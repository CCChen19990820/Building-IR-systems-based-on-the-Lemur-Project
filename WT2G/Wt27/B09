organic, shall register with the agricultural commissioner in the county
of principal operation prior to the first sale of the food, and shall
thereafter annually renew the registration unless no longer engaged in
the activities requiring the registration.  Each registrant shall
provide a complete copy of its registration to the agricultural
commissioner in any county in which the registrant operates.    (b)
Registration pursuant to this section shall be on a form provided by the
department and shall be valid for a period of one calendar year from the

available for this purpose.    (c) The information provided on the
registration form shall include all of the following:    (1) The nature
of the registrant's business, including the specific commodities
produced, handled, or processed that are sold as organic.    (2) For
producers, a map showing the precise location and dimensions of the

<P>Sal,</P>
<P>Our homepage will be down in a few month, but the ecoweb.dk server will
carry the Book of Abstract for a few years. Soon we will put on information on
how to buy the proceedings (that's all the real good stuff!). It will also have
a small Ifoam page pretty soon - waiting for Greg Forrest to put up a real Ifoam
homepage.</P>
<P>I include the speeches I have here, fell free to use them as You want.
Regards,</P>

<H2>Unedited Transcript of Speech given by IFOAM President Herv? la Prairie at
the Opening Session of the 11th IFOAM Scientific Conference</H2>
<P>Mesdames et Messieurs, friends</P>
<P>First I would like with you to realize the path we have done until today. In
a recent past it was impossible to hear speeches like those of the Environment
Minister yesterday and the Agriculture Minister today.</P>
<P>What pleasure, what privilege to be here in Copenhagen and see our &quot;dreams&quot;
becoming the cup of tea of numerous politicians.</P>
<P><B>The creation</B></P>
<P>Since 1972 every two years IFOAM organize an International Scientific
Conference in different continents 1990 Burkina Faso, 1992 Brazil, 1994 New
Zealand, 1996 Denmark next in 1998 in Argentina.</P>
<P>The main objective is to situate progress in research, development,
education, market and sustainability of our system in regard to add that behind
speeches behind papers and debate there is people and our conference provide the
tremendous opportunity to meet people from all over the world.</P>
<P>Second objective is the preparation of the Food Summit of November in Rome
organized by FAO . At the end of this conference we plan to address the
Copenhagen declaration on this topic of food security based on the work of IFOAM
96.</P>
<P>On behalf of IFOAM - I would like to warmly thank Troels V. V. ?stergaard
and the all team of IFOAM 96 for their hard work and dedication for this event.</P>
<P>To all of you I wish - good work, good contacts and please don't forget to
enjoy yourself at evening time in this marvellous harbor.</P>
<P>-----</P>
<H2>Speech given by Dr.Vandana Shiva at the Opening of the First Organic World
Exhibition, 10. August, 1996</H2>
<P>(transcriped from audiotape recording)</P>
<P></P>
<P>Thank you to Mr. Auken for that opening speech and to all the people who has
built the organic farming movement invisibly over 20 years, so that it can
visually get together in this shape - today.</P>
<P>I personally see this movement as the biggest peace movement of our times,
the biggest justice movement of our times, and the biggest ecology movement of
our times. I see it as a peace movement not merely because it reestablishes a
peaceful relationship between humans and the earth that feeds us, but even more
it gives us the possibility to build societies that are peaceful.  That have a
place for everyone, because societies with redundant ...(poor sound quality)
lead to violence, civil breakdown,absolute unlivable conditions for all. The
issue that keeps coming up repeatedly and I guess that we will hear it more than
ever before this year, with the food summit of november, is the question who
will feed the world and how the world will be fed. </P>
<P>The assumption somehow has been for the last 40 years, that one can destroy
agriculture every way, intensify it in a few places in a few hands, and that is
the most efficient way to feed the world.</P>
<P>We  know from all experience, that that net is breaking down. Just 1996 has
given us two major catastrophes with that kind of intensive systems,
concentrated in a few places or countries. We have had a new collapse of wheat
crop of  the United States. And the FAO was working on predictions, that by the
year 2020, 99% of the grain need of the world, including Europe, would be met by
US grain. This year there has been a 50% decline in wheat, because of drought,
triggered by climate change, and a fungal disease which was introduced into
India by the Americans in 1965 with the Green Revolution has gone back to kill
the wheat crop of the US - as if what we were having is a microorganism level
backlash.</P>
<P>There is a very, very dominant myth, that small farmers are inefficient,
small holdings are inefficient,  organic methods are inefficient. That we will 
have to have less, that we will have to have a decline, if people are to be fed.
 I don't think that's true. First of  all, that's not true,  by and large
because productivity  in agriculture has not been measured with respect to
natural resources in the environment. It has always been measured with respect
to labor inputs,  it?s productivity by capita not productivity per acre.  And
because of the fact, that it is not people that are scarce.  We have hands,
minds and hearts in abundance, to produce organic food. That is not the input
that we must be reducing. In fact that input has been in abundance in the Third
World, but now with jobless growth as a phenomenon even in the industrialized
countries,  It is only in organic systems that we can find relevance for the
future generations. Because every other system is pushing them out, rendering
people absolutely dispensible to the economic production system. And we need
places where people  can find  a new, relevant, significant meaning for life.</P>
<P>The studies are now, that when people from jail were put to organic
gardening the crime levels came down. In down town areas in the US, whereever
gardening and organic experiments started, the teenagers were not involved in
violence anymore.  That is the place we have to go, not just because agriculture
is about producing food, it is also about giving people a meaning in life.</P>
<P>And  I think the biggest crisis right now at the ending of this millenium
and at the beginning of the next is the hopelessness, the sense of being wasted,
 that is just running like epidemic through all societies of the world, that is
creating the  Yugoslavia's, the Rwanda's, the Sri Lankas, the Kashmire's, the
Punjab's and the Assam's of the world today. We cannot afford the whole world 
to become  &quot;balkanised&quot; and &quot;libanised&quot; in that way, and
organic agriculture moves to mainstream economy, becomes the only imaginable
solution to the entire world being reduced to a Rwanda-like situation. In any
case I do not from my experience of 15 years, of having applied my physics
training to farming systems and eco systems, I have not found to date,  organic
systems that are of lower productivity than industrial, chemical and intensive
systems, </P>
<P>  The way the productivity  is constructed , is by looking at one element of
the system, reducing hundreds of crop varieties to a single crop, reducing one
crop to one function,  reducing cattle, which was supposed to produce organic
manure, which was supposed to provide animal energy, and in our country they
still do,  which were supposed to produce dairy products, and in societies where
meat is eaten to provide meat. They have been reduced to just single function
machines. They are just milk producing units or theyare just meat producing
units. They are not linked to the land and as a result of that sort of
intensification you have the inevitability,  the mad cow disease. What could be
more efficient than taking dead infected cows and feeding them to cattle. it's a
very efficient system. Worked out in the prevention of one dimentional 
efficiency that sees no ecological value, human value, ethical value, cultural
value  in anything   that  has to do with production.</P>
<P>We are also realizing very quickly that,  in any casethree  to five units of
 internal input can produce the same amount of food as 300 units of external 
inputs  provide, and as a very simple second class of arithmetic lesson to mean
5 units producing 100 is far more than efficient and productive than 300 units
producing 100.</P>
<P>You might when you walk around see a program on regenerating biodiversity,
but for us it is nut just conserving species as museum pieces. For us
biodiversity is the very base for regenerating  the first link of the food
chain, which is seed,  but even more important,  shifting to a different notion
of productivity,  a  diversity based productivity, not a monoculture based
productivity.  And it turns out that that is  the crisis not just for us. There
was a Leipzig conference on plant genetic resources two months ago, in june, and
all ecological farmers of Europe was saying that the monopoly on seed,
intellectual property rights on seed, is becoming the biggest block to shifting
to ecological  agriculture, because farmersdon't have access to the material,
that would allow them to become ecological, the seed material.</P>
<P>So, farmers rights become absolutely essential foundations  for organic
agriculture, and that means: any monopoly system that undermines those rights
becomes a declared war against the shift to organic agriculture. </P>
<P>The minister talked about  eco-labelling and we have seen, again,  in the
last year the issue of the mad cow disease,  the issue of the
herbicide-resistant rape-seed that Monsanto wanted to push without labelling in
Denmark and which, I feel very happy that Denmark has resisted so far.</P>
<P>These are issues in which very fondamental right to information is being
denied to consumers. What method has been used, what has gone into the food, how
the seed has been processed, what technology was used. And I think  the deadlock
that is being created in the world-trade organization around that there is an
agreement that the north and the south could reach, which says,let us begin with
food, on product and process methods,  I am sure that the south will be more
than willing to come to that. because it is the dumping by non ecological
production methods that is wiping out agricultures .  And they will be only too
happy to have  costs of production internalised into systems. And if by the time
of  the ministerial ......in december  a few countries of the north like
Denmark, Sweden and Norway could come to agreement that we will push for process
and production methods being internalized,  but we will do it for agriculture,
we will do it for genetic engineering, we will do it for food labelling,  I
think we could actually have major brake through so that  instead of  trade
issue, pushing and subsidising  anti organic agriculture it starts to support
organic agriculture. I will give you a very simple example,  five years ago,  I
have done a conference about the stage of  the world in terms of the food
system. And we have done a paper on the fact that Pepsico, you know the big
company Pepsico,  is going to machoes in Punjab to make ketcup to send to all
its pizza huts, it was paying the farmers half a rupi  for a kilo, twenty rupis
make a dollar and you can work out which  fraction of a dollar that is. Just
yesterday the newspapers announced that the exporters of vegetables from India
would be getting subsidies to rupis ten a kilo, that is twenty times more than
the farmer gets after laboring the entire year. And from what I see, a lot of
that money is coming from aid. Which is saying not aid, lets promote trade,  but
trade is then promoting subsidies,  for the wrong kind of agriculture, and I
really think that we need a serious ecological audit on that.</P>
<P>So what we have to subject all agriculture to is the two tests of ecology
and human rights. Ecology basically to insure that ecological processes have
been the basis of food production, and  human rights spanning from the
fundamental right to food of  all,  from  the rights of farmers to be engaged in
farming, the right of farmers to have seed, the right of consumers to have
knowledge about what they are eating, that whole bundle of human rights that is
concerning food and agriculture.  And agriculture that fails those tests
deserves to disappear.</P>
<P></P>
<P>I feel very happy to be with you, the movements that are showing the  way in
which we could be going from here into the next millenium. Thank You</P>

<P>The 11th IFOAM Scientific Conference</P>
<P>Welcome address, August 11, 1996</P>
<P>Henrik Kloppenborg</P>
<P>Chairman, The Danish Association of Organic Agriculture</P>
<P>On behalf of the Danish Association of Organic Agriculture, I am deeply
honored this evening to welcome all of you to IFOAMs 11rd Scientific Conference.
For travellers from other countries, a hearty welcome to Denmark.</P>
<P>The associations members are people like yourselves - organic farmers,
consumers, researchers and educators - who work together on all fronts to
promote organic farming. We are very proud to host both the conference and the
World Organic Exhibition.  As a small association with fifteen hundred members,
we have to admit that we couldn't have pulled off this ambitious project alone.
In addition to the hardworking organizers and volunteers who have pulled the
conference and exhibition together, I am glad to have the opportunity to thank
Minister of the Environment Svend Auken and the Green Fond for support to the
World Organic Exhibition.</P>
<P>I especially want to thank our  progressive Minister of  Agriculture Henrik
Dam Kris-tensen for thee Financial and political support which the Ministry of
Agriculture has given to the conference, to the World Exhibition and to the
development and organic farming in Denmark. </P>
<P>We thank you.</P>
<P>The fact is that this conference is pretty typical and the kind of
collaboration that has given Danish organic farming such a boost in recent
years. We have a handful of organic farmers, researchers and small associations
working overtime to get things off the ground. We have support from consumers.
We have support from the major farm organizations and labor, through the
ministers Council on Organic Agriculture and we have the national government
stepping in with resources.</P>
<P>The Danish government now supports the development of organic farming at
virtually every critical link. The work is long from finished but we now have</P>
<UL>
<LI> an ambitious research program,
</LI>
<LI> support for product development,
</LI>
<LI>an ongoing information campaign aimed at consumers and the food industry</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>a system of technical assistance to organic farmers,
</LI>
<LI>a subsidy program for conversion and, not least,
</LI>
<LI>a credible state organic control.
</LI></UL>
<P>A major challenge for the conference participants here from Europe will be
the building of similar support from the European community. We must have a
European agricultural policy--with conversion subsidies, green taxes, research
and control --which promotes conversion to organic farming.</P>
<P>Today, we have European agricultural subsidy program which penalize farmers
who have a good crop rotation and thereby hinder conventional production and
environmental clean up. This would give organic farmers all over the would a
more free market</P>
<P>We must do more than work on common standards for organic production. We
must go after European agricultural policy head on. We want to be more than a
niche production.It says something about the times that, in order to be allowed
to farm as I want to, I must have allies in many countries. I must understand
and engage myself in the development of agricultural policy on a European and
global level.</P>
<P>Just consider the production standards for organic farming. Fifteen years
ago, we started a little association which hammered out a set of rules. then the
Danish state development rules and later the European Community. Now we try to
influence the new global rules, Codex Alimentarius. Our next task will probably
be negotiations with the martians on galactic organic rules for cattle farming.:
&gt;</P>
<P>Common standards and agricultural policy are very important, and IFOAMs role
is critical as rules and policies are set further and further afield. But we
must remember that it is the local work which ignites many farmers interest in
organic farming. The power of example is tremendous. But conversion also
requires that we reach out to farmers, one-by-one.</P>
<P>We are here to talk about rules and research and marketing. But organic
agriculture is also about what is in the hearts of every person who works the
land. I want common rules with organic farmers in Argentina and Tanzania, but
more important is what I already share with organic farmers throughout the
world: the knowledge that I have borrowed the land from my children.</P>
<P>In agricultural debate, it is often said that organic farming cannot feed
the world. We disagree. Organic farming cannot eliminate hunger overnight. But
by emphasizing development of human resources, sustainable agricultural
practices, and use of local resources, organic farming provides a better basis
for development. This is certainly the case in countries where hunger is caused
by social, political and environmental conditions. But organic farming is also -
for the same reasons - promising for our depopulated rural areas in Scandinavia.</P>
<P>Organic agriculture is our answer to the question &quot;How should food be
produced ?&quot; but it is also our answer to the question &quot;Who decides how
food will be produced ?&quot;. It is farmers and consumers who must decide.
Organic farming frees us today from a number of powerful agribusiness interests
-such as those which produce fertilizers and pesticides and which now would like
to sell us genetically modified plants, animals, enzymes and Heaven knows what
else.</P>
<P>There is wisdom in the saying &quot;Think globally and act locally&quot;.
But to promote organic farming, we are increasingly forced to act globally - on
standards and policy - and think hard locally - about how to get nutrient cycles
between towns and farms to function in a balanced and healthy way.</P>
<P>I have confidence that all of the dedicated people here will be working at
one or more of these levels for many years to come. Our Associations goal here
in Denmark is total conversion of Danish agriculture - that will certainly take
several decades to accomplish. We are very happy and proud today to have the
opportunity to learn from your experiences and knowledge.</P>
<P>With these words I will conclude my address.</P>
<P>Once again, a hearty welcome. And thank you for coming !</P>
<P>-----</P>
<H2>Talepunkt</H2>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen</P>
<P>As Danish Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries I am very proud to open
IFOAM 96-conference and to welcome you all to Copenhagen, and especiallyto this
particular place - Holmen.</P>
<P>For more than 300 years the headquarters of the Danish navy were located at
Holmen. a few years ago however, military use of the area was given up.to day
Holmen is occupied by a number of different institutions.</P>
<P>As an international organisation for organic farming IFOAM plays a very
important role. perhaps IFOAM's most important achievement so far is the
agreement on basic standards for organic agriculture. These standards constitute
the binding guide-lines for all regulations concerning organic farming.</P>
<P>The European Union (EU) has implemented a regulation concerning organic crop
production. I do hope that in the near future a similar regulation concerning
animal production will be adopted.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the European Union has implemented an agricultural
environmental program. This program opens the possibility for member states to
support organic farming with co-financing from the European Union. Denmark has
adopted such a measure. We are all aware of the problems associated with modern,
intensive agriculture.</P>
<P>It is a priority for the Danish government to limit these problems, and to
promote solutions which are ecologically sustainable. In this context, it is
important to underline that agricultural production has to be economically as
well as environmentally sustainable. The agricultural policy of the European
Union and of the International agreement on world trade with agricultural
products is market oriented. Agricultural policies must however take more and
more account of nature and of animal ethics.</P>
<P>Denmark is a country with a highly developed agricultural sector. It
produces three times as much food as we consume ourselves. The agricultural
sector does, therefore, play an essential role for the Danish economy, although
only 5% of the labor force work in the primary agricultural sector.</P>
<P>The structure of the Danish agricultural sector has changed over the
years.The number of holdings has declined radically, and production has
increased.</P>
<P>The result is a highly intensive production. Without rules and regulations
on production-conditions, the surrounding seas, lakes and streams would be at
risk. The dominant risk-factors are leaching of nitrate and too intensive use of
pesticides.</P>
<P>In the organic agriculture there is no use of pesticides. this means that
holdings following the organic rules are less harmful to the environment.</P>
<P>I am proud to be able to say that Denmark was the first country in the world
to introduce a national legislation on organic agriculture. The legislation on
organic agriculture. The legislation introduced financial support to organic
farmers, production rules and rules on organic products. These rules were, of
course, based on IFOAM guidelines.</P>
<P>I would however very much like to stress, that the success of organic
farming in Denmark - and I believe it also goes for other countries - is not the
result of initiatives from public authorities or the established farming
organizations. The status of organic farming to day is the result of effort of
many individual pioneers, who believe in ideas and concept of organic farming
and have the courage to fight for it. I think it is proper to day to give
special thanks to these persons.</P>
<P>Denmark has obtained good results in the production and distribution of
organic food. proof of this is distribution being undertaken through national
supermarket chains. The consumers' confidence in organic food is based on a well
functioning system of state includes a control-label for organic products.</P>
<P>Especially since the autumn 1994 Danish consumers have shown an increasing
interest for organic products.</P>
<P>I believe that the reason for this is a growing interest in quality. That is
quality as a broader concept, where consumer demand is reflecting an increased
interest for environmental considerations, animal ethics, high nutritional
quality and greater health and nutritional value.</P>
<P></P>
<P>I believe that the agricultural sector should fully accept the new concept
of &quot;political consumers&quot;.people do care what kind of products they
consume and under which conditions production has taken place and they are
prepared - more and more so - to act accordingly.</P>
<P>I hope that you may all have a pleasant and useful organic summit in</P>
<P>Copenhagen and that the conference will constitute an important platform for</P>
<P>an increased interest and demand worldwide for organic production.</P>
<P>Thank you.</P>

<P>New International Ecology Award to be Presented</P>
<P>for First Time in Copenhagen</P>
<P>The SARD - Sustainable Agriculture Rural Development - Mallinckrodt Award
will be presented for the first time ever, when ecologists hold their world
conference at Holmen, Copenhagen in August. The $10,000 prize has been
instituted by Friedrich Mumm von Mallinckrodt, a former Senior Adviser of UNDP
(United Nations Development Program), Germany. The award will be presented to
groups in the Third World promoting organic agriculture. When presenting the
award emphasis will be placed on the employment of organic methods in food
production that benefit the environment, improve the economic situation of the
poor, promote development through equal opportunities for both sexes and that
projects have had an influence on agricultural policy and agricultural training.
The SARD-Malinckrodt Award will encourage many groups working under extremely
harsh economic conditions throughout the Third World.</P>

<P>Press Release</P>
<P>Copenhagen Declaration:</P>
<P>Global Food Security</P>
<P>requires Organic Agriculture</P>
<P>The resolution adopted today by the closing session of the world conference
on organic agriculture in Copenhagen urges the FAO to recognize the part organic
production can play in achieving food security for all.</P>
<P>&quot;There are more than 800 million people in the world today who do not
have adequate food to eat. Ironically, a vast majority of them are located in
developing countries which are predominantly agricultural&quot;, said Dr Tito E.
Contado, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), addressing more
than 1,000 delegates at the closing session of the International Conference on
Organic Agriculture (11th IFOAM Scientific Conference) in Copenhagen today. This
is the key issue facing the World Food Summit scheduled for Rome in November.</P>
<P>However, although welcoming the initiative of the FAO in bringing together
the governments of the world at the World Food Summit, the international organic
conference concluded that preparatory documents emphasize the wrong issues in
analyzing the source of the crisis in world food production and availability,
and therefore that its commitments are not likely to produce effective results.
&quot;In particular, protection of the environment, quality and safety of food,
and local self-reliance are not recognized as essential elements of food
security. In addition, key issues of access to resources, equitable land tenure,
the rights of women and education have not taken the place they deserve - as a
consequence people continue to suffer&quot;, states the Copenhagen Declaration,
the final document adopted by the 11th Scientific IFOAM Conference today. IFOAM
(International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is the only
organisation which represents the entire organic food chain from farm to table,
with more than 500 member organizations from almost 100 countries.</P>
<P>Based on evidence from the many presentations made to the conference the
declaration also states, &quot;The practical development of organic agriculture
throughout the world is living proof that it is a realistic and achievable
approach. Organic agriculture can ensure the long-term security of human and
material resources, producing sufficient food of high quality while protecting
the environment and conserving biodiversity.&quot;</P>
<P>The Copenhagen Declaration advocates the FAO to place organic agriculture on
the agenda of the World Food Summit : &quot;Organic agriculture provides the
means to achieve food security for all. Local, regional and national
self-sufficiency in food is our shared goal - we urge the FAO to recognize the
part organic production can play in achieving this goal.&quot;</P>
<P>The conference in Copenhagen was the 11th IFOAM Scientific Conference. The
first was held in 1977 and the next will be held in Argentina in 1998.
Conference delegates in Copenhagen voiced their pleasure at the amount of
support given to the organic idea at all levels of Danish society including
producers, retailers, consumers and official Danish policy. The conference and
the organic world exhibition which coincided with it enjoyed the financial
backing of the Danish ministries of agriculture and environment respectively,
underlining Denmarks pioneering role in organic agriculture.</P>

<P>The SARD-Mallinckrodt Award</P>
<P>An annual $10,000 award guaranteed for ten years for land stewardship
donated by Dr Friedrich Mumm von Mallinckrodt was presented for the first time
today at the closing session of the International Conference on Organic
Agriculture in Copenhagen.</P>
<P>A ten man jury of well known ecological experts selected three organizations
located in Africa, Asia and Latin America as joint winners of the 1996 SARD
Award, selected from numerous nominations: Agricultural Renewal in India for a
Sustainable Environment (ARISE), India; Kenya Institute of Organic farming
(KIOF); and the Cuban Organic Farming Association (ACAO).</P>
<P>Eligibility for nomination was open to individuals or communities/groups
from the developing countries who apply an agro-ecological approach to
agriculture and food production that makes a difference to the environment and
the economy of poor people, fosters gender--sensitive and equitable development
and has had a documented impact at policy level and on agricultural education
and training schemes.</P>
<P>Commenting on the winners the instituter of the award, Dr Friedrich Mumm von
Mallinckrodt, said &quot;ARISE is a grouping of long established initiatives in
India focusing on strategic components of sustainability. ARISE brings all its
activities together in a national movement with a holistic approach to problem
solving. KIOF was established in Nairobi in 1986. The institute encourages
sustainable methods for agriculture with operations in many parts of the
country. The institute has not only caught the attention of the farming
community but also the farm service organizations in the country both private
and governmental. ACAO has advanced goals for sustainable agriculture and is
working in a very difficult economic situation. Ironically, shortages have
forced the Cuban people to find self-sufficient methods to maintain soil
fertility and to protect plants with biological methods against pests. ACAO
serves as an agro--ecological lighthouse for new organic movements.&quot;</P>
<P>Jury members included the well-known Indian physicist, philosopher, and
feminist, Dr Vandana Shiva;  Mr Bernward Geier, General Secretary, IFOAM, Dr
Miguel Altieri and Dr Friedrich Mumm von Mallinckrodt, instituter of the Award.</P>
<P>Dr Mumm von Mallinckrodt decided to donate the cash award because after 25
years work in international organizations applying mostly conventional
approaches or half-hearted attempts to finding sustainable methods, he found a
new message in the NGO movement when preparing for the Earth Summit. &quot;I am
today convinced that organic farming, which is sustainable agriculture in its
purest form, is the answer to the fundamental constraints placed on hundreds of
millions of the poorest farmers ? women and men. I want this prize to be a
recognition and encouragement to the worldwide movement of sensible uses of
natural resources.&quot;</P>

<P>Organic World Exhibition Prize 1996</P>
<P>New international ecology prize instituted at the First Organic World
Exhibition which ended in Copenhagen yesterday. The four day event was an
outstanding success attracting over 6000 visitors a day.</P>
<P>Over the past few days people have crowded to the First Organic World
Exhibition in Copenhagen to see, taste and buy organic products from around the
world. Organizers and visitors alike felt that the Exhibition, the first of its
kind, was an outstanding success.</P>
<P>The Danish Minister for Business and Industry, Ms Mimi Jacobsen, closed the
Exhibition yesterday by presenting the first Organic World Exhibition Prize for
the world's best organic food within eight categories. The prize was instituted
to heighten awareness of organic produce and quality. The trophies presented to
winning entries represent pyramids fashioned from old Danish Elm. When
presenting the prizes the Minister said: &quot;Today traditional farmers are
acknowledging the success of organic agriculture and are realizing that what
they used to consider an unrealistic dreamer is actually a pioneer. And
furthermore a pioneer with a very good sense of business. Organic farmers have
been able to read the signals given by the consumer: a consumer who demands
quality. But in spite of the success of the organic revolution we cannot expect
it to develop by itself. Some input is necessary. In this process the First
Organic World Exhibition is one element and a wonderful initiative. I believe
that this Exhibition will strengthen the development of organic production and
make consumers even more aware of the excellence of these products.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>Of about 300 exhibitors some 100 entered their produce for the competition
which was judged on three components: Gastronomic quality; Processing and
ecological considerations and Design.First prizes were awarded for products
which excelled in all three areas. The winners were: ?llingegaard Mejeri,
Denmark, for its sourmilk; M?lle Skovly, Denmark, for its marcipan; Torfolk
G?rd, Sweden, for its rhubarb juice; Two French wines won joint first prize in
the alcoholic beverages category: Domaine des Cedres, Cotes du Rhone and Domain
Pierre Andr?, Chateauneuf du Pape. Kruidenhandel Piramide,</P>
<P>Netherlands, for its Herbal Tea: &quot;Evening Dream Tea&quot;; Provence
Regime, France, for its Sauce Vinaigrette &quot;Tradition&quot; and finally
URTEKRAM, Denmark, for its Krunchy Peanut butter.</P>
<P>One of the judges, Ms Henrietta Green, a well-known British journalist and
author of the &quot;BBC Food Lovers Guide&quot; stated, &quot;If processed
organic food is to make a breakthrough generally it has to preserve integrity of
taste and be capable of competing at any level, not just the organic. Produce
entered in the dairy and wine categories at the Organic Exhibition could compete
with conventional products at every level&quot;, she said. Another jury member,
Professor Michael S?gaard J?rgensen, commented that &quot;Most produce were very
clean in that they were processed almost entirely without additives, and many
conventional companies producing organic food took other aspects like the
environment, using renewal energy, recycling, promoting local employment and so
on into consideration. On the design side, however, the judges voiced
disappointment that &quot;no fresh packaging look or breakthrough was attempted.
Packaging tended to be romantic, purposely old-fashioned or neutral in  style&quot;,
they said. Apart from Ms Green and Mr J?rgensen the judging panel were: Rene
Knudsen, Master Chef; Helle Br?nnum Carlsen, food correspondent ;Ursula Munch
Petersen, designer and ceramist.</P>
<P>Simultaneously, the 11th International Conference on Organic Agriculture is
being held in Copenhagen, closing Thursday with the presentation of the
Copenhagen Declaration to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),
represented at the conference by Dr. Tito Contado, with the purpose of making
the FAO place organic agriculture on the agenda of the World Summit in November.</P>
<P>The Copenhagen Declaration to be presented to FAO at the Organic World
Conference Thursday 15 August 14:00 - 16:00 hrs.Homepage updated daily with news
and photos. Book of Abstracts  on homepage: h-ttp://login.dknet.dk/~ifoam96/.

<B>PRESS RELEASE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H1>FAO to attend the International IFOAM Conference on Organic Agriculture in
Copenhagen
</H1>
<P>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, is sending an
official representati ve to the international ecological conference to be held
at Holmen, Copenhagen 11-15 August. The FAO delegate is Dr. Tito E. Contado,
Chief of Extension, Education and Communication Service for the FAO's
Sustainable Development Department. Ecology is not a concept the FAO has taken
seriously to date. The organisation initially declined an invitation to attend
the international conference but on the initiative of the Danish Minister of
Agriculture, Mr Henrik Dam Kristensen, the FAO decided to participate. The
Danish Ministry for Agriculture is supporting the conference with an allocation
of DKK 4.6 million and the Minister of Agriculture will open the conference on
organic agriculture on Sunday 11 August. 
</P>
<P>The organisers of the International Conference on Organic Agriculture, IFOAM
- International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements - view the FAO's
response as the first, small step towards placing ecology and the organic
concept on the agenda of the FAO World Food Summit in November. &quot;Ecology
has never before been on the FAO agenda. It would be a serious mistake, however,
for the FAO to overlook the possibilities inherent in organic farming methods&quot;,
says Troels V. &Oslash;stergaard, chairman of the international organic
conference. Among the 400 scientific studies to be presented at the Copenhagen
conference, many deal with organic farming as applied in poor tropical
countries. The results indicate that chemical farming as devised by the
so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; is destroying the soil and poisoning the
natural environment and that poor farmers cannot afford to buy fertilizers,
pesticides and seed. And more important organic farming yields in the tropics
are often as high if not higher than its chemical counterpart. &quot;In other
words organic farming is the realistic alternative to chemicals&quot;, says
Troels V. &Oslash;stergaard. &quot;The current strategy on the FAO agenda is
termed the &quot;new&quot; green revolution. 
</P>
<P>The idea is to genetically engineer plants and animals to increase yields on
the Earth's declining resource of arable land. From the point of view of ecology
there is a strong element of risk in releasing genetically engineered organisms
into the natural environment. Organic methods - fertilizing with compost,
cultivating in mixed cultures and so on -  have on the other hand been known and
used successfully for thousands of years and pose no form of risk.&quot; &quot;From
the environmental perspective no great advantages can be gained from the FAO's
new green revolution. The FAO strategy still remains the chemical alternative
using artificial fertilizers and pesticides, although efforts will be made to
limit the use of the latter with the help of genetic engineering. Conversion to
organic agricultural methods, however, will benefit the environment and the
health of humans and animals in an entirely different way,&quot; says Troels V. &Oslash;stergaard.

</P>
<P>Documentation to support the claims of organic agriculture's excellence will
be presented at the International IFOAM Conference on Organic Agriculture and
compiled in the final document. This will be handed over to the FAO along with a
request to actively and positively work for the expansion of organic agriculture
worldwide in an effort to solve the problems of hunger, in the first instance by
placing ecology and organic agriculture on the agenda of the World Food Summit
in November. The 11th International Conference on Organic Agriculture will be
held at Holmen, Copenhagen 11-15 August 1996, with more than 1000 participants
from all over the world and with the official backing of the Danish Ministry for
Agriculture and the EU. The conference will reflect the changes being
experienced by organic agriculture at present and will highlight the organic
alternative as a possible solution to the world's menacing hunger problems. 
</P>
<P>Simultaneously, the First Organic World Exhibition will be held at Holmen,
Copenhagen 10-13 August. With about 300 exhibits from all five continents and a
broad spectrum of the best organic products, the world exhibition will
illustrate how far organic agriculture has progressed in practice.

<B>PRESS RELEASE</B><BR> President of IFOAM at press conference in Copenhagen,
2 May 1996.

<P><B>Global focus on ecology</B><BR> 
</P>
<H1>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ORGANIC AGRICULTURE PRECEDES THE FAO WORLD FOOD
SUMMIT
</H1>
<P><B>A proposal to the FAO World Food Summit</B>
</P>
<H2>FAO called on to give serious consideration to the organic alternative</H2>
<P>&quot;The FAO must give serious consideration to the organic alternative by
placing organic agriculture on the agenda of the World Food Summit, in Rome in
November&quot;, says Herv&eacute; la Prairie, President of the International
Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). &quot;Organic agriculture
has matured sufficiently to be taken seriously by world leaders as an
agricultural type capable of solving agriculture's environmental problems
without risk of compromising food supply.&quot; Herv&eacute; la Prairie was
speaking at a press conference (2 May) to present the International Conference
on Organic Agriculture (11th IFOAM Scientific Conference) and the First Organic
World Exhibition scheduled for Copenhagen 11-15 and 10-13 August respectively. &quot;The
FAO's World Food Summit could benefit greatly from the evidence and research to
be presented at the organic conference&quot;, says Herv&eacute; la Prairie. The
Copenhagen conference will bring together 1000 scientists and practitioners from
around the world to debate global developments in ecology and organic
production. It will address a number of new, main themes relating to overall
social, environmental and economic consequences of restructuring agriculture
along organic lines, in a period of increased global focus on ecology. The
Director General of the FAO, Jacques Diouf, has been invited to deliver the
closing address to the conference. 
</P>
<P>Herv&eacute; la Prairie accused the FAO of &quot;optimism&quot; when it
states that the number of undernourished people in the world will decline from
the present 800 million to 650 million over the next 15 years. &quot;This view
is based on the assumption that production per capita will continue its steady
rise in the future&quot;, said la Prairie. The World Watch Institute and the
Consultancy Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) share a more
pessimistic outlook forecasting a deficiency in cereals by 2025 of 700 million
tonnes.
</P>
<P>&quot;Agricultural land area on the planet is declining due to soil erosion,
loss of soil humus, salination, waterlogging in irrigated areas and the
depletion of groundwater resources&quot;, he said, &quot;and even if the new
Green Revolution and the genetic engineering concept it is based on succeeds in
fabricating varieties that are even higher yielding than the old &quot;high
yielding varieties&quot; they will share the old need for input of water,
fertilizers and pesticides.&quot; 
</P>
<H2>Environmental accountability and sustainability</H2>
<P>The methods used in organic farming are in accordance with biological
principles, i.e. diversity, and have been employed by farmers for centuries. The
methods used in conventional farming on the other hand are contrary to
fundamental biological principles and as such can never be sustainable. The use
of pesticides is threatening biological diversity by poisoning insects, birds
and other organisms while at the same time posing a health threat to humans.
Soil erosion is also a serious environmental problem in many areas. &quot;These
problems are nonexistent in organic farming&quot;, says la Prairie. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The only pesticides used are natural products and by using compost and
the system of &quot;mulching&quot; instead of artificial fertilizer, top soil is
maintained and the humus content in the soil improved. This is one of the
reasons why organic agriculture is sustainable in the very literal sense of the
word&quot;, says Herv&eacute; la Prairie.
</P>
<P>The term 'sustainable' was first used at IFOAM's first international
conference in 1977, held under the slogan &quot;Towards Sustainable Agriculture&quot;.
The upcoming International Conference on Organic Agriculture (11th IFOAM
Scientific Conference) in Copenhagen 11-15 August will reflect the changes
currently being experienced in organic agriculture where the experimental period
is giving way to an era of political and economic realism, highlighting organic
production as a viable solution to world hunger.
</P>
<H2>Organic agriculture as an alternative</H2>
<P>&quot;Conventional agriculture is a proven polluter. Environmental problems
seen in industrial countries will force the change to organic methods within a
short span of time. To mention just one example. The costs of purifying drinking
water are far higher than the economic gains of using conventional farming
methods&quot;, says Herv&eacute; la Prairie. 
</P>
<P>The general view in industrial countries where conventional, intensive
farming is prevalent is that large-scale conversion to organic farming would
aggravate world hunger. Organic methods are less intensive and therefore yields
in industrial countries are somewhat lower than those of conventional
agriculture. &quot;But it would be erroneous to globalise this view,&quot; says
Herv&eacute; la Prairie. &quot;In the developing countries land is farmed at a
very low level of intensity and even if available, small farmers cannot afford
the fertilizers and pesticides necessary for conventional agriculture.
Conversion to organic methods, using recycled household waste as compost and
employing other little &quot;tricks&quot; of organic agriculture, would increase
yields dramatically. In many parts of the world organic methods are simply the
only way of eradicating hunger and ensuring food for all.&quot;

<TITLE>Is organic agriculture a possible solution to world hunger
</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><I>May 1996</I><BR>
<B>Press information</B>
</P>
<P>Address by Herv&eacute; la Prairie<BR> President of IFOAM at press
conference in Copenhagen, 2 May 1996.<BR>
</P>
<H1>Is organic agriculture a possible solution to world hunger
</H1>
<H2>A proposal to the FAO World Food Summit
</H2>
<P>The FAO is of the optimistic opinion that the number of undernourished
people in the world will decline from the present 800 million to 650 million
over the next 15 years. This view is based on the assumption that production per
capita will continue its steady rise in the future. The World Watch Institute
takes a much more pessimistic view, claiming that cereal production will decline
from its all time high of 346kg per capita in 1984, to 248kg by the year 2030.
The Consultancy Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) shares this
view and forecasts a deficiency in cereals by 2025 of 700 million tonnes. This
figure should be compared with present world cereal production of 2100 million
tonnes.
</P>
<P>The FAO's optimistic view is based on the belief that the so-called new
green revolution will manage to keep per hectare yield rising steadily. The
World Watch Institute on the other hand points to a number of disturbing factors
which makes it difficult to share FAO's optimism: 
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Per hectare yield is declining. Between 1950 and 1984 mean cereal yield
increased about 4% per year. From 1984 to 1990 this figure declined to only 1%,
and from 1990 to 1993 yield per hectare worldwide declined steadily. 
</LI>
<LI>Even if the new green revolution and the genetic engineering it is based on
succeeds in fabricating varieties that are even higher yielding than the old
'high yield varieties', they will share the old HYV need for input - water,
fertilizers and pesticides. 
</LI>
<LI>Agricultural land area on the planet is shrinking. Agricultural
productivity is declining due to soil erosion, loss of soil humus, salination,
waterlogging in irrigated areas and depletion of groundwater resources.
</LI></UL>
<H3>The market solution
</H3>
<P>It is compelling to point to the fact that overall world food production is
sufficient to nourish all and that the problem is therefore one of distribution.
The free market is the most efficient means of distributing resources and the
conclusion reached is that total free trade in agricultural produce will solve
the problem of hunger.
</P>
<P>To me the issue of food security and eradicating hunger is a question of
providing everyone with sufficient food. The above line of argument is flawed in
one very important respect - it ignores the fact that the market reacts to
purchasing power. At the moment pigs and cattle have greater purchasing power
than the human poor. This means that cereal production goes to animal fodder and
not to the undernour-ished.
</P>
<P>There are no signs of a change on the way. Quite the opposite. With living
standards rising in China the Chinese demand for meat will increase. This in
turn will give rise to an increase in demand for cereals as animal fodder. This
trend is already visible. In 1978 only 7% of cereals consumed in China was used
as fodder. By 1990 the figure had risen to 20%. With a population of 1200
million small changes in Chinese habits will have major effects on the world
market: one beer more to every Chinese person a year demands 370,000 tonnes of
barley. And higher demand for grain will lead to higher prices. This may be fine
for cereal producing farmers but even if they succeed in increasing yields, this
will not produce more food for human consumption.
</P>
<P>To secure sufficient food for all it will be necessary to create the
opportunities for people in the developing world to produce their own food,
shielded from the free market and from the dumping of agricultural surpluses
from industrial countries. Local farmers must not be outcompeted by cheap
imports. Small farmers in the developing countries should be given the
possibility to farm. In other words,  farmland must be made available. This is
all too often not the case. To give one example. Shrimp production in many
coastal areas in tropical countries is occupying and devastating farmland on a
unbelievable scale.  The shrimps of course are not used to improve the diet of
the locals. They end up on the high priced markets of industrial countries.
</P>
<P>Given space to farm poor farmers need a cheap farming method. Such a method
is organic agriculture, relying solely on local resources. Organic farming is
the realistic option in that it provides high yields, is environmentally
accountable and is sustainable in the true sense of the word. 
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Organic agriculture - the realistic alternative
</H3>
<P>The general view in industrial countries where conventional, intensive
farming is prevalent is that large-scale conversion to organic methods would
aggravate world hunger. Organic agricultural methods are less intensive and in
industrial countries yields are somewhat lower than those of conventional
agriculture. But it would be erroneous to globalise this view. In the developing
countries, and especially among the most impoverished groups, land is farmed at
a very low level of intensity. Small farmers in the developing world do not have
the means to buy fertilizers, pesticides, HYVs or other substances used in
conventional agriculture. In this situation training farmers to make compost
from household waste for use as manure and other little tricks of organic
agriculture can increase yields dramatically. Double, treble and even higher
increases in yields have been experienced in experimental projects. There is no
need to transport artificial fertilizers over long distances and equally there
is no need for excessive irrigation.
</P>
<P>Organic agriculture is environmentally accountable The widespread use of
pesticides is a serious problem in all parts of the world. Pesticides are
threatening biological diversity directly by poisoning insects, birds and other
organisms and indirectly by eliminating the food sources of many organisms. The
use of pesticides is directly responsible for  illness and death in the
developing countries. Pesticide residues may also have harmful effects on human
health and reproduction wider afield. In addition the danger of major accidents
in pesticide production is always present, as the catastrophe in Bhopal is a
glaring reminder of.
</P>
<P>All these problems are nonexistent in organic agriculture. The only
pesticides used are natural products, as, for instance, extracts of the Neem
tree.
</P>
<P>Soil erosion is another serious environmental problem solved by organic
methods. The main cause of soil erosion is lack of humus in the soil and lack of
top soil. Soil covering - mulching - is an important aspect of organic
agriculture. With mulching and the use of compost as fertilizer the humus
content of the soil is enriched and soil erosion prevented.
</P>
<P>The environmental problems being experienced in industrial countries will
force the change to organic methods within a short span of time. To mention just
one example. The costs of purifying drinking water are far higher than the
economic gains of using conventional farming methods.
</P>
<H3>Organic agriculture is sustainable
</H3>
<P>The term &quot;sustainable&quot; has been used and misused extensively in
recent years. I would like to point out here that IFOAM used the term long
before it became fashionable. Our very first international conference in 1977
was held under the slogan: &quot;Towards Sustainable Agriculture&quot;. Organic
agriculture is sustainable in the very literal sense of the word. By using
organic farming methods agricultural production can continue indefinitely.
Organic agriculture does not place limits on human life. It must be pointed out,
however, that the use of fossil fuels in the industrialised version of organic
agriculture is not sustainable and the machinery used on a modern farm in
industrial countries is not integral to organic agriculture.
</P>
<P>The reasons why organic agriculture is sustainable are quite simple: the
methods used 
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>are all in accordance with biological principles, i.e. diversity, and
</LI>
<LI>have been used by farmers for centuries.
</LI></UL>
<P>Conventional farming can never be sustainable because the methods used are
contrary to fundamental biological principles. I do not have time to go into
detail here but I will give one example to illustrate the different thinking of
organic and conventional farming. When a conventional farmer sees an aphid or
other pest he will reach for his spray to kill the pest. This poses a challenge
to nature. The first reaction is a build-up of resistance in pest and the second
is the production of even more pests, as the pests' natural predators are killed
by the pesticide. In the long term nature wins. This has been demonstrated, for
instance, in cotton growing regions in many parts of world, where entire crops
have been devastated by pests that no pesticide could eradicate.
</P>
<P>The organic farmer on the other hand sees the pest as an indication that his
plants have been weakened for some reason. He may use some natural pesticide
with no long-term effects but his main concern will be to correct his growing
methods to help the plants free themselves of pests.
</P>
<P>The principles of organic farming have been tried and tested for centuries:
composting, mulching, mixed cultures etc. Over the years these methods have been
developed and refined but the basic principles remain the same. To me this is
very reassuring. Organic methods have stood the test of time and have proven
their efficiency. In many parts of the world organic methods are simply the only
way of eradicating hunger and ensuring food for all.
</P>
<P>Finally, I would like to contrast organic agriculture with the new green
revolution: genetic engineering has never been used before. We know nothing of
the long-term consequences of releasing genetically modified organisms into the
environment. And we know just as little about what affect the presence of these
organisms, and products derived from these organisms in food and fodder, will
have on human and animal life. 
</P>
<P>Therefore, to secure sufficient food for all in a manner that neither
compromises human prosperity nor threatens the balance of nature, in the short
or long term, I invite the FAO to give serious consideration to organic
agriculture by placing it on the agenda of the World Food Summit, in Rome, in
November. We have invited the Director General of the FAO, Jacques Diouf, to
attend the International Conference on Organic Agriculture in Copenhagen in
August, so that we can exchange knowledge and experiences. We have in fact
invited him to deliver the closing address to the conference. We in the
International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements consider that organic
agriculture has matured sufficiently to be taken seriously by world leaders, as
an agricultural type capable of eradicating hunger and supplying food for all.
We are calling on the FAO therefore to give due recognition to the organic
alternative.

<TITLE>AGRICULTURE OF THE FUTURE WILL BE ORGANIC
</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
<I>May 1996</I><BR>
<B>Press information</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H1>AGRICULTURE OF THE FUTURE WILL BE ORGANIC
</H1>
<P>The environmental problems facing the agricultural industry cannot be solved
by pesticide free zones in periphery areas or by improved spraying equipment. If
environmental degradation is to be avoided pollution must be stopped. In the
industrial world the transition to organic farming can solve the problem of
surpluses and most of agriculture's environmental problems. In the developing
countries new research indicates the organic farming methods can help peasant
farmers produce considerably more food. Organic agriculture has matured
sufficiently to be taken seriously by world leaders as an agricultural type
capable of solving agriculture's environmental problems without the risk of
compromising food supply.
</P>
<P>
The organic idea comprises two key concepts: living soil and biodiversity. When
it is understood how soil should be treated to become a &quot;living&quot;
entity the need of easily absorbable artificial fertilizers disappears and when
it is grasped how to achieve biodiversity in farming the need of hazardous
chemicals in agricultural production also disappears.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>The basis of organic agriculture: Living soil</H2>
<P>Describing soil as &quot;living&quot; is probably foreign to most people.
However, top soil swarms with living organisms from the common earthworm to
bacteria and microscopic fungi. Top soil is an ecosystem much like a forest. It
is the earth's ecosystem that literally speaking forms the basis of organic
agriculture. If the ecosystem is left intact with broad biodiversity it has the
possibility of carrying out the mission designed for it by nature, namely, to
supply plant life with necessary nourishment.
</P>
<P>
Pollution simplifies the ecosystems of rivers and streams: organism variety is
diminished and the water's self-purifying ability is reduced. Soil's ecosystem
is polluted in like fashion, for instance, by artificial fertilizing and the use
of pesticides and, as in the case of streams and rivers, its ecosystem is
simplified. Organisms disappear, thus reducing the soil's ability to nourish
plant life without artificial help.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious difference between conventional and organic agriculture is that
the former uses artificial fertilizers and its organic counterpart uses various
types of organic nutrients derived from animal or vegetable matter, for example,
farmyard manure and compost. The organic method therefore appreciates top soil
as a living ecosystem: organic fertilizer nourishes the earth's organisms in a
manner that artificial fertilizer, by its very nature, can never accomplish.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Healthy plants</H2>
<P>If the central role played by living soil in organic farming is appreciated
accusations that organic farmers spread artificial fertilizers or spray their
land with pesticides at dead of night can only be acknowledged as ridiculous. If
this were the case they would destroy their living soil and be on the way back
to conventional production, where increasing amounts of artificial fertilizers
and pesticides are needed. Living soil and biodiversity are essential to the
health of plants. It is well documented, for instance, that plants cultivated on
compost fertilized soil are less exposed to fungal infections than plants
cultivated on artificially fertilized land.
</P>
<P>
Diversity also plays a role in helping to maintain plants in a healthy
condition. To mention just one example. A wise organic farmer tolerates a few
weeds in his corn field. He is aware that weeds attract useful insects. Hover
flies, for instance, whose larvae feed on the aphids found on cereals.
Diversifying crop type and variety in the same field are further examples of
methods to secure biodiversity in organic fields.
</P>
<P>
If due regard is taken of the soil's ecosystem and biodiversity it is possible
to cultivate healthy plants - or to put it another way, plants that do not
require &quot;protection &quot; from the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Famine or environmental catastrophy?</H2>
<P>There is no doubt that conventional agriculture gives greater yields than
its organic counterpart. However, higher yields come at a price in the form of
environmental problems. Owing to over production conventional agriculture is
forced at times to take land out of production. Conversion to organic
agriculture then would solve two problems simultaneously: less intensive farming
methods giving lesser yields and minimal pollution. Experience has shown that
organic agricultural yields by and large correspond to 1960 levels. In other
words a yield level that in no way threatens food supplies in industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, however, problems are quite different. In many regions
agricultural production is insufficient to feed the local population. There are
many reasons for this: dumping of agricultural surpluses from industrial
countries leads to unprofitable local production and the production of cash
crops, such as bananas and coffee, deprives local food production of arable
land, just to name two of the most important examples.
</P>
<P>
In the villages where food for the local population is produced methods are
often so primitive that yields are quite low. It is irrelevant here whether or
not yields can be increased with the use of artificial fertilizers and
pesticides because local farmers cannot afford either. If on the other hand
organic methods are introduced production intensifies. An increase in yields of
200-300 per cent has often been experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Two examples of how agricultural production can be intensified with the sole use
of local resources: the population can be trained how to recycle their household
waste to compost and use it as fertilizer. This makes use of local resources
that would otherwise go to waste and the same time help to achieve greater
yields. If a farmer cultivates coffee for export by organic methods he can
cultivate various types of vegetables between his coffee bushes. This increases
biodiversity while at the same time producing food. This method is impossible if
coffee is grown with the use of chemicals as spraying makes vegetables unfit for
human consumption.

speech</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Opening Speech by the Danish Minister for Environment and Energy at the
First   Organic World Exhibition, August 10, 1996</B> 
</P>
<P>

<BR CLEAR="all">    First of all let me congratulate The International
Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements  on the splendid outcome of their
efforts. I have been told that the 60 participants of their  first meeting, have
now grown into more than a thousand participants from all over the world 
gathering at the conference beginning tomorrow in Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the First Organic World Exhibition is a marvellous initiative. I have
just had a  chance to take a glimpse at some of the 220 stands, and I must say I
am both impressed and a bit   proud that the Green Fund under the Ministry for
Environment and Energy has helped IFOAM realise  this project. 
</P>
<P>
It is inspiring that this first chance to see the variety of organic production
has attracted so  much attention. And it proves to me, that people all over the
world have been convinced that the   concept of organically sound production is
part of the sustainable development we must pursue. 
</P>
<P>
There are still dilemmas and problems of organic farming. Can we be sure that a
world wide   change to organic agriculture will provide enough food for all? 
</P>
<P>
And will the richer countries accept the necessary adjustments to their
lifestyle?   These are dilemmas which deserve to be dealt with in an
international framework...  But meanwhile we must all do our best to nourish the
enthusiasm that has emerged in  recent years. 
</P>
<P>
All parties must make an effort to ensure that the conversion to organic
production   methods continues. Farmers and retailers must dare to make the
change, consumers must  support them, and governments must encourage a change by
strengthening research and  education, removing barriers, support cooperations
across sectorial- and national  borders and secure the demand. 
</P>
<P>
The public authorities - being major consumers- have a responsibility to set a
good   example, for instance by introducing a &quot;green procurement policy&quot;.
Imagine the   effect on the market if all public institutions insisted on using
only organic  products in their food catering! 
</P>
<P>
The public authorities play an important part. But the retailers must realise
that   they too have responsibilities. They must provide the opportunity to
choose organic   products. As a matter of fact, Danish retailers have
experienced that this can be  done to the great advantage of all parties.    
</P>
<P>   One Supermarket chain - &quot;Irma&quot; - which is also present at this 
 exhibition, has stated that it plans to &quot;phase out&quot;   nonorganic milk
and bread, because of the overwhelming   interest consumers have taken in the
organic products. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most of the organic foods are sold in ordinary  supermarkets as opposed
to speciality stores, and, I believe,  this is an important reason why it is
estimated that by the   year 2000 organically grown food products will have
gained   an average of 15-20 % of the Danish market. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately it is our daily choices - as consumers-  that are   crucial.
Therefore, it is reassuring that the consumers have  become more aware of their
great influence, and more   determined to use it. Ecological awareness is no
longer  reserved for a small group of &quot;green freaks&quot;. 
</P>
<P>
This is an important step. Organic products no longer have a   reputation as &quot;exclusive&quot;
and &quot;odd&quot;, but have become  popular.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Press Release<BR>  11 August 1995<BR>    First Organic
World Exhibition and International Conference on Organic Agriculture opens in
Copenhagen </B></FONT>   
<P>
<BR CLEAR="all">     
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Copenhagen in these days forms the framework for the year's largest
international ecological events, the First Organic World Exhibition and the 11th
Scientific IFOAM Conference on Organic Agriculture with participants from 92
countries.</H3> 
<P>&quot;By now we have managed to create international fora for negotiations
on important global environmental problems such as climate changes, biodiversity
and hazardous chemicals. I hope the enormous interest in the subject of ecology
and the marvellous results shown by organic producers, that we see presented
here today, will persuade the international community to pay equal attention to
the question of environmentally sound food production&quot;, so said the Danish
Minister of Environment and Energy, Mr Svend Auken, when he officially opened
the First Organic World Exhibition in Copenhagen, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>	The First Organic World Exhibition comprises 300 exhibits from around the
world that with a broad cross section of organic products demonstrates how far
ecology and organic agriculture has progressed over the past decades. The
exhibition also offers debates, experimental theatre, fashion shows, film,
organic architecture, straw playgrounds, a supermarket and the presentation of
the world's first international ecological prizes. 
</P>
<P>	Mr Auken continued: &quot;All parties involved must make an effort to
ensure that conversion to organic production methods continues. Farmers and
retailers must dare make the change, consumers must support them and governments
must encourage a change by strengthening research and education, removing
barriers, supporting cooperation across sectorial and national borders and
securing demand. It is reassuring that consumers have become more aware of the
great influence they have and are more determined to use it.     
</P>
<P>Ecological awareness is no longer reserved to a small group of green freaks.
Organic products no longer have a reputation of being &quot;exclusive&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;,
but have become popular. The concept of sustainability will probably have to be
viewed in a wider perspective as well. And then we will have to ask ourselves
the critical questions: can we afford to convert completely to organic farming?
Or can we afford not to? In order to judge properly we must have an extended
concept of economics. Linked to the economic calculation are social and ethical
dimensions.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Indian feminist, physicist and philosopher, Dr Vandana Shiva, took up
the thread of Mr Auken remarks by saying: &quot;We have hands, minds and hearts
in abundance to produce organic food. Input has been most obvious in the Third
World. And now with jobless growth a phenomenon even in the industrialised
countries, the organic system is the only way of providing relevance for future
generations. Because every other system is pushing them out, rendering people
absolutely dispensible to the economic production system. We need places where
people can find new, relevant and significant meaning to life. Studies show that
when ex-prisoners become involved in organic gardening, crime levels come down. 

</P>
<P>Where organic gardening and experiments have been initiated for teenagers in
down-town areas in the US, these young people have given up their lives of
violence. This represents the way forward not just because agriculture is about
producing food but because it gives people a meaning to life. I think our
biggest crisis right now at the end of the millenium and at the beginning of the
next is the hopelessness and the sense of being wasted that is running through
all societies in the world like an epidemic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On Sunday 11th August the Danish Minister of Agriculture, Mr Henrik Dam
Kristensen, welcomed about 1000 participants from around the world to Copenhagen
for the 11th Scientific IFOAM Conference on Organic Agriculture which will
continue until Thursday. The Conference will reflect the changes organic farming
has undergone over the past decades and will highlight organic farming as a
possible solution to the world's threatening hunger problems. The UN
organisation for food and agriculture, FAO, is sending an official
representative in the person of Dr Tito E. Contado from FAOs department for
sustainable development. The results of the conference will be presented at the
closing session on Thursday afternoon and the final document will be handed over
to the FAO as a proposal to the FAO World Food Summit in November.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The 11rd IFOAM Scientific Conference<BR>  Welcome address<BR>
 August 11, 1996<BR>  Henrik Kloppenborg<BR>  Chairman, The Danish Association
of Organic Agriculture 
</B></FONT>   
<P> 
<BR CLEAR="all"> 
<BR>         
<STRONG>On behalf of the Danish Association of Organic Agriculture, I am deeply
honoured this evening to welcome all of you to IFOAMs 11rd Scientific
Conference. For travellers from other countries, a hearty welcome to Denmark.</STRONG></P>
<P>  The associations members are people like yourselves - organic farmers,
consumers, researchers and educators - who work together on all fronts to
promote organic farming. We are very proud to host both the conference and the
World Organic Exhibition.</P>
<P>  As a small association with fifteen hundred members, we have to admit that
we couldn&#180;t have pulled off this ambitious project alone. In addition to
the hardworking organisers and volunteers who have pulled the conference and
exhibition together, I am glad to have the opportunity to thank Minister of the
Environment Svend Auken and the Green Fond for support to the World Organic
Exhibition.</P>
<P>  I especially want to thank our  progressive Minister of  Agriculture
Henrik Dam Kristensen for thee Financial and political support which the
Ministry of Agriculture has given to the conference, to the World Exhibition and
to the development and organic farming in Denmark. We thank you.</P>
<P>  The fact is that this conference is pretty typical and the kind of
collaboration that has given Danish organic farming such a boost in recent
years. We have a handful of organic farmers, researchers and small associations
working overtime to get things off the ground. We have support from consumers.
We have support from the major farm organisations and labour, through the
ministers Council on Organic Agriculture and we have the national government
stepping in with resources.</P>
<P>  The Danish government now supports the development of organic farming at
virtually every critical link. The work is long from finished but we now have an
ambitious research program,  support for product development,  an ongoing
information campaign aimed at consumers and the food industry  a system of
technical assistance to organic farmers,  a subsidy program for conversion and,
not least,   a credible state organic control.     A major challenge for the
conference participants here from Europe will be the building of similar support
from the European  community. We must have a European agricultural policy.<BR> 
    With conversion subsidies, green taxes, research and control  Which promotes
conversion to organic farming.    Today, we have European agricultural subsidy
program which penalise farmers who have a good crop rotation and thereby hinder
conventional production and environmental clean up. This would give organic
farmers all over the would a more free market.</P>
<P>  We must do more than work on common standards for organic production. We
must go after European agricultural policy head on. We want to by more than a
niche production.</P>
<P>  It says something about the times that, in order to be allowed to farm as
I want to, I must have allies in many countries. I must understand and engage
myself in the development of agricultural policy on a European and global level.</P>
<P>   Just consider the production standards for organic farming. Fifteen years
ago, we started a little association which hammered out a set of rules. then the
Danish state development rules and later the European Community. Now we try to
influence the new global rules, Codex Alimentarius. Our next task will probably
be negotiations with the martians on galactic organic rules for cattle farming.</P>
<P>  Common standards and agricultural policy are very important, and IFOAMs
role is critical as rules and policies are set further and further afield. But
we must remember that it is the local work which ignites many farmers interest
in organic farming. The power of example is tremendous. But conversion also
requires that we reach out to farmers, one-by-one.</P>
<P>  We are here to talk about rules and research and marketing. But organic
agriculture is also about what is in the hearts of every person who works the
land. I want common rules with organic farmers in Argentina and Tanzania, but
more important is what I already share with organic farmers throughout the
world: the knowledge that I have borrowed the land from my children.</P>
<P>  In agricultural debate, it is often said that organic farming cannot feed
the world. We disagree. Organic farming cannot eliminate hunger overnight. But
by emphasising development of human resources, sustainable agricultural
practices, and use of local resources, organic farming provides a better basis
for development. This is certainly the case in countries where hunger is caused
by social, political and environmental conditions. But organic farming is also -
for the same reasons - promising for our depopulated rural areas in Scandinavia.</P>
<P>  Organic agriculture is our answer to the question &quot;How should food be
produced ?&quot; but it is also our answer to the question &quot;Who decides how
food will be produced ?&quot;. It is farmers and consumers who must decide.
Organic farming frees us today from a number of powerful agribusiness interests
- such as those which produce fertilizers and pesticides and which now would
like to sell us genetically modified plants, animals, enzymes and Heaven knows
what else.<BR>  There is wisdom in the saying &quot;Think globally and act
locally&quot;. But to promote organic farming, we are increasingly forced to act
globally - on standards and policy - and think hard locally - about how to get
nutrient cycles between towns and farms to function in a balanced and healthy
way.</P>
<P>  I have confidence that all of the dedicated people here will be working at
one or more of these levels for many years to come. Our Associations goal here
in Denmark is total conversion of Danish agriculture - that will certainly take
several decades to accomplish. We are very happy and proud today to have the
opportunity to learn from your experiences and knowledge. With these words I
will conclude my address.</P>
<P>  Once again, a hearty welcome. And thank you for coming !</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B> Press Release 
<BR>12th August 1996<BR>      A main theme of  the International Organic
Conference in Copenhagen: 
<BR>  Consideration not just of soil, plants and animals   but also the human
dimension </B></FONT>     
<P> 
<BR CLEAR="all">        
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Organic agriculture is more than a farming method.</H3>            Social
issues have to be addressed within  the framework of the organic food system. It
is not enough for the organic movement to consider  soil, plants and animals
alone. If the organic movement is to develop, consideration must also  be given
to the human dimension. One of the main themes discussed at the current
International  Conference on Organic Agriculture in Copenhagen is the issue of
the social organisation of  agriculture.  
<P>Addressing the Conference on Monday, where 1000 ecologists representing 92
countries are gathered  to debate the way forward for world ecology, Dr Vandana
Shiva, India, stated that the social perspective  of organic farming has to be
taken into account. &quot;What the organic movement is trying to achieve is to 
put back on its feet a world that is standing on its head. Farmers in the world
economic order are  considered of least value. Small farmers are considered
unviable. This calculated dispensibility in a  trade-led global economy is
devaluing production and generating negative value. The organic  movement is
faced with the challenge of leading a paradigm shift, not based on an elite
consumer  movement, but on a producer led movement where producers ensure people
a place in the production  apparatus.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On this issue Dr. Shiva was speaking of the developing countries. On the
issue of food security,  however, Dr. Shiva stressed: &quot;Food security is now
becoming a problem in the North as well as in the  South. And not just for the
poor. The rich consume the same quantities of toxins in food as the poor,  whose
diet has always lacked nutrition. The North is removing the issue of food safety
from its vision  of food security.&quot;  
</P>
<P>Likewise, Ms. Tuenjai Deetes, founder of the Hill Area Development
Foundation in Thailand, also  stressed the human dimension stating that
development work in watershed areas in Thailand should  focus on non-formal 
education, strengthening community organisations, sustainable upland
agriculture,  environmental conservation, women's development and the
development of inter-village networks.  
</P>
<P>&quot;Organic farming and farmers must create a spiritual relationship with
the ecosystem&quot;, she said. &quot;The  hill tribes in Thailand are closely
related socially, culturally and economically. This relationship and the 
knowledge and respect that comes from it is vital to the future of organic
farming in the mountains. The  hill tribes realise that a flexible approach to
organic farming is needed and that cooperation between  farmers and consumers is
essential to its success. If both parties respect each other healthy, safe, 
clean food will be produced and consumers will learn that farmers can have a
positive affect on the  environment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The 11th Scientific Conference on Organic Agriculture ends Thursday. The
final document will be  presented at the closing session in the form of a
proposal to the FAOs World Food Summit in Rome,  in November. FAO is officially
represented at the Copenhagen conference by Dr. Tito E. Contado from  the FAOs
Sustainable Development Department.

<H3>Pioneering Danes open International Conference on Organic Agriculture</H3> 
      In his opening address to the major International Conference on Organic
Agriculture in  Copenhagen yesterday the Danish Minister of Agriculture gave his
full support to organic  agriculture and told 1000 conference delegates from 92
countries that Denmark was proud to be  a pioneer in the field of ecology. 
<P>
&quot;We are all aware of the problems associated with modern, intensive
agriculture. A priority of the Danish  government is to limit these problems and
to promote ecologically sustainable solutions. In this context  it is important
to underline that agricultural production must be economically and
environmentally  sustainable. The agricultural policy of the European Union and
the International Agreement on World  Trade is market oriented. Agricultural
policies must, however, take more account of the natural  environment and animal
ethics&quot;, said the Danish Minister of Agriculture, Mr Henrik Dam Kristensen,
 when opening the International Conference on Organic Agriculture in Copenhagen
yesterday.  
</P>
<P>
&quot;Organic agriculture does not use pesticides&quot;, he emphasised. &quot;This
means that agriculture based on  organic principles is less harmful to the
environment. I am proud to be able to say that Denmark is the  first country in
the World to introduce national legislation on organic agriculture. Danish
legislation  provides for financial subsidies for organic farmers and lays down
regulations pertaining to production  methods and standards of organic produce.
These regulations are, of course, based on IFOAM  guidelines.&quot;  
</P>
<P>
IFOAM, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, is hosting
the organic  conference, the 11th in succession. The first IFOAM conference was
held in Switzerland in 1977. For  the first time an organic wrold exhibition is
being held in conjunction with the IFOAM conference. The  Danish Ministry of
Agriculture has granted DKK 4.2 million to the conference. Chairman of the
Danish  member of IFOAM, The Danish Association for Organic Farming (L&#157;J),
Mr Henrik Kloppenborg, praised  Denmark's approach to organic agriculture in his
welcoming address to conference delegates. &quot;I want  to thank our
progressive Minister of Agriculture for the financial and political support
given by the  Ministry of Agriculture to this conference, to the World Organic
Exhibition and especially to the  promotion of organic farming in Denmark
generally. Denmark is supporting organic agriculture at  virtually all levels. A
major challenge for EU participants in this conference will be to build similar 
support all over the Community. A European agricultural policy guaranteeing
conversion subsidies,  green taxes, research and quality control, all promoting
conversion to organic farming, is essential.  Today EU agricultural subsidy
programmes penalise farmers with good crop rotation thereby hindering 
conversion to organic farming.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
The 11th Scientific Conference on Organic Agriculture ends Thursday. The final
document will be  presented at the closing session in the form of a proposal to
the FAOs World Food Summit in Rome,  in November. FAO is officially represented
at the Copenhagen conference by Dr. Tito E. Contado from  the FAOs Sustainable
Development Department.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>CHERIMOYA FRUIT OF THE INCAS </TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>TAKEN from writings by A.L. Pikanen<P>Annona genus comprises
more than 50 species of trees and shrubs and are native to tropical
America, which can be traced back to plantings developed by the pre-Inca
people as far back as 2500 B.C.</P><P>Mark Twain said that the
cherimoya is <B><I>deliciousness itself"</I></B>and Haenke called it
<B><I>"Masterpiece of Nature."</I></B>The famous fruit expert and
botanist ,Dr. Seemann, says,<B><I>The pinapple, the mangosteen and
cherimoyas are considered the finest fruits in the world, and I have
tasted them in the places where they are said to be at their best and
reach their highest perfection--the pinapple in Milagro (Ecuador), the
cherimoya on the slopes of the Andes and the mangosteen in the Indian
Archipelago."</I></B></P><P>Dr. Seemann's unhesitating choice of the
three fruits would be the cherimoya.</P><P>The Cherimoya (Annona
cherimola Mill.) native to Ecuador and Peru growing in the mountain
valleys.  It was introduced early into Mexico and Central America.  The
cherimoya grows best close to the equatorial line yet it grows at an
altitude that is definitely cool in the valleys of the Andes.</P><P>The
Cherimoya is a small spreading tree,rarely more than 25 or 30 feet in
height. Technically it is called the "syncarplum" and begins to produce
fruit at four to five years of age.  The light-green leaves vary in
size, reaching up to 10 inches in length. The upper surface of the
leaves is slightly hairy while the lower surface is velvety.  The
inch-long fragrant flowers are produced in the axils of the leaves.  The
highly perfumed fruits vary in form but usually are heart-shaped, oval,
conical or irregular. The light-green surface of the fruit varies in
appearance from smooth to ridged depressions (termed "fingerprinted") to
where the carpels terminate by an abrupt point. The subacid flesh is
creamy white, soft,juicy and is arranged in petagonal or hexagonal form
with many dark brown to black half inch seeds imbedded in ridged rows. 
It has a custard-like consistency, the flavor rich and aromatic, a blend
of sweetness and mild acidity resembling a cross between that of banana
and pineaple. <B><I>"Melting"</I></B>is the best word to describe the
flesh of the cherimoya for it literally does "melt"in the mouth"an
exquisite taste.</P><P>Cherimoya fruits reach a large size from four to
six pounds, some even weigh up to 10 pounds or more. They are propagated
by budding or grafting on strong seedlings of the same species.  Hand
pollinated fruits are found to be larger and less regular than those
pollinated by natural means.  Adult cherimoya trees can stand a mild
frost, but the young trees must be protected.  The soil should be loamy
and rich for the best results, but the tree does not demand this and it
can be propagated in various soils including clay. For a regular grove,
either seedlings or budded trees may be planted, usually 20 to 30 feet
apart. In Ecuador, the only planting method used is by seed while in
Florida and California the cherimoya is propagated by grafting or
budding with seedlings of the species.</P><P>There is quite a wide
difference in the quantity of fruit produced by a single tree, some
growing no more than a dozen or two, while others 50 or even 100 or
more.</P><P>The true Cherimoya is the finest fruit of all the annona
species and considered one of the most exquisite fruits of the world.</P></BODY></HTML>

<BODY>
<H1>Cherimoya</H1>
<P>When you hold this ancient fruit, you see one of the earliest recorded New
World fruits. Cherimoya belongs to the custard-apple (<I>Annonaceae</I>) family
and is related to the native American paw paw. Fruit connoisseurs highly value
the cherimoya's silky- smooth, cream-colored pulp.  </P>
<P>Purchase unripe, hard fruit and ripen at room temperature for 2-4 days
before refrigerating. Although the skin may darken, the pulp is not affected.
When ripe, the cherimoya yields to pressure like a ripe avocado. Use it in fruit
salad, smoothies, sorbet, sherbet, salad dressing, and dessert sauce. This fruit
is wonderful to eat out-of-hand, but don't eat the watermelonlike seeds which
are toxic. </P>
<H1>Sorbet Tips</H1>
<P><B>   By adding milk or yogurt, a sorbet becomes a sherbet. Sorbet
resembles a fruit ice or fruitsicle. For a smooth product, process the sorbet
mixture once during the freezing process and refreeze. This technique breaks up
ice crystals. Sorbet melts quickly at room temperature, so serve rather quickly.
</B></P>
<P><B>       Because cherimoya has a lovely, delicate flavor, adding another
fruit or fruit juice to the sorbet mixture may dilute the cherimoya flavor. A
few blueberries, strawberries, or raspberries, could be used for garnish. Adding
a liqueur into the sorbet mixture can hamper the freezing process. If desired,
add liqueur, such as kirsch, as a topping before serving.</B></P>
<P><B>Cherimoya Sorbet </B>                                                   
                                4 servings</P>
<P>4 cups cherimoya pulp, seeds removed</P>
<P>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</P>
<P>1 tablespoon honey</P>
<P>Puree the cherimoya pulp with the knife blade in a food processor or
blender. Add lime  juice and honey and thoroughly mix. Pour mixture into divided
ice-cube trays or into an 8-inch square pan. Freeze until almost firm. Place
cubes or large pieces into processor bowl and use knife blade until the mixture
is fluffy, but not completely thawed. Pour mixture into ice cube trays or
individual serving dishes and freeze to firm.</P>
<P>To serve: Allow the sorbet to soften a minute or two in the serving dishes,
or place four or five sorbet cubes into each serving dish and gently break them.

</DL><P><B>Biological Control in Cherimoyas -------</B>
</P><P><B>-By Jake Blehm, President Buena </B>
</P><P><B>Biosystems </B>
</P><P><B>Ventura, CA 93007</B>  
</P><P><B> Good Bugs Versus Bad Bugs 
</B></P><P> Some of the pest problems that plague cherimoyas can be
controlled by several species of beneficial insects and mites. The
following is a brief description of these organisms and which pests they
attack. 
</P><P> It is important to remember that these organisms typically are
not used to eradicate a pest, but to bring it under control below &quot;Economic
Injury Level&quot; (EIL). 
</P><P> The basic concept of using biological controls as a first
option control method is usually referred to as &quot;biointensive&quot;
pest management. 
</P><P>  <I>&quot;Biointensive&quot; pest <B>management focuses on
the least </B>disruptive, biologically <B>based solutions first,
resorting to chemical interventions as
</B>a <B>last resort to save the crop.</B></I>  
</P><P> Most growers and pest control advisors recognize that the
liberal use of broad spectrum pesticides can cause secondary pest
outbreaks which require even more pesticide applications -- thus, the
&quot;pesticide treadmill.&quot; 
</P><P> Biological controls that cherimoya growers might consider using
include: 
</P><P><B> Green Lacewing --<I>Chrysoperla spp.</I></B> 
</P><P> A general predator that attacks aphids, small mealybugs, 
</P><P> whitefly, Thrips, small worms, and other pests. 
</P><P><B> Minute piratebug --</B>
</P><P> Or/us <B>spp.</B>
</P><P> An excellent predator of spider mites and thrips, as well as
worms and other pests. 
</P><P> A more specific predator for two-spotted and pacific spider
mites. Works well in cool coastal areas, but not in hot interior
valleys. 
</P><P><B> Six-spotted Thrips --<I>Scolothr/ps sexmaculatus</I></B>
</P><P> This predatory thrip does not bother plants but will attack
several species of spider mites, and other small pests. Works well in
higher Summer temperatures. 
</P><P><B>Mealybug destroyer ~ <I>Cryptolaemus sp.</I></B>
</P><P> This ladybeetle does an excellent job on larger mealybug which
Lacewing has difficulty controlling. It can survive on other pests, but
is not recommended for aphids or mites. 
</P><P><B> White fly parasite ~ <I>Encarsia formosa</I></B>
</P><P> A small wasp that is most effective on Greenhouse Whitefly and
other species to a lesser degree. It is generally not recommended for
Sweetpotato Whitefly <I>(Bemisia spp.).</I>
</P><P> Most of these species can be used in combination with selective
&quot;soft&quot; Pesticides<I>.</I>
</P><P>  <I><B>It is highly recommended that growers consult with a
knowledgable pest control advisor before purchasing and releasing
beneficial organisms.</B></I>  
</P><P> Entomologists know of many species of insects that are
beneficial to man and the environment. It is possible to put beneficial
insects to work controlling a number of pest insects. Thus, the term
&quot;biological control&quot; is used to describe &quot;good bugs
versus. bad bugs.&quot; 
</P><P> Although the concept of biological control has been around for
centuries, it has been actively used as a type of pest control in the
U.S. only for about a century. 
</P><P> Since the 1940s, chemicals had been the most widely used method
of pest control, but with the increased costs of such chemicals,
increased pest resistance, and the growing concern for the environment,
the demand for biological control has grown tremendously. 
</P><P> Cherimoya growers may choose to use only beneficial insects for
biological control, or include beneficials in a larger Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) program using alternate means of pest management to
complement biological control. 
</P><P> Beneficial insects are commonly divided into two generic
categories; predators and parasites. The ladybug, or <I>Hippodamia
convergens </I>is a commonly known example of a predator that attacks
and directly consumes such pests as aphids, spider mites, immature white
fly, worms, and a variety of other softbodied insect pests. 
</P><P> A parasite such as the <I>Trichogramma </I>wasp uses the pest
as a host, or vehicle to reproduce. The parasite stings the pest insect
and lays its eggs inside, or near the pest, thus killing the pest and
providing food for the future offspring of the parasite. 
</P><P> In general, beneficial insects all work the same way. They
attack the specific pest population, thus reducing it below economic
injury levels. It is not usually necessary to totally eliminate the pest
population in order to see results. Expert knowledge of release rates
and timing is important to achieve the maximium result from a release of
beneficial insects. 
</P><P><B>Green Lacewing</B>
</P><P><I><B>{Crysoperla)</B></I>
</P><P> The green lacewing larvae is known to attack almost any
soft-bodied pest insect that it comes in contact with. Its voracious
appetite lends to a specific liking for aphids, but lacewing 
</P><P> larvae will also feed on small <B>worms, </B>immature
whitefly, mites, 
</P><P> insect eggs, etc.. 
</P><P> Although lacewing can be found naturally in planted areas, a
steady increase of their population will lend to control or elimination
of the pest population. It takes a trained eye to locate their tiny
green eggs, each one perched on a minute hair-like stem. 
</P><P> In the larvae stage, they are grayish green in color and are
thought to resemble small alligators. As adults, the green lace-wing
lives up to its common name by developing its wings that resemble
delicate green lace. 
</P><P> Lacewings should be shipped in the egg stage so that they will
be hatching into hungry larvae close to the time our growers receive
them. 
</P><P><B>Trichogramma <I>(Trichogramma)</I></B>
</P><P> There are several species of Trichogramma parasites that attack
over 150 species of moths and butterflies (Lepidopteran pests). Such
pests include tomato fruitworm, European cornborer, corn earworm,
armyworm, spruce budworm, and several more. 
</P><P> The species of Trichogramma recommended depends on the
particular crop and pest situation. Trichogramma are shipped within
parasitized moth eggs that are hatching, or ready to hatch by their
arrival. The actual parasite is so small, it is said that 4 or 5 of them
can sit on the head of a pin. 
</P><P>  <IMG SRC="new10002.gif"> 
</P><P><B>Trichogramma</B>  
</P><P><B>Fly Parasite (Muscidifurax zaraptor, Spalangia endius )</B>
</P><P> Fly parasites are beneficial parasitic wasps that attack the
pupae of several species of filth breeding flies. They will attack the
common housefly, stable fly, blow fly, lesser house fly, garbage fly,
horn fly, etc.. 
</P><P><IMG SRC="new10003.gif"></P><P>  <B>Green Lacewing</B>  
</P><P> There are often some species of fly parasites naturally present
where flies breed, but there must be a significant population of them in
order to control the pest fly population. 
</P><P> Fly parasites resemble small gnats and will only attack flies
in the immature stages. They will not harm humans, plants or animals.
The product is shipped in the form of parasitized fly pupae and upon
arrival will be hatching, or close to hatching. 
</P><P>  <B>Fly Parasite</B>  
</P><P><B>Predatory Mites</B>
</P><P><B>(P. <I>persimilis, </I>A. Californicus, M. Occidentalis)</B>
</P><P> Used for the control of the two spotted spider mite and many
other harmful species, Predatory Mites are shipped in the adult stage.
It is estimated that one Predatory Mite will consume up to 20 pest mites
and/or eggs per day. 
</P><P><B>Predatory Mites</B>
</P><P><B>Summer 1995 Newsletter</B>
</P><P><B>White fly Parasite</B>
</P><P><B>(Encarsia spp., Eretmocerous, Delphastus sp.)</B>
</P><P> These small parasitic wasps attack the Greenhouse white fly,
Sweetpotato White fly, and other species in the immature stages (laying
eggs in the 3rd and 4th growth stages, and feeding on the 1 st and 2nd
stages of white fly). For best results make releases early, when
populations of white-fly are relatively low (approxi-. mately 1 adult
per leaf). 
</P><P><B>White fly Parasite</B>
</P><P><B>Ladybugs</B>
</P><P><I><B>(Hippodamia convergens)</B></I>
</P><P> This well known predatory beetle attacks common pests such as
aphids, spider mites, immature white fly, worms, and a variety of other

<P>
<B>Tips for Saving Heirloom Seed</B>
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to save seed of heirloom cultivars, the first step is to figure
out if they're self-pollinated or open-pollinated. Both types of pollination
take place when pollen is transferred from the anther (male part of the flower)
to the stigma (female part of the flower).
</P>
<P>
If a plant is self-pollinated, its stigma is pollinated by pollen from the same
flower or from another flower on the same plant. Self-pollination is common
among many of the major food crops of the world. Wheat, barley, rice, and oats
are all self-pollinated; so are beans, peas, soybeans, peanuts, eggplant,
lettuce, peppers, and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<CENTER>
Open-pollinated crops include onions,
</CENTER> 
<P>
corn, cucumbers, pumpkins, squash, broccoli, beets, carrots, cabbage,
cauliflower, melons, radishes, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnips. They can't
pollinate themselves. Instead, they depend on bees or other insects to transfer
pollen from the anther of one flower on a certain plant to the stigma of a
flower on a different plant. These plants may be pollinated by a plant of the
same cultivars, a different cultivars, or a related species. (Pumpkins can
pollinate squash, for example.)
</P>
<P>
To make sure your heirloom seed is true to type, isolate the plants you want to
collect seed from so they can't cross with other cultivars nearby. (One way to
do this is to set a tomato cage or frame around the plant and cover it with fine
mesh netting to keep out bees and other pollinators.) If the plant is
self-pollinated, it will take it from there. But if it's open-pollinated, you'll
have to lend a hand. Lift up the netting and brush pollen from another plant of
the same cultivars onto each flower's stigma with a soft artist's brush. Then
replace the netting.

<TITLE>Squash Summer</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY BACKGROUND="green">
<P>
<B>SQUASH, SUMMER</B>
</P>
<P>
Summer squash lives up to its name. It likes <B>hot </B>weather and can't be
planted until the air temperature stays in the 65&#176;-to-75&#176;F range.
Summer squash grows fast, though. Almost all cultivars bear fruit in less than
two months, <B>and </B>most zucchinis ripen in less than 50 days. I can safely
sow squash in May and be eating it by July. From then on, I can pick it day
after day until the first frost ends the harvest.
</P>
<P>
<B>Get your summer squash off to a great start by planting them in hills of
rich, well-prepared soil. Put cardboard collars around your seedlings to protect
them from cutworms, and mulch them to maintain even soil moisture for best
growth. Hotcaps will protect frost-sensitive seedlings until all danger of frost
is past.</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>&#183;</B>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<CENTER>
<B>Make Your own Squash</B>
</CENTER> 
<P>
You can develop new cultivars, or keep certain characteristics in an existing
cultivar, by playing a hand in pollination. If you want to try hand-pollination,
experiment on squash or pumpkin. Both have large blossoms, making them easy to
work with.
<IMG SRC="flower1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"><IMG SRC="flower2.gif" ALIGN="TOP"></P>
<P>
Watch carefully as buds form on your plant. When you feel that blooming is
imminent, gently tie the female blossoms closed with soft yarn, rubber bands, or
twist ties. The next morning, pick an open male blossom from the
</P>
<P>
plant you wish to cross  with the mother plant,
</P>
<P>
and remove the petals. </P>
<P>
This procedure will expose the male blossom's anthers, where the pollen is
located.
</P>
<P>
Then remove the yarn from the female blossom and gently rub the anthers across
the stigma, which is usually located at the center of the blossom. Tie the
female blossom closed. Mark the stem of that blossom with a tie or marker. As
the fruit develops, the blossoms will slough off.
</P>
<P>
Wait for the fruit to ripen fully, then remove the seeds. Wash them off and dry
them carefully on a screen, then store them in a glass jar in a warm, dark
place. Plant the seeds the following year to see what you've created. Who knows?
you could be another Luther Burbank!
</P>
<P>
<B>Make your own squash! Who knows what you'll come up with if you try
experimenting with cross.pollination? But whatever you get, it's easy and fun!
To make a cross, strip the petals off a male flower on one parent plant. Cut off
the flower and rub the pollen-coated anthers against the stigma of the female
flower you've chosen as the other parent. (Female squash flowers look like they
already have a tiny squash forming at the base.) Once you've pollinated the
female flower, tie its petals together with a twist tie to make sure bees don't
destroy your experiment! Harvest the mature squash, save the seeds, and plant
them out next year to see what you've produced.</B>
</P>
<P>
with hotcaps. On very chilly nights, you can toss a light mulch of straw over
the hills for extra protection. Early-seeded squash grows rather slowly, but it
also ripens about two weeks earlier than squash that's direct-seeded in the
ground at the regular time.
</P>
<P>
Sow three or four squash seeds per hill anti space the hills 4 or 5 feet apart.
After few weeks, thin each hill to the one or strongest plants, and put a
cardboard
</P>
<P>
around the stem of each young plant to thwart cutworms. Ideally, just one bush
squash plant should occupy about a 4 x 4-foot area. Summer squash is a husky
grower in good soil, and if the plants get too crowded, they often form tiny
fruits that turn brown at the blossom end.
</P>
<P>
<B>CARE</B>
</P>
<P>
Summer care is minimal. Just spray the plants once every three weeks with a
micronutrient-rich foliar feed like kelp or liquid seaweed, and keep them well
mulched and watered.
</P>
<P>
Watch for the reddish brown egg clusters of the squash bug on the undersides of
leaves. Destroy the eggs and handpick any gray nymphs or adult brown bugs that
may hatch out. Wood ashes bother the pests; apply them when the leaves are wet.
</P>
<P>
The squash borer is an inch-long, fleshy white caterpillar that eats inside the
stem near the base of the plant, sometimes severing the stem. A weak plant will
wilt and die. Prevention is the best way to control these pests. If you've had
borer problems in the past, cover your plants with floating row covers before
the vines begin to lengthen, or spray the base of the plants with pyrethrins 0r
rotenone weekly. If you find a borer hole in your squash stem, slit the stem,
extract the borer, then cover the stem with soil.
</P>
<P>
Proper spacing helps to keep powdery mildew in check. If your plants have leaves
coated with white or gray powdery spots, pull out every other plant to provide
maximum sunlight and air circulation. Where the problem is common year after
year, make sure the leaves of one squash plant don't touch those of another. You
can spray the plants with sulfur according to package directions to keep mildew
at bay. New research in the field has shown that you can also control
</P>
<P>
mildew by spraying a solution of baking soda and water (1 teaspoon of baking
soda and 1 quart of warm water) on the leaves.
</P>
<P>
<B>HARVESTING</B>
</P>
<P>
Harvest summer squash when they are still immature and tender--you should be
able to pierce the skin with your thumbnail. The fruit grows quickly, so check
the plants daily. Frequent harvesting will also encourage the plants to continue
producing. To harvest summer squash, cut the fruit from the vine, leaving about
1 inch of the stem attached.
</P>
<P>
<B>CROW'S TIPS</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>I have a special technique that allows me to</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>concentrate soil fertility where the individual squash plants will be
growing. For each hill, I dig a hole about 15 to 18 inches deep and wide, and
backfill it with a mixture of//1/3<B>compost
</B>1/3 good garden loam, and 1/3 shredded leaves, sphagnum moss, or similar
humus material. To that I add 1/2 cup each of greensand, blood meal, and rock
phosphate, and I cup of blended organic fertilizer. In soils with a pH of 6.5 or
lower, I add 1/2 cup of dolomitic limestone.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>This mix will give the plants enough to go on for most of the season. For an
extra boost I feed them every three weeks with a liquid fertilizer like manure
tea or fish emulsion.</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>CROW'S PICKS</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>The main types of summer squash are yellow, </I>green, <I>and scalloped.
But there's one cultivar of yellow squash that really stands out in my garden.
It's called 'Custard Marrow'. The fruit
<B>resembles </B>'Pattypan' squash and grows to about the same width--7 or 8
inches--but it's much thicken The young fruits, up to 4 inches in diameter, have
very firm yet tender flesh without the undesirable seedi-ness and soft centers
of other summer squashes.</I>

</CENTER>

<P>
<B>I </B>don't like seeing pests and diseases on my plants any
more than the next gardener. But I resist the urge to grab a spray
can every time I see a bug. In this chapter, I'll tell you how
to cope with your plants' problems <I>without </I>resorting to
the can.
<P>
<B>Natural Systems</B>
<P>
Diversity and stability are the secrets to a healthy garden, and
intercropping is the key. I believe that mixed cropping patterns
are essential in the garden. A diverse planting design allows
for a richer and healthier relationship between plants and the
environment.
<P>
Year after year, I've found that as long as I maintain diversity
by planting in patches and blocks rather than planting long rows
of monocrops, I don't have any major pest problems. Planting patterns
like these encourage beneficial interactions between insect and
plant life.
<P>
To get the most out of diversity, you should plant intensively.
I plant most rows 6 inches apart, with in-row spacing even closer.
This means that plants will barely touch each other when fully
grown. If you alternate the rows with fast- and slowmaturing crops,
the fast ones will be gone by the time the slow ones need room.
<P>
To improve the ecological stability of your garden, try experimenting
with some of the following techniques:
<P>
Grow flowers in your vegetable beds to serve as food for natural
enemies of pests. The flowers of certain plants like yarrow and
Queen-Anne's-lace provide pollen and nectar for various beneficial
insects.
<P>
Grow aromatic plants. They interrupt the feeding behavior and
other biological activities of pests by masking the odor of the
host plant.
<P>

<CENTER>
Use trap plants to lure pests away from the main crop. You can
control the pests on the
<P>
 trap crops or save them for the beneficial insects.
</CENTER>

<P>
Choose resistant cultivars. Many plants have been specially bred
to resist the attacks of particular pests and diseases.
<P>
Plant hedgerows and shelter belts to provide a refuge for natural
pest enemies. These plants can give alternate food sources for
beneficial insects and predators.
<P>
<B>When a garden is designed with diversity in mind, it's generally
healthier because growing many different types of plants attracts
beneficial insects that feed on destructive ones. A diverse planting
also makes it harder for pests and diseases to find vulnerable
crops.</B>
<P>
<B>Nontoxic Techniques</B>
<P>
Nothing succeeds like success. As soon as you start letting a
few simple nontoxic techniques go to work against insects, other
steps will fall right in line and pest problems will dwindle.
<P>
If you're using chemical pesticides, the first thing to do is
to stop, cold turkey. Without these poisons permeating your air,
soil, water, and plants, some of nature's intended protection
has a fighting chance to work. Helpful insects can go back
<P>
on the job.
<P>
Plants themselves respond to the advantages of a natural and balanced
environment as well. They develop stronger root systems, and they
regain their inherent resistance to pests that healthy plants
have. Even birds come back on the garden scene to lend a hand
and an appetite.

<P>
<B>SWEET BASIL</B>
</P>
<P>
I can't imagine my vegetable or herb garden without at least some sweet basil
<I>(Ocimum basilicum). </I>It's the classic complement to any tomato dish, and
sweet basil and tomatoes are good garden companions.<B> </B>
</P>
<P>
There are several different species and lots of cultivars available, and many
are ornamental in the garden. 'Dark Opal' and 'Purple Ruffles' have purple
leaves that &quot;spice up&quot; the garden and can be used to make beautiful
pink herb vinegars. 'Spicy Globe' produces a compact mound of small but
flavorful bright green leaves, making it a perfect choice for the edges of a bed
or front of a border. And lemon basil ('Citriodorum') adds a lemon tang to the
basil flavor.
</P>
<P>
Basil grows best in full sun and rich, moist soil. This bushy plant grows 1 to 2
feet tall and about 18 inches wide. Sow seeds indoors in spring and transplant
them after all danger of frost is past, or sow outdoors when temperatures are
reliably warm. Thin plants to 1 foot apart. You can also buy and plant bedding
plants.
</P>
<P>
Harvest the aromatic leaves as needed for salads, pesto, and tomato sauce. To
keep the leaves growing vigorously, cut off the flower heads as soon as they
form. Basil is an annual, so when the first frost is predicted, harvest the
entire plant, strip off the leaves, and freeze them for best flavor. One neat
trick is to freeze chopped leaves in an ice cube tray and full of water; pop the
frozen basil cubes into a freezer bag and use them as needed.

</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>Why Do Organic Grower's Disapprove of </B></U></TT><U><B>Chemical
</B></U><TT><U><B>Fertilizers</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Chemical fertilizers are Quick-acting, short-term plant boosters and are
responsible for: (1) deterioration of soil friability, creating hardpans soil,
(2) destruction of beneficial soil life, including earthworms,(3) altering
vitamin and protein content of certain crops, (4) making certain crops more
vulnerable to diseases, and (5) preventing plants from absorbing some needed
minerals.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>The soil must be regarded as a living organism. An acid fertilizer, because
of its acids, dissolves the cementing material, made up of the dead bodies of
soil organisms, which holds the rock particles together in the form of soil
crumbs. This compact surface layer of rock particles encourages rain water to
run off rather than enter the soil.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>For example: A highly soluble fertilizer, such as 5-10-5, goes into
solution in the soil water rapidly so that much of it may be leached away (into
our ground water) without benefiting the plants at all. This chemical causes the
soil to assume a cement-like hardness. When present in large concentrations,
recolate into the subsoil where they interact with the clay to form impervious
layers of precipitates called hardpan.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>. Many artificial chemical fertilizers contain acids, as sulfuric and
hydrochloric, which will increase the acidity of the soil. Changes in the soil
acidity (pH) are accompanied by the changes in the kinds of organisms which can
live in the soil. For this reason, the artificial fertilizer people tell their
customers to increase the organic matter content of their soil, offsetting the
deleterious effects of these acids; also to use lime.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>There are several ways by which artificial fertilizers reduce aeration of
soils. Earthworms, whose numerous borings made the soil more porous,are killed.
The acid fertilizers will also destroy the cementing material which bins rock
particles together in crumbs.Chemical fertilizers rob plants of some natural
immunity by killing off the microorganisms in the soil. Many plant diseases have
already been considerably checked when antibiotic producing bacteria or fungi
thrived around the roots. When plaints are supplied with much nitrogen (N) and
only a medium amount of phosphate (P), plants will most easily contract mosaic
infections. Host resistance is obtained if there is a small amount of nitrogen
(N) and a large supply of phosphate (P). Fungus and bacterial diseases have been
relate&lt; to high nitrogen fertilization, and lack of trace elements.</TT>
</P>
<P>
Plants grown with artificial chemical fertilizers tend to have less nutrient
value than organically grown plants. For example, several tests have <TT>found
that by supplying citrus fruits with a large amount of soluble nitrogen will
lower the vitamin C content of oranges. It has also been found, that these
fertilizers that provide soluble nitrogen will lower the capacity of corn to
produce a high protein content.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Probably the most regularly observed deficiency in plants doped continual
with chemical fertilizers are deficiencies in trace minerals. To explain this
principle will mean delving into a little physics and chemistry, but you will
then easily see the unbalanced nutrition created in chemical fertilized plants
Note: The colloidal humus particles are the convoys that transfer most of the
minerals from the soil solution to the root hairs. Each humus particle is
negatively charged and will, attract the positive elements, such as potassium
(K), sodium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, aluminum, boron, iron, copper and
other metals. When sodium nitrate, is dumped into the soil year after year, in
large doses, a radical change takes place on the humus articles.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>The very numerous sodium ions (atomic particles) will eventually crowd out
the other ions, making them practically unavailable for plant use. The humus
becomes coated with sodium, glutting the root hairs with the excess. Finally,
the plant is unable to pick up the minerals that it really needs.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>So, with chemical fertilizers, in short, you have short-time results,and
long-term damage to the soil, ground water and to our health.</TT>

<TITLE>Why and how of Saving your own Seeds</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY>
<P>
<TT><U><B>The Why And How Of Saving Your Own Seed's</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If left to themselves, our fleshy fruits would naturally fall to the soil
and rot slowly, allowing some of their seeds to settle into the ground , and
sprout when spring arrives. Saving seeds from these plants mimics Nature s way
of gardening.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>But remember, only seeds from open-pollinated (not hybrid) plants will
produce the same crop next year. And except for tomatoes, you need to be fairly
certain that the plants in question have not been cross pollinated by insects.
Such saved seeds might grow into something similar to the parents, or something
tough and tasteless. Tomatoes are self-pollinating . So if you avoid hybrid
varieties you'll be able to grow the same tomato from seed saved from each plant
next year, even if different varieties were grown close together. Pepper and
eggplant flowers can be cross-pollinated by insects, so different varieties of
these would have had to be separated by 500-feet this season for seed purity.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Cucurbits family, crops such as squash, cucumbers, gourds, pumpkins and
melons need even more personal space. All of these garden favorites must be
pollinated by insects, so unless close relatives (of the same species) have been
separated by a half-mile or more, you'll get some kind of squash surprise if you
grow seeds. Seeds of tomatoes, peppers, melons and winter squash are ready for
saving when the fruits are ripe and ready to eat. Peppers are the easiest. The
seeds are mature after the peppers have changed color to their final stage of
ripeness. Cut the peppers open, scrape the seeds onto a plate, eat the pepper
and let the seeds dry in a non-humid, shaded place, testing them occasionally
until they break rather than bend.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Saving tomato seeds take a little more time. Harvest nicely ripe tomatoes
from several different vines of the same variety, cut each across the middle and
gently squeeze the juice and seeds into a bowl. You will note that each tomato
seed is encased in a gelatinous coating. (this prevents the seed from sprouting
inside the tomato.) Remove this coating by fermenting it. This mimics the
natural rotting of the fruit and has the added bonus of killing seedborne tomato
disease. To save the seeds of eggplants, you'll need to wait until the fruits
are far past the stage when you'd pick them for kitchen purposes. Seeds saved
from table-ready eggplants will be immature. Left on the plant, purple eggplant
varieties will ripen to a dull-brownish color and will  turn yellowish-green,
and white becomes golden. Eggplants ready for seed saving will be dull,
off-colored and hard.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Cut the ripe eggplants in half and pull the flesh away from the seeded
areas. If you want to save more than a few seeds, a food processor comes in
handy to mash the flesh and expose the seeds.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>After cucumbers ripen, they change color and start to become mushy. <U>Note:
</U>Remember, if you stop picking cucumbers, their vines will stop producing new
fruit, so you may want to pick your seed-savers toward the end of the season.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Cut the ripe cucumber in half and scrape the seeds into a bowl. To remove
their slimy coating, rub them gently around the inside of a sieve while washing
them or soak them in water for 2-days. Rinse and dry.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>You'll need to let your summer squash ripen past the tender stage, too.
When you can't dent the squash with a fingernail, it's ready to have its seed
saved. Pick it, cut it open, scrape the seeds into a bowl, wash, drain, And,
Finely there's Watermelons. After finishing off the tasty flesh, Put the seeds
(spitting contests optional)in a strainer and add a  drop of dish washing liquid
to remove any sugar and saliva left on the seeds.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><B>So, why should you save your own seed?</B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you raise and save your seeds, you are producing seed for your garden,
and, by careful selection over several generations of plants, you can produce
plants best suited to your climate and your gardening conditions. no one else
but you can do this. Flavor, pest and disease resistance, early bearing, and
size are among the many characteristics that can be enhanced by careful
selection over a period of years</TT>

<TT><U><B>GROWING&quot;</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>Your Winter Herb Garden</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>You can start some herbs from seed in late summer. Best to include annuals
such as basil and chervil, as well as parsley, a biennial. Sow them in a light,
seed-starting mix in flats, water gently, cover with plastic wrap and put them
where temperatures will stay warmer than 60&#176;F. When the seeds sprout,
remove the plastic, and when the seedlings have their second set of true leaves,
put them in 4-inch pots; then, as they outgrow these into 6-inch pots. Those
should hold them nicely until next spring.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>You also can propagate new plants from established ones by cuttings or
layering. This works well for rosemary, thyme, oregano and sage. Take a 4-inch
tip cutting, strip off the lower leaves and stick the stem into moist soiless
mix such as perlite and/or/ vermiculite. To ensure good humidity, cover With
glass or clear plastic, and keep the growing medium moist.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>To propagate by layering, select a branch near the base of a parent plant.
Strip the leaves where it touches the soil when you bend it over, and pin it
down with a bent piece of wire. Keep the soil moist until roots develop. When
this new plant begins to grow, cut the connecting stem and pot it up.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Before the first fall frost(While the weather is still on the mild side)
It's time to start moving your potted herb plants toward their winter home. Move
them to an area with lots of sun (south-facing windows are the brightest), But
protect them from heat and dryness. Most herbs prefer daytime temperatures of
about 65&#176; to 75&#176;F, although they can withstands climbs into the 80s.
It's especially important that night temperatures drop at least 10 degrees, down
into the 50s would be better, to simulate outdoor conditions.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Most herbs like to be well-watered, but don't like wet feet. That's why
good drainage is important. Water when the top of the container feels dry, or
learn to judge the moisture in the soil by the weight of the pot. Add sand or
vermiculite to the potting soil to ensure good drainage. Learn to juggle water,
light and temperature. An herb in a south window in a clay pot will need more
water than one in a plastic pot in an east window</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If the light is low, keep the temperature low. Temperatures that mimic May
combined with the low light levels of a short December day will make for
unhealthy plants. Choose the soil for your indoor herb garden carefully. and for
a good soil mix blend 1 part potting soil with 1 part compost, and 1 part
perlite, vermiculite and sand. Keep transplants separate from your other house
plants while you're gradually acclimating them to the indoors. If you see
insects on a plant during this quarantine, leave it outside.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If, despite such defenses, your indoor plants do end-up under insect
attack, help them stay healthy by providing the correct mix of light and
temperature, and spray them once a week with liquid sea-kelp. A plant weakened
by hot, dry indoor conditions is even more susceptible to spider mites, whitefly
or aphid damage than a healthy one.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you choose to control these with insecticidal soap spray, remember that
the wet spray must come in contact with the insect to be effective. It takes
3-spray treatments &lt;at 5-days intervals&gt; to eradicate soft-bodied insects.
Spray in the evening (and never in bright sunlight) to prevent rapid drying, and
wash off residues the next day.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Treat your herbs like a mini-garden, hold back on the water and organic
fertilizer through December, but when the days start getting longer in
mid-January, feed them with liquid seaweed-fish spray. Even potted soil gets
compacted as you water it, so cultivate it with a little fork, them topdress it
with compost.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>February is usually a great month for indoor plants, because of all the
bright light, By March, they are starting to get buds, and in April, be sure to
put them outside on a warm day.</TT>

<U><B>OUR GARDEN&quot;</B></U>
</P>
<P>
How To Multiply Your Chrysanthemums
</P>
<P>
<TT>Most of the chrysanthemums blooming in gardens this fall will go dormant
when the weather turns cold, then resume growing in spring. But some won't make
it, even though mums are supposed to be hardy perennials. Inadequate snow cover,
extreme cold, heaved roots and the absence of a thick organic mulch all
contribute to their demise. Dormant mums mulched with 4 to 6 inches of chopped
leaves or straw are most likely to live through most winters.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A quick way to divide a year-old mum clump is to look down at it and
imagine it's a big pie, then use a sharp shovel to cut the mum pie in half
vertically and horizontally. Next, cut each of the quarters in half, winding up
with 8 chunks. Dig up each of these sections and plant them elsewhere in the
garden in a hole enriched with compost. Snip out at soil level any hard, woody
stems and all but 4 to 5 of the young succulent stems. Then tamp down the soil,
and water.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Another way to divide an existing clump is to insert a shovel to its full
depth into the soil around two sides of the plant, make a third insertion on
another side, angling it to get under the rootball, then lift the whole clump up
and out of the hole. Loosen the soil around the roots with a trowel.'</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>On the outer rim of the rootball you'll notice lots of new shoots with
small, young hair roots, snip these rooted stems from the mother plant and place
them in water for later planting. Because of the large number of young rooted
stems that can be taken from the periphery of a year-old mum clump, you don't
even need to bother with any of the woody center portion. Compost it instead.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>To get even more plants, take 4 to 5 inch cuttings from the rooted stems or
from undivided clumps still in the garden. Remove the two lowest leaves, make a
.45&#176; cut with a razor on the bottom of the stems, dip the stem in rooting
hormone, and insert it in moistened vermiculite in shallow flowerpots, the type
used for forcing spring bulbs is excellent.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>When a rooted cutting is planted in May it's hard for a novice to visulize
how much space the mature plant will require by fall. Planting rooted cuttings
25 inches apart seems like a tremendous waste of space. Yet a mum in flower
needs at least that much room, and some of the large flowered varieties required
even more. When I line out cuttings I plant them close, about 7 inches apart.
But the close spacing is temporary. About a month after planting, every other
seedling is transplanted to another part of the garden. or potted.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A few weeks later half the remaining mums are again separated, providing a
full 25 inches between plants.<B> </B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Pinching makes chrysanthemums compact and bushy. Pinching is just another
name for pruning with your fingers, removing about an inch of stem per pinch.
Start pinching the tips of rooted cuttings when they reach 6 inches. They'll
develop additional stems from the leaf nodes below the pinch. When the new stems
are 6 inches long, pinch those tips and the plants will produce more stems from
the leaf nodes. By late July when pinching should stop the single stem, rooted
cutting planted back in May will have developed into</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>a bushy compact plant with hundreds of stems with buds forming on their
tips.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>With organic fertilizer, compost and abundant water, chrysanthemums, even
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>the so-called low growers, tend to get top heavy. It's disappointing to
nurture the plants from their infancy to maturity, have them come into full bud,
then see them topple over from the sheer weight of the blooms. Add some wind and
a driving rain and your prize mums will be flat on the ground. To preclude
floppy chrysanthemums, I support the taller ones with twigs pruned from my fruit
trees inserted in the ground around the plants when they're half grown. as the
mums continue to leaf out during the summer their foliage soon hides the
branches.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>I enjoy mums for their attractive foliage from May to fall, then throughout
bloom from September until frost. In pots both in and out of the house they
become movable fall gardens.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Indoors or out, mums gloriously mark the conclusion of the gardening year.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>They're the flower garden's last hurrah!</TT>

<BODY>
<P>
<TT><U><B>&quot;Our Garden&quot;</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>Compost To Improve Your Garden</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>When gardeners speak of a soil, they are referring to earth that looks,
feels and smells pleasant. That means fertile soil, with good structure
depending on the extent to which the inorganic soil particles; sand, silt, clay,
and humus are bound together. No matter what kind of miserable soil you begin
with, it can be transformed into the stuff great gardens are made of. Composting
will start the process.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Compost is Nature recycled. It is the garden itself, in part, returning
benefits in the form of humus as plants and other organic components decompose
through microbial action. A compost pile, in fact, is teeming with microbial
life as the beneficial bacteria, fungi and protozoa go to work in their natural
cauldron. This process can take place slowly or in a matter of a few weeks,
depending on the materials used, their relative sizes and quantities and how
they are mixed together.</TT>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<CENTER>
<TT>Compost is multifaceted but not intended as a fertilizer. It offers only a
relatively low proportion of nutrients, yet what it does is close to magical. In
its finished form as a mulch, it reduces evaporation, reduces or prevents weed
growth, and insulates the soil from extreme temperature changes. A mulch also
keeps the upper inches of the soil cooler in daytime, warmer at night.</TT>
</CENTER> 
<P>
<TT>Yet Compost has humble beginnings. Common, easily accessible materials
destined to decay together in a pile will give your soil the gift of minerals
and other components it needs. The materials are indeed numerous; lawn
clippings, barnyard manure and kitchen garbage are among them.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Regardless of the particular ingredients, making compost is akin to making
bread or beer; soil-digesting bacteria like yeast need warmth, moisture, air and
something to feed on to keep them alive and growing. Almost all of the practical
problems associated with making compost stem from too much or too little of
those basic factors. The traditional method, referred to as fast or hot
composting, produces a lot of compost in just a few weeks. Heat is the key
element: a well-constructed compost pile can reach temperatures 160&quot; to 170&#176;&#183;
It also requires the proper carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 30-to-1 and periodic
turning every 2 to 3 days over a span of 2 to 4 weeks.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>There is also a slow (cold or passive) composting process which is simpler
but takes longer. It won't challenge your knowledge of basic chemistry or pose a
threat to your worms, relying more on time than heat. If you need only moderate
amounts of compost, slow composting is ideal. It involves minimal work,
.recycles kitchen and small garden wastes, and reduces the volume of outgoing
trash.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Whatever the tempo, air is vital to any composting process. Without air
(anaerobic) composting is possible but unpleasant with the putrescence of
rotting material assaulting your nose. It is usually because there is too much
nitrogen and too little air in the mixture.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you have an 'abundance of trees on your property, autumn leaves can be
plentiful and messy, but they are there for your use and can be easily gathered
and stored in leaf bags.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>In any case, you need not worry, as some people have, that the acidity of
the leaves will sour the soil. Although leaves are acidic, they do not add
enough acidity to significantly affect the soil. In particular, some gardeners
question the use of oak leaves in compost because of their acidity, but they can
definitely be used. The acidity they possess is more beneficial than not,
especially for acid-loving plants. This is also true for needles and wood chips
from coniferous trees, which are acidic. Tying up soil nitrogen , is a greater
threat than acidifying the soil. About 100 pounds of leaves can be added to a
garden of 1,000 square feet, with the soil having an organic content of about 2
to 3%, without locking up too much nitrogen. Timing is crucial. Your pile is
fully composted when it fails to heat up after being turned. Then it is ready to
use. And use it with a good feeling for it is your garden's natural fuel.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Remember your objective, the foundation of every successful garden, is to
achieve healthy soil.</TT>

<TT><U><B>The Organic Lawn,Now And Next Season</B></U></TT>
</CENTER> 
<P>
<TT><B>Is </B>your lawn a black hole of gardening, endlessly sucking in your
time, energy and money ? You fertilize, mow, water, mow, spread pesticides, mow,
and mow some more ? Well, it doesn't have to be that way.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>There are 4,basic elements to organic lawn maintenance; fertilization,
liming, mowing and irrigation. Done properly, these all work together to produce
a dense, green turf with few problems such as pests or thatch. Done improperly,
they can work at cross purposes, making trouble for you and your lawn. Let's
look at each of these individually and see how they affect the quality of our
lawns.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Proper organic fertilization takes time, but can reduces mowing chores as
well as the need to use pesticides and herbicides, while making for a prettier
and healthier lawn. The object of fertilizing is to encourage vigorous root
growth without stimulating too much leaf growth. Vigorous root growth means a
healthy organic lawn which resists drought, pests and diseases, while excessive
leaf growth just means mowing.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Before you start fertilizing, find out how fertile your lawn already is.
Take a soil sample, and bring it to Spring Meadow, we'll test it and tell you
the proper organic fertilizer to use on your lawn. This way you will get the
best results, and save money by note putting down more than your lawn needs. The
results will indicate what analysis organic fertilizer is best for your
conditions and how much to apply, probably some where in the range of 3 to 5
pounds actual nitrogen (N) per thousand square feet of lawn per year.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>For cool-season grasses, split the desired amount of organic fertilizers
over 2 monthly fall fertilizations, starting in September and ending in Oct.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Contrary to popular belief, not all lawns need lime every year. Lime is
only necessary when the pH of your soil (a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity
drops to an undesirable level. A soil pH in the range of 7.0 to 7.5 favors most
varieties of turf grasses.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Soil testing is the only way to know your soil pH. Since you have already
tested your soil for fertility, all you need do is check those result, which
will include soil pH. Our soil test results also specify how much lime to apply
Spread lime in the fall of the year, it takes about 2 months to change the pH.
If more than 50 pounds of lime per 1000 square feet is required, split the
amount into separate applications applied several months apart.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>It doesn't hurt a lawn to go brown in midsummer. All this means is that t!
grasses are .dormant, waiting for fall rains. If you must have a lush green turf
throughout the summer, you will probably have to water. Should you choose to do
so, remember these rules. Water deeply and water regularly.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Deep watering, enough to wet 6 inches down in the soil, encourages roots to
grow downwards, instead of staying near the surface. Surface-rooted plants
require more frequent watering This results in constantly moist surface which
encourages weeds to germinate, and disease to spread. Deep roots stay cooler,
and are less likely to go dormant in summer's heat. Most lawns require about one
inch of water per week to continue growing.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Regular watering keeps the lawn from fluctuating between periods of
dormancy and growth several times per season, which can weaken the turf. If you
forget to water your lawn one week and it turns brown, let it stay that way
until it naturally comes out of dormancy with the return of regular rains. It
may not look pretty, but the lawn will be healthier than if you continued to
water it sporadically.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Weeds are another possible problem that may sprout up. Annual weed grasses
such as crabgrass can be crowded out of your lawn by healthy grass mowed high,
and fertilized in the fall with a 3-6-3 organic fertilizer.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>I am always amazed at the intertwining of all aspects of organic lawn care.
Mowing heights affects the health of the grass roots, as does the timing of
fertilization, which can affect how much mowing is necessary, and so on. A lawn
is a complex community of plants, insects and microorganisms, and the more we
understand it the easier it is to successfully maintain it. Sure, it is still
work, but at least we don't have to work against ourselves with Toxic Chemicals.
And even mowing is almost pleasant when the lawn is healthy and green.</TT>

</CENTER> 
<P>
<TT>Gardening is as much an art as a science. You can stuff yourself full of
plant lists, insect-identification guides and weather statistics, but that won't
make you a great gardener. Good gardening, especially organic gardening,
consists of knowing, down deep, a few basic principles, and there details. It is
the relationships
<B>between the </B>plants on those lists and the insects in those guides that
make the garden what it is. If you understand those connections, then the
details make sense and the proper actions in a given situation seem obvious.
It's why some of the best gardeners, when asked how they know something, will
say, &quot;Oh <B>it'</B> , s just common sense.&quot;</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><B>Great </B>gardening is, in part, a matter of timing., and garden time
is critical time. Every cycle has a consistent sequence of developments in when
specific events unfold.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>The key to good garden timing, then, is to watch each of the cycles and
time your planting, cultivation and pest-control activities to coincide with the
natural developments of the season. Even harvesting is affected by the progress
of the year. We all know that melons taste best if they haven't, been watered in
the last 3 weeks of <B>ripening.</B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>The importance of the annual cycle of light and dark can be seen in the
staggering of succession crops. In the spring, the days are getting longer and
the soil, air and water temperatures are rising. Two rows of carrots, planted 2
weeks apart in late April, will mature only one week apart because the
later-planted crop has better conditions and will grow faster. So stretch the
time between plantings in the spring to get the right timing for succession
harvests. Fall crops act the opposite way' just a few days between plantings
will cause a harvest delay of a week or more because the days are becoming <B>shorter
as </B>the crop matures.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Try to use the timing of different plants to your advantage. Thinning
carrots was one of the more tedious jobs in the garden. But, plants can work
together, so we've stopped thinning. Now we mix radish and carrot seed together,
1/3 radish by volume, and sow them both in the same row.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>The radishes break ground almost immediately, allowing us to cultivate
between the rows and stop early sprouting weeds before the carrots are up, When
the radishes mature a few weeks later, the harvest thins the carrots
automatically. The relationship of these 2 plants makes the garden more
productive.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>This kind of thinking is hard to do from the seat of a tractor. the kind of
garden that will put you in touch with the quiet rhymes of growth is by
definition a garden of human, not industrial scale. A personal garden need to be
small enough that you can do any major garden task in a day.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Spring soil preparation; seeding and setting of transplants; fall cleanup,
none of these should take more than a single Saturday of pleasant work for the
family. How big a garden is that ?</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you start too, big, it may get out of hand. Don't think of vegetable
gardening as a chore; cultivating and weeding give as much pleasure as
harvesting if you keep it manageable. It can be a quite moment of observant , of
close interaction with the whole community of your garden.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Tools and techniques determine each other; if both are kept in mind during
the planning process, the whole project benefits. We had been planting 6 rows of
carrots side by side in a 3-foot wide bed. It was very space efficient; but,
when the carrots reached a decent size, we couldn't fit a hoe between the rows
anymore and had to weed by hand. By matching the row to the hoe we cut the labor
required in half.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you really want to know how your garden is doing, get down on your hands
and knees and look at it; run your hand through the soil and smell it; check the
undersides of plant leaves for insect egg instead of just walking by and dousing
them with spray. You might find that the time you spend taking care of your
garden is a whole lot more satisfying and a lot less like work.</TT>

<TITLE>Hey-Grow UP</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY>
<P>
<TT>&quot; <U>It's Our Garden </U>&quot;</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><B>HEY~ GROW - UP!!!</B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><B>More Garden Space By Using Fences Trellis's, And Stakes</B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Every vegetable garden should have some sort of fence around it, not only
to keep visitors from walking in uninvited, but more important, as support for
growing crops. Take a small garden, say 20 by 25-feet, fence it with poultry
netting 5 or 6-feet high, and you have increased your effective space by 50% or
more. You've also saved the time and trouble involved in providing stakes or
cages for tomatoes, <B>poles for </B>your beans, and supports for peas.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>You can obviously plant all your pole beans, tall peas, and tomatoes close
to the fence. Less obviously, you can plant many other crops along the
ready-made trellis and count on their doing at least as well as they would if
allowed to sprawl over dozens of square feet of your garden.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Cucumbers grow specially well on a fence. Instead of planting them in
hills, push a dozen seeds into the soil an inch or two from the fence, about
3-inches apart. You'll also find the fruit colors more uniformly, without the
white streak that frequently spoils its appearance if not the taste.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Melons are another excellent crop <B>for vertical </B>gardening.
Muskmelons, though, should have cradles made for them out of cheesecloth, or
similar material spread under the fruit and secured to the fence. Otherwise, as
melons ripen and stems begin to loosen, the fruit will fall to the ground.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>In growing your vegetables on a fence, remember that the principles of crop
succession apply. Any given section of fence can support more than one crop each
season. Tall peas may be started first. Pole limas and Pole string beans can go
in a little later and a few inches farther from the fence. Tomato plants can be
set a full foot away, cucumbers, melons, pumpkins and squashes planted between
them.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>I'm continually being told by people living in the suburbs that they would
like to grow a few tomatoes or something of that sort, but have no room. Over
years of experimenting in vegetable growing, my answer has become: &quot;If you
have room for a fence, you have room for tomatoes, and many other crops too.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>What I tell them amounts to this: If you want to grow tomatoes, get a dozen
strong plants and set them within a foot of your fence in a sunny spot Dig deep
holes for the plants, and leave only the tips exposed above the paper collars
you wrap around them to stop cutworms. Apply compost, bone meal and some 4-6-4
organic fertilizer liberally <B>over </B>the surface. As the plants take hold
and start to grow, mulch them with hay or straw. When they begin to sprawl,
prune main branches off to the best 2 or 3, and tie these to the fence with
strips of cloth, being careful to take a turn loosely around each stem with the
tie made at the fence end. This gives you a sling for each branch which, like a
surgical sling for a tender arm, supports it without risk of injury. After that,
all you have to do is make similar slings for the higher growth, and you will
have a nice crop of tomatoes.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>So much for tomatoes. The same applies to all the crops mentioned earlier
Anyone who has a piece of fencing anywhere, or a place for one, has room for a
good vegetable garden of corresponding dimensions. By feeding the soil with
organic fertilizers and soil amendments, including all crop residues, along a
2-foot-wide strip next to a fence, you can grow astonishing quantity, of choice
vegetables at little cost beyond the price of seeds.</TT>

<TT><U><B>Eye-Pleasing Edibles In Your Flower Beds</B></U></TT>
</CENTER> 
<P>
<TT>Think you don't have enough space to grow vegetables ? If you have space
for flower beds and borders, there is no reason for you not to grow vegetable. 
Have you ever looked at an eggplant growing ? The sturdy plant reaches 24 to
36-inches in height and is covered with light-green, lobed leaves. As the whorls
of new leaves appear the centers are touched with purple. The foliage alone
would justify background space in a flower bed, and when the delicate, lilac
colored blossoms appear, the plant is even more attractive For beauty of form,
color, shape and texture, the fruit of the eggplant is difficult to surpass. As
a background for pink or scarlet petunias, 2 or 3 these plants would lend an
almost exotic touch to the flower bed and would also supply your family all
summer with a delicious vegetable.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Imagine petunias or gold marigolds against the glossy green leaves of a
sweet pepper plant. There is a dwarf edible pepper that might be the showpiece
of any flower garden. It is globular in shape, about 18-inches high covered with
tiny white blossoms for several weeks, and later in the summer it is full of
cherry size peppers. Early peas may be sown in areas that will be filled in
later with annual flowers. Since peas may be planted earlier than most seeds,
this is a welcome task for a winter-bound gardener. And what a reward when the
family enjoys fresh, tender peas! Later, the vines themselves may be worked into
the soil to supply an extra share of nutriments to the flowers which follow the
peas.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Even in very informal plantings, set-apart location and are generously fed
and mulched. A border garden of bibb lettuce rosettes at the outer edge of a
rosebed may supply weeks of tossed salads, with no harm to the roses.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>One of the most delightful gardens I've seen was outside the kitchen door
of an old Amish house. The featured plants were red cabbages marching along the
entire border. Before the summer was over the cabbages were eaten, and flowers
soon spilled over into the empty spaces.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Savoy cabbages could be used in a corner of the flower bed. Low-growing
ageratum or sweet alyssum planted in front and feathery cosmos nodding in the
background would lend color to the beautiful texture of the cabbage leaves.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you can interest your next-door neighbor in the idea of having beauty in
the flower borders and eating it, too, asparagus may be a joint project for you.
A row of asparagus planted on a property line may be shared by two families.
This would require planning and cooperation because the asparagus should not be
harvest for 2 or 3-years. From the very beginning, however, the lacy fern, which
must be allowed to grow all summer, would furnish a lovely background for
flowers in the adjoining gardens. A double row of asparagus would be dense
enough for a temporary hedge, if desired.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A couple of rhubarb plants, with crimson stalks and huge, dark-green
leaves, will supply the makings for many delicious pies. Even summer squash,
yellow Seneca, or green zucchini are plants with beautiful foliage and blooms
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A dwarf peach tree or cherry tree when in bloom is almost, if not quite as
beautiful as a flowering crab apple, and also provides fruit to eat. Red or
black raspberries have lovely blossoms and, later, berries, to eat. They'll.
also make a sturdy hedge.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Possibly the most bountiful plant for edging and for eating is the
strawberry. Everbearing strawberry plants, kept free of runners so that they
produce berries freely until frost, may be used to edge flower borders or
vegetable plots. A dozen or more strawberry plants may be tucked into a rock
garden. They grow less than a foot high and blend nicely with other plants. Just
be certain to place them where you can reach the berries when they are ripe.
</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>So remember, growing space need not keep you from enjoying both. attractive
plants and good eating. Get some eye-pleasing edibles into your flower beds and
borders.</TT>

<HEAD><TITLE>Success with growing cactus</TITLE>

</P>
<P>
<TT>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>Guidelines For  Success With Growing Cactus Indoors</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Most cacti seem to be victims of their own durability. They will take an
incredible amount of neglect and even abuse. I've seen them growing under
practically zero light conditions, on cold, dreary porches, in ordinary potting
soil, and shriveling from a prolonged drought because their owners take the name
<B>desert cactus </B>too literally.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>However, a little care goes a long way. Give them proper light, soil,
temperature and watering, and they'll send out new growth.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>You can use any common plant container for cactus, but clay pots are
preferred for two reasons. First, they are porous and allow the soil to dry
quickly. Second, they're heavy and many cactus soak up water, becoming heavy.
Such plants easily tip over when in light, plastic containers. Mature cactus
need repotting only once every 3 to 5 years. The pot should be at least as large
as the largest diameter of the plant and its spines. Best repotting time is late
winter, before the dormant season ends.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>What about the right kind of potting soil to be used for cactus</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Well, here are 2 formulas you might try. The simplest method is to use a
commercial houseplant soil you're happy with for other perposes, and mix with an
equal amount of clean, dry builder's sand. Note: don't use sea sand. Or, use
equal parts of garden soil, compost and builder's sand. To either of these
mixtures add a tablespoon each of limestone and bone meal per quart The main
point about soil is that it should be quick-draining. Cactus don't like to sit
in heavy, wet soil. their roots will rot.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Water is the single most critical factor. It is better to err in the
direction of too little water. But a little thought and scheduling will go far
in developing healthy, blooming plants.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>One basic rule is to keep the plants dry in fall and 'winter, wet in spring
and summer. Cactus need a dormant period in which they harden growth and
frequently set flower buds.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>I follow this schedule: In late February I step up watering to once a week.
As spring goes on and the plants show signs of new growth, I water more
frequently. Watch the plants. In August I find that new growth has slowed or
stopped on most plants, so the water ration is cut. I extend the time between
watering from 3 to 5 days, By early fall the growing season is over, and the
plants get water once a week. The next stage is the hardest for it seems cruel.
My plants get a good drink at the beginning of November. They get another one
around Thanksgiving. That's it. They won't see another drop until about
mid-January. Then in Late-February they get another drink, and the cycle begins
again.   </TT>
</P> 
<P>
<TT>Q)    What about light ? Cactus are survivors. Even in a north window some
plants will hang on for year after year. But desert cactus are basically light
lovers, by all means find a southern exposure for your plants.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Q)     How do I know what temperature they <B>need </B>? Many cactus can
take anything down to freezing. Generally, they're comfortable when we're
comfortable. However, if you want them to bloom, try to give them cooler
temperatures in winter, warmer temperatures are preferred at other times.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Q) What should I feed my cactus ? Cactus like well-drained soil, but this
doesn't mean poor soil. They appreciate nutrients. The key ingredient in their
diet is (P) phosphorus, the middle number given on most fertilizer bags. One
good organic source is bone meal . Go lightly on it.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Fertilize only during the season of active growth and then no more frequent
(N-P-K) than once a month. Also, use the fish/seaweed (4-4-1)</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>There are more than 9,000 cactus to choose from. The names are often
confusing, that can be frustrating to a serious amateur grower, but in truth
it's unimportant to the casual gardener. By any other name, a cactus is still a
cactus; and few plants can offer so much variety in shape, texture and bloom for
so little care.</TT>

<TITLE>The art of forcing bulbs</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY>
<P>
<TT>&quot; <U>It's Our Garden </U>&quot;</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><B>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>The Art Of Forcing Potted Bulbs Indoors</B></U></TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A good potting soil mix for starting bulbs is 1-part peat moss, 1-part
sand, 1-part perlite, and 1-part compost, with a good sprinkle of bone meal.
Daffodils have long heavy roots, so I use a clay pot 8-inches deep and 8 inches
across the top.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>A few don'ts' in potting&#183; Don't compact the soil; a thump on the table
will settle it, and the roots can penetrate better.
<U>Don't </U>twist bulbs into the soil or you may damage the basal plate from
which the roots emerge. <U>Don't </U>crowd too many bulbs into one container;
roots seeking room may heave the bulbs right up out of the soil. <U><B>Don't
</B></U>sprinkle newly-planted bulbs saturate them; this will be their last <B>water
for </B>many weeks.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>After labeling, store the pots in either a cold frame with the glass
removed or a trench deep enough so that they're covered at least one foot deep.
I used to slog through January snows to the cold frame near the garden Now I get
pots out of cold storage from a handy trench dug beside the garage I cover it
with a thick layer of pine needles, leaves, straw. As an extra precaution, I lay
a piece of window screening over all, weighting it down with a light layer of
soil to discourage mice and chipmunks, who like to nibble on tulips and
crocuses. I suppose bulbs could be stored in an unheated garage where the
temperature did not drop to freezing nor go above 50&#176;.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>When about 6-weeks have elapsed, remove the covering in trench or cold
frame to see if the smaller bulbs are rooted. If either a gentle tug or a yellow
sprout give evidence, they can be brought indoors. I begin to remove the large
bulbs early in January, leaving them in the cellar until the soil thaws. Next
they are moved upstairs to dim light for a day, then placed near a window, and
in another day or two put in direct sunlight. I check every couple of days to
make sure the soil is moist, but not soggy. I turn the pot frequently so growth
is symmetrical.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>In a couple of weeks the buds show color. I mist them with a sprayer to
substitute for the moist atmosphere of springtime. If you can't keep your living
area on the cool side, move the plants to the cellar at night to prolong flower
freshness. Hyacinth
<B>bloom </B>should be out of the neck of the bulb before you put it into
strong light. Otherwise it tends to blossom down in the crevice at the base of
the leaves instead of unfolding at the top of a nice sturdy stalk. Slip a cone
made of a twist of heavy paper over the bloom and you can coax it upward. When
you see the florets ready to unfold, remove the cone.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT><U><B>Note: </B></U>Dig up a few of those grape hyacinths from your
garden border for forcing, too. They may not do as well as fresh ones, but
there's little to lose and they may surprise you. I first learned these
miniature blue thimbles had a lovely fragrance when I grew them indoors. Scillas
and wood hyacinths force well too. '</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>Bulbs you want to save for planting outdoors will need water, sunlight and
a light feeding with fish and seaweed emulsion after their flowers have faded.
As the weather warms, they can be knocked from pots and set outside, or left to
ripen in the pot, dried off, then planted in the fall.</TT>
</P>
<P>
<TT>If you're a gardener like I am, one for whom spring never comes early
enough, try arranging your own private preview of the season by potting a few
bulbs for forcing.</TT>

<H1>Your Herb Garden / Getting Started</H1>
<P><B>       </B>The satisfaction of growing your own fresh herbs, which can
be used through the summer months and dried for winter use, is well worth the
small garden plot required. Where no garden plot is available, window boxes may
be sued for such herbs as chives, parsley, rosemary and basil.</P>
<P>For those who would like to try some of the more popular types there are the
pungent herbs: rosemary, sage and basil, dill, mint, sweet marjoram, tarragon
and thyme; or herbs especially good in blends: chervil, chives, parsley and
summer savory.</P>
<P>Seeds of the annual and perennial herbs are best planted in early March
inside flats of well-composted soil set in a greenhouse, cold frame, or even a
sunny window. They should be transplanted to your garden in May. Deep-soak the
transplants in a mixture of seaweed and liquid fish, and provide a mulch of
straw to hold moisture and stop weed growth.</P>
<P>Thin the seedlings after they have reached a height of about 3-inches,
leaving approximately the same space between plants. It is best to thin
seedlings in the late afternoon to reduce wilting of the remaining seedlings
caused by root disturbance. Thin again when the seedlings have developed more
abundant foliage and better root structure; space about 6-inches apart.</P>
<P>Here's a good idea, if you don't want to have all your herbs growing in one
location, is to scatter some of the taller plants, such as sage, in with the
flower garden for an interesting variation. Add lower, shrub-type herbs along
borders and rock gardens, interspersed with lavender, nasturtium and marigolds;
the first as food for the soul and the latter two for the stomach in salads
(petals of the flowers and leaves of nasturtiums).</P>
<P>Annual herbs may be grown with the vegetable garden. A few feet of  each of
the annuals or half a dozen plants of the perennial will supply enough herbs for
the average family.</P>
<P>The soil for planting should be prepared well in advance with compost. A
pound of bone meal to each 15 square feet should be added for best results with
perennials. A straw mulch is applied late in the fall will prevent winter injury
and will aid in starting early spring growth. Sage, rosemary and thyme require a
well-drained, moderately moist situation; parsley, chervil, and the mints give
best results on soils that retain considerable moisture but have good drainage.
</P>
<P>A few plants, such as sage, lemon balm and rosemary, can be propagated best
by stem cuttings. Stems from the latest growth or the upper part of the older
stems make the best cuttings and usually can be rooted easily late in summer or
early fall. With a sharp knife, the stems should be cut into 3 to 4-inch
sections, each containing a set of leaves or leaf buds near its upper end. The
terminal and the intermediate sections root equally well. The leaf area should
be reduced by about 2/3 by removing the larger leaves and allowing only the buds
and young leaves to remain on the upper 1/3 of the section. To prevent wilting,
the cuttings should be placed in water as soon as they are removed from the
plant.</P>
<P>A shallow box filled with 4 to 6-inches of clean sand and fitted with a
glass cover makes a good rooting bed. Insert the cuttings to a depth of 1/2 to
2/3 their length in the moist sand; pack firmly, and saturate the sand with
water. Cover with glass so that a 1/2 to 1-inch opening remains along one side
of the box for ventilation. Place the box in a protected, sunny place and keep
moist, but not wet, at all times. The cuttings should be protected from direct
sunlight by cheesecloth shades for the first week to prevent wilting. With good
care, roots should appear in about 2-weeks, and in 4 to 6-weeks the cuttings
will be ready to pot or to set in cold frames or in other places where they can
be protected during the winter. Early in spring the plants can be transplanted
to a permanent location. ,</P>

<P>(1)</P>
<P>Your Herb Garden / Growing And Caring For</P>
<P>Plants like thyme, winter savory and pot marjoram can be increased by simply
covering some of the side branches with soil and then, after rooting, cut from
the parent plant and set as new plants.</P>
<P>The mints spread rapidly by means of surface or underground runners that may
grow several feet from the parent plant. As new plants spring up, they can be
separated and replanted or left to spread in clumps.</P>
<P>The seeds, leaves, flowering tops, and sometimes the roots of the different
plants are used for flavoring purposes. The flavor of the herbs lasts longer if
they are dried and properly cured and stored. The young, tender leaves can be
gathered and used fresh at any time during the season, but for winter use they
should be harvested when the plants begin to flower and should be dried rapidly
in a well-ventilated, darkened room. If the leaves are dusty or gritty, wash
with cold water and drain thoroughly before drying.</P>
<P>The tender-leaf herbs; basil, rosemary, tarragon, lemon balm and the mints,
which have a high moisture content, must be dried rapidly away from the light if
they are to retain their green color. If dried too slowly they will turn dark or
mold. For this reason a well-ventilated, darkened room, such as an attic or
other dry, airy room, furnishes ideal conditions for curing these herbs in a
short time.</P>
<P>Harvesting of the seed crop is done when mature or when their color changes
from green to brown or gray. After curing for several days in an airy room, a
day or two in the sun before storing will insure safekeeping.</P>
<P>As soon as the herb leaves or seeds are dry they should be cleaned by
separating them from stems and other foreign matter and packed in suitable
containers to prevent loss of the essential oils that give them teir delicate
flavor.</P>
<P>Basil: Plant seeds early in spring 3-feet apart, 12 to 15 to the foot, and
cover to a depth of 1/2-inch. Thinning the plants is not necessary; grorth is
quite rapid and when plants begin to flower cut 6 to 8-inches above ground to
provide for drying. Bring some plants into the house before the first frost,
which will kill them, and cut back to the first leaves above the base of its
stem for potting. The soil for these potted plants should be much richer than
the soil outdoors. A mixture of 2/3 humus and 1/3 sand should be just about
right. The soil in the pots should be just barely moist. If the plants leaves
seem parched and crumble, the air may be too dry, or the artificial sunlight too
close to the foliage. Spray liquid organic fertilizer (seaweed / fish mixture)
once every 3-weeks to promote healthy indoor growth. Bring the plants indoors by
stages, over a period of time. Transplant the herbs from your garden into
individual pots; then keep them outdoors during daylight hours and bring them in
at night.</P>
<P><B>Rosemary: </B>This is a small, perennial evergreen shrub of the mint
family which rarely produces seed, so that it will be necessary to obtain plants
or rooted cuttings to start. One or 2-plants will supply enough leaves for
flavoring purposes. It produces a dense shrub 2-feet in diameter and about
3-feet in height by the end of the second season of growth.</P>
<P><B>Sage: </B>A shrubby perennial herb of the mint family, growing to a
height of about 2-feet. Seeds may be planted in a cold fram or window box, or
the plant can be propagated by stem cuttings.</P>
<P><B>Tarragon: </B>Anise-scented perennial, which rarely forms seeds, but the
plant is easily grown by root or crown divisions. The leafy top growth can b~
cut back several times during the season. The leaves and tops should be driec!
rapidly away from light; otherwise they will turn dark.</P>
<P>Remember, that dried herbs are 4 to 5-times stronger than fresh herbs. The
delicate aroma and flavor of savory herbs may easily be lost by extended
cooking, cutting the leaves of the fresh herbs too fine or grinding them in a
mortar which exposes the aromatic oils.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Do you feed your trees ?</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><B>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot;</B></P>
<P><B>    By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<H1> Do You Feed Your Tree's ?</H1>
<P>Trees should be fed just like your vegetable-producing and ornamental
plants, and fall-early-winter is the time to do this. It doesn't matter what
kind of trees you have; nut, fruit-bearing, evergreen or deciduous ornamentals,
get out your soil amendments: cottonseed meal, granite dust, kelp meal, fish
meal, bone meal, compost and rock phosphate, make up your own organic fertilizer
or buy a all put together balanced blended organic fertilizer like. 4-6-4, 3-8-3
or 7-7-7, and start feeding your trees.</P>
<P>Now, some people bring up the argument that most trees appear to do very
well in the forest, although they obviously are not fed by anyone. Trees growing
on your grounds, in your landscape are growing in a artificial environment, and
it's up to you to make them feel at home by creating the condition which they
have been used for a hundred-thousand years. There's no turf or grass in the
forest, only the forest floor, rich in decayed leaves and organic litter. But
you've probably got a healthy, vigorous lawn over your tree's root systems to
rob them of the water and nutrients they need. And, like a good organic
gardener, you probably haul away their leaves to the compost pile, or you spread
them around your smaller plants.</P>
<P>That's what your trees are up against, loss of the growing conditions they
require in order to flourish in a healthy state, plus competition from plants
that normally do not grow in the forest. But, admittedly, trees and turf look
well together on your home grounds, so it's up to you to keep them both happy
and well, by giving them what they need. Forget the forest primeval myth, it
just doesn't exist on your well-manicured, man-conditioned home grounds.
Instead, start feeding your trees and giving them the nutriment they lack.</P>
<P>Mostly it's a matter of placing the organic fertilizers where the roots can
reach and absorb them. Since a tree's root system can't reach out for nutrients
quickly and efficiently like a vegetable or flowering plant, you've got to help
the tree.</P>
<P>Nutrients are absorbed by smallest roots. The feeding roots usually occupy
the outer band of a circular area whose circumference lies just beyond the
spread of the outermost branches. The width of this band is equal to about 2/3
of the radius of the circle. With most trees, few feeding roots lie within the
center 1/3 of the circle. A rule-of-thumb method for determining the region in
which most of the roots occur is, as follow- the radical spread of the roots in
feet is equal to the diameter of the tree (one-foot above the soil) in inches.
</P>
<P>For example, a tree whose diameter one foot above the ground is 9-inches,
will have most' of its roots within a 9-foot radius and its feeding roots in the
outer 6-foot-wide band.</P>
<P>My method of feeding a tree calls for making holes in the sod or turf and
then placing the organic fertilizer in the holes 18-inches down, close to the
tree's feeder roots.</P>
<P>I believe that broadcasting fertilizer to trees, except the shallow-rooted
evergreens, is a waste of time and money, a fine way to grow grass, weeds,
shrubs and unwanted tree seedlings. By thickening the turf, surface fertilizing
also tends to lessen the tree roots water and air supply. The usual professional
method of tree feeding is to thrust food down to where the roots run, or even
lower to attract roots downward, and improve their grip on the ground.</P>
<P>I punch 18-inch holes into the soil under the drip-line, spacing them at
2-foot intervals, and working with a 3-foot pipe, or crow-bar. When the tree is
large, a series of holes is tapped, and filled with such organic nutrients as:
rock phosphate, fish and kelp meal, and then pluged with compost. This method
may sound strenuous, but it will bring the kind of results you want.</P>
<P>By now, it should be pretty obvious that you owe it to your trees, to feed
them the right way. I think the deep-root-feeding program is perhaps the best
for the reasons given. Its up to you to create growing conditions around your
trees that are similar to those prevailing in the forest.</P>
<P>Tree feeding is important. Besides fall-early-winter root-feeding, there is
foliar spraying at 3-week intervals with micro-nutrient (fish/seaweed mix)
through the growing season.</P>
<P>Mulching with straw, pine needles or leaves is also a recommended fall
practice, particularly with evergreens. Such mulches prevent wide fluctuation in
soil temperature and help the soil hold moisture. The mulch can be left on all
winter, and then worked into the soil in the spring.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Fuchsias </TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><B>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<P>&quot;It's Our Garden&quot; <B>Growing Fuchsias Indoors And Out</B></P>
<P>Fuchsias, are tender shrubs that bloom bountifully throughout the summer but
succumb to frost in the fall. After the first frost, I cover the flower box with
an inch of soil, then mound straw over it.</P>
<P>In early spring, I carefully lift the straw here and there along the row
checking the progress of the new life coming up from the roots. Then I careful
replace it, leaving it until all danger of frost is over.</P>
<P>At that time I remove the straw, all but the partially decayed layer on 'the
bottom. About June 1st, when the flower buds are heavy, I go down the row.
scattering 2-inches of compost.</P>
<P>Here, at Spring Meadow we have a bright, unheated room where fuchsias live
happily through the winter. Once a week t take the plants to the sink and wash
all their leaves, front and back, and let it drain and dry there before I take
them back to their place in the sun. To this weekly dunking, I attribute the
fact that I've never found any sign of insect life on my indoor fuchsia.</P>
<P>Nothing is easier to propagate than a fuchsia. Just break off 3 or 4-inch of
stem, take off the leaves that would be under the soil, and plant,  in sand. I
like to cover my cuttings with a plastic bag turned upside-down over it to keep
the sand moist. Leave it in a bright place, but out of direct sunlight, and
within 10 to 14-days you'll have little plants.</P>
<P>I use a potting mixture consisting of equal amounts of peat moss, perlite
compost, and sand. You'll find, that these flowers like their soil quite acid.
</P>
<P>Fuchsias are not bright-sun flowers, but neither do they like deep shade. I
grow mine successfully in hanging baskets on my south porch where they have all
the sun there is until about noon, and after that open shade for the rest of the
day.</P>
<P>To my thinking, fuchsias and geraniums should grow together. Both like rich,
porous soil, both grow luxuriantly throughout a long season, and get along with
a minimum of fussing. Even colorwise they go together, for they both come in
rich, bold shades and soft pastels. And, since both can be grown as potted
plants, and usually are, you can change the pots around until you get the color
combination that pleases you, then leave it for a summer of undemanding beauty.
</P>
<P>At the end of the season I bring in my potted fuchsias, cut them back to 2
or 3-inches on each branch, and store them in a cool room. They don't need
anything through the winter but to be dampened slightly from time to time, just
enough to keep their wood from becoming brittle. Sometime in February I repot
them in rich soil, water well, and put them where it's bright and cool.</P>
<P>They grow quickly and soon give me all the cuttings I need for my summer
stock</P>
<P>For winter blooming it is a good idea to take your cuttings in late-July or
August. When rooted I pot them firmly and set them back a little from the glass
in a sunny window, for the August sun can be very bright. Now there is nothing
left to do but to nip each branch until the plants assumes the proportions of a
butterball.</P>
<P>As soon as your plants shows roots at the drainage hole, repot two sizes
larger. If the place where it stands tends to become dry and hot, mist the
plants every day with a sprayer.</P>
<P>Have you ever tried to make a fuchsia tree ? Fuchsias grow so quickly that
you can have a nice one in short order. For these I use rooted cuttings, coaxing
them along by changing them from one pot to another as their roots grow Tie the
main stem to a stick about 4-feet tall, pinching off all the side branches.
Don't remove the leaves along this main stem; your plants needs them for it's
growth.</P>
<P>When you have your tree as tall as you like it, pinch the tip to induce
branching. Then pinch these branches after they've grown a few inches. Soon you
will have a nice bushy head that will cover itself with flowers.</P>
<P>I like to make two of these trees, putting them on either side of the walk
for bright accents above the other flowers.</P>
<P>So, - would you have the plants that seeds to delight in being alive, grows
like a teenagers, and blossoms all over itself ? Then, grow fuchsias ' You, the
butterflies and the hummingbirds will all be delighted.</P>

<P>&quot;The <B>Natural Family&quot;</B></P>
<P>IN a sense we all belong to an natural family. Its members include not only
our immediate relatives, but also the plants we eat, the animals that support
us, and the soil that feeds everyone.</P>
<P>Yes, the soil that feeds us, that's something we should all think about
these days, when ever you turn around you hear about this farm or that, thats
been sold because of poor farming methods and now their building condos, houses,
or mini-malls. Sure people have to have a place to live, but without food there
is no life. 80% of all food consimed here on Long Island is trucked in, if for
some reason it stoped being trucked in what are you going to do for food ? Eat a
condo ?</P> 
<P>People are suddenly realizing that the traditional family is slowly
disintegrating, its members eating on the run, parents living separstely, and
children banding together in new associations. To a member of a non-natural
family, potatoes come in the form of a white powder packed in a cardboard box.
Milk comes from containers, and soup from envelopes. It's a plastic world ?</P>
<P>In a truly natural situation, many different plant and animals grow
together. Each organism complements the other in some way. Tall plants provide
the shade which small plants need. Weeds send their roots deep into the subsoil
to bring up minerals into their leaves. When the leaves fall those minerals feed
the shallow rooted plants. Animals eat certain plants, dropping manure which
becomes the natural fertilizer for other plants. Even when plants and animals
crowd each other out, they are serving constructively the order and balance of
Nature.</P>
<P>Of course, Nature can't be left alone to balance itself out if we are going
to have the high production of farms and gardens, and are going to allow some
people to live in cities while others live and work on farms. But the so-called
modern commercial, chemicalized farm tears apart the natural family and disrupts
the balance of Nature far more then is necessary or desirable. Food of better
quality could be produced more cheaply if the Natural family were treated with
respect.</P>
<P>The chemical farmer put toxic chemicals on their land to kill all but the
one type of plant he wants to grow. Then they grow that same plant year after
year in the same field, without rotating crops to give the soil a chance to rest
or regenerate itself. Whenever an insect comes on the scene or some other
problem arises, more toxic chemicals are brought out to blast the offender.</P>
<P>Many chemical farmers don't even eat the crops they grow. Wheat growers buy
bread at the store, and cattleman eat hot dogs. Natural people are different.
They look on their farms and gardens as part of a natural system, of which they
themseleves are a part. They want a good harvest, not only to sell but to eat.
Natural people also want the natural system to keep functioning. They observe
and try to understand the web of life that Nature weaves, and put to practical
use the lessons they learn. As a result they have themselves a healthier and
happier family.</P>
<P>Many years ago, I had this dream, or you could say a nightmare about my Son,
Zeb, who was only 3 years old at the time. In this dream my Son Zeb was a very
old man. Sitting on his knee was his Great Grand son.</P>
<P>And as the vivion started to faid away, I heard the boy say, &quot;Great
Grand Paw Zeb, What is a Tree ? Did we ever have one here on Earth ?&quot; &quot;Were
there really things call fish that lived in Oceans and Rivers? And where are all
the rivers now? and did people really drink water that came out of the Earth ?&quot;
   &quot;PEOPLE !!!But why didn't their care ?&quot;</P>

<BODY>
<P> Our Garden&quot;</P>
<P>PART 1</P>
<P>The Little Garden That Could</P>
<P>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</P>
<P>A little garden is the best education that I know.</P>
<P>Each plant is just a few feet from all the others, so you notice things
you'd overlook in a large garden. When something goes wrong, you realize it from
the start, look for the cause, then take action.</P>
<P>The little garden can be beautiful. Put to work, every square inch is
fruitfully productive. Never pull out a vegetable without planting a couple of
seeds in its place, If enough growing season remains. Always count on the
weather being with you. You lose little if it isn't; and a long shot sometime
pays off, giving you besides food, that comforting feeling that your judgment is
pretty good, after all.</P>
<P>In your little garden, the greatest problem may be shade. Raise a
light-loving plant a foot or two above the others and in some cases you'll
double the light it receives. You can do that by planting it in a bottomless box
set on top of the soil.</P>
<P>Corn is not impossible in a small garden. True, the leaves should touch for
pollination, but they will when planted in triangles of three. Quite a few of
these triangles can be wedged in here and there for a vegetable that must be
fresh to be real.</P>
<P>The best of all vegetables, asparagus, admittedly is a space-taker. But it
makes such a lovely background for the summer flowers and vegetables that I slip
one in wherever there are a few inches to spare. Give it room in your little
garden if only to have a crop when other vegetables are scarce.</P> 
<P>A small-space gardener necessarily becomes resourceful. I put 2-orange
crates full of everbearing strawberries on the toolhouse roof. I used large
plants, half a dozen to each box, Anchoring the boxes firmly first, then
carrying up rich soil to fill them. This was real inspiration, for they had day
long sunshine up there where deprived of their runners and fed liquid seaweed
and fish mix at 10-day intervals. Strawberries are gluttons, but given organic
fertilizer and water in sufficient quantities, along with unlimited light, they
were very obliging about production.</P>
<P>Another good space-saving method is to alternate garden rows and walking
rows each year, the growing rows one year becoming the walking rows the next.
The walking space is covered with mulch whixh is turned under in the fall, and
again covered with hay, straw, grass clippings and ground-up leaves. This is
turned under early the next spring, and you have rich, spongy soil all ready to
receive the seeds. When your plants are from 2 to 4-inches tall,it's time to
start the process of tucking mulch around them.</P> 
<P>You can compensate for lack of space by putting your garden to work early
and late. Do you like early lettuce ? Plant a row earlier than you'd think
lettuce could grow at all. Cover it with greenhouse plastic over strong wire
hoops, both ends of which are driven into the ground to form a series of arcs,
about 12-inches apart. Hold the plastic down with rocks at each sid or, if you
have them, a couple of 2-by-4s. I have planted lettuce in February under these
mini-greenhouse tunnels, and have had them do well.</P>
<P>Start in mid-September with another row; the protection to be put on when
the first real frost threatens. You'll find yourself enjoying salad greens more
months than you'd dreamed possible.</P>
<P>An advantage to this early and late gardening is that you can choose, from
the entire garden, the space your row is to occupy. I recommend a southern
exposure against a protecting wall.</P>
<P>The flowers in a little garden should be the ones that make a long-lasts'
picture. Tuberous begonias are easy. Pansies in rich soil in a semi-shaded
corner are beautiful. Sweet peas sharing the fence with garden peas, tomatoes
and cucumbers are gratifying. I always sow my sweet peas in late fall, and lay a
couple of inches of straw mulch over the row.</P>

<BODY>
<P><B>&quot; IT&quot;S OUR GARDEN &quot; PART 2</B></P>
<P>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</P>
<P><B>The Little Garden That Could</B></P>
<P>It is in the little garden that the potted plants truly come into their own.
When you lift a plant up above the others, you not only give it air and sun, but
you highlight it. Without sacrificing an inch of precious room, you can present
a notable picture. Fuchsias are beautiful anywhere, but put them in a hanging
basket against a white wall and the effect is breathtaking.</P>
<P>Having space limitations started me growing tomatoes in large cans and
buckets. A 5-gallon container with drainage holes filled with rich soil will
hold a well-trained and pruned tomato plant through its whole bearing period. It
has always seemed regrettable to me that we should grow tomatoes into rich
bearing plants only to have them destroyed when they reach their peak
performance. Find a reasonably bright, cool place inside for these container and
you can stretch your tomato season right through the winter. Start these
winter-into-spring tomatoes later than the others, but have them bearing when
you take them into the house.</P>
<P>Treat the 3-Brussels sprouts you start in a 5-gallon container the same way.
They should have a good nipping frost before they are brought in. Their need for
sun is much less than that of the tomatoes, and they can be grown in a place
that is all but frigid. Three healthy plants will give the average family all
the Brussels sprouts they want throughout the winter.</P>
<P>Ok, with little space, we make a little garden. But when space is your
problem, where do you put your compost pile? So, make your worst problem and
turn it into your chief asset. It seems that garbage accumulates quickly So I
bought a large wooden box, knocked out its bottom and made a close-fitting,
easily removable top for it. I dug a large hole, and fitted my box over it.
Then, I ordered a thousand earth-worms as my disposal unit.</P>
<P>They fell on all that garbage, literally and figuratively. I added a layer
of soil from time to time, and a little sprinkling of water as I put in the food
scrapes, and covered it all with the box top.</P>
<P>When my worm composting box was filled, I used an other bottomless box over
another hole. By the time that was full, the first box was emptied, for
earthworms work with speed and enthusiasm. Even in winter, business went on as
usual in these mini-compost factories. This compost is a rich plant food that
will gradually rebuild your garden into a little paradise.</P>
<P>I found other sources of wealth. Pine needles are an ideal mulch for
alkaline soil, at once holding in the scarce water, and, decaying, helping to
bring down the high pH to an acceptable level. I hesitated to put raw sawdust on
my s0il at first, fearing that when it started to decay it would use up the
nitrogen there was in the soil. Then it occurred to me to mix it with my
garbage-earthworm-compost, and nothing could have been more satisfactory in
appearance as well as performance.</P>
<P>Once, right in the center of one of my little gardens I put a pool. I sunk
an old wooden tub into the ground, and felt that I was being very extravagant
with space, to bring a little patch of blue sky into the scene. However, I made
that tub pay for itself in utility as well as beauty by growing a summer-long
supply of watercress in it.</P>
<P>Did you know that it's a simple matter to root watercress from the bunch you
buy at the market ? Clip off an. inch or two of each stem, and stick the
branches into a bowl that has enough sand in the bottom to hold them upright.
Fill the bowl with water and put it on your windowsill.</P>
<P>Mist the cress with clear water every day. Repeat this process in late fall,
taking the cress from your pool, and you'll have a supply in the house after
frost and ice have put an end to that outdoors.</P>
<P>Don't feel that you must deprive yourself of fruit trees, even in the little
garden. Buy a self-pollinating tree so that you don't need two.</P>
<P>Dwarf trees take very little space and bear beautifully. Or you may want to
investigate the possibility of espaliering a tree. Both espaliered and dwarf
trees can be covered on frosty nights, as a full-sized tree cannot, and often a
crop can be saved by protecting blooms or fruit from freezing.</P>

<BODY>
<P> &quot;IT'S OUR GARDEN&quot;                    By Elizabeth and Crow Miller
</P>
<P>., '                               (1)</P>
<P>Planters And Container Gardening - Imagination Plus Organics</P>
<P>Confidentially, I've always been a window box fan. I love to see bright
boxes of gaily colored geraniums and ivy gracing the fronts of houses I pass.
But until recently, I never realized the vast, practically unlimited
possibilities of organic gardening in containers.</P>
<P>In container gardening, I must stress, must be strictly organic.</P>
<P>Your soil must be rich, and it must not pack. Equal parts of soil, sand and
humus material; compost, leaf mold, peat moss or the like, plus generous amounts
of composted horse manure and bone meal, make a wonderfully fertile, porous
soil. I work on the theory that the more tightly crowded a container is with
plants, the better they thrive and bloom, provided the soil is right.</P>
<P>I recommend mulching all plants grown in containers, using semi-finished
compost, peat moss or coco shells for most plants, pine needles or oak leaf mold
for acid lovers. Once the organic end of my project is taken care of,</P>
<P>I give my imagination free rein in thinking up decorative uses for planters.
Window boxes don't have to be restricted to just windows! A front porch, for
example, instead of having a wooden railing, can have a continuous row of plant
boxes.</P>
<P>In choosing plants, I like to have at least two colors in each planter,
preferably in varying tints. Light and dark blue or red with white is very
attractive. Or I contrast brilliant yellow and red with bright blue and white.
</P>
<P>In a box or container that is viewed from one side only, I put the taller
plants in the rear, lower ones in front of these, and let trailing plants
cascade over the rim. Boxes that are seen from two or more sides should have the
tallest plants in the center. In large boxes, it's best to intermix tall and
medium-height plants so you don't get a step effect.</P>
<P>Selecting the plants themselves is easy. In consulting your flower seed
catalogs, there are 4-things to consider- color, season of bloom, height and
exposure. In shady northern exposures, I favor tuberous begonias, browallia,
fuchsias, gloxinias, impatiens, caladiums, crotons, ferns, torenias, balsam,
forget-me-nots and abutilon. Partly shaded or east or west locations that miss
the hot midday sun are planted to lobelias, wax begonias, fancy-leaved caladiums
and impatiens.</P> 
<P>Hundreds of plants will thrive in containers receiving full sun. I often
combine pansies and geraniums, blue ageratums and white petunias, or for a red
and gold blend, marigolds and lantanas. Miniature roses, dwarf zinnias, pompon
dahlias, primroses, snapdragon, sweet alyssum and calendulas are some of my
other favorites.</P>
<P>Careful study of your seed catalogs will enable you to map out a plan for
3-season beauty. In spring, you can have bulbs, cineraria, pansies, primroses,
English daisies and azaleas. For summer, the annuals offer unlimited choices.
Fall inspires a combination like coleus, and mums.</P>
<P>Don't forget you can grow many of your organic vegetables in containers and
planters, chard, lettuce, beets, spinach and many greens do well in containers.
Herbs are very easy to grow in planters. Strawberries do fine in tubs, barrels,
boxes or pyramids. And of course there window box tomatoes and other miniatures
especially suited to container growth.</P>
<P>The biggest trick is to keep a supply of plants growing to blooming size in
a suitable spot in your backyard. This takes careful planning, but it will give
you spectacular color from crocus time until frost. Many plants may be grown in
pots and set in soil, damp peat, or sphagnum moss.</P>
<P>Planter and container gardening, is truly an art. But it is an art well
worth learning. The range of plant material is endless, indeed. Many plants seem
to show up to much better advantage growing in containers than they do in the
garden.</P>
<P>This method of organic gardening can be practiced anywhere, on a porch,
window sill, terrace or city roof top. And best of all, with planter and
container gardening, you don't have to spend a fortune on your home to make it a
beautiful and happy place.</P>

<BODY>
<P><B>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot;</B></P>
<P><B> By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<P><B>Landscaping Guidance For The Organic Homeowner</B></P>
<P>There are many homeowners who are unfamiliar with plants and trees, but take
great pride in their homes here on Long Island. When flowering trees blossom in
the spring they take notice and learn names, then try to buy one for their yard.
</P>
<P>Now, the trouble comes when these plants, shrubs and trees get to be a yard
full without a pattern, like a room full of cluttered furniture. It is better to
have some sort of plan in mind so that as things are added one by one they will
total up to an attractively planted home and yard.</P>
<P>The planting around the home is as important to the beauty of the home as
color and feeling and artistic technique are to the beauty of a painting.
Planting around the home can get out of balance in the course of time. Yearly
pruning helps. Actually, though, a lot of trouble can be avoided in the first
place by using evergreens with the right growth habits for the locations where
they are to be used.</P>
<P>Why do we use evergreens so much for foundation plantings</P>
<P>Well, shrubbery that sheds its leaves (deciduous) often appears dull and
unappealing in winter if planted right next to the house, for the ugly
foundation will show right through the leafless shrubs. On the other hand,
evergreens are green the year round and even in the dull of winter will decorate
and improve the looks of your home.</P>
<P>It is best not to clutter up your front lawn with too many shade or
flowering trees unless you have a large yard and feel a real need for them. Most
front yards will benefit, though, by one lone eye-catcher flowering, berrying or
unusual foliage-type tree. This tree should be your absolute favorite of
favorites. Dwarf, semi-dwarf or slow-growing types are often best for this spot,
especially in small yards. Quite often .used are white or pink dogwood, Japanese
red maple, weeping Japanese cherry, flowering crabapple or red-berried holly.
</P>
<P>This, your special tree, often looks attractive on the street side of the
front walk about halfway between the front door and the driveway, out in the
lawn far enough to allow for growth without crowding the path. The object is to
place the eye-catcher tree where you will see and enjoy it looking out the front
door, walking the front path and coming in the driveway.</P>
<P>If you have young children it is often wise to leave the foundation planting
incomplete at the back of your house. Sometimes a flower bed can be made along
the foundation and though it may get battered a bit, it will be cheerful.</P>
<P>A rose trellis or a vine or two are nice along the house at the back, too.
</P>
<P>Everyone should have a fast-growing shade tree or two in the back yard. Do
plant your shade tree where it is handy for you to sit under and where you can
see the youngsters when they are climbing. Buy a big enough tree (10-feet) so
that you do not have to wait too many years to use it. Most shade trees planted
in toddler years are good for climbing during the grammar-school years. Weeping
willows are quite fast-growing and climb well.</P>
<P>The back yard is a wonderful place to plant your favorite flowering tree
here and there along the fence or property line is often attractive.</P>
<P>The back yard's the place for fruit trees and for vegetable and flower
garden laid out in rows, too.</P>
<P>After you learn the more basic evergreens and flowering trees of your area
you will automatically begin to hunt for different or unusual things to fill
blank spaces about the home and yard.</P>
<P>For example, did you know that red cedar is really a juniper and that our
cedar chests are really juniper chests ? The white cedar from which fences and
lawn furniture are made is also masquerading, for it is really, an arborvitae.
</P>
<P>Doing your own home landscaping is a lot of fun and very rewarding. it gives
you adventure, education, beautifies your home, and the exercise is good, too.

<BODY>
<P>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller &quot; The His and Hers of Gardening&quot;</P>
<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot;</P>
<H1>Gardening Planning Starts By Asking </H1>
<H1>Questions</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Q) How did last years gardening season go ? Q) Were there gaps
in the production of vegetables you count on ? Q) Did you manage to have lettuce
early and late, and how about the tomatoes that go with it ? Q) What insects and
diseases gave you problems, and what biological controls you need to order now
to be ready when their cycles comes around again ? Q) Did you plant succession
crops ? </P>
<P>This year draw three garden plans; showing the early, mid-season and late
(fall) planting patterns. You'll see at a glance what room you'll have in August
for all the winter kale and leeks. Q) Did you overplant zucchini, and underplant
the good keepers in the squash family ? Q) Did you have enough mulch ? Q) The
soil itself, did you manage to sneak in a cover crop of Buckwheat, oats, or
winter rye ? Q) Can you manage an extra compost spreading for that patch of
heavy clay ? Q) Where did you find soil filth improving, earthworms
proliferating ?</P>
<P>If you keep a garden/record note book, and you should, you'll he for it now.
It aid's your planning; you'll have records of planting dates, periods when
certain insects appeared, blossom and harvest dates, amounts stored, reminders
of tasks that need doing next growing season.</P>
<P>After jotting it all down, a pattern begins to take shape. You can see where
you want to make changes in this years garden; Grow pole beans for their greater
productivity in limited space, (Vertical Gardening) put in more beets and
turnips for winter use, grow more of the long-keeping winter squash, find more
soil-building materials to till into your garden. (Compost, Fish Meal,
Greensand, Bone Meal, Kelp Meal, Feather Meal these are some of organic
soil-amendments you can use to build better soil)</P>
<P>Now go over those juicy new seed catalogs. Q) What new varieties seem
irresistible to try ? Q) Have you overlooked some high-vitamin, or
insect/disease resistant strain ? In choosing seed; 1) look for flavor, 2) food
value, 3) good yield, 4) resistance to pests and disorders. To keep your garden
producing all season, select crops especially for spring, summer and fall.</P>
<P>With this list in hand, decide what to plant in each garden row or bed.
Shuffle through many versions of your plan, taking into consideration companion
planting, succession crops, and rotation of heavy feeders. </P>
<P>Getting plans down on paper helps you group early crops, crops that remain
in place all season, crops that finish with the first frost, so that you can
plant a whole area of the garden to a cover crop in early fall, rather than just
a row, or bed at a time. Your plan may change as the season wears on, but it
remains a helpful guide.</P>
<P>Remember, that radishes, garlic and aromatic herbs are used for garden
insect control as well, as for food. Now is the time to line up baskets,
bottomless jugs, coffee cans and other seedling protectors, and to make, or
repair flats as needed.</P>
<P>Planning your garden on paper is not a fussy thing to do. It is the key to
gardening success and abundant vegetables when you want them. You don't really
want all the corn, beans and tomatoes ready to can, or freeze at the same time,
now do you ?</P>

<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; <B>By_Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<H1>When You Plan Your Garden, Here's Some Things To </H1>
<H1>Know</H1>
<P><B>     </B>When you choose a garden site, look for one that is well
drained. If the only spot available to you is one where water puddles after a
rain, you could forget about digging up that low-lying wet spot and build raised
beds right on top of it, instead. Obtain some loose, dry topsoil and mix it with
compost, leaves, aged manure and any other organic material you can find to form
a 24-inch high raised beds,. The organic material will form moisture-holding
humus in the soil and the loose structure will permit good drainage.</P>
<P>Less is more may be true in our garden. The problem here seems to be that
some of us lack confidence. Some, empty a whole packet of seeds in a small
space, thinking that at least some of then will grow. But all too often most of
them grow, and, in their search for air and light, that develo tall, weak stems
that never fully recover even after we've thinned the surplus seedlings. There
are some plants, like peas and parsnips, that should be seeded rather thickly,
but most others are habitually over crowded Consult a good gardening book (&quot;Let's
Get Growing&quot; By Crow Miller, it covers everything you need to know to be a
master gardener, oh, yes) or read the seed catalogs to determine recommended
seed spacing.</P>
<P>Seeds have within them everything they need to grow, except moisture and
warmth. But, if you pile 4-inches of soil over them, though, they are
overwhelmed. The soil is heavy and cold and often damp enough to rot off the
emerging leaf bud before it can break the surface. Be kind to your seeds. Cover
them with soil to a depth no more than 2-times their size.</P>
<P>Of the 50 or so garden vegetables available for planting, only a few may be
planted extra early. Some, in their enthusiasm, tend to go overboard on these
few because they've waited so long for a chance to plant something. So they
plant several great long rows of radishes and leaf lettuce, only to find, after
a little while, that they've got more than they can use and the extras are going
to seed. A good <B>solution </B>to this problem, is to plant a single row or
small bed of these early vegetables, and to keep replanting them every 2 or 3
weeks in small amounts. Thus, for the same amount of seed and space, but a
continuous harvest through fall.</P>
<P>Mulch is great, but there are two ways to misuse it. One is to mulch
heat-loving plants too early in the season, before the soil warms up. Mulch
smothers weeds, but it's also a good insulator. Cantaloupes, tomatoes, </P>
<P>sweet potatoes, watermelons, peppers and egg plants will produce better if
mulched.</P>
<P>Another mistake is to put down too little mulch. It looks good for a few
weeks, but then weeds poke through, and they must be hand pulled, for there's
just enough mulch covering the ground to make hoeing impossible. Insufficient
mulch gives your plants much less drought protection.</P>
<P>How much is enough ? Well, maybe this will give you an idea: Sawdust; 2 to
3-inches / Shredded leaves; 8 to 10-inches / Straw; 5 to 7-inches / Newspaper; 4
to 7-inches / and Grass Clippings; 5-inches when you first spread them.</P>
<P>Watering the garden every evening after dinner can be good therapy for the
gardener, but it's not good for the plants. When the soil is often sprinkled on
top but never deeply soaked, plant roots tend to remain in the damp, upper few
inches of soil where they are vulnerable to searing mid-summer heat and drought.
Vegetable plants need an average of 2-inches of water a week. Be sure to water
thoroughly so the soil is soaked to a depth of 4 to 6-inches. This will
encourage roots to grow deep.</P>

<P>&quot;IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</P>
<H1> Organic Gardening A </H1>
<H1>Life-Expanding Experience</H1>
<P><B>     </B>There are as many reasons for gardening, as there are gardens
and gardeners. In a way, that's what gardening is all about, a search for
something better. Some of us garden because we're not entirely satisfied by our
contacts with Nature in our daily lives. Too often we lose touch with the many
forms of life around us. So we garden and expand our arena of life.</P>
<P>In gardens we plant the seed of diversity and make room around us for
plants, animals, insects, and even micro-organisms (soil life). they become what
clay is to a sculptor, raw material that we shape to enrich life. We no longer
have to be satisfied with food from a can, or farms seen through a windshield.
And we play a role in the system of Nature.</P>
<P>Gardening is becoming ever more popular because life's variety is steadily
diminishing. In earlier times our ancestors ate hundreds of different kinds of
food.</P>
<P>Today over 80% of all food comes from fewer than a dozen kinds of plants.
Corn, wheat and rice alone accounts for 75% of all human grain consumption. The
boxes and cans that line supermarket shelves don't represent a true diversity of
food. What they hold are combinations of only a few ingredients, labeled and
packaged to simulate variety.</P>
<P>Why should we strive to regain the multitude of choices that our ancestors
had ? The sheer plasure of variety is a good enough reason for many of us. But
did you ever think of the security you gain when you multiply the kinds of
plants you grow ? If one plant fails, another kind takes its place. <B>Remember:
&quot; The frost that kills a pepper plant serves to sweeten the kale.&quot;
</B>Diversity in our gardens encourages <B>synergism; the ability of different
plants to help each other, rather than competition. Example: </B>A deep-rooted
plant can tap nutrients deep in the soil and bring them closer to the surface
where shallow-rooted plants can get them.</P>
<P>A garden with many different plants uses the sun's energy more efficiently.
The green leaf with its power of photosynthesis is the most powerful of all
solar collectors. So it pays to keep the garden covered with thriving plants for
the greatest possible part of the year, rather than wasting the sun's energy on
bare Earth.</P>
<P>There's more to be done than ordering seeds of different types. You have to
lay a foundation. Here are a few steps which are important </P>
<P>to life-expansion in the garden: 1) Improve your soil. A soil rich in 
organic matter is alive (Micro-organisms) and can support more plant  life. If
you expect your garden to withstand the stress of expansion, you  have to
provide it with a solid foundation. 2) Don't spray chemical  poisons. Poisons
kill more than pests. It wipes out helpful insects, it  gets in our ground
water, and then in our children. Also, a recent study  shows that pesticides
reduce the yield of some vegetables. Use biological  controls, and you are
encouraging different life forms. 3) Extend your  garden season. Cold is usually
the limiting factor. Stretch the year by  learning to protect the plants from
the cold with mulches, cloches and  other season-extending devices. And by
growing plants that resist the  frost 4) Finally, be a life-saver. Seeds are
life in small packages.  There is no substitute for the life-preservation work
of gardeners who  grow special, local varieties and save the seed year after
year. It's the  best way to preserve the existing diversity that is so important
for the  protection of our food system over the years and centuries ahead. Many
of  those old reliable varieties are already disappearing, pushed out of seed 
catalogs by hybrids, bred for color, shape or shipability, rather than  flavor.
The best way to insure the availability of your favorites every  spring is to
save them yourself.</P>
<P>Organic gardening is more than just digging, planting, pulling  weeds and
picking fruits and vegetables. It is also the savoring and  cultivation of life

<P>IT'S OUR GARDEN I' <B>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<H1>Creating Balance And Multi-Purpose Gardens</H1>
<P><B>     </B>The longer we garden, the more we come to believe in making
Spring Meadow Farm into a well designed, with multi-purpose gardens which some
how reflects the whole of Nature's wonderful pattern of interrelationships.</P>
<P>Over 25 years of-being an organic farmer has seemed to open my eyes to more
and more of the ways that all plants, insects, birds and animals live together
in their habitat, and each phase in my farming life has given me new ways of
making our garden beds serve several purposes. We have moved through phases of
emphasis on raising organic fruits, herbs, and flowers. On special vegetables,
early, summer, fall and even winter greenhouse growing</P>
<P>We, of course, did not have to pass through the chemical phase, because we
never wanted to introduce anything that would kill the life in our soil, or that
would be injurious to the birds. We have an eye, too, on the safety of the bees,
wasps, butterflies and other beneficial insects which aid in pollination and
control of pests. For these creatures, we expressly set out honey plants such
as: asters, bee balm, snapdragons and borage, etc., and we have interplanted
white clover in the many grass walkways that wind through Spring Meadow Farm.
</P>
<P>Other creatures inhabit our garden beds, and they are always benign; toads,
for instance, and the frogs and fish in our small pond. All these are greatly
beneficial in keeping the balance of life in the gardens. And then there are the
earthworms who help so much in conditioning the soil, and all the millions of
micro-organisms (soil life) beneficial bacteria, molds and fungi, so essential
to the health of the soil, and the transformation of nutrients into the state
useful to plants.</P>
<P>We plant things which will harmonize together, including the pest-repellent
plants and flowers (Companion Planting) to help maintain the harmony and
balance. This is the healthiest method of growing you can have, and is at the
far extreme from the chemical monoculture, a kind of agriculture that has proven
so disastrous because it is unnatural; and acts as a feasting place for pests
witch prefers the crop planted.</P>
<P>A well-run garden can also be a private laboratory, where we can experiment
with different soils and exposures for growing the same plants to compare
results and make plans for the future. You can try out new verities and test the
comparative efficiency of standard and experimental ways of treating them. You
can propagate and try hybridizing to see whether you can </P>
<P>come up with a new cold-resistant parsley, for instance, or an apple which
will flourish with a minimum of cold days for its dormancy period.</P>
<P>A final, and most important, point is that multi-purpose garden can be for
beauty, too. They bring relaxation and pleasure, or for the solace of meditation
and the quite, endless observation of Nature's continuously changing scenes.
</P>
<P>No matter how multiple your intentions, there is no reason why you need to
be hit-or-miss in your planting, and put out jumbles of shrubs, flowers, plots
and pots. No matter how eager you are to have many different kinds of fruit
trees, berry bushes and other useful and ornamental plants, it is still possible
to make garden shapes cohere to a well-focused, and well-design plan.</P>
<P>Then both the design and the multiple purposes will give you the fundamental
pleasure and satisfaction given to people who have taken the thought and time to
plan a garden that both cooperates with, and improves on Nature for the ultimate
human ends.</P>

<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN 't By Elizabeth and Crow Mille_</P>
<H1>Organic Growing Starts With Balanced Building Of the Soil</H1>
<P>For us, the outdoor gardening season starts not in March or April, but in
November. Organic gardening, after all, begins with the soil. The results you
have gotten in this year's garden are largely a product of the quality of your
soil-. If you weren't quite satisfied with this years results the fall is the
time to prepare the soil for next year's improvement.</P>
<P>The first thing to do is to test your soil. You should get a complete soil
analysis, not just a p/H test, but also primary nutrients ( N-P-K ) Secondary
nutrients; Calcium, (Ca.) Magnesium (Mg.) and Sulphur (Su) and Trace Minerals
(T.M.). But a p/H test is essential, any normal gardening activity tends to
lower the soil's p/H, a light application of <B>Dolomitic </B>limestone (54%
Ca. and 44% Mg.) will b     ring the soil back up toward the desired neutral
range (a p/H of 7.0).</P>
<P>Next, Chop-up all garden refuse, plants that have yielded all they are
capable of, and those that have already been killed by frost. Do not touch;
parsnips, carrots, horseradish, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes ( Sun-Roots as
Native American's called them), and other root crops that can stay in the ground
through the winter under mulch.</P>
<P>We find the easiest way to handle autumn refuse is to go through OUR GARDEN,
with a scythe or weed-eater, leveling everything. After Elizabeth has chopped-up
all the old plants, I make several passes through OUR GARDEN with the tiller.
This does a fin job in shredding the materials for fast sheet-composting in
ground.</P>
<P>At this point, you can spread compost and a balanced organic fertilizer
(4-6-4, 5-3-7, or depending on your soil test results recommend to apply over
the entire garden. All will add fertility, true, but more important is the soil
structure that these materials will build. If your soil is too sandy, organic
matter will help to build up its water-retention capability. If you are faced
with a heavy clay soil, get quantities of organic green sand and add this to the
other materials, to lighten the soil provide a more hospitable environment for
plant root growth.</P>
<P>By next April, all this organic matter will have decomposed to a
considerable degree. It is surprising how much composting activity actually
takes place over the winter, even during the frigid days when there seems to be
no possibility of life.</P>
<P>Nature abhors a bare soil. This is obvious even to the casual observer. 
</P>
<P>Prairies, forests, wetlands, every piece of land capable of supporting
vegetation will contribute to the Earth's green carpet without our help. And so
it should be in OUR GARDEN. A winter cover changes the effects of frigid
temperatures, helping to prolong the activity of soil micro-organisms in
breaking down organic matter. With a mulch, however, the soil won't freeze,
enabling the earthworms to adapt gradually, retreat to underground burrows, and
survive to the next season.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of winter covering to consider. One is a heavy mulch of
organic material; leaves, hay or straw are most common, since they are easily
available, but any kind will suffice. The other is a planting of winter
rye-grass. It should be planted early enough (here on Long Island September
15th) to make good progress before the first frosts come.(Oct.30th It can be
tilled under shortly before planting time in spring. Live cover crops such as
rye is also called green manure, because they build-up the soil</P>

<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; <B>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<H1>Sow And Grow Starting A Child's Garden</H1>
<P>,</P>
<P>A successful child's garden requires adult supervision and occasional direct
assistance. Don't make the too-common mistake of just providing tools, seeds and
a spot in the yard. Youthful gardening fever can fade quickly if the actual job
becomes overwhelming. Moral support through your physical presence, with a
little technical advice and an occasional assist with the spade or hoe, goes a
long way in maintaining interest.</P>
<P>Before you dig in, give some thought to the size of the garden. It should
conform to the age, capability and interest of the child. Until about the
kindergarten age, children would benefit most by being helpers in your garden.
After 9 or 10, they usually can handle a garden of their own. A good garden size
for such young children would be about 3 by 5 feet. It may be small, but so is
the child. And since young children have short attention spans, you don't want
to bore them with gardening chores. Keep the work time short and it will remain
sweet. Remember, your garden, or your child's, gardening is fun, not a chore.
</P>
<P>Pick the site for the garden with care. While you may be able to over -come
soil, water or light problems, a child cannot. The best site for a child's
garden would be in full sun, with adequate drainage, easy-to-work soil, near a
source of water. Once past this hurdle, they can handle the other tasks with
just your guidance.</P>
<P>Straight rows, properly spaced, make for an attractive garden, but young
children do not have the physical and visual coordination to carry that out to
perfection. It is better to broadcast the small seeds such as radish and lettuce
in bands or blocks. After seeding one crop, move the markers to define the next
planting area. Onion sets are large enough to be handled individually, and can
be planted about 2-inches deep</P>
<P>Quick maturing crops used in a small child's garden will usually grow fast
enough to be ready for harvest before weeds become a problem. Planting the seeds
in blocks also helps to crowd out the weeds. But, if weeds begin to crowd the
crop plants, they will have to be removed. That can become an undesirable chore
for small children, but can be made fun if you do it together and name the weeds
as you pull them. Many weeds are good to eat; dandelions, purslane, lamb's
Quarters and chickweed are a few that may be eat</P>
<P>Let the child begin to harvest as soon as the crops are large enough. As the
harvest continues, be sure to let the little green-thumer know that they
contributing to improve the families nutrition and health.</P>
<P>Children measure their success in a garden in basically two ways: How fast
they can grow something to eat, and how close they can come to meeting your
expectations of them. The first isn't hard to handle. the second depends on how
you involve yourself in the venture. Be realistic. Don't set unattainable goals
for the child. Insure success by guiding and occasionally helping with the work
and frequently pass out compliments. Don't do their garden for them.</P>
<P>You, on the other hand, should measure your child's gardening success, not
by what crops were grown, but by how much he or she has grown. It's true,
Children do grow in your garden.</P>
<P>Nurturing plants from seed to harvest inevitably leads to increased feelings
of confidence, self-esteem and pride. One only see the beaming face of a child
who has harvested their first carrot to appreciate the value of this experience.
The child becomes empowered and motivated by the realizatio that hard work and
patience produce concrete, satisfying results.</P>
<P>Above all, gardening if Fun and is a skill that, once acquired, can be a
lifelong companion. It is not a skill that must be mastered to be enjoyed, and
it is extremely adaptable to diverse needs and abilities.</P>
<P>For some children gardening may offer merely the excitement of watching
seeds grow and harvesting the bounty. For others it offers the opportunity to
develop skills they would build on as adults, Leading possibly to a rewarding
hobby or career.</P>

<H1>Winter Care For Your Herb Garden</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Given a few simple protective measures, combined with good
cultural and growing conditions, herbs should breeze through the winter and
eagerly greet the spring.</P>
<P>There is nothing like a permanent mulch to keep an herb garden happy. In
summer the mulch conserves moisture, keeps the foliage clean, and keeps down
weeds. In winter this same mulch helps maintain a more uniform temperature
around the roots, and provides protection against heaving cause by frequent
freezing and thawing of the soil. A good mulch for herbs is to use coco bean
shells.</P>
<P>During the first year of growing herbs, at Spring Meadow Organic Farm, we
lost some perennials by being greedy and trying to harvest them shortly before
the frost. This is wrong, since late harvesting prompts the plants to put on a
spurt of rapid, tender growth just prior to winter, making them candidates for
winter kill. The rule now, is to stop all major harvest) about one month prior
to the first expected killing frost.</P>
<P>The following herbs should fare well to temperatures of 20&#183; below zero,
with no more protection than a few inches of mulch around their base : <B>Anise-Hyssop,
Bergamot, Burnet, Caraway, Catnip, Chicory, Chives, Comfrey, Costmary, Feverfew,
French Sorrel, Foxglove, Garlic, Horehound, Lady's Mantle, </B>Lemon Balm,
Mints, Oregano, Rue, Sage, Southerwood, Sweet Woodruff, Tansy, Thyme, <B>Valerian,
Wormwood and Yarrow. </B></P>
<P><B>     </B>After an extra severe winter a few of these, such as Rue, Sage,
Thyme, and Southernwood, may appear brown and dead. But in time new growth
should appear. Harsh, drying winter winds can prove as fatal as cold
temperatures to some of the more tender perennials. Wind-breaks are proven
lifesavers for many varieties that don't take kindly to below-zero temperatures.
The herbs that need protection from the icy-winds of winter are:  <B>Mint,
English Pennyroyal, French Tarragon, Germander, English Lavender, Roman
Chamomile, and Winter Savory. </B></P>
<P><B>     </B>While some species of Creeping Thyme can withstand 20&#183;
below readings, others such as <B>Silver </B>and LEMON <B>Thyme </B>may
require a few evergreen boughs to prevent dying over the winter.</P>
<P>Tender perennials include <B>Lemon Verbena </B>(it's deciduous and will
lose it$ leaves while wintering inside), <B>Scented Geraniums, Sweet Bay and
Sweet Marjoram. Rosemary is normally treated as a tender perennial and moved
inside. Under certain conditions, however, it has been know to survive winters.
</B></P>
<P>In addition to these suggestions, several more will prove helpful to seeing
members of perennial herbs through cold winters. Obtain plants from a climate as
cold as, or colder than the one it will grow into ensure the hardiest possible
stock. 2) The more cold-sensitive herbs have a better chance if given a
sheltered spot in your garden. 3) Most herbs demand a well-drained soil, and if
subjected to heavy damp soils, may perish from rot, or mildew damage over
winter.  All the <B>Thymes, Lavenders and French </B>Tarragon are especially
sensitive. 5) Slopes, or rocky sites usually have good drainage. 6) Amend poorly
drained soil by tilling in lots of compost and humus, making it lighter. 7) If
you have only damp, poorly drained soil for an herb garden, choose among herbs
that will adapt to it, including: <B>Bergamot, Flax, Lovage, Mints and
Pennyroyal. </B></P>

<BODY>
<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; <B>By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</B></P>
<H2><B>WHY DO YOU GARDEN ORGANICALLY, OR SHOULD ?</B></H2>
<P>Although there could be as many answers to that question (?), as there are
organic gardeners, here is our very unofficial survey that shows some fairly
similar answers, with about 7-main categories. Here is an inventory of the most
popular reasons for organic gardening as asked to the 4,357 people who visited
Spring Meadow School of Organic Farming &amp; Gardening last season</P>
<P>WHY DO YOU GARDEN ORGANICALLY ?</P>
<P><B>Enjoyment seems </B>to be paramount with many folks. Many people like to
watch the tender new growth come to full maturity and, as a bonus, you get to
eat it! </P>
<P><B>Extra Fresh Vegetables, Naturally, </B>corn on the cob and newly picked
peas are especially noticeable, but this trait extends to all vegetables you
grow yourself, especially under the organic method-. A phenomenon noted by most
people when harvesting their very first vegetables from their vary first gardens
is that everyone eats much more of a given vegetable than they would of a
similar store bought variety. </P>
<P><B>Saving Money </B>is certainly on most people's mind today. Did you ever
hold a package of say, carrot seed, in your hand and think what a great
potential mass of food could come from that small packet ? </P>
<P><B>Desire For Organically Grown Food </B>can be one prime mover in growing
your own. Organically grown produce are, in some areas, hard to come by, and are
usually more expensive even when readily available. When you do your own growing
you are sure your produce is organic, some so-called organic farms, just say
their organic so they can make more money. A real organic farm will be
certified, and glade to show you certification. </P>
<P><B>Extra Income </B>may be derived from your garden. This could be as
simple as a casual offering for sale of some surplus crop or as intensive as
planning and marketing crops through the whole growing season, (as we do at
Spring Meadow School of organic farming &amp; gardening) changing vegetable
varieties as the seasons change, from early peas and asparagus to pumpkins and
cabbages. </P>
<P><B>Helping Our Ecology </B>by recycling animal and vegetable wastes by
means of composting, tilling directly into the soil or by burying the wastes in
a trench appeals to many people. Our National waste problem is monumental and
<B>it is a terrible waste to       burn leaves, straw, cotton ginn and grainary
</B></P>
<P>waste as is still done in too many places. Because organic growers forego
the use of toxic chemicals; both with fertilizers and poison sprays, there is
that much less of those two substances to pollute our streams, rivers, and
creeks.</P>
<P><B>Relaxation </B>can still be an important reason for gardening,
especially for people whose occupations keep them confined inside all day. Fresh
air, sun and the peacefulness of a garden, your garden! can have a beneficial
effect  on a person who is tired, harried and sick of central air and heat.
Working in the beauty of the garden can be a natural tranquilizer. </P>
<P><B>Sense of Accomplishment is </B>no little <B>thing. </B>When winter is
here, we can feel secure with stores of jellies, jams, plump pickles, jars of
beans, corn, fruits, and a root cellar well stocked with boxes of potatoes,
carrots, cabbages, onions and winter squash. </P>
<P>So those are some of the more prevalent reasons <B>Why Organic Gardening
</B>is growing so fast in the United States. But for most of us who have control
of our food supply, it's not just a garden, &quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN,&quot; And
that's a vital part of our lives.</P>

<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</P>
<H1>Pre-Soaking Your Seeds</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Treating seeds by soaking in water seems to stir up the life
process of the dormant embryo within its shell. Like any living thing, a seed
require moisture, heat and oxygen. The moisture provided by you is absorbed
through the seed coat. This results in a swelling of the seed parts and a
quickening of vital activities. In other words, growth begins.</P>
<P>The main argument in favor of this pre-treatment is not only for a speedier
garden but also for more complete germination of all seeds planted. You can get
germination results in 3 to 4 days, while without pre-soaking it may take 2
weeks of unfavorable germinating conditions.</P>
<P><B>Example: </B>onion seeds, after soaking them for 24 hours, We planted
them. We found the germination rate faster and the seedling stand more even and
thicker than with unsoaked seeds. </P>
<P>We have found that the easiest method for sowing seeds after soaking is to
put <B>them </B>in a plastic squeeze bottle along with some water. If you keep
swishing the solution in the bottle as you hold it in an upturned position, you
can get an even distribution of seeds. This, of course, is for fine seeds such
as parsley, onion, celery, asparagus, and carrots. The larger seeds such as
corn, beans and peas can be hand planted in the usual way after their water
bath.</P>
<P>Don't expect the miraculous of pre-soaking seeds. We have discovered that
you must consider the likes and dislikes of individual plants. It won't do you a
bit of good, for example, to presoak lettuce seeds and expect them to germinate
in a soil of 87&#183;, as they prefer a cooler-temperature. So start your
pre-soaked seeds at the temperature and time you generally plant. Pre-soaking
just gives you faster performance under normal conditions.</P>
<P>Among the most difficult seeds to get to germinate are beet seeds. This is
because the beet seed, or kernel, is surrounded by a hard, tough shell It takes
a long time for a beet seed to get enough moisture from the soil, to swell and
open up.</P>
<P>Pre-soaking greatly helps this problem. We always soak beet seeds a full
24-hours before planting, then sow in the usual way. We try to have a moist,
soft seedbed, and cover the seeds with about a 2-inch of compost.</P>
<P>Carrots are much stronger sprouter, but we soak them too, to speed up the
sprouting process. Peas are generally strong on germination. Just the same, they
also have to absorb moisture from the soil. If peas are soaked over night, they
will take in as much moisture as they would be able to do </P>
<P>in a day or more from the ground. The advantages are obvious.</P>
<P>It is possible, of course, to overdo the soaking. <B>Seeds should not be
soaked until they sprout in the water. </B>The idea is to soak them until they
are materially softened. They should be left to sprout in the soil.</P>
<P>Seeds that have a tough, hard shell, whether flowers or vegetables, will
benefit most from soaking. However, We do not soak any seeds longer than 24
hours. We always get a complete stand of anything we plant.</P>
<P>You will find that small wet seeds do not sow as well as dry seeds. They
cling to your fingers, and tend to drop in gobs. This can easily be remedied by
laying the seed on a paper towel for a little while. The surface water will be
drawn off, but the shell of the seed will continue to remain soft and moist
until you have time to plant them. Another good method,, is to mix the wet seeds
with dry sand, planting sand and all.</P>

<P>&quot; IT'S OUR GARDEN &quot; By Elizabeth and Crow Miller</P>
<H1>Growing Kitchen Herbs</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Some herbs capture our hearts and taste buds because they
produce such delicious seeds. <B>Anise, Caraway, Coriander, Dill and Fennel
</B>all produce savory seeds that add unusual flavor to soups, salads, cheese,
pickles, pastry, vegetable and fish dishes. While they please your palate, they
can also soothe your stomach and aid digestion.</P>
<P>These herbs are all members of the <B>Umbelliferae (carrot) Family, </B>so
called because its flowers grow in flat topped clusters known as umbels. They
are easily started from seed, and once established, will normally reseed
themselves.</P>
<P><B>Anise </B>requires at least a 120-day growing season to ripen its seeds.
As soon as the soil is warm, sow fresh seed where they will remain, since the
delicate taproots will not transplant well. Plant in full sun, space closely in
clumps, or hill them with soil to help them stay upright. </P>
<P><B>Caraway is </B>a 2 to 3-foot biennial whose feathery foliage survives
most of the year, making it a valued green in late fall and early spring. The
chopped licorice flavored leaves add zest to fresh vegetables. <B>Caraway </B>does
well when grown in loamy soil with full sun or partial shade. To prevent
disturbing the long taproots, plant seed directly in the garden in early spring
where the plants will remain. Thin to 8 to 12-inches apart. During the first
year, only carrot-like greens will appear. The following year white flower
umbels will form. Shortly, the crescent shaped brown seeds will mature, after
which the entire plant dies. Ripe seeds need to be harvested promptly before
they fall, but a few seeds are bound to escape and will self-sow. </P>
<P>Coriander is often scorned for its fresh scent, but when dried, it turns
into a pleasant, clean smelling herb reminiscent of lemons. To start Coriander,
An annual which grows 2 to 3-feet high, sow seeds shallowly in early spring.
Seed germinates easily in about 2-weeks. For best results, cultivate in a light,
well-drained soil with full sun. Space plants 8 to 10-inches in a permanent
spot. When in bloom, the umbels are lovely with pinkish flowers, and the
delicate foliage is a welcome garden addition.</P>
<P><B>Dill seeds </B>remain viable for 3-years, germinating in 7 to 14-days.
They should be sown in a sunny, well-drained, rich loamy soil. To insure fresh
dill-weed all summer long, make successive sowings from mid-April until the end
of May, at 2-week intervals. When planted in single rows, </P>
<P>this 3 to 4-foot annual tends to fall over, so plant in patches. If
necessary to transplant, do so in the evening, only when plants are several
inches tall.</P>
<P>Fennel is a tall, 5-foot perennial. It's foliage is similar to dill's but is
bushier and more branched at the base. Because of this fullness and its delicate
yellow green leaves topped by numerous umbels of gold, it makes an attractive
back ground plant in a border. <B>Fennel </B>may live for years, we have <B>fennel
</B>plants that are 3 or 4-years old, and each spring volunteers appear around
this stately herb. Sow 12 to 18-inches apart in a light, well-drained soil in
full sun, where they are to grow.</P>

<P>Its Our Garden The Importance Of-Soil/Part 1 - (1)</P>
<H1>By Elkabeth and Crow Miller</H1>
<H2>Knowing And Building Your Soil</H2>
<P><B>     </B>What kind of soil do you have in your garden ? What kind of
soil is best for your farm, garden, lawn, or landscape project ? These questions
are important because different crops have different soil preferences. For
example; asparagus likes sandy loams, while tomatoes prosper on silt and
clay-loams. Rich clays produce heavy yields of turnips, while the cucurbit
family seem to prefer loamy-sands.</P>
<P>Loamy soils can range from coarse-sandy-loams, through medium-sandy,
fine-sandy, silty-loams and clay-loams. You will find that the thinner soils are
best for early crops because they warm up more quickly, while the richer soils
will produce more abundant, but later crops.</P>
<P>In the interest of early crops and a longer season, you'll tend to go slow
at first with your applications of mulch and compost. But, as the season
advances, you'll heap more and more compost and mulch in planting rows and beds
for three good reasons: 1) to encourage and stimulate full, mature growth; 2) to
conserve soil moisture and moderate soil temperature; 3) to add humus to the
soil so that it approximates a good crumbly-loam, which is what most of your
vegetables require.</P>
<P>Loam is soil that is composed of a friable mixture of clay, silt, sand and
organic matter. The mixture of organic and mineral matter in a good loam should
<B>provide 50% solids, and </B>50% space between them. Ideally, the spaces
would be filled with 50% water, and 50% air for the most productive plant
growth.</P>
<P>Idea soil structure is granular with rounded bits or clusters of soil lying
loose and readily shaken apart. The amounts of organic matter in loam range from
just a trace to about 15%.</P>
<P>We feel, good loam should contain at lest 5% organic matter, which helps the
soil retain moisture, while contributing to the continuous process of
decomposition and growth which must go on in the soil.</P>
<P>Composting, growing cover crops and green manure crops to prevent loss of
topsoil, opening up and aerating the subsoil with deep and widely reaching root
systems, and supplying the soil with plenty of humus where it is needed. 2)
Rotary tilling to aerate the topsoil, improve structure and also to incorporate
humus, plant nutrients and organic fertilizers. 3) Liming to correct soil
acidity (after you have had a complete soil test.) Note: Read Part 2/ Soil
Testing.) to condition texture and structure, and to encourage microbial life;
4) Maintaining the idea carbon/ratio in the soil by incorporating plenty of
nitrogenous materials to balance the carbon in mulches and crop residues. These
4-methods will help you to achieve good soil.</P> 
<P>It's hard to beat compost as a source of sustained soil fertility, filth and
structure because, just by itself it has all the elements needed. for a complete
plant food. Note: read Part 3 / Composting, Building Healthy Soil) When you
combine it with organic soil amendments, (Kelp, Fish Meal, Greensand, Bone Meal,
Feather Meal, etc.) cover-crops and a green manure program.</P>
<P>While a cover-crop is grown chiefly to prevent or reduce erosion, the green
manure crops ( Buckwheat/spring, Oats/summer and Rye/fall) improve soil quality
when they are tilled under. The advantages of growing protective,
soil-replenishing crops on farms, and gardens are obvious. 1) time and labor of
hauling and spreading are saved. 2) the deep, widely spreading root systems open
up the soil, making it more permeable. 3) the decomposing residues of the roots
further serve as nutrients for the succeeding main crops.</P>
<P>For the organic farmer there is disking, and rotary tilling is practiced by
many landscapers and organic gardeners to improve soil filth and structure by
incorporating humus and compost in the top layer while they build fertility.
Sick, unbalanced soil lacks organic matter, aeration and physical condition. The
corrective steps that we recommend is to aerate by tilling, improve with compost
and bone meal, sweeten with lime if needed, and give mulch protection.</P>
<P>Mere spading does little good if the soil is massive, because the soil
particles will settle back together when the soil is wet again with the deeper
layers heavily pressed by the weiqht of the ones above them.</P>
<P>Besides spading, it is necessary to add abundant organic matter and soil
amendments for good structure and adequate nutrition of deep-rooted plants. Once
you have well-drained soil, its organisms are enabled to decompose organic
matter to produce compounds that lead to natural soil geanulation.</P>
<P>When tilling, digging. or subsoiling, <B>don't remove all or most of </B>
</P>
<P><B>the stones </B>you uncover. The reason for this is plain; <B>stones act
as moderating influences on the soil. </B>In summer, they help keep it cool; in
winter they help heat it up. They are sources of trace elements which they
contribute steadily over the years and encourage symbiotic soil relationships.
</P>
<P>Some form of organic nitrogen (N); soybean meal, alfalfa meal, fish meal,
feather meal and cottonseed meal are all fine, and should be added with the
lime, or you will have a nitrogen (N) deficiency because liming stimulates soil
microbial life by breaking down the humus present. The bacteria that go to work
on the humus needs more nitrogen (N) and will take it from the soil if you don't
give it to them.</P>
<P>We cure sour soil by adding lime in the form of ground limestone, wood ashes
are also good, and using plenty of compost and mulch. Organic soil retains
moisture perfectly, and thus prevents the leaching out of lime</P>
<P>Most plant residues which go into the soil are 50-parts carbon to</P>
<P>one part nitrogen. The ideal carbon/nitrogen ratio is 15 to 30-parts to</P>
<P>one of nitrogen. Very little of this soil nitrogen is used to make plant
</P>
<P>tissue, which is largely dependent on photosynthesis for its growth.</P>
<P>But the C/N ratio of crop residues tilled back into the soil directly</P>
<P>affects the vigor and size of its bacterial population which needs the</P>
<P>nitrogen to build cell tissue. When you add crop resifues to the soil,</P>
<P>be sure to include extra nitrogen. Otherwise you will have a soil (N)</P>
<P>deficiency because the bacteria which break down the residues need the</P>
<P>extra (N) for energy.</P>
<P>We must remember, soil is a living, breathing organism, it must be feed</P>
<P>a balanced healthy diet.</P>

<P>It s Our Garden The <B>Importance Of Soll/Part 2</B></P>
<H1>By Eleabeth and Crow Miller</H1>
<H2>Soil Analysis</H2>
<H2>A Tool For Balanced, Healthy, Productive </H2>
<H2>Soil</H2>
<P><B>     </B>A doctor uses an X-ray or a blood test, so that they can make
an accurate diagnosis of a person's health. We, organic farmers, gardeners, and
landscapers use soil analysis, so we can make an accurate diagnosis of the
health of our soil. A healthy, balanced soil will produce healthy, balanced
crops that are free of insects, disease and weeds.</P>
<P>A soil analysis is a very practical way to learn more about the make up of
any soil. First, test your soil, dig into it and find out what's there, and what
isn't. By any one of several available testing methods get a dependable analysis
of the essential plant nutrients your soil contains. Check, too, on it's
acid/alkaline status (a p/H test) to be sure this condition is favorable for the
crops you want to grow. Make your tests periodically, often enough to stay aware
of changes and how well your soil program is working. Remember, your doctor
won't prescribe for his patient without an examination first.</P>
<P>Next, you must treat the soil. Treat it according to the test results.
Decide on a program of natural fertilizing that matches up supply with demands
shown in your soil's check-up. Keep in mind the particular or heavy drain of any
elements by specific crops you may grow. Work to increase the soil's organic
matter content, (O.M.C) which is literally its lifeline, and exerts the greatest
influence on desirahle tiIth, good drainage and moisture-holding capacities.
</P>
<P>There are two basic ways to test soil accessible to the average organic
grower. First, the simplest of them is a soil test kit. The kit provides
solutions and guides for determining the approximate content of the three major
soil nutrients: (N) nitrogen, (P) phosphorus and (K) potash, plus a similar
means of establishing thr p/H standing. Their biggest advantages are that they
permit you to make frequent on-the-spot tests of your soil, and help you adapt a
fertilizing program in accord with your soil's prime needs. </P>
<P>The test is made simply by putting a small portion of the soil sample in a
test tube, then introducing one or two reagents. A reagent is a chemical which
reacts with the nutrients being tested, it shows the quantity of the nutrients
available by changing color. Color charts are supplied with these kits, the
finial analysis is made by checking the color of the solution in the tube with
the test chart for the nutrient being tested.</P>
<P>The other way to have soil tested is to send a sample to a laboratory. There
other testing methods, used only in technical or specialized agricultural
research, include plant tissue or leaf analyses in determining nutrient
deficiencies.</P>
<P>Soil samples can be taken at any time during the year that weather
conditions permit. The soil should be free of frost, and fairly dry. If your
growing area is quite large, taking a composite, or mixed sample from several
points will provide more information than a spot sample.</P>
<P>For a composite sample, start at one end of your growing area and with a
soil auger go down about 6 to 8-inches, then place the soil plug in a clean
container. Now move about 12-feet in any direction and repeat this operation.
Continue until the plot is given an over-all sampling. Note: On a field of an
acre or more, samples can be taken several rods apart</P>
<P>Once you've covered the area to be tested, mix samples thoroughly in a clean
bucket, remove one pint of soil. Damp or wet soil will give false test readings.
Next, label the soil sample, indicating where and when it was taken, the type of
crop grown last season, and type of crop to be planted this year.</P>
<P>Some soil test kits and most laboratory reports also make soil
recommendations for improving weak or deficient nutrient levels shown in the
test. An important point for growers who want their soil enriched in a way that
does the most good is that they translate any general or chemical
recommendations into natural fertilizers and organic soil amendments that
deliver long lasting benefits, and improve the soil's composition at the same
time.</P>
<P>Let's look at the major nutrients and consider how each one can be supplied
when a soil analysis shows a deficiency. Nitrogen (N) of course, is one of the
most vital elements for a productive soil, one which must be constantly renewed.
</P>
<P>If your soil analysis shows a low (N) level, start applying one or more of
the rich natural sources. Composted poultry manures are the best organic
fertilizers relatively high in (N), and should be included in an organic soil
feeding program whenever available. Fish meal, feather meal. and cottonseed
meal, are especially rich in (N), are excellent for overcoming deficiencies.
</P>
<P>Bone meal is another good supplier of (N), as well as a phosphorus rich
material. Raw bone meal has between 2% to 4% (N), 23% to 27% (P) phosphoric
acid. Steamed bone meal contains one to 2% (N), and up to 30% phosphorus (P).
One of the richest sources of (N) is blood meal. Blood meal analyzes 15% (N), it
can be used directly in the soil or composted.</P>
<P>Phosphorus (P) plays a leading role in plant nutrition. It's essential for
healthy growth, strong roots, fruit development and resistance to diseases. (P)
deficiency is considered by many agronomists to be the prime factor in limiting
crop production.</P>
<P>When a soil analysis points to (P) shortage, the best source is using rock
phosphate, ground to a powder, which contains about 30% (P). Colloidal
phosphate, also a natural mineral product, is made up of sedimentary deposits of
soft phosphate with colloidal clay. It contains from 18% to 25% phosphoric acid.
</P>
<P>Potash (K) is the mineral that concerns itself mainly with plants
carbohydrate manufacture. As one of the big-3 soil nutrients, it is essential
for the development of strong plants, particularly in overcoming disease
susceptibility and maintaining balanced (N) use. Plants lacking potash (K) do
not resist heat or cold well, their process of photosynthesis is slowed down.
</P>
<P>Greensand, an under sea mineral deposit, is an excellent potassium  (K)
supplier (7%) and also contains beneficial quantities of many trace  elements,
some lime and phosphorus (P). Plant residues, manures and  compost also bring
potash (K) to the soil in a free and available form.  This is important because
even in fertile soil the supply of free  potassium (K) is seldom enough to meet
the needs of a growing crop.</P>
<P>Note : Wood ashes are another potash (K) high source. Broad-leaf wood  ashes
contain as much as 10%; coniferous ashes, about 6%. </P>
<P>Another important part of a soil analysis is the acid/alkaline  (p/H)
balance, it is important because a lopsided p/H will block the  release of major
and minor plant foods. A soil that is too acid will  not release unavailable
nutrients properly; neither will a soil that  is too alkaline.</P>
<P>Keep in mind, of course, that a soil analysis is not the only way  to check
on the soil's needs, and the requirements of plant growing in  it. A soil
analysis reveals the available, soluble nutrients, and these  constitute about
3% of the total minerals present in the soil. Some  growers feel that testing
the actual tissue of a plant is a better  method, since it reveals what the
plant is lacking. but the trouble  with tissue testing is that it shows the
hunger after it exists, by  that time the damage has been done. An accurate soil
test can help  prevent deficiencies, thereby serve as a valuable tool for the
organic  grower.</P>
<P>The more you know about your soil, the more productive it will  be for you.
Soil analysis and intelligent treatment as a follow-up  to what they show can do
a lot for Your growing success. </P>

<P>It' s Our Garden<B> The Importance Of Soil/Part 3</B></P>
<H1>By Elkabeth and Crow Miller</H1>
<H2>Composting, Building Healthy Soil</H2>
<P><B>     </B>One of the great beauties of the organic approach is that it
enables a person to grow beautiful, healthy plants without much of anything
special. In Nature the soil is built by a very efficient recycling of nutrients.
Things that die and fall to the ground begin to rot almost immediately. Little
is lost. The organic approach feeds plants by feeding the myriad organisms of
decay that live in the soil. Wonderful gardens are built on wastes, trash and
castoffs.</P>
<P>Basic composting is an easy to arrange process. True, transformation of a
mass of undecomposed organic materials into life-giving fertilizer is one of
Nature's almost unbelievable miracles. But the elementary steps which set off
this transformation are simple, and easy to follow.</P>
<P><B>Sheet Composting </B>is one good example of low temperature
decomposition. It involves tilling under plant refuse, manure and other wastes,
leaving them to decay in the soil. Since there's no pile to turn, sheet
composting means less work. But the problem with it, as with other methods of
anaerobic decomposition like <B>trench or pit composting, </B>is that high
carbon residues rely on the nitrogen (N) reserves of the soil for their break
down. High-nitrogen materials, on the other hand, release their (N) too quickly
or in the wrong form for plants to use when decomposed anaerohically <B>Sheet
composting </B>is slow. What can be accomplished in a well managed heap in a few
weeks may take a full season in the soil. </P>
<P>Hot compost means fast compost, but hot, aerobic compost pile, too, has its
disadvantages. Building a pile takes plenty of time, energy and sweat.
Nutrient-rich liquids can leach into the ground beneath the pile where they are
of little help to plants.</P>
<P>Rapid decomposition burns up oxygen fast. A well made pile will heat up in
2-days. But to keep it rotting as quickly as it is able requires a turning for
aeration every third day. Without it, the bacteria and fungi that are digesting
the pile run out of oxygen and the decomposition slows.</P>
<P><B>Active composting </B>has some compelling advantages. One is that it is
an easier way to apply large amounts of organic matter to the soil. Especially
in small gardens where vegetables are spaced closely. </P>
<P>The process of composting reduces the bulk of whatever material you have
roughly in half, with minimal losses of nutrients. Some of the nutrients in the
original material are rendered readily availahle to roots. the continuing action
of soil microbes on digested compost releases more.</P>
<P><B>Behind every successful compost pile </B>are well fed microbes. They
acquire essential energy by oxidizing the carbon and nitrogen (N) contained in
those materials, using carbon for growth and (N) for protein synthesis. The heat
in a compost pile is a direct result of this oxidation for biological burning.
For a pile to heat up properly, it needs the right blend of organic wastes, air,
moisture and sufficient size, in that order. </P>
<P>To start building a compost pile, all you need to know is a rough estimate
of the carbon/nitrogen content of the materials you have to work with. The
carbon content is a gauge of the food energy, that is available for the
microbes. The microbes also use nitrogen (N) as building blocks for protein as
they multiply.</P>
<P>To work at peak efficiency, the bacteria and fungi in a compost pile need 25
to 30-parts of carhon to one part (N). If there is too much (N), that is, less
than 25-parts of carbon to one part (N), the excess will he wasted. You will
smell it escaping as ammonia gas when you turn the pile.</P>
<P>When the balance is right (carbon level between 25 to 30), heat loving
microbes thrive. The temperature raises, <B>which </B>makes the microbes work
even faster. As a bonus to you, the <B>high heat also kills many </B>weed seeds
and disease-causing organisms. Nearly all the (N) is incorporated into the
bodies of the micro-organisms. And they consume carbon energy in the process
until the carbon level drops to roughly 10-parts to each part (N). That's the
same carhon to nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio) as a humus-rich soil. The compost then
cools to about 110&#183; F. and is ready to go on the garden beds immediately.
</P>
<P>Feeding a compost pile is simple. The micro-organisms require only a special
blend of protein and carbohydrate sources. Vitamins, minerals, and other
nutrients, these they seem to either manufacture for themselves or forage for
just fine. High-protein wastes are usually succulent, green </P>
<P>vegetation (kitchen wastes and grass clippings), and many animal by-products
including manure and urine. <B>Note: </B>Urine is not a source of protein, but
of (N) containing compounds from which some microbes can build their own
protein.</P>
<P>Energy-rich materials are almost exclusively dry, tough, fibrous former
plant parts; autumn leaves, straw, sawdust and the like. these contain complex
carbohydrates, which the microbes digest for the energy they contain.</P>
<P>Adding organic matter triggers a complex soil system into action. When plant
and animal wastes are worked into the soil, the most soluble components, sugars
and starches, decompose first. They're a good source of energy for the
micro-organisms in the soil. The micro-organisms feed on some of the carbon and
(N) in the organic matter and convert them into their own cellular material. In
the process, many nutrients are released in a form accessible to plants. Later,
when the micro-organisms die, their cells decompose, and the nutrients in their
cells become available for plants.</P>
<P>A yearly application of 10 to 20-tons of organic matter per acre, 240 to
450-pounds per 100-square feet, would certainly provide all the (N), nitrogen,
(P) phosphorus and (K) potassium you'd need in most garden situations. After
about 5-years, you might want to cut back, and you'll still find the nutrient
level increasing.(Note:) have your soil tested.</P>
<P>An ideal soil profile contains about 5 to 10% organic matter. Getting the
level up that high isn't difficult. Since a 6-inch layer of mineral soil in a
100-square foot plot weighs about 47,000 pounds, adding 235-lbs. of compost will
give you an instant 5% organic matter. Even in soil that has only 1% organic
matter initially, 20-tons per acre (460-lbs. per 100-square feet) will make a
big difference. </P>
<P>Finally, a few review points for successful composting:</P>
<P>1) Make sure the nitrogen content of your pile is high enough.</P>
<P>2) Try to mix together more kinds of raw materials, primarily to provide
</P>
<P>proper physical condition.</P>
<P>3) Shred all fibrous materials.</P>
<P>4) Keep your compost moist, not soggy.</P>

<H1>Organic Weed Control, &quot;Just Eat ' </H1>
<H1>em</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Have you ever wondered why some plants make weeds of themselves
? It's as if this wild vegetation prefers human company to life in the pristine
wilderness. Ironically, its because many of these plants were naturalized many
centuries ago by our ancestors for food and medicine. I've been eating and
enjoying beneficial weeds for over 20-years in addition to more normal foods,
for their flavor, freshness, and nutritional value.</P>
<P>By using those weeds as food, you will realize a number of benefits: (1) you
get an early spring harvest at a time when most gardens are just getting
started. (2) You increase the productivity of your garden. (3) as with most
other homegrown food, you'll save money. This particular food is especially
economical, it's totally free. (4) you'll expand your own culinary horizons.
There approximately 50,000 edible plant species in the world, but the average
American eats only 30. Hence, if you only use 3-kinds of weeds as part of your
diet, you've probably increased your food choices by 10%.</P>
<P>Purslane, this common garden weed is rich in flavor and nutrients. Many
garden seed catalogs now list purslane and Dandelion's. Purslane prefers sunny
spots in sandy rich soil. It carpets the ground, rarely growing more than
5-inches high. The succulent, purplish-green leaves range from 1/2 to 2-inches
long. The tender red stems bear tiny, 5-petaled yellow flowers at their tips.
The whole plant is edible. Some purelane lovers have found that they can use one
plant from June till August, just by snipping off the tips of the stems.</P>
<P>Raw purslane has a pleasant crunch and is a good salad green. An interesting
purslane cole slew can be made by chopping up the raw leaves and stems, mixing
with chopped carrots, and other raw vegetables and blending with commercial
cole-slaw dressing. Purslane's great taste, high level of nutrition and low
caloric content (the plant is 92% water, similar to cabbage).</P>
<P>Like most of us Americans, dandelion is an immigrant, brought here by the
earliest English settlers. It was considered absolutely essential for survival
and was given an honored place in the kitchen gardens of the day, providing
food, medicine and wine. Because it is an effective diuretic, it has been used
for kidney stones, weight loss, and edema. Its ability to cleanse the system of
toxic matter makes it valuable in clearing up disorders.</P>
<P>Every part of the dandelion, with the exception of the seeds and flower
stalks, is useful. Eat the young leaves in early spring, either raw or steamed.
</P>
<P>Dig up the roots anytime, although they will be highest in nutrients in 
</P>
<P>the fall. Boil them like parsnips. You can also use them as a caffeine-free
coffee substitute,while enjoying dandelion's health benefits.</P>
<P>Chickweed is quite possibly the most common weed in the world. It, too, is a
small plant, rarely reaching more than 5-inches in height. Weak-stemmed, it
seems to spread out horizontally along the ground. It prefers rich soil, a
little shelter, and cool weather.</P>
<P>The whole plant, above ground, is edible raw or cooked. Raw, it has little
flavor. For this reason, it is one of my favorite plants, because with its mild
flavor and crunchy texture, I can use it just like lettuce, as the base for
salads. It mixes well with any other more strongly-flavored salad fixin's such
as watercress, radishes and peppers.</P>
<P>Cook chickweed just like spinach: steamed, it even tastes like an extremely
mild spinach. As it cooks down quite a bit, use a lot. Because its flavor does
not overpower others vegetables, it's a good thing to add to the green pot to
stretch other greens.</P>
<P>When you mow your lawn, does the scent of onion or garlic fill the air?
Lucky you! There are a great many species of these two closely related herbs,
But any plant that smells strongly of onion or garlic is onion or garlic and is
edible.</P>
<P>Dig the bulb up to see which one you have. Just like their domesticated
relatives, onions will be layered and garlic will be made up of cloves. Don't be
fooled by their small size, their flavor is often stronger than domesticated
varieties. Use the green tops like chives or green onion tops.</P>
<P>I hope you will want to try eating some of the weeds in your backyard.
They'll add freshness, flavor, and variety to your diet, as well as increasing
the productivity of your organic garden. <B>Bon Appetit! </B></P>

<P>( l )</P>
<P><B>How About Apple Tree's In Your Backyard </B>? </P>
<P>When selecting trees for planting, be sure to choose those which are adapted
to <B>your area. </B>As <B>with any </B>long-term investment, apple trees
should be chosen with care. Avoid so-called bargains. Buy your trees from a
reputble grower (Leuthardt fruit trees, L.I. Grown for 6 generations 878-1387)
which specializes in fruit trees. You have your choice of variety, size and age
when buying trees. Be familiar with these three variables, and choose them to
suit your <B>particular </B>requirements. The best time to order trees is early
in the fall, when a wide variety of trees is available.</P>
<P>The best time to plant your trees will be after their leaves have fallen or
from late October into November. If freshly dug trees are planted early enough,
planting can be done successfully in the spring. Nevertheless, soil at this time
dries up slowly and the growing season is generally well advanced by the time
the soil becomes fit to work for the setting of the orchard. A more important
reason for planting in the fall is that young apple trees withstand the shock of
transplanting best when they are dormant, resting as it were, from the growth
which has gone on during the months before</P>
<P>For pollination purposes, it's a good idea to plant at least 3 to 4-trees
near one another. I prefer <B>the triangular plan </B>when space is limited.
Trees must be far enough apart to permit the sun to reach the lower branches.
Vigorous dwarf apple varieties, such as Baldwin, MacIntosh and York Imperial,
planted 12-feet apart in fertile soil, may crowd when only about 15-years old
but, planted 15-feet apart they will not crowd even in 20-years. Less vigorou
trees, such as Rome Beauty, Winesap and Golen Delicious, planted 15-feet apart,
would not crowd seriously.</P>
<P>Apples like a well-limed soil that is rich in humus. The quality of the
subsoil often is more important than that of the topsoil, however, as the roots
of apple trees penetrate deeply into subsoil in search of nutrients and water.
Trees will not thrive in hardpan clay, nor in gravel or sand subsoil.</P>
<P>Cover cropping for the larger orchard is an excellent practice for preparing
the soil before planting trees. A winter cover crop of rye at 1 1/2-bushels per
acre can be used, sowing the seed between August 20th and September 15th.</P>
<P>Most apple tree growers prefer a mulch around their fruit trees. Between the
first and fourth years, fruit trees are especially sensitive to competition from
other vegetation. Competing growth within 5-feet of the trunk in the form <B>of
weeds, </B>grass or even cover crop legumes like alfalfa, can </P>
<P>prevent the young trees from making normal growth. Therefore, if a cover
crop is used, turn it under in early spring before growth starts. Though 1-pound
of dry weeds or grass takes up little nutrients, almost 800-pounds of water must
pass through the leaves of the plants to produce that single pound of growth.
When planting trees in a former lawn area, I advise to keep about a 5-foot
circle around the base of the young tree free from grass, and to maintain a
heavy straw mulch.</P>
<P>Nitrogen (N) requirements of your apple trees can easily be satisfied with
spring applications of compost; use about 5-pounds for each year of the tree's
age. Spread the organic fertilizer under the mulch in a band starting 1-foot
from the trunk and extending out to the branch tips. Heavy applications of
greensand, wood ashes or other potash material should be added along with the
nitrogen fertilizer to avoid creating a potassium (K) deficiency. To complete
the feeding program, apply bone meal (P) at about 10 to 15-pounds per tree.The
best time to apply organic fertilizer is 6 to 8-weeks before the tree blooms.
</P>
<P>If you have been living without the benefits of one of the many varieties of
apple trees, So, - why not brows ? You'll find it worthwhile to give up some of
your lawn space to qrow this king of the orchard.</P>

<H1>Growing Tomatoes, Winter To Spring - Indoors</H1>
<P>You <B>can start </B>window-sill salads that last all winter by moving a
tomato branch in a <B>pot into </B>your indoor garden. Just pot up one or more
small stocky tomato plants this fall, bring them indoors to grow and bear all
winter and spring. Anyone with a properly mulched, weedless garden can obtain a
stocky plant by cutting a branch off a bearing tomato plant, placing it in a
container of <B>water, and leaving it till </B>roots appear, which takes about
a week. Or a branch still attached to the plant can be placed on the ground,
with soil over a 3-inch section, and left for 10-days. After roots grow, the
branch can be cut from <B>the larger </B>plant and potted in a mixture of half
compost and half garden soil. I leave my potted tomatoes out in the garden for a
few days, then bring them in on a warm day. It is best to have them indoors for
a week before the heat is turned on.</P>
<P>I keep my tomatoes in a south window with flowering plants. They usually
start blossoming in November and continue to bloom and bear tomatoes during the
winter and spring. I fed my plants with a diluted mix of liquid fish and seaweed
every 12-days, but they do not regain their normal vigor till I open the inside
south window leaving only a ventilated storm window between the <B>plants and
the </B>winter weather.</P>
<P>I've also discovered that the uninvited insect is the whitefly, the bane of
most indoor tomato growers. There's a plant that repels this pest, though, and
that's a good way to control it from the start. The plant is popularly called
the shoofly plant or Peruvian ground cherry. A few kept in the house or
greenhouse will dispel any whitefly infestation and discourage several other
insects, too.</P>
<P>Blossoming and bearing tomatoes are heavy feeders. Mine require bone meal,
mixed in near the surface of the soil during February and March. I water them
with compost-tea. Before they become too ungainly to move, I put them in the
sink and shower them once a week.</P>
<P>When they show a tendency to grow too tall, I pinch the new growth or <B>prune
the plants. It's </B>wise to remember that as house plants their roots systems
are quite limited compared to growth made in the outdoor garden. To compensate
for this, the tops should be pruned; by balancing stem and leaf growth, setting
of fruit is encouraged and heavier bearing results. As the fruit becomes heavier
the plants need support. I tie them to a stake.</P>
<P>As for hand-polling, simply tapping the plants firmly so that the pollen
scatters is generally enough. Do this several times as new blossoms appear. 
</P>
<P>My indoor grown tomatoes do not bear very heavily, but the fruit is firm and
have a good flavor and deep color, quite a contrast to the pale, tasteless
tomatoes sold in the winter markets. I pot Vinigina Lady's (the vitamin C is
double that of standard varieties) and sometimes Red Cherry, also high in
Vitamin C. Because of their delicious flavor, both are excellent in salads, and
the attractive fruit of Red Cherry enhances the beauty of any fruit bowl.
Cheerful yellow flowers, bright red tomatoes, and the green <B>foliage of
window </B>plants show strikingly against the cold skies just beyond the window.
</P>
<P>In late spring the plants can be returned to the garden, easily giving you
the earliest tomatoes in the neighborhood. More vigorous plants, however, will
result if branches are cut off to root in water. You then have a head <B>start
on your summer </B>garden and do not have to sow or buy many new plants, if any.
Peppers, too, can be indoor-container-grown through the fall and winter</P>

<H1><B>Growing Cantaloupes In Your Garden, Why Not? </B></H1>
<P>Cantaloupes have certain requirements. They like sandy-loam, humus-rich soil
that is close to neutral pH (6.8 to 7.0), hot weather, and room to spread</P>
<P>To provide the room I set aside a bed 25 by 25 feet. Along each side of this
bed, I planted 2-rows of peas; down the middle I planted 4-rows of radishes,
lettuce and green onions, 10-rows in all. Then I planted the hills of
cantaloupes down the middle of the remaining wide rows. The peas and other early
vegetables were used by the time the cantaloupes needed more space. <B>Note:
</B>If you have a really small garden, cantaloupes can be grown on trellises
</P>
<P>Since the soil was heavy, acid clay that was slow to warm up in the spring,
providing a warm, sandy soil was a bit of a problem. My solution was to dig a
hole about 2-feet in diameter and 2-feet deep for each cantaloupe hill</P>
<P>I filled the hole with alternate layers of composted horse manure, sand and
bone meal. The composted manure provided nitrogen (N) and potassium (K); the
bone meal, calcuim and phosphorus (Ca. and P). I mixed all the layers together
with a spading fork, except for a final layer of sand on top.</P>
<P>Now, I had a pocket of sandy soil rich in organic matter (compost) that
cantaloupes love. I sprinkled Dolomitic limestone on top of the soil after I
planted the seeds. Rain soon washed it into the soil.</P>
<P>Preparing the soil for cantaloupes the way I did may sound like a lot of
work, but it really isn't if you just do 2 or 3-hills a day. I like to plant
cantaloupes (usually 20-hills in all) over a period of a month's time so that
they don't all get ripe at once. I've noticed that the plants started the
earliest produced the largest, sweetest melons. This is because they are making
fruit during the hottest weather of July and August.</P>
<P>I mulch the plants as soon as possible after planting them. I use hay or
straw mulch everywhere in the garden. Once the mulch is in place there is no
more work until the fruits get ripe.</P>
<P>One of the worst insects in the garden, certainly the worst for melons, is
the striped or spotted cucumber beetle. In a bad year, this small, innocent
looking bug, along with countless of her cousins, can all but wipe out a
cantaloupe patch; even in a good year, yields can be reduced. They'll greedily
devour tender young emerging plants before they have a chance to get started,
Feast on bigger leaves of older plants and spread bacterial wilt from plant to
plant.</P>
<P>Some organic gardeners recommend planting radishes around the borders of
cantaloupe rows and hills to deter cucumber beetles.</P>
<P>Presumably, the quicker growing radishes serve as cover and camouflage for
the young cantaloupe seedlings, or the strong odor or taste of the radishes is
unpleasant to the beetles. If spraying or dusting is needed, rotenone and /or/
pyrethrum are natural insecticides that will control cucumber beetles But the
best way to control insects and diseases is to use soil nutrition. healthy soil
makes healthy plants, no insects!</P>
<P>Long Island gardeners can start cantaloupes indoors in celpacks about 3 to
4-weeks before the last frost date, transplanting them outside when the soil is
warm, May 15 - June 15th. If directly seeded into the garden, they can be sown
about 1 to 3-weeks after last frost, in warm soil, around June 1st.</P>
<P>There you have it, the ingredients for a bumper crop of cantaloupes:
preparing rich soil, selecting genetic superstars, effective pest control, cold
protection, and using yield-boosting mulches and drip-irrigation. As you can
see, there's more to it than just dropping a seed in the soil and hoping for the
best; planning, hard work and some expense will be involved here but this is
gardening at its best. The payoff comes at harvest when, perhaps for the first
time, not only will both your handcart be full but you'll have to add siderails
to hold the surplus of cantaloupes ! Enjoy.</P>

<H1>Cucumbers; The Popular Salad And Pickling Vegetable. </H1>
<P>Fortunately, the cucumber is easy to grow, and because of its short growing
season, 48 to 70-days from seed to picking size, it can find the warm weather
that it needs in almost every garden. But being a warm-weather plant very
sensitive to frost, it should be direct-sown only after the soil is thoroughly
warmed in spring and air temperatures are 65&#183; to 70&#183;F. Sow seed one
inch deep and 4-inches apart; later thin the seedlings to about 12-inches apart.
</P>
<P>Cucumbers can be grown in hills, but there is no real advantage to this
method, and they are grown best in rows and trained on a trellis, pole, fence or
other support. This way, they take very little ground space and produce more
attractive and straighter fruits.</P>
<P>Also, you can start seeds indoors 4 to 6-weeks before time to set them out
as transplants, which is after frost danger has passed. Indoor started plants
are best grown in individual pots so the roots are not disturbed when
transplanting. If an unexpected late frost comes, cover plants with floating row
covers to protect them.</P>
<P>Cucumbers respond to a generous amount of organic matter such as compost in
the soil, the use of micro-nutrient foliar spray (seaweed and fish mix) every
3-weeks, and 4-6-4 organic fertilizer added at the rate of 4-pounds to 50-feet
of row before planting.</P>
<P>Like most vegetables, cucumbers prefer full sun; in a very hot areas,
afternoon shade will keep the foliage from scorching.</P>
<P>Cucumber roots will grow to a depth of 3-feet if the soil is good, so water
slowly and deeply. If the plant is under stress from lack of moisture, it just
stops growing. It will pick up again when water is supplied. Leaves often wilt
in the middle of the day during hot spells, but check the soil for moisture
below the surface.</P>
<P>If the first early flowers fail to set fruit, don't worry. The male flowers
open first, and about a week later you'll see the female flowers with-baby
cucumbers at their bases. This delayed setting shouldn't worry you, but you can
avoid it by trying one of the gynoecious, or self-pollinating hybrids, that set
fruit with the first blossoms.</P>
<P>There are several types of cucumbers and varieties of each type. Catalogs
divide cucumbers into slicing and pickling varieties. Some are dual purpose.
Slicing cucumbers are cylindrical and grow up to 10-inches or longer. Pickling
cucumbers are shorter and blockier. Some pickles can be picked at any age,
meaning small ones for sweet pickles and larger ones for </P>
<P>dills. It is true that all cucumbers should be picked in the immature stage,
but a slicing variety that is just right at 8-inches long does not really have
the pickling quality at the small, sweet pickle size.</P>
<P>Gynoecious refers to varieties that have almost all female flowers. In the
regular old monoecious cucumber, male blossoms greatly outnumber the female, or
fruiting, blossoms. Gynoecious cucumbers set with the first flowers set closer
to the base or crown of the plant, have higher yields and mature earlier.</P>
<P>Gynoecious cucumbers, however, need a male pollinator plant, seeds of which
are included in a packet of gynoecious varieties. Male plants have green seeds
and female plants have beige seeds. One male plant is needed for every 5 to
8-female plants.</P>
<P>There are also self-fertilizing cucumbers, which set fruit without
pollination and are seedless. These varieties must be grown in an isolated area
to prevent cross-pollination with other varieties. They are the type grown in
greenhouses and several varieties have become available to the home gardener,
check your seed catalogs.</P>
<P>Whether eaten alone or tossed into salads, cooked, used in ethic recipes or
pickled, cucumbers are one of the mainstays of the kitchen and among the easiest
vegetables to produce in your garden.</P>

<H1>Fast-Growing Cold-Weather Crops; Chinese Cabbage And Pak Choy</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Like other members of the brassica family (broccoli, cabbage,
kale and cauliflower), Chinese cabbages perform well in cool weather. However,
temperatures below 50&#183;F coupled with increasing day-length encourages
bolting the formation of seed stalks. You can grow these Chinese greens in
spring, but bolting is less likely if heads mature in the shorter days of fall.
Also, heads that mature in cool weather don't have the strong flavor and poor
texture that summer-maturing heads often have.</P>
<P>Chinese cabbages mature as early as 42-days from transplanting, so you can
harvest mature heads in fall if you start seeds about 2 to 3-months before your
first frost date. Long Island gardeners need to start seeds in July. Home
gardeners, who usually don't need a lot of Chinese cabbage all at one time, can
do succession plantings at 10 to 12-day intervals. I usually recommend 3-small
plantings.</P>
<P>Some of my seed was started indoors in Late June through early August. My
transplants are usually set out about 4-weeks later, as late as the first week
of September. As far as direct-seeding, I feel it gives you uneven germination,
so production is less uniformed. Also, you could have a dry spell in August that
would delay germination of seeds sown directly in the soil.</P>
<P>Light frost can actually be a boon to Chinese cabbages. It increases the
sugar content of the leaves, making them very flavorful.</P>
<P>As with lettuces and other staples of the fall vegetable garden, polyester
row covers can help extend the harvest by sheltering plants from sever cold and
wind. Row covers also provide excellent protection against flea beetles one of
the most troublesome insects for cabbage growers</P>
<P>If you want to grow non-heading Chinese cabbages, don't be confused by the
names Pak Choi, Pac Choi, Pak Choy and Bok Choy, all refer to the same basic
type of loose-leaved Chinese cabbages.</P>
<P>Pak Choy is also the specific name for the most commonly grown type of
non-heading Chinese. Pak Choy grows 8 to 14-inches tall with thick basal stalks
narrowing to thin midribs. The stalks are capped with dark-green, spoon-shaped
leaves on the plant that grows in an upright rosette form resembling Swiss
Chard.</P>
<P>Green-stalked Shanghai Pak Choy, or Baby Pak Choy, has a mature height of
just 6 to 8-inches. Harvested young, the entire plant may be steamed and eaten
whole, as it is in southern China.</P>
<P>I approach insect control from the ground up. The best way to avoid</P>
<P>insect damage on pak choy is to ensure that the plants grow quickly and are
healthy. Feed your plants when seedlings have 2-leaves. Balanced growing
conditions contribute to the health of the plant, enabling it to grow quickly,
yet preserving the quality.</P>
<P>I feed my direct-seeded plants with finely crushed basaltic rock and crushed
oyster shells, Although another source of calcium, such as limestone, could
substitute for the shells. Soil must be biologically active, so the minerals can
be assimilated. I recommend topdressing the minerals with compost if your soil
is poor.</P>
<P>Because pak choy generally are smaller than the heading Chinese cabbages you
can get away with a closer spacing. Sometimes I direct-seed pak choy one-half to
1-inch apart, and later thins the 2-inch-tall plants to stand 2-inches apart.
Eventually I thin the more mature plants to 4 to 6-inches apart. I use the
thinnings in salad green mixes, then harvests the remaining plants at baby,
mid-or-full size. Plants are edible even when they bolt. The blossom is
delightful, similar to our broccoli.</P>
<P>Choosing which of these delicious and undermanding greens to grow this
spring, or fall is probably the most difficult part of the job. With the many
interesting, widely adapted varieties available, you too could find yourself
putting Chinese cabbages and pak choy out front,</P>
<P>right where they belong.</P>

<H1>Grapes For Edible Landscaping</H1>
<P>How about landscaping with grapevines and a spacious arbor you can have cool
shade in your yard the second season after planting. Or grapes could give you a
hedge or screen shielding your yard from the street or some unwelcome view. Use
grapevines to soften the look of a fence or keep the wall of a building cool.
</P>
<P>Ok, so to grow grapes, you're going to have to build something to keep them
off the ground. You'll also have to cut the grapes back regularly, not just to
keep it from running wild but to get a full crop of sweet fruit. Taken together,
the trellis and the pruning technique add up to what I call &quot;the Training
system.&quot;</P>
<P>Grapes produce fruit on one-year-old wood only. Without pruning, the
fruitful wood gets farther and farther out from the trunk with each passing
season. Another good reason to prune is that grapes tend to produce-too much
fruit, which stresses the plant. Bud development for the following year suffers,
and the weaken vine is more vulnerable to winter injury. Proper pruning removes
most of the previous season's growth and with it up to 90% of the fruit buds.
That channels the plants energy into producing strong new growth and increases
the sugar content of the remaining grapes.</P>
<P>One-year-old branches on grapes are called canes The ones you leave to
produce fruit are shortened to various lengths: long canes to 8 to 12-buds each,
short canes to 4 to 7-buds each, or spurs to just 2 or 3-buds.</P>
<P>When pruning, save only the healthiest canes. Ideal cane thickness is about
pencil size, with 3 to 6-inches between the buds. Spindly canes are weal and
unproductive, while overly thick, bull canes are too vegetative. Healthy canes
are red-brown for American varieties, tan for hybrids, neither too light (which
means they haven't received enough sun) nor blackened (indicating disease or
winter damage).</P>
<P>The safest time to prune is late winter just as the buds begin to swell.
That way you can assess the extent of winter damage. It doesn't hurt the</P>
<P>vine to prune while the sap is flowing, even though the amount of bleeding
may seem extreme.</P>
<P>There's romance to many of the popular ways to use grapevines in the
landscape: an arbor shading a patio, a bower over a bench, a leafy tunnel. But
there are practical advantages to trellises as well. Keeping the vines with the
fruit buds high off the ground reduces the risk of frost damage, a big advantage
with seedless varieties, which are usually more vulnerable </P>
<P>to cold. If the structure is near the house or where people gather or pass
frequently, bird damage will be reduced. Grapes often live 75-years or more, so
your trellis will serve as a near-permanent landscape attraction. It's worth the
trouble of careful planning and high-quality construction.</P>
<P>The curtain method of training is the system currently favored by most
commercial growers. In the home landscape the curtain system is perfect if you
want to make a dense-looking hedge about 6-feet tall or grow the greatest number
of varieties in the least amount of space. Yields and sugar levels will be high,
and pruning, spraying and picking are easier.</P>
<P>The trellis is a single wire running 6-feet above the ground, supported by
sturdy posts. The grapevine's trunk goes straight up to the wire, then two
shoots extend horizontally along the wire in opposite directions to make
cordons. Fruiting canes arise every 8 to 10-inches along the cordons, and shoots
drape down on either side forming the curtain.</P>
<P>A pergola is a series of sturdy poles that carry rafters and support the
vines. Pergolas have open sides so you can see through them, with the grape
foliage overhead. They're usually built to shade patios and major walkways. The
structure's openness allows breezes to pass through and creates an island of
comfort in a hot summer landscape.</P>
<P>Grape yields can be as high as or higher than with the curtain system, but
grapes may not be as sweet because the jumbled shoots will shade each other.
</P>
<P>Depending on the size of the pergola, you may be able to plant more than one
vine. Each vine should have at least an 8 by 8-foot square area to cover;
10-feet by 10-feet would be even better. Of course you could eventually train
one vine to shade an immense area, but coverage would take several seasons. And
why not get some flavor variety into the grape crop and stretch the harvest with
early and late varieties ?</P>

<H1>Cauliflower; A Showy And Finicky Brassica</H1>
<P>Cauliflower is less tolerant to heat than most other brassica crops. If the
heads mature in the heat of late spring or early summer, they are apt to be
bitter, if they even head at all. The ideal time to plant cauliflower is in late
July or August. Attempting cauliflower in spring is a gamble at best. If you can
set out transplants about a month before your last spring frost, but remember
that spring planted cauliflower runs a higher risk of failure.</P>
<P>To maximize your chance for success, select varieties that are quick
maturing and disease-resistant. Cauliflower should be grown fast and be
harvested early. Besides, the plants require much garden space, so you want them
in and out of the garden fast.</P>
<P>The real key to successful cauliflower is in proper soil preparation.
Cauliflower likes a deeply tilled soil that's rich in organic matter and
contains plenty of nitrogen (N), which is essential for developing tasty, larger
heads. During fall garden clean-up, I plant a winter cover-crop of winter-rye in
the cauliflower bed. In the early spring, this is turned under. I also work in
manure enriched compost. A soil rich in organic matter also enhances moisture
retention without waterlogging the roots.</P>
<P>Another important consideration is soil pH. Cauliflower prefers a near
neutral pH ( around 6.5 to 6.8) for best production. A neutral soil also
prevents clubroot, a disease that commonly attacks brassica crops. Be sure to
have your soil tested to see if limestone is required.</P>
<P>I always start our own plants from seed about a month before transplanting
time. I try to transplant them on a cloudy day. It's particularly important not
to disturb the root system when setting out the transplants. Any check in
growth; transplant shock, drought, high temperatures, will cause the plants to
bolt, forming a small button instead of a full head. Each plant we transplant is
donked in a mixture of liquid seaweed before being placed in the soil, this
prevents stress and transplant shock. A successful crop of cauliflower depends
on constant pampering. Proper spacing will increase your yields significantly. I
plant cauliflower in wide beds, spacing the seedlings at least 20-inches apart
each way. This generous spacing produces larger heads and bring the plants to
maturity faster. There's also less air</P>
<P>circulation and thus a higher risk of disease problems.</P>
<P>If the roots don't have a constant, even supply of moisture, there will be a
check in heading. Cauliflower should receive 2-inches of water per week, and a
little more as the temperatures rise.</P>
<P>Once the plants are established in the garden, I mulch them with 6-inches
</P>
<P>straw. An organic mulch not only retains soil moisture, but hinders weeds,
keeps the soil <B>temperature cooler, and eventually breaks down to add
nutrients </B>to the soil.</P>
<P><B>If your cauliflower wilts even when the soil is moist, you can bet that
insects are attacking the root systems. </B>This <B>is usually the dreaded
cabbage </B>root maggot. The tiny larvae burrow into the roots just beneath the
soil surface, eventually killing the plants. I repel the insects by dusting the
mulch with wood ashes before each watering. This also repels aphids and cutworm
</P>
<P>Nothing can ruin a bed of cauliflower faster than the insidious cabbage
worm. The easiest way to handle these insects is to spray the plants with BT
(Bacillus Thuringiensis), a natural insecticide that kills only butterfly and
moth larvae. It's nontoxic to humans, animals and beneficial insects. Spray your
cauliflower once a week at the first sign of the worms, applying BT in the early
morning or evening so the worms will eat it before it dries completely.</P>
<P>Conventional varieties of cauliflower require blanching (excluding sun light
from the developing heads) for the whitest, mildest curds. When the heads are
slightly smaller than a teacup, I simply pull the larger outer leaves over the
tops and bind them with rubber bands or loose twine. I check the heads every day
or so to make sure they don't overdevelop. Normal blanching takes about a week,
but it may take up to 2-weeks in fall's chillier weather. The only problem with
this method is that the tied leaves often trap rain water, which could rot the
heads. To prevent this, untie the leaves on rainy days to allow the water to run
off.</P>
<P>To avoid the chore of blanching, try some of the self-blanching varieties.
Their leaves naturally curve over the head and do the job for you.</P>

<H1>Starting Flower's From Seed</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Growing your own plants from seed is neither difficult nor
expensive. For one thing, you don't need a collection of costly special tool and
equipment.</P>
<P>Losses from severe winterkill, over-crowding by more belligerent plants, and
neglecting to divide and reset took away a number of species I consider
essential to a good perennial border. So last spring I ordered some new seeds
and prepared a bed. Previously, I tried starting perennials in cold frames in
February and March, and also made fall plantings in September,</P>
<P>A few annuals were also planted in this seedbed and, probably because it
quickly exceeded in growth seed planted 2-weeks earlier where it was to remain.
The planting was done the first week in june, and by the first week in July I
was able to transplant some of the perennials to their permanent beds. While we
were getting some nice rains.</P>
<P>Lupines, in particular, need to be transplanted when very small, for they
have a long taproot, and do not do well if this is broken. This is also true of
hollhocks, and it is really better to plant these where they are to remain.</P>
<P>The gilia. or standing cypress, one of the most striking plants in the
border when in bloom, is not difficult to grow if it is plantted where water
will not be over the crown during the first year of its growth. It is not a
long-lived perennial, and perhaps should be treated as a triennial with new seed
planted each year. Once started, it will reseed itself. Just remember to set the
plants on higher ground, and do not let leaves mat on it during the winter.
Small branches may be placed on the plants before the leaves drift over them to
help protect them over winter.</P>
<P>Not all garden seed catalogs list gilia, but the rubra variety will grow
from 4 to 6-feet high, with great spikes of scarlet blooms. By watching the
plants and the weather, I am able to transplant all the plants that I have
places for by August, keeping them watered. Thus they become well  <B>established
during the </B>fall growing season, ready for immediate growth when spring
arrives.</P>
<P>There are three requirements, or rules which must be observed by any
gardener; be them a rank beginner or the most experienced green-thumber. 1) A
well-prepared level seedbed of good organic soil. Notice the emphasis on level.
Fine seed, and much seed is fine, must be planted very shallow. Even a slight
slope will erode with the hard rains common in spring, and </P>
<P>valuable seed will be washed out or covered too deeply. So select the spot
</P>
<P>for a seedbed with this in mind. Prepare the soil carefully, leaving no</P>
<P>clods, and firm it well. A board laid down and walked on several times,</P>
<P>repeating until the whole bed is well flattened, is the best way to </P>
<P>accomplish this, or, wait for a good rain to settle the soil.</P>
<P>2) Never let the surface of the bed dry out. Make the bed within reach of
</P>
<P>the garden hose, so that it may be thoroughly showered every day with a</P>
<P>fine spray of water.</P>
<P>3) Secure fresh seed from a reliable garden seed catalog. Do not depend on
</P>
<P>a packet of seeds from your local supermarket. Flower seeds are very </P>
<P>short-lived, and many will sprout only the first year. No reliable seed co.
</P>
<P>will send out old seeds, and most will guarantee satisfaction.</P>
<P>Another advantage in ordering from a garden seed catalog is that you have a
big variety to choose from. There are many newer introductions of almost every
species, and it may have been one of these you admired so much in one of your
friends garden. So it is advisable to inquire as to the particular variety when
viewing other gardens.</P>

<H1>Portulaca, Small, Colorful Flower's</H1>
<P><B>     </B>The single, semi-double and double varieties of portulaca all
are members of the widespread Purslane family. While small, they have great
charm, many uses, and an uncanny ability to transform a poor, sandy spot into a
thick carpet of green foliage and colorful flowers. The rugged little plants
grow well in ordinary garden soil, but prefer a soil mixture of garden loam,
leaf mold, and coarse sand. And although they do reasonably well in partial
shade, the flowers will bloom best only in a location that is in full sun, and
is well drained.</P>
<P>Even though you may not be able to grow any other flower in a particular
spot on your grounds, you'll more than likely succeed with portulaca. Its seeds
need moisture while germinating, but once the plants become established, they
can withstand desert-like conditions for long periods of time.</P>
<P>Although portulaca does well on a poor soil, it does much better on one
fortified with composted manure and leaf mold, turned in a few weeks before
planting time. If possible, plant in direct sunlight, no matter how hot the
location becomes in midsummer. Three weeks before I sow portulaca seed I work
the soil well to a depth of at least 7-inches; because it is naturally sandy,
good drainage is provided without adding coarse sand.</P>
<P>Portulaca seed is almost as fine as that of petunias. If just sown loosely,
the planting will probably consist of little more than thick, scattered clumps.
To prevent uneven sowings, I place the seed in a small paper bag, then drop in
handful of dry soil. After giving the bag a good shaking, broadcast the mixture
over the worked area, then rake it gently into the top 1/4-inch layer of soil
with an iron rake. No other cover is necessary.</P>
<P>If no rain is in sight, I wet the entire planted area thoroughly with a fine
spray from the garden hose, and make certain the soil remains reasonably moist
until germination takes place. After the plants are about an inch tall, they are
on their own, except for a weekly watering perhaps if a long dry spell should
hit</P>
<P>Thinning is usually not necessary if seed is mixed with soil or sand before
planting. Thinning actually depends on the purpose you want the portulaca to
serve. If you grow them mainly for their colorful flowers, space them 4 to
6-inches apart in all directions for better bloom. If you Drefer a thick ground
cover. the closer plants are, the better. </P>
<P>(2)</P>
<H1>Portulaca, Small, Colorful Flower's</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Because of their low, creeping habit, portulaca varieties are
excellent for rock gardens, borders, around the base of lamp posts, and as turf
in hot, dry spots where lawn grass refuses to catch on, or where a sandy
embankment needs cover to prevent soil erosion.</P>
<P>Shortly after portulaca plants sprout, they begin to spread and bloom;
continuing until frost even though old blossoms and seed heads are not remove.
In fact, it is wise to allow seed heads to remain as this is the plant's means
of self-sowing for the coming year.</P>
<P>Portulaca is a flower that has been grown and enjoyed in gardens for many
generations, and is known by several different names: purslane, sun plant, rose
moss, as well as portulaca.</P>
<P>One spring my grand mother planted a pack of seed beside our garden gate
Every spring after that the spot abounded in portulaca blossoms of brilliant
yellow, pink and scarlet. Much to my childhood delight, they had reseeded
themselves from year to year.</P>
<P>So, if you have a problem spot in your garden, or just don't have much time
to devote to flowers, brighten your surroundings with masses of cheerful
portulaca.</P>

<H1>Pyracantha, A Happy Shrub Choice For Home </H1>
<H1>Grounds</H1>
<P><B>     </B>Pyracantha can be planted either in the spring or fall.
Adaptable and accommodating as pyracantha is in so many respects, however, watch
out when you're choosing plants. It can be extremely contrary about
transplanting, so if possible choose container-grown plants.</P>
<P>But, if you have a neighbor who owns a pyracantha, don't hestitate to try
your luck with rooting your own cuttings. July is the best time to take
cuttings. For rooting, my favorite method has come to be equal parts of soil and
peat moss topped with vermiculite. Make your cuttings 3 to 5-inches long,
directly below a node which is a leaf joint. Remove the lower leaves and then
press the slips into your rooting mixture. You can root several cuttings at a
time in a deep box or cold frame if you have one, but I prefer to pot each
cutting individually. Pyracantha just does not like transplanting, so why risk
injuring roots when digging up new plants ?</P>
<P>Water thoroughly after potting and keep the cuttings in as humid an
atmosphere as possible. A large jar placed over each one will help preserve
moisture. Keep pots in a place where they will not get direct sun yet will
receive good light. When I put the pots into my cold frame, I keep the sash
closed most of the time except for about 20-minutes each morning. This morning
airing gives me a chance to remove any yellowed or fallen leaves.</P>
<P>Cuttings will root in about 8 to 10-weeks, but will not be ready to be
planted out in the open until the following spring. When you feel that yours are
ready to go it alone, soak the pots in a mix of water, seaweed, and liquid fish
thoroughly the night before, and again just before you take the cutting out.
Then soil, roots and plants will slip out easily like a cake out of pan.</P>
<P>Whether you're the kind of gardener who prunes strictly according to the
calendar, or when you have the shears handy, you shouldn't find this plant
difficult to manage. Pyracantha can be pruned anytime, the amount depending upon
the use to which your shrub has been put. For a hedge, shear it closely so that
later growth will be twiggy with dense foliage. Or perhaps you have the space to
allow your shrubs to grow naturally. The graceful, arching branches are indeed
lovely.</P>
<P>I mulch my pyracantha the year-round. For summer, a 2-inch mulch of co-co
shell mulch is sufficient. coco shell's are an attractive light brown color and
will keep moisture from evaporating from the soil while not preventing water
from penetrating into the ground. In winter you'll need a deeper mulch of straw
or leaves to keep plants adequately protected. Unless rainfall has been
plentiful during the autumn, make sure that the </P>
<P>planting is given at least 4-heavy soakings before frost arrives. This is
important because when the ground is frozen hard shrubs cannot draw moisture
from it.</P>
<P>And what can you plant that will get along well with pyracantha ? Lilac,
another spring-flowering shrub, will be quite compatible since it too is fond of
a sunny location and an alkaline soil. Try iris, carnations or phlox for
summer-blooming perennials that will make an attractive fore-ground planting.
Among annuals, alyssum and nasturtiums make a good choice.</P>
<P>Pyracantha is ideal for foundation plantings. Also a fast-growing,
good-looking hedge, it will assure privacy. It can be used as a vine and is
excellent for espalier since its long branches make tremendous growth in a
season or two and can be easily trained. Or, you can allow this shrub to grow
naturally. Unrestricted by pruning, it makes a rounded, wide-spreading,
many-stemmed plant up to 12-feet.</P>
<P>Whether you choose pyracantha for its spring flowers, winter foliage, or
autumn berries, I think you will enjoy it. Besides isn't it fun to see something
so pretty grow faster than the weeds ?</P>

<H1>The Salad Garden</H1>
<P><B>     </B>I prefer to start my lettuce in the cold frame, although it can
be planted in the open ground with other early vegetables, because I get a crop
of tender, young lettuce when I transplant in April. By that time, the young
plants are 3 to 5-inches high, and pinching off the largest leaves gives me
several fine bowlfuls of tasty salad greens.</P>
<P>~ Both cabbage and lettuce may be started in the cold frame. Flats, boxes,
cel-packs, or even flower pots with drainage holes can be used too for starting
these salad plants in an enclosed porch which is neither too hot or too cold.
</P>
<P>Later, in the salad garden I transplant 9-plants to the square-foot, using a
sharpened 2-inch peg 6-inches long for making planting holes and for tamping
down. After planting a section, 3 to 5-square feet, I soak the soil.</P>
<P>But first, I turn the soil of the salad garden either with the spading fork
or tiller. Next I drive small, one-foot stakes along both sides and across the
ends of each area at one-foot intervals. Strings attached to the stakes are run
across and the length of the garden to mark the 12-by-12-inch areas. At each
intersection, I plant an onion set about 2-inches deep. Cabbages and cucumbers
are planted in the center row of each space, while Swiss chard; very productive
from early spring to late fall, is planted in the outer row to give it more
space and avoid over-crowding, thinned 7 to 10 inches in the row. Sometimes I
pull the leaves and use them for mulch when we are unable to keep up with their
heavy production.</P>
<P>I prefer baby head cabbage for the congested growing salad garden. The heads
are small and firm, about 5-inches across, of superb quality, and highly
resistant to bursting. More than that, they seem to have a higher resistance to
the cabbage worms.</P>
<P>Tomatoes and sweet peppers are set out in the corner areas opposite f' each
other at the ends of each garden. Plant the beets, carrots and turnips in a
shallow furrow about one-inch deep made with a stick or hand trowel. Space the
beet seed about 1/2-inch apart and cover with a 1/2-inch of soil. Thin your
young plants gradually to 4 or 5-inch spacing and let your thinning process be
your harvest, as the tops of beets, carrots and turnips are high in nutritional
value.</P>
<P>Radishes, a quick-maturing crop, may be planted with carrots, and in special
rows with your beets and carrots. Being long, White Icicle is more productive
than the more colorful varieties. Radishes may also be plant afall crop. and
some may wish to try the Black Spanish at that time. </P>
<P>Mid-June, when the lettuce is harvested, is the time to plant second crop
beets and carrots for fall use. Before planting, I like to work some
fine-compost and 4-6-4 organic fertilizer into the soil. To insure seed
germination, I take a garden hose with a nozzle to control the flow and flood
the furrows. After the seeds are dropped into the furrow, I cover them with a
half-inch of fine-compost,</P>
<P>Where it is possible to mulch, spread as much straw, hay or green lawn
clippings as you can. During the hot, dry summer weather remember that a least
2-inches of water per week will be needed, and that proper thinning of the
plants will help to insure a more bountiful crop.</P>
<P>After the last harvest has been made in late fall, prepare your salad garden
for the winter and next year's crop. I do this by first cleaning the garden,
tilling under all residues, after which I apply kelp meal, compost, and
greensand, all this should be worked into the soil with a spading fork or
tiller.</P>
<P>Finally, full of anticipation for a new crop, I rake the mulch from the soil
about 3 to 5-weeks before planting time so sun and spring winds may dry it for
an early beginning to a new gardening year.</P>

<H1>Home-Yard Landscaping; The Most Frequent Planting </H1>
<H1>Blunders</H1>
<P>Using too much fertilizer; some people seem to think that a strong dose of
organic fertilizer will make a newly planted tree grow like and old, already
established tree. All they usually succeed in doing is injuring the roots and
and making the tree look worse than before. After planting in well-prepare soil,
it is best to allow the tree time to establish and start normal growth before
applying any kind of fertilizer.</P>
<P>Planting broad-leaved evergreens in too much wind: If you have ever climbed
mountain trails, or studied pictures of windswept mountains, you will remember
grotesque and tortured pines, fir, spruce, etc. on the ridge. Often all the
needle-growth will be on the side of the tree away from the wind, but still they
live, for Nature has designed needles so that wind slips through them easily.
</P>
<P>So, in very windy yards or in almost any yard where the wind whistles around
a corner or through a breezeway a needled evergreen will often survive.</P>
<P>Yet in the same location a perfectly temperature-hardy broad-leaved
evergreen may batter badly each winter. Nature just didn't intend most
broad-leaved evergreens for windy places. These do much better in quiet
locations in the yard. For you see, broad leaves present a surface to the wind
like a kite. Particularly when frozen, some leaves may be twirled off by the
wind; other leaves may break or bend so that the veins are severed and all or
part of the leaf turns brown.</P>
<P>If you have a broad-leaved evergreen in a windy place that is not doing
well, why not move it to a more favorable spot ? The east side of the house is
often very good. The improvement in a year or two may amaze you !</P>
<P>Planting directly into clay without any soil preparation: Growers seldom
think of a plant's root area as a burlapped ball or pot. They think of an azalea
as a mass of hair roots. They see a magnolia as a mat of venturesome,
asparagus-like roots. When planting in the nursery they use leaf-mold, peat moss
or compost for hairy-rooted things and select good friable soil areas for most
other types. No organic grower in their right mind would ever set out nursery
stock in the kind of clay subsoil that is often found in a new housing
development after the bulldozers have been at play. Yet new home owners are <B>often
stuck with this type of soil and must make the </B>best of it.<B>Fully half of
the dead, or sick landscape plantings which I see these </B>days are <B>caused
by innocent homeowners planting shrubbery right into </B>heavy, poor soil. It is
against Nature to plant fine-rooted things in other than a well
prepared,humusy,loose soil,but it is a lesson costly to learn by experience. 
</P>
<P>Planting shade-loving shrubs in too much sun: Certainly many azaleas,
rhododendrons, andromedas, hollies, dogwoods, etc., are native to woodlands or
woods-edges. In their native state they have been protected from strong sun by
the shade above, and from strong wind by the density of the forest. So, in our
home-yards if we plant them in very windy locations or hot sunny spots, we're
just asking for trouble. Note: Try to duplicate growing conditions which
prevailed in natural environment.</P>
<P>Mistreating plants from warmer, drier climates: Pyracantha is noted for its
showy masses of berries, yet often refuses to berry at all when planted in the
shade. It also has a reputation of being hard to transplant. It is easy to
understand why these things are true when you consider that pyracantha is native
to a semi-desert region of hot sunshine and limited rainfall. Nature has taught
it to send roots way down in search of water.</P>
<P>Many homeowners fall in love with Southern shrubs when on vacation and bring
a few home. These usually winter burn when planted in cold, windy spots in your
yard. Yet things like crepe myrtle and Chinese holly will grow quite far north
if planted on the sunny, quite side of the house. This is because the
wind-sheltered sunny side of the house really has a climate all its own, a
little bit of the South.</P>
<P>Planting too deep: Surface feeder roots of trees and shrubs need  aeration.
It is natural and good when fallen leaves and twigs form a  mulch over the roots
in the forests. Natural mulches are loose and  permit air to reach the top
feeder rootless.</P>
<P>It is unnatural when soil is piled over the roots, shutting out  air and
often causing root rot and the slow death of the tree. This  smothering effect
is what makes a big tree die after a year or two  when its roots are buried by
levelling operations at a new housing  development.</P>
<P>When you buy an evergreen the old leaves are healthy because they  were
grown in good soil at the proper depth. If the new leaves that  grow at your
home are very small and sickly, it can be the shock of  transplanting, but more
often it is because of planting too deep. Such  sick trees should be dug up and
replanted with lots of compost around  the roots so that they will have
something to push out into that they  like. Mulch well on top with 2-inches of
leaf mold or peat moss.</P>
<P>We all like to keep from weeding, and thick mulches are a wonderful  help.
It is well, however, to use mulching materials which have large  enough
particles or which are naturally loose enough to allow air to  pass through.
</P>
<P>Letting overgrown shrubbery take over your home: Why do we see so  much
overgrown shrubbery ? The cause is really quite simple: When the  homeowner is
faced with a limited budget they have two real choices in  landscaping. They may
start with smaller-sized things of the type which  may be sheared to size or
which do not become too large. Then, too,  developers add to the problems by
landscaping new homes with inexpensive  rapid-growing shrubs.</P>
<P>If your shrubbery has become over-grown, or if you have moved  into a house
with overgrown shrubbery, why not plan to do something  about it ? One way is to
budget the job, and do one side of the house  each year.</P>
<P>The idea of saving overgrown shrubbery, or moving it elsewhere in  the yard
in these days <B>of high labor cost's, just to save the tree, </B>is  often
pure foolishness. What's the harm in weeding out undesirable, overgrown 
shrubbery ? <B>It is no worse than </B>cleaning out <B>underbrush in the woods
</B>or  mowing an abandoned lot to improve its appearance. Plant something new, 
interesting and worthwhile. .... Therein lies true conservation. </P>
<P>Now, you don't have to follow a landscape plan to enjoy planting your home.
Home-yard landscaping is a joy to each in their own way. Some homeowner like to
collect and plant most every kind that they can find so that their yard is like
a small arboretum. Others like expanse of lawn and little planting except near
the house. Lilacs beside a fence will be every bit as lovely as those in the
flower border. A dogwood in full bloom overshadowing that tool shed can be a
thing of absolute beauty.</P>
<P>After all, isn't working in the yard a way of getting back to a more natural
way of life at least for a few hours each week ? Isn't it a means of losing
yourself in something that you wish to do where you can create things in your
own way at your own speed in a healthy outdoor atmosphere ? What a relief to
come home from office or factory where you have worked at a mechanical pace
indoors, and then be able to relax and do what you wish outdoors !</P>
<P>Seems to me that the happiest people these days are those who have opened
their minds to some of that curiosity they used to have when they were kids.
They ask questions, they visit and talk, they read...,they Team, for the
learning is fun. &quot;All learning begin's with the simple pharse,I Don't Know.&quot;

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The Earthworms as Fertilizer Factory</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>Earthworms</H1>
<P>Ordinarily,normal farming procedures stipulates the use of chemical
analysis to determine the basic nutrient needs for the planted crop. 
The element which is not in sufficient supply in the soil for a certain
crop is then applied in the form of chemical fertilizer.  The microbial
life in the soil is given little consideration.  In countries with
climatic extremes, this has led to regarding soil as a mere holding
media for crop plants.</P>
<P>The bio-organic farmer's priority is to increase the humus content
in the soil.  Rich in humus, the soil soaks up water and holds it more
effectively,remains loose,aerated,and warm, and does not blow away or
cake up.  Further,it can better withstand the pressure of wheels and
skid marks of farm machinery.  Humus is a vast reservoir of all kinds of
plant nutrients.  It cannot be replaced by artificial means.  In the
living soil,the microbiological processes decompose crop residue and
manure into plant nutrients and humus.  They produce acid-sand release
minerals for the benefit of the plants.  Soil microbes have the ability
to release P,K,Ca,Mg,Fe,and S,as well as other trace elements from
various soil components.</P>
<P><EM>G.Lienhard, instructor at the School of Agriculture in
Ebenrain-Sissach (Switzerland) praises the earthworm:
<STRONG>"The earthworm increases the nutrients in the soil
significantly"</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Soil tests taken at Ebenrain showed that worm castings had ,on
average,twice as much potassium as normal soil,with a maximum of 4.5
times as much.  Soil that passed through the earthworm contains
approximately seven times as much nitrogen.  The earthworm,working as a
"fine drainage maker"not only improves the water and air circulation in
the soil,but also mixes organic and mineral substances.  They
are,then,the smallest fertilizer factories which keep working at no cost
to the farmer.  The work is done on the spot without fossil fuels and no
transportation is involved.  However, as with all life phenomena in the
soil,they are susceptible creatures and will not survive the application
of poisons and aggressive chemical fertilizer.</P>
<P><I>It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which
played so important a part in the history of the world,as have these
lowly creatures. Charles .r. Darwin of earthworms.</I></P>
<P>There have been many studies on earthworms since Darwins
observations.  Most of these do not seem to agree over -<I>How deep do
earthworms dig?  What is the length of burrows?etc.</I></P>
<P>We can be sure of one principle:  If one digs and finds earthworms
at 8 meters depth one can make a fair assumption that earthworms can be
found at more than 8 meters depth,because of probability is very high
that one did not dig out the deepest burrow there is.</P>
<P>To find the probabilities of burrow depth, we need a set of
statistical data concerning burrows-and this is impractical because of
the wide distribution we would find(beecause of the variety in
soil,climate,and species).</P>
<P>There are many Famlies of earthworms.  The most widely represented
is <I>Lumbricidae</I>with over 160 species(2-30cm[1-12in.],and the
giant(up to 3 meters[10ft.]long )Australian <I>Megascolecidae(Megascolides
Australis)</I></P>
<P>Earthworms are generally feeding on organic matter that has started
to decompose,mammalian dung and the deep burrowing species feed on
soil(geophanous species),some even feed on nematodes.  It has been found
that nematode population may decrease by as much as 60% when earthworms
are added to soil.
</P>
<P>Also microbes play an important part of an earthworms diet, and
earthworms even prefer organic matter with high concentrations of
microbial life.  Some researchers suggest that some microorganisms are
essential to earthworms.</P>
<P>Water is a major necessity of earthworms as they contain about 80%
water,by weight and loose about 15% per day.  If moisture is not
available they will dig deep into the soil to find it.  The water uptake
is related to surrounding temperature.  The generalized limits to
earthworm activity are form 273K (32 degrees F) for the lower limit to
303K(86 degreesF) for the upper temperature limit.</P>
<P><STRONG>EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT</STRONG></P>
<P>Generally we can see the effects of earthworms on the environment in
three ways:</P>
<DL><DT>Biological</DT>
<DD>microbial concentration</DD>
<DT>Chemical</DT>
<DD>mineral availability,organic matter decomposition</DD>
<DT>Physical</DT>
<DD>burrows(aeration.etc.)casts(mineral movement between horizons)</DD></DL>
<P>For sake of simplicity and because these three effects are so
closely related let us consider the biological,chemical,and physical
effects of earthworms on their environment together.</P>
<P>The effects of earthworms on crop production vary widely from test
to test.  This not only because of species,crip,and soil type but also
the weather conditions at the time of test.  For example, it has been
shown that in orchards with high population of earthworms the trees have
larger root systems by 40%.  Yet yields are only 2% higher in these
orchards.  One would need to examine the stress resistivity (yields in
years of drought,ect.)of the orchards to find the true value of the
earthworm effects on yields.  Nevertheless yield increases as high as
900% have been observed on clover and 100% on wheat.</P>
<P>Often roots follow the burrows and feed on the more available
nutrients in the immediate vicinity(within 2mm). An amazing fact is that
roots often seek out the earthworm casts. This happens even if the roots
have to grow upward!  The reason for this is that the earthworms (or the
microbes present in their gut) have concentrated high amounts of growth
factors and vitaimins into the casts.</P>
<P>The burrowing of earthworms helps bring up minerals to the A horizon
from the B and C horizons.  At the same time the lower horizons get
enriched with the organic matter from the upper A and O horizions (see
Soil Layers).This intermixing plus the increase of oxygen and water
penetration to the lower horizons increases the depth of the top soil.</P>
<H3>As much as a 2cm (1 inch) thick layer of subsoil may be brought to
the surfa e per year by the burrowing of earthworms.</H3>
<P>Another effect on the environment is that the casts are always more
neutral (closer to pH 7) then the surrounding soil.  This helps
neutralize the acids or alkali that may be present in the soil therby
optimizing the pH for the root development of mayority of cultivated
plants.</P>
<P>A mucosal substance rich in proteins lines the wall of the burrows. 
This substance in turn serves as energy source for microbes.  The
concentration of nitrifying microbes has been observed to be about 40%
higher in the burrows then in the rest of the soil.</P>
<H5>This means that where there are earthworms there is good soil.  For
that reason,the earthworm is an ideal tool with which to measure the
quality of the soil. An ebenrain the "rule of the fist"is:When plowing
if you can count 80 earthworms for every 10 steps in the furrow,then the
soil is good."</H5>
<H1>X.SUMMARY</H1>
<P>The important part of organic matter is its decomposition process. 
Ideally the first part of decomposition is carried out apart from the
soil(pile composting).</P>
<P>As the organic matter is added to the soil the decomposition will
yield valuable nutrients to the soil(mineralization), these are in
available form and are used by the plants.  Clay plays an important roll
as its layers provide spaces for microorganisms to function.  Good
structure in the soil provides the growing plants with needed nutrients
and makes for a fast turnover of organic matter. </P>
<P>The other part of decomposition yields humus and in combining humic
acids,with clay yields stable humus.  This part of the soil is
relatively static as its name "stable" implies.  Stable humus in the
soil is like a storehouse of nutrients that are accessed only in times
of low decomposing organic matter.  So one could see it as a buffer for
nutrients.  When no or low levels of organic matter are present stable
humus supplies the needed nutrients.  This can only be accomplished with
the help of healthy microflora .  In addition stable humus provides a
buffer for water and pH in the soil.</P>

<HTML><TITLE>Weed Mining:</TITLE>
<BODY><P>Tero Laakkonen   yo!    a couple of monhs ago i posted here
asking if anyone knew which  deep-rooted plants i should grow to "mine"
P & K in order to leave it for  plants with not very deep roots?</P>
<P><EM>Robert Kourik's _Designing and Maintaining Your Edible
Landscape Naturally_</EM>describes "dynamic accumulators" as "plants
that amass a greater than usual amount of a particular nutrient in their
foliage," because they (a) accumulate an element in higher
concentrations than other plants, even on soils deficient in that
element? (b) thrive on soils with high concentrations of the element or
(c) send their roots down to layers where the nutrients are in
abundance.  Your question relates to (c) which is harder to measure than
the concentration of elements in the leaves.
</P>
<P>
Dynamic accumulators of phosphorus include legumes, buckwheat, and
mustard (Brassica).  Phosphorus is often in the soil in a form that is
not available to plants; growing alfalfa in a field over a number of
years steadily increases the amount of available phosphorus.  Buckwheat
and mustard solubilize phosphorus and subsequently excrete it from their
roots.  Other dynamic accumulators of phosphorus are bridal bower,
calamus, caraway, chamomile, chickweed, dandelion, dock, garlic, lamb's
quarters, lemon balm, licorice, marigold, meadow sweet, pigweed,
purslane, sarsparilla (sassafras), skunk cabbage, sorrel, watercress and
yarrow. 
</P>
<P>Potassium may also be present in a form that isn't usuable to
plants, so liberating the potassium present in the topsoil may be as
important as bringing it up from the subsoil.  Green bracken ferns were
used as a source of potash for washing in England.  Other potassium
accumulators include  bridal bower, calamus, cattail, century plant,
chamomile, chickweed, chicory, coltsfoot, comfrey, dandelion, dock,
eyebright, lamb's quarters, mullein, stinging nettles, oak, parsley,
peppermint, pigweed, plantain, sanicle,  silverweed, sow thistle,
creeping thistle, vetch, watercress, waywort, and yarrow.
</P>
<P>Oak leaves have high levels of calcium even when there are low
levels of calcium in the soil.  I don't know what this means in terms of
calcium "mining."  Maybe the deep roots bring calcium up, or maybe the
upper roots strip calcium from the surface soil.   Kourik doesn't have
any numbers.  He refers to  several books that might be more
statistically oriented:  Joseph Cocannour, _Weeds: Guardians of the
Soil._ Ben Easey, _Practical Organic Gardening._ Stuart Hill, _Weeds as
Indicators of Soil Conditions._ Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, _Weeds and What
They Tell_

<BODY><P>GREEN LACEWING TECHNICAL BULLETIN  RINCON-VITOVA INSECTARIES,
INC.  SUPPLIERS OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS SINCE 1960 P. O. BOX 95, OAK VIEW,
CA. 93022               (805) 643-5407   FAX 805-643-6267   OUTSIDE CA
800-248-2847   Outline (need 2700 words total)  BENEFITS OF BIOCONTROL 
Biological control with beneficial insects makes dollars and sense, even
in  chemically sprayed fields. Growers using Rincon-Vitova's green
lacewings  and other beneficials (all natural, none genetically
engineered) to augment  indigenous natural enemies can expect to improve
profits by reducing or  eliminating pesticide use. Residue problems,
costs of sprays, scheduling  sprays around irrigations and when workers
are not present, health and  safety liability risks, even insurance
costs, may be reduced when  beneficial insects assume more pest
management chores.   In many cases, crop yield and quality improve as
previously unrecognized  adverse pesticide effects on plant physiology
disappear. Resistance  problems, and outbreaks of secondary pests like
spider mites, whiteflies  and leafminers are avoided. There are also
public relations and marketing  benefits from using this "green",
environmentally-friendly alternative to  conventional chemical control. 
NATURE'S BEST ALL-AROUND PREDATORS  Green lacewings are "proven
broad-spectrum biological control agents," says  Donald Norlund of the
USDA-ARS in Weslaco, Texas. Very few pest species  escape hungry green
lacewings. Green lacewings devour eggs and young larvae  of Colorado
potato beetles, most caterpillars (worms), corn borers, aphids,  spider
mites, scales, psylla, mealybugs, whiteflies, thrips, leafhoppers  etc.
It takes a very hard shell or thick waxy coating to deter green 
lacewing feeding.   Adult green lacewings have beautifully delicate
light green bodies,  sparkling golden eyes and diaphanous lacy wings.
Adults depend upon pollen,  nectar and insect honeydew for sustenance.
Eggs are protectively layed on  the tips of stalks resembling miniature
cattails growing from plant  foliage. Adult lacewings live longer and
lay more eggs (which hatch into  voracious larvae in less than a week)
when supplied plant pollens.  Mottled, grayish-brown, alligator-shaped
lacewing larvae (3/8 inch long  before pupating) actively search for,
seize in their pincers and suck the  juices out of small caterpillars
(e.g. armyworms, budworms, bollworms, corn  earworms, cabbage loopers,
codling moth etc.), flea beetles (e.g. on  cruciferous oil seed crops)
and a wide range of small soft-bodied sucking  pests like aphids, spider
mites, thrips, psyllids, mealybugs, scales and  whiteflies. During its
2-3 week life, one lone lacewing larva can consume  250 leafhopper
nymphs (4th-5th instar on grapes), 300-400 aphids, 11,200  spider mites,
3,780 coccid scales or 6,500 scale eggs (on pine trees).  Lacewings work
well on tree, vine, field and row crops, as well as in  greenhouses and
on interior plantscapes.   DIFFERENT SPECIES AVAILABLE  Rincon-Vitova
Insectaries, Inc., raises several species in the green  lacewing natural
enemy complex (1200 species are known worldwide),  including Chrysoperla
carnea, Chrysoperla comanche and Chrysoperla  rufilabris.   Unless there
are indications for using one species, growers, gardeners and 
researchers value the genetic diversity of our mixture. A mixture of 
species insures colonization of diverse habitats (e.g. ground covers, 
trees, shrubs). Rincon-Vitova's staff will be happy to advise callers on
 the best species or species mixture for their particular situation. 
CHRYSOPERLA CARNEA  Chrysoperla carnea is the old standby, a workhorse
predator that has helped  librate many farms from the pesticide
treadmill. Bred from stock collected  in heavily sprayed southern
California valleys, Rincon-Vitova's C. carnea  are ideal for farms
making the transition from pesticides to biological  control.
Researchers report that C. carnea is resistant to multiple  pesticides.
Rincon-Vitova does not test for pesticide resistance or make  specific
claims, but growers and consultants are welcome to order sample  batches
and do their own testing for compatibility with compounds used in  their
IPM programs.   Chrysoperla carnea is a broad habitat species found from
lowlands to high  mountains. Thus, C. carnea is recommended for all
field crops, trees, vines  and gardens. C. carnea does well at low
humidities (higher egg laying and  survival), in contrast to C.
rufilabris, which is better for high humidity  areas. and attacks more
than 100 insect and spider mite pests.   In the warmest areas, there may
be 7-8 generations of C. carnea, which  means that high populations of
this natural enemy can build up from early  season inoculative releases,
particularly when insect pests (e.g. on early  cover crops) provide
honeydew needed to stimulate egg laying by this  species. Mated females
can lay 20-40 eggs per night, and have the ability  to take evasive
aerial dives to avoid bats.  Eggs or larval C. carnea are recommended
for field release on a weekly  basis to create overlapping generations
in the field. The larvae do most of  the pest eating, pupate, and turn
into adults. Adult C. carnea have a  strong flight urge, and may fly for
3-4 hours each of their first two  nights before being ready to settle
down, feed and lay eggs (fifth day  after adult emergence). This is an
evolutionary adaptation to following  their major food source, aphids,
in a downwind migration. This nomadic  strategy is suited for rapidly
changing temporary habitats, and allows C.  carnea to avoid its own
natural enemies. These evening downwind flights are  visible 1-5 feet
above crop level; insect honeydew (or the amino acid  tryptophan in
fields) induces C. carnea to reverse direction and even fly  upwind into
the odor plume to search the upper parts of plants.  Pea aphid honeydew
is one of the best egg laying stimulants for C. carnea  -- hence,
Rincon-Vitova recommends soil-building legume cover and alternate  host
crops with pea aphids are highly recommended. =C. carnea lays single 
eggs near aphid colonies and uses the breakdown product of the amino
acid  tryptophan, indoacetaldehyde, to orient to honeydew. lacewing book
(LB): p.  86 C. carnea feed greedily on sunflower and corn pollen, also
flower  nectar, and honeydew of Planococcus citri (enhances fecundity)
-- i.e. does  best when pollen and pests. aphid honeydew stimulates
fecundity. early  spring adults emerg will even scrape dried honeydew

about 300 eggs.  C. carnea is also adaptable enough to overwinter,
though it will migrate  when faced with shortages of food (hence, a
variety of continuous blooming  cover and strip intercrops are
recommended to provide a continuous supply  of pollen, nectar and insect
foods). Cover crops (even weeds) and low  vegetation provide C. carnea
overwintering sites. Food supplements late in  the season enhance
overwintering survival; additional food supplements  early in season
help emerging overwintering adults survive and lay eggs for  next
generation. (give pop. increase numbers from one lacewing to support 
this strategy)  C. carnea populations can be monitored by suction
sampling (D-Vac) of low  plants, counting numbers of eggs per random
sample of plant material,  beating branches over a tray to sample larvae
or by sweep net sample. Peak  flights can be observed just after sunset
from shady roosts like rows of  sunflowers along field margins.  
Chrysoperla carnea can live for almost 3 months, longer when
overwintering  C. carnea adults overwinter in dark dry places like dead
leaf litter and  undersides of bark. Successful overwintering requires a
high intake of  foods like corn pollen during the short days of late
summer. Adults  preparing to overwinter turn brownish-yellow and cluster
together. In  Germany, growers purchase commercial overwintering
shelters stuffed with  wheat straw and painted red or brown to attract
lacewings.   CHRYSOPERLA RUFILABRIS  Though best known for aphid control
in tree (e.g. pecans) and field crops  in the South and East,
Chrysoperla rufilabris is also a valuable ally  against tough pests like
sweetpotato whitefly in cotton and other crops  from Texas to
California's irrigated deserts. C. rufilabris comes on strong  in mid to
late summer, when C. carnea (best early season species) decline  in
number.  Chrysoperla rufilabris is adapted to humid areas, but
irrigation raises  plant canopy humidity enough in western deserts to
make C. rufilabris a  valuable ally against tough pests like sweetpotato
whitefly in California's  Imperial Valley. Rincon-Vitova's Chrysoperla
rufilabris breeding stock is  collected from heavily sprayed pecan
growing areas in Georgia in the hopes  of introducing genes for
pesticide resistance to benefit growers making the  transition from
pesticides to greater reliance on biological control.   Adult
Chrysoperla rufilabris lay 10-30 eggs per day, and, lacking the  strong
migratory wanderlust of C. carnea, stay in release areas. There are  2-3
generation per year. Crapemyrtle is a good alternate host plant for C. 
rufilabris.   CHRYSOPERLA COMANCHE  Chrysoperla comanche, a close
relative of C. rufilabris, dominates many  California vineyards,
particularly later in the season when C. carnea goes  into diapause
(resting state). C. comanche is still a relatively unknown  species, but
University of California studies (Daane et al.) reveal amazing  pest
control potential.   For example, one female Chrysoperla comanche fed a
leafhopper diet can lay  1,100 eggs, making explosive population growth
possible for control of mid-  to late-season pests. Alternatively,
inoculating a field with 20 adult  female C. comanche per acre is the
equivalent of releasing 20,000 lacewing  eggs. Adding a lacewing food
supplement spray to fields boosts C. comanche  egg laying by 150%.  
RELEASE BASICS  Releases should start when pest levels are low, then
every one to four  weeks as needed. 1 lacewing can produce 200 in 30
days, 40,000 progeny in  60 days (hence, start releases as soon as first

Lacewings  are shipped as mixed species of eggs and will begin  hatching
within 1 to 4 days after delivery.  Hatch rate is fastest at an 
incubation temperature of 80!F  to 90!F (such as in a small ice chest
with  a hot water bottle).  If there is no food supply, the larvae will
begin to  eat each other.  The eggs are dispersed in a carrier of either
vermiculite  or rice hulls along with moth eggs for food for the early
hatchers.  At  first signs of hatching, sprinkle them as close to pest
infestations as  possible.  Small amounts can also be placed in paper
cups and stapled to  leaves.   EGGS ON CARDS:  Releasing newly-hatched
larvae in vines, shrubs and trees  is made easier when lacewing eggs are
shipped glued on cards or masking  tape or as 500 pre-fed larvae in
hexcel units.  When lacewing are shipped  on cards, 5,000 or 10,000 per
card, each one-inch square holds an average  of approximately 170 and
330 eggs respectively.    EGGS ON TAPES:  Lacewing tapes are made up in
units of 20 tapes 6 inches  long and 3/4 inches wide with waxed paper on
each end so that the ends can  be conveniently attached to form a
bracelet around an infested limb or  vine.  Each tape holds an average
of approximately 250 lacewing eggs with  equal volume of moth egg diet
and corn grit to cover the exposed sticky  areas on the tapes.  Tapes
should be distributed in foliage as soon as  larvae start crawling on
the tapes.     HEXCEL UNITS:  The release method for hexcel units simply
involves peeling  off the organdy cloth cover and lifting or brushing
each larvae onto the  plant with a fine paint-brush.  Pupae in hexcel
and lacewing adults are  also available.  FURTHER DETAIL ON RELEASE

for several months at 6 C.   RELEASE RATES  Release rates depend on the
degree of infestation, the presence of other  biological controls, and
other factors, but a guideline is 5,000 to 50,000  per acre per season
or 1,000 per 2,500 square feet of garden area.  Some  research suggests
that releasing during cool temperatures, particularly in  the evening,
and misting foliage enhances survival of larvae. About 15-20  times more
eggs than larvae were needed to achieve the same decrease in  aphid
populations. Need more eggs than larva when trying to control pest 
populations, as it takes a week for eggs to become large enough larvae
to  make a dent in pest populations; during a hot summer, a pest
population can  more than double in that week; also there can be egg
loss to predators,  particularly ants.   one week delay in control with
release of eggs, as need to reach voracious  second and third instar
eggs that are most effective; releasing larvae  shortens delay. bec of
cannibalism and reduced egg hatch rate, higher  numbers of eggs than
larvae needed. 1:1.3 ratio needed for egg releases, vs  1:5 or 1:30 w

taking delay period into account, can use either eggs or larvae, 
deciding factor is which easiest, and eggs can survive a delay in mail;
may  need to make aphid control releases each 4-6 weeks.  ATTRACTANTS &
FOOD SUPPLEMENTS  shelter provided by weeping lovegrass windbreaks in
High Plains a good  refuge for green lacewings and other beneficials.  
Chrysoperla species need insect honeydew to stimulate egg laying, and
this  can best be assured by a diverse habitat with cover crops and
alternate  host crops providing aphids, whiteflies, mealybugs and other
honeydew  producing insects when the crop plants are not loaded with
pests. Growing  crops conducive to pea aphids for C. carnea
(lacewing.raw p. 8, line 43)  lacewing adults can disperse many miles by
wind during the evening flight  period, and are attracted to land and
lay eggs by adult food sources such  as aphid honeydew). Food and
attractant sprays like tryptophan and whey  have produced great lacewing
increases in small areas (100 m2) (e.g. spray  onto infested areas to
attract and concentrate adult lacewings, which will  lay eggs that will
hatch into larvae providing pest control in 2-3 weeks)  of vineyards,
and have the potential to make a big contribution to pest  control, as
each lacewing eats more than 250 fourth and fifth instar  leafhoppers.
[See =IPMP 12(4):12 & 13(5/6):18 for more detail on  attractants etc.] 
Pollens increase adult lacewing life spans and egg laying. Corn and ice 
plant are among the best pollen sources, while sunflowers are a favored 
gathering place. Ice plant pollen is among the best for increasing 
Chrysoperla carnea egg laying, while corn pollen is used to prepare for 
autumn migration.   hard to beat commercial yeast hydrolysates like

Biol. Control, Univ. California, Albany, CA 94706):  Predatory =Collops
beetle males and green lacewings are attracted to cotton  by a
combination of two senses: vision and olfactory detection of 
caryophyllene. Green lacewing attraction to honeydew can be simulated
with  artificial honeydew food sprays (e.g. yeast hydrolysates), or a
tryptophan  attractant product can be used.  With a combination of
tryptophan and  sugar, lacewings fly into fields at night, though a
growing crop or habitat  signal is also needed (e.g. carophyllene in
cotton).  Cutting a growing hay  crop results in fewer lacewings.  When
a habitat signal is restored,  lacewings will fly into the wind to find
honeydew or tryptophan and  carophyllene.  Hagen says that tryptophan
and carophyllene can be put into  almost any crop to attract green
lacewings.&&  Hagen in Proc Summer Inst., p. 173 -- yeast hydr mix

 COLORADO POTATO BEETLE)/FIELD AND ROW CROPS (Divide in 2)  In USDA-ARS
studies, placing 10 green lacewing larvae (second instar) on  each
potato plant when Colorado potato beetle eggs began hatching prevented 
damage (potatoes without lacewings were defoliated; other natural
enemies  were excluded). effectiveness  of  Chrysoperla carnea was
85-96%, while  that of Chrysopa  sinica  was  81-89%. In the west of the
Ukrainian SSR,  where the pest  develops on potato, usually in 2
generations, Chrysoperla  carnea can be  released  against  the  1st
generation 2-3 times at  intervals of 10-15 days  at  a  rate of 120
000-150 000 individuals/ha in  years with moderate temperatures  and
high air humidity. In the south of  the Ukrainian SSR and in  the 
Moldavian  SSR,  the  predator  can  be   released against the 2nd
generation  of  the  pest  on  aubergine,  3-4   times depending on
weather conditions  and  at intervals of 7-10 days, in  the 2nd or early
3rd larval instar  at  a  rate  of 120 000-180 000  individuals/ha and a
predator-prey ratio of 1:20.   potato plants. The two releases were
necessary because the predator  larvae pupated after 10-14 days and
control was still required.  The   effectiveness  of  the predator was
reduced by heavy rains with strong  winds, excessive irrigation and also
temperatures exceeding 30 deg  C,   which  induced the larvae to migrate
in search of more favourable  conditions. field test, second-instar
larvae were released  twice  at  a   predator:prey ratio of 1:10  Soviet
eggplant and potatoes: Eggs of the predator released in a ratio of   1:1
with those of the host gave 74% population reduction. First-instar 
larvae  released  in  ratios of 1:1 to 1:5 destroyed 86-91% of the eggs
in  5-10  days, and second- and third-instar larvae destroyed 87-100% of
them.  For aphids on vegetables, 300 000-800 000/ha of second instar
larva for the  best results,  the  lower number sufficing for releases
at the beginning of  the  period of infestation  by the pest requiring 
control.   Soviet: for aphids need at least 1:5-10 predator:aphid ratio

USSR, in 1980 in  which  3-4-day-old  eggs and 1st- and 2nd-instar
larvae of Chrysopa carnea  [Chrysoperla  carnea]  were  released against
sucking pests and the cotton  moth [Heliothis armigera] in a 1-ha cotton
field. Three releases were made  at  a  predator-prey  ratio  of  1:1. 
A  week  after the 1st release, the  abundance of aphids [? Aphis
gossypii] had fallen by 98.5%, that of thrips  by  95.6%, that of spider
mites [Tetranychus sp.] by 100%, that of eggs of  H.  armigera  by  100%
 and  that  of young larvae of this pest by 50%. In  fields  in  which 
the  predator  had  not been released, the abundance of  aphids 
increased 1.8 times, that of thrips 1.6 times, that of Tetranychus  sp. 
2.4  times,  that  of eggs of H. armigera 1.5 times and that of young 
larvae  2.3  times  over  the same period. The 2nd and 3rd releases
caused  even  greater  reductions  in  pest  abundance.   Azerbaijan
cotton - release of eggs and larv at 1:1 ratio, within week had  more
than 95% decrease in aphids, 98% decrease in thrips, and 100% decrease 
spider mites and bollworm eggs, 50% decrease young bollworm
caterpillars.  For  practical  purposes,  it  is  suggested  that  if 
the aphid:predator  ratio was 80:1 in the cotton fields, chemical
control could be delayed.  12/L/28 - Predators moved from rape and wheat
fields to cotton fields in  mid- to late May. Surveys conducted in
1978-83 showed densities of 258-880  aphids  and  4-12  predators/100 
plants,  giving aphid:predator ratios of  1:65-1:73.  Aphids were nearly
completely controlled in June, and chemical  control  measures  were 
generally not necessary. The annual cumulative  number of noctuid  eggs 
was  generally 600/100 plants. Natural enemies  were able to suppress
the numbers of 3rd-instar larvae to  5/100 plants.  add pink bollowrm to
pests eaten.   Uzbekistan (USSR) on the value of Chrysoperla carnea - 
second-instar nymphs at a predator:prey ratio of 1:5 or 1:10, or  eggs 
at  a  ratio of 1:1, complete control resulted in 13 days. There was 
only  76%  reduction  of aphids when the ratio of nymphs was 1:15 and
none  when  it  was 1:25, although in the last case aphid numbers
increased by a  factor  of  6.8  with  no  release; when the ratio was
1:50, aphid numbers  trebled.  A ratio of 1:10 was evidently optimal.
Field tests were begun in  the  Tashkent  district,  where the predator
was released at this ratio as  second-instar nymphs. It succeeded in
containing aphid numbers for a time,  whereas  there  was  an increase
in other plots, but the numbers of aphids  then  trebled.  A  second 
release was made, and the number of aphids fell  after  3-4  days, but
increased again to the original level after 10 days.  Where no releases
were made, aphid numbers increased and at the end of the  test  were 5
times greater than at the beginning. Effectiveness of the two  releases 
of  the predator was calculated to be 64%. Observations on times  of 
appearance showed that the aphids appeared in May and the predator not 
until  June.  It was concluded that the predator should be released
during  the  early  period  of  cotton  infestation,  when  there  are 
only 10-15  aphids/plant. If this was done, the mean number of
second-instar predators  required  should  be  150  000-200 000/ha. It
was noted that 15 days after  release,  the predator was 1.3-3.4 times
as numerous as on untreated plots  and  after  40 days 5 times as
numerous; apparently cotton fields provided  favourable  conditions for
the chrysopid, even though in June up to 22% of  the eggs of C. carnea
were parasitised by Telenomus acrobates Giard. It is  concluded  that 
use  of  Chrysoperla in early spring is promising for the  control of
aphids  on cotton.  1:15 predator:aphid ratio for green peach aphid

eliminated the pest.   During the spring-summer period, the initial
ratio  of  predator  to prey  should be 1:15 on most fast-growing crops
but 1:50  on celery and dill, and  during the autumn-winter period it
should be 1:10  on  spinach  beet,  1:25  on celery and 1:30 on lettuce.
outdoor  (also below is under ghouse): Aphids  (Aphis  fabae  and  Myzus

Umbelliferae)  were  successfully  controlled with  C.carnea  when  the
predator/prey ratio was 1:27. On green pepper (Capsicum  annuum: 
Solanaceae)  the  corresponding  ratio  was 1:3. To be successful, 
treatment  had  to  be started when the number of aphids was still low.
The  effect  of  control  could be seen about 2 wk after the start of
treatment,  and  lasted for 4-6 wk. Control was impaired by ants (Hym.,
Formicidae). On  parsley treatment was successful when Chrysopa was
applied at a rate of 230  eggs/m2.   TROUNCING TREE PESTS  In apples and
pears, green lacewings destroy pear psylla, thrips, spider  mites,
aphids, mealybugs, scale crawlers and eggs of caterpillars like the 
notorious codling moth. In Indiana studies, green lacewings destroyed
20%  of codling moth eggs on apples, making lacewings a good 1-2 punch,
along  with Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma egg parasites, for codling moth
control  (Trans. Roy. Ent. Soc., 1975).   C. ruf - 50% reduction in
aphids on pecan w 660 egg/larv per tree, provided  fire ant pop not too

stop movement of adult pecan weevils.  Three well-timed spring and
summer lacewing egg releases in alternate years  are a proven way to
keep mealybugs under control in pears. one of first  definitive release
studies in late 1940s in USA involved releasing C.  carnea eggs in
crowns of pear trees to control grape mealybug; substantial  decrease in
fruit infestation w 3 well-timed releases of 250 eggs per  tree..  
Release  of  the chrysopid, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens, at a rate of
ca.  335,000  eggs  per  hectare,  reduced  significantly the number of
apterous  adults  and  nymphs  of  the green apple aphid, Aphis pomi
DeGeer, on dwarf  apple  trees in Ontario, Canada.  Greater  reduction
in aphid numbers  occurred in 1984 than in 1985,  and the efficiency of
the predator might  have been influenced by the predator:prey ratios
(1:10 and 1:19) used and  by the mean daily temperature that occurred
during the test periods.   Distributing  1000 and 1500 eggs of
Chrysoperla carnea per tree per week  to  mite-infested  peach  trees 
in greenhouses in Ontario resulted in the  elimination  of  motile 
stages of Tetranychus urticae from 3 of 4 release  trees  after  5  and 
4 weeks, respectively. Re-infestation of these trees  during  the  5th 
to  8th week after release was probably due to eggs that  were not
consumed by the predator.  intercrop/strip crop/ground covers -- C.
carnea nymphs may prefer cover  crops to vines, and move down into cover
crops (in almonds and peaches,  there are 100 times more lacewing eggs
with cover crops). Cover crops are a particularly good way to increase
numbers of green  lacewings. In California almonds and peaches, lacewing
eggs are 100 times  more numerous with a cover crop than without. (see
pecan paper).  Rincon-Vitova's staff entomologists will be happy to
discuss specific  legume, cereal, grass and green manure cover crops, as
the choices vary  from area to area. For example, in Georgia annuals
like hairy vetch and  crimson clover are used because they die out in
summer (i.e. don't compete  with the trees for moisture) and regrow in
the fall. In California, lana  vetch, hairy vetch and cereal rye oats.
Where cover crops are mown, an  alternate strip harvest is recommended.
This involves mowing alternate  strips as they come into bloom, allowing
the mowed strip to regrow before  mowing its unmowed strip counterpart.
In this way, unsprayed refugia are  always maintained for beneficials.

1:5.  The  Chrysopa releases at this ratio repeatedly  resulted   in 
virtually total elimination of aphid populations. The  intervals 
between  the  Chrysopa  treatments necessary to control the aphids 
varied  between  2  and  5  weeks  and were greatly affected by the
presence  or  absence  of an aphid source of infestation in the
greenhouse.  In  another  experiment  with  different predator/prey
ratios, it was shown that  large  reductions  in the number of aphids
could be achieved with the ratios 1:10 and 1:20, but not with 1:40.

distributed.  The  Chrysopid   did not maintain  itself  at  a  level
sufficient to afford effective  control, and introductions  were
repeated at intervals of 3-4 weeks.   In  greenhouse  experiments in the
USSR, treatment of larvae of Chrysopa  carnea  [Chrysoperla  carnea] 
with  hydroprene  prior to their release on  cucumber   plants  
prevented   downwards  migration  even  at  very  high  temperatures 
and greatly lengthened the life of the predators, increasing  the 
number  of  aphids  destroyed  by an individual as much as 4-fold. In 
larger-scale   experiments,   subsequently   carried   out  in 
commercial  greenhouses, releases of treated individuals at a 1:10

Biological control with beneficial insects makes dollars and sense. No 
orchard, even one that is chemically sprayed, can afford to be without 
biological control. Growers transitioning from toxic pesticides towards 
greater reliance upon biological control by natural enemies typically 
report fattening up bottom lines during the first two years with 50-75% 
pest control cost savings.   Difficulty achieving satisfactory pesticide
spray coverage is incentive  enough to experiment with biological
control agents that seek out pests  with the precision of laser-guided
missles. Costs of sprays, the hassle of  scheduling sprays when workers
are not present, managing residue and  resistance problems, particularly
the resistant codling moth, can be  avoided with greater reliance upon
biological pest control solutions.   Improved plant vigor and health may
also be noted when pesticide stresses  on plant physiology are removed.
Public and worker liability risks, even  insurance costs, may be
reduced. Besides safety and profit benefits, adding  biological control
with natural enemies as a pest control input can also  provide valuable
public relations and marketing benefits as a "green", 
environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional chemical control.  
BIOLOGICAL CONTROL IN ORCHARD AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS  Releasing Rincon-Vitova's
beneficial insects into walnut agro-ecosystems is  part of a sound
profitable strategy for achieving biological control and  minimizing
crop damage. Rincon-Vitova's natural enemies help police pest 
populations and stabilize orchard ecosystems, bringing predator and prey
 (pest) into better ecological balance.   Walnut trees provide a
favorable environment for a wide variety of  organisms, including
several hundred insect and mite species, most of which  are beneficial
-- e.g. pollinators increase fruit set, antagonists suppress  pests via
niche competition, scavengers turn debris into vital soil humus  and are
part of the food chain, an alternative food source for beneficials  when
pests are absent. In orchards where pesticides have not killed off the 
predators and parasites, most potential pests go unnoticed, as they are
so  effectively squelched by resident beneficials.   Of the several
hundred arthropod species residing in walnut orchards, only  three (e.g.
codling moth) are key pests directly attacking the fruit. These  key
pests are attacked by a wide array of general feeding predators and 
parasites. Rincon-Vitova's insectary-grown beneficial insects (all
natural,  none genetically engineered) supplement indigenous orchard
biological  control organisms and shift the ecological balance towards
sustainable  biological pest control by natural enemies.   FARMING WITH
BENEFICIALS  Maximizing the diversity and distribution of selected plant
species -- e.g.  planting covercrops or tolerating certain weed species
between trees at  critical times instead of herbiciding or discing the
orchard floor  completely clean -- is a farming technique useful for
increasing orchard  biological control. The strategy behind cover
cropping vis-a-vis pest  control is increasing resident insect and
arachnid micro-wildlife, thereby  expanding the food chain and
supporting a larger army of beneficial  pest-fighting arthropods. Thus,
after cleaning up walnut aphids in the  trees, brigades of predators and
parasites can find shelter and sustenance  on cover crops, and be
available to fight future infestations in the trees.   The best cover
cropping strategy may vary from area to area, and is best  selected in
consulation with pest control advisers and other sources  knowledgeable
about integrated pest management (IPM) techniques like  habitat
diversity and refuge management. Rincon-Vitova's philosophy is that 
orchard cover crops and cultural practices must be designed to grow 
beneficial organisms in ecological environments that closely emulate the
 natural systems in which they evolved.   At Rincon-Vitova, we
enthusiastically recommend consideration of legume  green manure cover
crops. Besides injecting nitrogen into the soil and  promoting formation
of nourishing soil humus, legumes and mixtures of  legumes, grasses and
weeds can be managed to reduce orchard pest problems.  For example, by
periodically alternately cutting every other border of  leguminous cover
crops, weeds can be kept from going to seed, while at the  same time
encouraging composting organisms. Composting organisms become  part of
the food chain, nourishing biological control organisms ranging  from
beneficial arthropods to predatory nematodes and fungi that aid in the 
biocontrol of soil and foliar insects and diseases, such as the walnut 
blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris.   Rincon-Vitova's
insectary-grown beneficial insects (all natural, none  genetically
engineered) are intended to be part of a larger orchard  integrated pest
management (IPM) strategy, augmenting naturally occurring  populations
of predators and parasites. Our beneficial insects are not  intended to
be used as pesticides, and we oppose government regulatory  agency
expenditures of taxpayer monies (e.g. Cal-EPA) to regulate these  tiny
pest-eating farm animals as toxic chemical pesticides subject to the 
same costly regulatory policing policies as the toxicchemicals that 
brought on the current environmental crisis and consumer distrust of 
agriculture -- beneficial insects are part of the solution, not the 
problem.   Rincon-Vitova's beneficial insects are not designed to be
magic bullets  applied like pesticides for instant pest control.
Successful sustainable  biological control is an ecological process, and
inoculative releases of  Rincon-Vitova's beneficials into the orchard
ecosystem to augment existing  natural controls is but one component of
a larger sustainable ecological  farming system that may take three to
five years to establish. Farming  ecologically with Rincon's biological
control inputs gets easier the second  and third year, as a reservoir of
natural biological control organisms  becomes established.   After the
initial first year biocontrol inoculation, which is best planned  out
with an IPM specialist who can monitor progress and advise on release 
dates etc., smaller annual maintenance releases of predators and
parasites  may subsequently suffice to get a headstart on pests and
compensate for  biocontrol losses to weather, orchard sprays, pesticide
drift etc. Besides  helping integrate sustainable biological control
into your farming system,  an IPM practitioner can provide guidance on
least toxic, low residual  sprays and reduced dosages of conventional
pesticides that minimize  disruption of biological control. Continued
attention is advised to nurture  biological control organisms from year
to year and detect new pest  invasions.   Careful monitoring and
sampling of the progress of biological controls is  important because
not all walnut trees or parts of groves get pests at the  same time. It
is often possible to identify pest "hot spots" that can be  targeted for
treatment with larger numbers of beneficials or spot-treated  with least
toxic, low residual spray materials. Knowledge inputs -- e.g. 
publications like the IPM Practitioner (BIRC, P.O. Box 7414, Berkeley,
CA  94707) and the University of California's Integrated Pest Management
for  Walnuts manual -- and staying on Rincon-Vitova's customer list are
also  recommended to keep you up to date on the latest advances in
managing pest  natural enemies.  To be most effective and sustainable,
biological pest control is best  designed into an area. Alfalfa is the
beneficial insect nurse crop for many  agroecosystems. Spraying
"insectary" crops like alfalfa is a guaranteed  recipe for major pest
infestations in all area crops; the media seems to  have missed this
message in the recent sweetpotato/poinsettia whitefly  scourge.   Slight
modifications in the way one farms can emulate more natural systems, 
and encourage beneficial insect armies to attack walnut pests. For
example,  planting cover crop or alfalfa refugia (safe havens that are
never sprayed)  mimics the natural movement of beneficials from crop to
crop. Biological  control is maximized when alternate crops act as field
insectaries, growing  large populations of pest-fighting predators and
parasites. Refuges of  alfalfa and other legumes attract large numbers
of aphids, mites, and worms  (none of which attack walnuts) that nourish
general predators which can  move into the trees to eat walnut pests.  
A form of intercropping known as strip cropping (e.g. strips of cover
crops  between at least some tree rows) and maintaining small fields of
unsprayed  alfalfa are ecological farming practices Rincon-Vitova
recommends to create  on-farm insectaries, growing your own free supply
of hungry predators and  parasites to devour pests. General predators
that feed on a wide variety of  prey eat early season pests in unsprayed
alfalfa and cover crops. Several  generations later their offspring form
the basis of biological controls  that enter the canopy of new spring
growth occurring in walnut trees.   Alternate strip harvesting of
alfalfa and cover crop beneficial insect  refuges (safe havens that are
never sprayed) keeps the plants attractive to  arthropod food sources
that nourish beneficials throughout the season. As  the season advances,
begin mowing alternate strips when cover crops or  alfalfa begin to
bloom; cut half and let this start to grow back before  mowing the
alternate strips. Avoid broad spectrum pesticides at all costs  in early
season for maximum production of predators and parasites. This  "battle
of the bugs" in adjacent crops takes place without damage to the 
walnuts.  USING RINCON-VITOVA'S BIOLOGICAL CONTROL INPUTS  Maintaining
biological control in walnuts is an ongoing process involving 
introduction and conservation of natural enemies and careful monitoring.
 Periodic maintenance release of insectary-grown beneficials timed to
focus  on developing pest hotspots aids in season-long biocontrol.
Conservation of  natural enemies is facilitated by phasing out hard
pesticides interfering  with biological control. Repeated spraying of
hard-to-kill resistant pests  devastates beneficials, and in the longrun
creates even more pests.   Where walnut's beneficials are destroyed by
spray programs or starved away  by lack of alternate prey, releases of
Rincon-Vitova's green lacewings and  other beneficials helps restore the
natural checks and balances found in  unsprayed ecosystems. Early season
release of insectary-grown beneficials  is the backbone of
reestablishing biological control. It is like restocking  the fish pond
when one starts releasing Rincon's beneficials to rescue such 
natural-enemy-depleted farms from the pesticide treadmill.  
Rincon-Vitova Insectaries tries to make the transition from pesticides
to  ecologically-based biological control as smooth as possible by
continually  collecting new strains of beneficials from heavily sprayed
agroecosystems.  Though we do not specifically test natural enemies for
ability to withstand  chemical sprays, we believe that some of our
insects, particularly our  green lacewings, great all-around predators,
have been successful in  transition situations due in part to this
hardiness and ability to  withstand some chemical residues.  General
predators such as green lacewings and lady beetles are released to 
insure timely presence when aphid prey are in the cover crop. Ideally, 
releases are started early when the first pests enter the field. These 
early releases are forced into the trees when walnut aphids appear. The 
same beneficials control spider mites after aphids come under biological
 control. Later season worm control is an additional benefit of letting 
small early season populations of beneficials expand their numbers in a 
pesticide-free environment.  If it is necessary to knock runaway pest
populations down to levels that  small populations of newly-introduced
beneficials can easily mop up, use  least-toxic, low-residual spray
materials. The goal of spraying (selective  use of least toxic
pesticides) is lowering pest populations to tolerable  levels, not pest
eradication. Low pest populations and innocuous alternate  prey are
necessary to feed biological control organisms. Without prey,  predators
are scarce. Hence, it is essential that a few minor pest  situations
develop, in order to obtain and maintain a buffering natural  enemy
complex within the walnut ecosystem, and control major pest problems  as
they develop.   A natural enemy complex of several dozen species
building up over time may  be necessary for sustained biological control
of key caterpillar pests,  such as the codling moth. An advantage of
releasing Trichogramma reared in  Rincon-Vitova's insectary is that this
pinhead-sized parasite kills codling  moth in the egg stage before it
can damage fruit or nuts.   Trichogramma is one of Rincon's
specialities. Releases work best in  conjunction with natural enemy
conservation measures such as avoiding harsh  sprays toxic to indigenous
beneficials and growing cover crops with nectar  to nourish wasps
attacking codling moth larvae and pupae.   Rincon started out rearing
Trichogramma for cotton growers in 1960, and has  since reared several
Trichogramma species adapted to a wide variety of  crops and pests. One
of our most popular strategies is initially releasing  large numbers of
Trichogramma and green lacewings to colonize groves, then  following up
with a series of smaller releases to ensure long-term  establishment.  
We currently recommend purchase of Trichogramma platneri for release in 
west coast orchards against codling moth and a wide variety of fruit and
 leaf worms, including navel orangeworm, redhumped caterpillar, fall 
webworm, Oriental fruit moth and twig borers. Trichogramma minutum is
the  species of choice for the east coast. Releasing the wrong species
can have  adverse consequences, which are explained in a special
bulletin. We can  explain this further over the phone when discussing
your order.   Customers on accounts are informed through periodic
mailings of new  beneficial species, some of which are so scarce that
only very small  quantities can initially be provided for inoculation.
In addition, where  demand is sufficient, we can on special request
collect or obtain rarer  natural enemies not normally available
commercially.  Technical bulletins are available for all the beneficials
that we sell.  A  quality control specialist works to insure that the
best possible product  is sent out. Nevertheless, sometimes shipments of
fragile insects can  arrive injured or otherwise not meet expectations.
As we stand behind all  product shipped, please feel free to contact us

be necessary. / Trichogramma's Role in Codling Moth Biocontrol&&  Jan
Dietrick Bassari, Rincon-Vitova Insectaries, Inc. & Joel Grossman&&  In
the 1920's, Professor Harry Smith of the University of California, 
Riverside, urged Stanley Flanders to develop techniques for mass-rearing
 =Trichogramma because it was "the most adaptable egg parasite with
which to  attempt the biological control of the codling moth," a key
pest of apples,  pears and walnuts. In 1927, Flanders released
insectary-reared  =Trichogramma in orchards, and wrote that the
"increase in parasitism from  less than 1 percent to 50 percent occurred
in a period of three weeks."  Mass rearing of =Trichogramma promptly
spread to the Soviet Union, and then  around the world before coming
back to the U.S.&&  As early as 1930, Flanders touted ecological farming
methods, such as cover  crops and plants with nectar and alternate
insect hosts for codling moth  natural enemies to feed on, as the way to
maximize =Trichogramma's  pest-fighting power: "Clean cultivation, by
reducing the number and variety  of the food plants of the hosts of
=Trichogramma, acts as a check on the  natural abundance of the latter.
In southern California there is a  noticeable difference between the
degree of parasitism of the codling moth  in orchards and on fruit trees
in dooryard situations where food plants of  moths are present
throughout the year. Properly managed cover crops may aid  parasitism
under orchard conditions...=Trichogramma may be of value in  maintaining
pest populations below the economic zero."&&  In other words, Flanders
recognized early on that biological control  organisms were not magic
elixirs or pesticidal magic bullets to be used in  ecological ignorance.
Rather, biological control organisms need to be  incorporated into
ecological systems. This means changing farming systems  to more closely
resemble the plant diversity of backyard gardens.  Biological control of
codling moth works when diverse plants act as field  insectaries,
growing large populations of pest-fighting predators and  parasites that
migrate into orchard trees.&&  As adults, =Trichogramma feed on insect
eggs, nectar, pollen and honeydew.   =Trichogramma and most other
parasites live several times longer and  destroy many more pests when
supplied with nectar. Good sources of nectar,  pollen, and insect foods
include borders or strips of alfalfa, sorghum,  sunflower, corn, cover
crops, flowering herbs and certain weeds, like  red-root pigweed,
=Amaranthus retroflexus, which increases =Trichogramma  parasitism of
pest eggs. These refugia (safe havens that are never sprayed)  are
breeding grounds for natural enemies that migrate into crops to provide 
biological pest control. [See =IPMP 11(8):5]&&  [BOX A] Which
=Trichogramma For You?&&  Recent taxonomic studies by Pinto et al. (in
press) lead us to believe that  biological control practitioners using
=Trichogramma are entering an  exciting and at times confusing period.
Pinto et al.'s reevaluation of  =Trichogramma species and biotypes
clouds interpretation of past studies,  as there is now uncertainty as
to which =Trichogramma species or biotypes  researchers have actually
studied and field tested. The difficulty in  distinguishing
=Trichogramma platneri from =T. minutum has far-reaching  implications
for biological control of codling moth.&&  "It is important for
biological control practitioners to understand that  the names =T.
minutum and =T. platneri are applied somewhat arbitrarily,"  write Pinto
et al. (in press). "The extent to which reproductive and  allozymic
variation in these nominal species correlates with variation in  life
history traits important to biological control is unknown. It should  be
emphasized that these two taxa cannot yet be distinguished 
morphologically, claims to the contrary notwithstanding. Consequently, 
documenting the success of introductions in areas already inhabited by
the  complex will be difficult, especially if identifications are based
on  morphology alone. Also, because of a degree of reproductive
compatibility  among forms, introduced material may hybridize with
native populations.  Unless the advantage of using one population over
another is clearly  established, the movement and release of =minutum or
=platneri to any area  already harboring natural populations of the
complex is biologically  questionable."&&  In other words, what is sold
as =T. minutum for release in the eastern U.S.  mates with what we call
=T. platneri in west coast orchards (i.e. =minutum  and =platneri may
actually be biotypes of the same species, not separate  species).
Unfortunately, the hybrid formed when =T. minutum mates with =T. 
platneri in west coast orchards dies out, as the progeny are mostly male
 (females are needed to attack codling moth eggs, and produce the next 
generation of =Trichogramma).&&  We believe that the most appropriate
=Trichogramma biotypes for release  into orchards for codling moth
biocontrol are =Trichogramma native or  indigenous to the orchard area.
It is best to collect codling moth egg  masses at the end of the season,
and use =Trichogramma emerging at that  time as breeding stock for
releases to be made the next season. In an ideal  world, growers would
cooperate with local insectaries in rearing and then  releasing progeny
of locally collected =Trichogramma; and universities, the  USDA and
grower groups would fund research to better understand what is 
happening in the field, and improve implementation of biological
control.&&  Rincon-Vitova collects its =T. platneri on the west coast
(northern  California), and =T. minutum is derived from the east coast.
For states in  the middle of the country, where taxonomic surveys of
=Trichogramma species  are sketchy, which =Trichogramma to use is an
educated best guess. The best  available information, Pinto et al. (in
press), points toward =T. minutum  being best against codling moth east
of the Rocky Mountains, and =T.  platneri best for codling moth
biocontrol west of the Rockies.&&  One last caveat derived from Pinto et
al. (in press), ask the insectary  where their =Trichogramma breeding
stock is from. Buy =Trichogramma for  codling moth biocontrol only if
the insectary breeding stock is from your  side of the Rocky Mountains,
as this is probably more important than the  sometimes misleading
species labels, =T. minutum and =T. platneri. [END BOX A]&&  Release
Rates & Techniques&&  Though we take =Trichogramma species
identifications with a grain of salt  [See Box A], the older studies
still provide good guidance on releasing  =Trichogramma for codling moth
biological control. Soviet studies  summarized by Zhilyaeva et. al.
(1981) reveal that =T. minutum parasitism  of codling moth is highest in
the trees in which =Trichogramma are actually  released. According to
the Soviets, there is some downwind drift of  =Trichogramma, but most
=Trichogramma remain on the crown of the tree where  originally
released.&&  Thus, in order to get =Trichogramma working against codling
moth in every  orchard tree, Zhilyaeva et. al. (1981) recommend:
"=Trichogramma should be  released in the morning hours in the lower
tiers of the crown of EACH  fruit-bearing tree." One release of 2,000
=Trichogramma per tree resulted  in 6-28% parasitism of codling moth
eggs. "With 500 and 1,000 eggs of  codling moth per tree and a ratio of
parasites to host of 10:1 and 5:1 the  rate of parasitism was 30 to
39%." Achieving 70-96% =Trichogramma  parasitism of codling moth eggs
required releasing 10,000 to 20,000  =Trichogramma per tree.&&  Soviet
studies (Zhilyaeva et al., 1981), like those of Flanders (1930) in 
California, found that parasitism of codling moth eggs is low (10%) 10
days  after =Trichogramma release. It is only when =Trichogramma have
reproduced  and multiplied in orchards that codling moth egg parasitism
climbs to  30-40%, a few weeks later. After several weeks of reproducing
in orchards,  =Trichogramma can eventually parasitize 70-90% of codling
moth eggs. Thus,  =Trichogramma releases need to begin early in the
season, preferably with  other alternate hosts (i.e. other butterfly or
moth eggs) on weeds,  wildflowers, cover crops etc. allowing
=Trichogramma and other natural  enemies to reproduce and produce large
populations capable of controlling  later season codling moth
invasions.&&  To get codling moth missed by =Trichogramma, an integrated
pest management  (IPM) approach is needed. Monitoring is combined with
least toxic control  methods, such as granulosis virus and pheromone
mating disruption [See Box  B], and encouragement of other natural
enemies.&&  A survey by Zlatanova (1987) in the former Soviet Union
identified 20  different natural enemy species attacking codling moth
larvae and pupae,  including the braconid parasite, =Ascogaster
quadridentata, which is also  found parasitizing codling moth eggs and
larvae in the U.S. In Sweden,  Subinprasert (1987) noted that 50-78% of
codling moth larvae and pupae  overwintering on tree trunks are killed
by natural enemies, particularly  tachinid flies like =Elodia morio,
ichneumonid wasps like =Pristomerus  vulnerator, and braconid wasps like
=Ascogaster quadridentata; fungi like  =Beauveria bassiana and
=Paecilomyces farinosus, and birds also take their  toll on codling
moth.&&  Releasing insectary-reared =Trichogramma while simultaneously
nurturing the  many other codling moth natural enemies in an ecological
orchard system  (e.g. one with cover crops and alternate food sources
for natural enemies)  is the way to achieve biological control of
codling moth. Sustainable  biological control is best viewed as a three
to five year long-term goal,  as it takes time for natural enemy
populations to buildup, especially after  having been devastated by
pesticides.&&  [BOX B] ESA Emphasizes Pheromone Mating Disruption&&
[NOTE: Sheila said that ESA Conference Highlight on codling moth
pheromone  mating disruption could go into box with this article.]&& 
Codling moth IPM was updated at the 1991 ESA Annual Meeting in Reno,
Nevada.  In lab studies, J.E. Cossentine (Agric. Canada Res. Stn.,
Summerland, B.C.,  Canada V0H 1Z0) found that in addition to codling
moth, =Cydia pomonella,  both fruit tree and oblique banded leafrollers
were susceptible to codling  moth granulosis virus (CpGV). [See =IPMP
12(9):10 for a recent report on  CpGV for codling moth control in
Canada] Hence, this alternative codling  moth control, which is
compatible with =Trichogramma, may be more useful than previously
realized, if multiple pests can be controlled.&&  J.F. Howell (USDA-ARS,
3706 W. Nob Hill Blvd., Yakima, WA 98902) presented  a
USDA-ARS/Biocontrol Ltd. film with a jazzy musical score updating
codling  moth pheromone mating disruption [See =IPMP 11(11/12):12 for
successful use  in Switzerland]. Codling moth females begin pheromone
release at sundown,  and male moths scan up and down in a zigzag
pattern, becoming confused and  unable to locate females (hence, not
mating) in orchards utilizing mating  disruption. Ten acre orchard
blocks in Yakima, WA, had one pheromone  dispenser (with 60 days
constant output) per tree (more on border trees)  for two generations of
codling moth. In June 1987, there was a 67-71%  reduction in codling
moth; by July, codling moth was reduced over 80%.  There was 77% less
fruit damage in pears in July. First generation control  was inadequate
for commercial growers, but control of the second generation  was
sufficient.&&  Codling moth pheromone mating disruption is now providing
90% control in  treatment plots, with 1/2 to 2 percent damage in
untreated plots an  indication of lasting control. From first to second
generation, codling  moth can go from 1 to 50 larvae per tree, whereas
there is less than 1  codling moth larvae per tree in treatment blocks
(with $1 million in fruit  in a 40-acre test block, good grower
relations were needed in this work).  Good control continued into the
third year, with less than 10 codling moth  larvae per tree.&&  Though
there were immigrant codling moths, few moved into the mating 
disruption block. There were 1,097 larvae per acre in the pheromone
treated  block, versus many thousands per acre in other blocks.
Infestation in the  treatment block was limited to the edges. Though
pheromone mating  disruption has been said to only work on low moth
populations, this work  showed decreasing codling moth populations over
a period of years even  where codling moth populations were initially
high.&&  In an overview talk on pheromone mating disruption, R.E. Rice
(Kearney  Agric. Cent., Univ. California, Parlier, CA 93648) noted that
there was  commercial registration of codling moth pheromone mating
disruption in  apples and pears with EPA on the national level, but that
the technology  was not legal in California (Cal-EPA wants additional
data). Rice also  pointed out that there can be problems from very
erratic pheromone release  from dispensers. A problem using pheromone
mating disruption against  codling moth in the Netherlands is that
orchards need to be retreated with  a second application of pheromones,
as dispensers have only a 60 day field  life (200 mg of pheromone per 25
mm2). In Italy, dispensers hold 350 mg of  pheromone; but this is also
probably not enough for season long codling  moth control.&&  [end Box

Biological control with beneficial insects makes dollars and sense, even
in  chemically sprayed cotton fields. Beneficial insects growing wildly
in  fields are one of nature's great free sources of pest control, a
resource  to augment and nurture, not squander or slug into oblivion
under a  pesticidal rain. When properly managed, biological control
organisms can be  a valuable part of your cotton profit team.  Costs of
sprays, scheduling sprays when workers are not present, public and 
worker liability risks, even insurance costs, may be reduced when 
biological control organisms assume more pest management chores in your 
cotton fields. Residue and resistance problems, particularly whiteflies
and  leafminers, are avoidable when pest-fighting biological control
armies are  integrated into your cotton pest defense system.   Fifty to
75 percent pest control cost savings have been reported within the 
first two years by cotton growers transitioning from chemical farming to
a  more sustainable ecological approach utilizing beneficial organisms.
Even  gaining a mere few weeks delay in the onset of spraying by making
early  releases of beneficials can yield dramatic monetary gains, with
natural  biological control substituting for weeks of pesticide inputs.
As if this  were not enough, there are also public relations benefits
from using this  "green", environmentally-friendly alternative to
conventional chemical  control.  COTTON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL    Unsprayed
cotton fields host an army of several million beneficial  arthropods per
acre, a valuable free source of natural pest control best  nurtured, but
all too easily and often destroyed by harsh pesticide  regimens.
Bollworms, loopers, aphids, whiteflies, leafminers, spider mites  and
other potential pests seldom pose major problems in cotton fields where 
the indigenous pest-fighting natural enemies are preserved.   Among the
hundreds of beneficial species commonly devouring cotton pests  are
green and brown lacewings, pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, assassin bugs, 
damsel bugs, spined soldier beetles, Staphylinid rove beetles, Carabid 
ground beetles, Collops beetles, lady beetles, six-spotted thrips,
Tachinid  flies, Phytoseiid mites, spiders and several dozen parasitic
wasp species,  including Trichogramma.   Two of the 50 potential cotton
pests, the pink bollworm and boll weevil,  most consistently elude these
hungry cotton field predators and parasites.  Both pinkie and the boll
weevil feed internally on squares and bolls,  thereby escaping enough of
the common cotton field beneficials to pose  chronic problems.   NEW
PINK BOLLWORM EGG PARASITE  Rincon-Vitova is addressing the pink
bollworm problem by introducing a new  natural enemy, Trichogrammatoidea
bactrae, an Australian import that  destroys moth eggs before pinkie
caterpillars hatch out and burrow into the  hidden safety of their
cotton boll feeding niche. Rincon's entomologists  are excited about
this new natural enemy, which turns pinkie's white eggs  black, because
mated females produce mostly new pest-egg-destroying  females. Field
studies in Brazil [Entomophaga 1987. 32(3):241-248] show  that a related
Trichogrammatoidea species teams up with other parasitoids  to provide
more than 50% caterpillar egg parasitism; with pirate bugs,  big-eyed
bugs, spiders and other predators in the natural enemy complex  adding
another 45% moth egg destruction, total egg destruction is 95.5%.   Few
pesticides can match the 95+ percent pest egg destruction potential of 
the natural enemy complex -- indeed, pests like pinkie lay many eggs so
to  insure that a few individuals survive to perpetuate the species in
this  tough bug-eats-bug natural environment. The objective of adding
new  beneficials like Trichogrammatoidea bactrae to the cotton
agroecosystem is  strengthening the natural enemy complex, and creating
an ecosystem where  predator and prey (pest) are in better balance. 
Neither Trichogrammatoidea bactrae nor any other beneficial species sold
by  Rincon-Vitova Insectaries is intended to be used as a pesticide for
quick  insect kill. Trichogrammatoidea bactrae, Trichogramma pretiosum,
green  lacewings, predatory mites and other Rincon-Vitova beneficials
need to be  integrated into agroecosystems, and nurtured into
reproducing in the field.  Releases of Rincon-Vitova's biological
control organisms are intended to  augment existing natural enemies,
thereby tipping the balance of nature  towards more biological pest
control.   Harnessing and working in harmony with ecological processes
to grow  biological control organisms in cotton fields is a totally
different  process from chemical pesticide use. Creating sustainable
biological  control in cotton requires a change in thinking, as the
rules are very  different from chemical pest control. Even economic
thresholds for  pesticide treatments change when cotton fields are
teeming with biological  control organisms. When beneficials are on
patrol in cotton fields, higher  pest levels can be tolerated for longer
periods of time without pesticide  use, which translates into immediate
bottom line pest control cost savings.  Rincon-Vitova's beneficial
insects (all natural, none genetically  engineered) are small
pest-fighting farm animals, not pesticides. The state  of Texas agrees
that beneficial insects are farm animals, and, like cattle  and pigs,
exempts beneficial insects (as farm animals) from state sales  tax. We
oppose government regulatory agency expenditures of taxpayer monies 
(e.g. Cal-EPA) to regulate these tiny pest-eating farm animals as toxic 
chemical pesticides subject to the same costly regulatory policing
policies  as the toxic chemicals that brought on the current
environmental crisis and  consumer distrust of agriculture -- beneficial
insects are part of the  solution, not the problem.    When combined
with sustainable cotton growing practices to encourage  predators and
parasites, periodic early season releases to establish 
Trichogrammatoidea bactrae, and inoculative releases of other
Rincon-Vitova  beneficials, can be cost effective, at least delaying the
onset of costly  chemical spray programs. Trichogrammatoidea bactrae and
other beneficials  are compatible with "soft pesticides" like BTs (e.g.
Dipel, Javelin),  sterile male releases and pheromone mating disruption
(e.g. Attract 'n Kill  and NoMate), making them good additions to
integrated pest management (IPM)  programs.   Rincon-Vitova Insectaries
invites interested cotton growers and their PCAs  to participate with us
in evaluating the addition of Trichogrammatoidea  bactrae to the cotton
field natural enemy team against pinkie. This  generalist beneficial
insect is available to any cotton farmer. However,  advance orders are
required, as we are limiting production of this  perishable living
product (T. bactrae), and will not have the capacity to  accept most
last minute orders.   TRANSITIONS TO BIOCONTROL MADE EASIER 
Rincon-Vitova tries to make the transition from heavy reliance upon 
pesticides to sustainable biological control as smooth as possible by 
continually collecting new strains of beneficials from heavily sprayed 
agroecosystems. Though we do not specifically test natural enemies for 
ability to withstand chemical sprays, we believe that some of our
insects,  particularly our green lacewings, great all-around predators,
have been  successful in transition situations due in part to this
hardiness and  ability to withstand some chemical residues.   Ideally,
releases of beneficials are started as early in the season as  possible,
when the first pests enter cotton fields or neighboring crops  (e.g.
alfalfa, grains, vegetables) preceding cotton. One of our most  popular
strategies is initially releasing small numbers of beneficials to 
colonize young cotton, and following up with a series of weekly releases
to  insure long-term establishment of pest-destroying natural enemies.
Farming  ecologically with biological control inputs gets easier each
year, as a  reservoir of natural enemies becomes established.   Where
pesticides have not killed off the natural enemies, most potential 
pests go unnoticed, as they are so effectively squelched by resident 
beneficials. When predators and parasites are destroyed by spray
programs  or starved away by lack of prey, releasing Rincon-Vitova's
green lacewings,  Trichogramma and other beneficials helps restore the
natural balances found  in unsprayed agro-ecosystems. Early season
releases of insectary-grown  beneficials are the backbone of
reestablishing biological control. It is  like restocking the fish pond
when one starts releasing beneficials to  rescue natural-enemy-depleted
farms from the pesticide treadmill.   Rincon-Vitova Insectaries started
out rearing Trichogramma egg parasites  for cotton growers in 1960, and
currently rears several different  Trichogramma species adapted to a
variety of crops and caterpillar (worm)  pests. Rincon's Trichogramma
pretiosum attacks eggs of numerous cotton  moths, including bollworms
and leaf worms.   Limited quantities of the tiny lady beetle Delphastus
pusillus, a voracious  predator of sweetpotato and poinsettia
whiteflies, can also be inoculated  into cotton fields. We advise
placing orders well in advance, and setting  aside unsprayed crop
refuges to allow the small available inoculative  quantities of
Delphastus to reproduce and become a significant whitefly  fighting
force.  General predators such as lady beetles and green lacewings are
available to  help in early season aphid control -- these same insects
help defeat spider  mites after aphids come under biological control.
Late-season biological  control of worms (caterpillars) is an added
benefit of holding off on  early-season pesticides and allowing small
early-season populations of  beneficials to multiply into large mid- to
late-season pest-fighting  armies.   FREE SOURCES OF BENEFICIALS  
Slight modifications in farming practices and ecological planting
schemes  can create cotton agro-ecosystems more closely emulating
natural  ecosystems, and promote the in-field production of millions
(per acre) of  voracious pest-eating beneficials at no additional cost
to cotton growers.  This free source of indigenous natural enemies,
which would be  prohibitively expensive to purchase, consistently
controls sweetpotato  whitefly and cotton aphids in unsprayed cotton
agroecosystems.   Understanding the movement of natural enemies between
crops is the key to  unleashing this vast free source of biological pest
control. Though there  are differences among cotton growing areas, some
general principles apply.  Cotton field populations of dominant natural
enemies are markedly increased  when cotton agro-ecosystem diversity is
increased, as compared with large  cotton monocultures (one crop).  
Biological control is also maximized when alternate crops act as field 
insectaries, growing large populations of pest-fighting predators and 
parasites that can migrate into cotton. Cotton interplanted with or
growing  adjacent to unsprayed alfalfa hay, sorghum, sunflower borders,
vegetables,  small grains, oil seed Brassicas etc. attracts a wide
variety of natural  enemies, including lady beetles, green lacewings,
Tachinid flies, big-eyed  bugs, spiders, pirate bugs, predacious beetles
and several genera of  parasites that effectively control sweetpotato
whitefly, bollworm, cotton  aphids and other potential pests.   In
integrated planting systems it is not unusual for minimally sprayed 
vegetable crops to produce more than four million parasites per acre,
many  of which migrate freely into adjacent crops, including cotton, and
provide  cheap (free) biological control. For example, a recent study of
inoculative  releases of Trichogramma on 667 acres of vegetables
resulted in biological  control on 3500 acres of adjacent cotton, with
60 to more than 90 percent  parasitism of cotton caterpillars [Chinese
Journal of Biological Control  1985. 1(4):2-7]. Experiences are similar
in California and elsewhere when  beneficials are allowed to grow (i.e.
not killed off with broad-spectrum  pesticides) in cropping systems
overlapping cotton. From Texas to Africa to  China and the former Soviet
republics, Trichogramma releases directly into  cotton produce similar
dramatic results, provided growers switch from  broad-spectrum
pesticides that kill beneficials to IPM systems emphasizing  softer
materials like insect growth regulators, microbials, pheromone  mating
disruption etc.   Rincon-Vitova advises cotton growers to work closely
with PCAs skilled in  IPM methods such as beneficial insect releases,
mating disruption,  selective pesticides easy on beneficials, and spot
spraying. If it is  necessary to knock runaway pest populations down to
levels that small  populations of newly-introduced beneficials can
easily mop up, use  least-toxic, low-residual spray materials. The goal
of spraying (selective  use of pesticides least toxic to beneficials) is
lowering pest populations  to tolerable levels, not pest eradication.
Low pest populations and  innocuous alternate prey are necessary to feed
biological control  organisms. Without prey, predators and parasites are
scarce. Hence, a few  minor cotton pest situations must develop and be
tolerated, in order to  obtain and maintain a buffering natural enemy
complex that subsequently  controls major pest problems.   Planting
legume, green manure, cover crop or alfalfa refugia (safe havens  that
are never sprayed) mimics the natural movement of beneficials from  crop
to crop. For example, alfalfa hay attracts aphids, mites and worms  (few
of which attack cotton) that nourish large pest-fighting populations  of
predators and parasites, a no-cost biological control army available to 
control pests in nearby cotton fields.   ALFALFA, KING OF THE INSECTARY
CROPS  There are over 1,000 insect species in an average alfalfa field,
the  majority of which are beneficial, making alfalfa, along with
sorghum, the  main "insectary" crop in many agroecosystems. Agrichemical
West magazine  (July 1960) noted, "In Imperial Valley, alfalfa is the
only large acreage  crop grown throughout the year. Hence it is the
principal reservoir of  beneficial insects in that area. Conserving the
beneficial insects  therefore benefits growers of many other
agricultural crops in the same  region." A neglected lesson,
unfortunately being relearned the hard way by  Imperial Valley growers
combating leafminers, whiteflies and other pests  artificially created
by pesticide destruction of biological control  organisms in insectary
crops like alfalfa.  In 1956, at the height of the University of
California's statewide `war'  against spotted alfalfa aphid, researchers
discovered that strip farming  alfalfa, instead of harvesting entire
alfalfa acreages simultaneously,  dramatically increased the number of
biological control organisms, and  reduced pest populations. Strip
cutting (harvesting alternate strips or  fields) stabilizes the alfalfa
agro-ecosystem, with different-aged hay  growths occurring
simulatenously in the same or nearby fields.   When one strip is cut,
alternate strips or fields are half grown, and  fields and farms are
never completely bare or without an alfalfa breeding  refuge for
beneficials. In the pioneering University of California studies,  strip
cut alfalfa had more than one million insect-eating spiders per acre, 
versus only 105,000 for regularly harvested alfalfa; 287,000 
pest-destroying parasitic wasps, versus 70,000; 401,000 predatory
big-eyed  bugs, versus 199,000; 205,000 lady beetle adults, versus
46,000; 232,000  lady beetle larvae, versus 11,000. "By exact count the
strip-farmed field  contained four times as many natural enemies, with
only one-fourth the  number of alfalfa pests," along with a ton more hay
per acre and no need  for insecticides, reported Agrichemical West (July
1960).   As the season advances, begin mowing alternate strips or fields
when cover  crops or alfalfa begin to bloom; cut half and let this start
to grow back  before mowing the alternates. Avoid broad-spectrum
pesticides at all costs  in early season for maximum production of
predators and parasites.  Harvesting alternate strips keeps plants
producing predators and parasites  throughout the season, forcing a
steady migration of beneficials into  nearby cotton. This "battle of the
bugs" takes place without damage to  cotton.   Alfalfa is also an
excellent Lygus trap crop. Cutting an entire alfalfa  field at one time
forces Lygus bugs to fly into neighboring crops. Nearby  uncut alfalfa
as a trap crop eliminates the need to spray cotton for Lygus.   STRIP
CROPS STOP BOLLWORM & BOLL WEEVIL  Strip cropping is better known as a
soil and water conservation technique  than as an integrated pest
management (IPM) tool. Strip intercropping, as  the practice might be
more accurately termed, is "growing two or more crops  simultaneously in
different strips wide enough to permit independent  cultivation but
narrow enough for the crops to interact agronomically"  (Francis, 1986).
 "To be quite accurate," wrote Harold E. Tower and Harry H. Gardner
(1946)  in a USDA Farmers' Bulletin titled Strip Cropping for
Conservation and  Production, "strip cropping is not a single practice;
it is a combination  of good farming practices. Strip cropping employs
crop rotations, contour  cultivation, proper tillage, stubble mulching,
cover cropping, and other  practices. The strip-cropping system
maintains soil fertility and often  increases it, maintains the maximum
amount of ground cover for the greatest  possible portion of the year,
provides for the growing of field crops in a  systematic arrangement of
strips or bands which serve as vegetative  barriers to erosion and waste
of soil, water, and fertilizer. These are the  principal and clearest
advantages of the practice -- or system. The  principal disadvantage of
the system is its newness to many farmers."   Good strip intercrops do
not impale parasites on sticky hairs, and have  abundant pollen and
nectar to fuel the natural enemy fighting force.   Cotton, corn, cowpea,
sorghum, and Crotolaria are among the good strip crop  candidates. Texas
experiments show that Trichogramma pretiosum - an egg  parasite of
bollworm and other cotton caterpillars that Rincon-Vitova has  been
selling to cotton growers since 1960 - and many other parasites live 
several times longer and destroy more pests when cotton, weeds or other 
plants provide nectar. Borders of alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower, corn etc.
 can also be quite effective, particularly when flowering, silking etc.
are  timed to pest life cycles.  In 1935, Marcovitch (J. Econ. Entomol.
28:62-69) touted strip farming for  increasing the effectiveness of
cotton boll weevil parasites: "In planning  the cropping system there
can be no possible harm in arranging to have a  forage or hay crop
adjacent to the cotton field. In case a forage crop is  used, cowpeas,
with the ever-present cowpea pod weevil would undoubtedly  bring about
the presence of several important parasites. The early removal  of the
cowpeas for fodder would force the parasites to attack the boll 
weevil." Cutting fencerow weeds led to highest boll-weevil parasitism in
 adjoining areas. Other plants harboring boll-weevil parasites include 
dewberry, croton and amorpha.    In 1947, Lincoln and Isley (J. Econ.
Entomol. 40(3):437-8), after studying  decades of Arkansas bollworm
outbreaks, found that "The bollworm  infestations developed when no trap
crop was available." Cotton fields near  late silking corn escaped major
damage, as "the ovipositing moths  apparently transferred their
attention from cotton to corn and little late  infestation of cotton
followed. In one instance where a small planting of  late corn, less
than 2 acres, was adjacent to a field of cotton of about 60  acres, the
average number of eggs on fresh silk was over 200 to the ear.  Many eggs
were also scattered over these corn plants. In all 15 of these  fields,
corn was effective as a trap crop and the infestation of cotton 
declined sharply with the beginning of silking."   Strip or trap crops
can be the breeding grounds for beneficial arthropod  wildlife that
migrates, is forced (e.g. by cutting) or transferred (by  D-Vac suction
collection) to nearby cotton.   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  Maintaining
biological control in cotton throughout the season is an  ongoing
process.   Rincon-Vitova encourages cotton growers to work closely with
PCAs and IPM  consultants to create on-farm insectaries to provide large
armies of  natural enemies, devise trap crops for key pests, conserve
indigenous  beneficial arthropod wildlife through judicious pest control
solutions and  inoculate fields with new natural enemies. Since not all
cotton plants or  parts of fields get pests at the same time, careful
monitoring and sampling  of the progress of biological controls is
advised to identify "hot spots"  for treatment with larger numbers of
beneficials. The best PCAs can also  adjust economic treatment
thresholds upwards to take into account the fact  that fields patrolled
by armies of natural enemies can withstand higher  pest populations
without showing economic loss.  It takes from one to three years to make
the transition and grow back the  known sets of resident natural enemies
for all pests of vegetable and field  crops. But for many growers, it is
worth the effort, as biological control  systems based upon natural
enemies are safe, permanent, economical pest  control solutions that fit
in well with sustainable farming systems based  upon ecological
principles.   Rincon-Vitova Insectaries customers on accounts are
informed through  periodic mailings of new beneficial species, some of
which are so scarce  that only very small quantities can initially be
provided for inoculation.  In addition, where demand is sufficient, we
can on special request collect  or obtain rarer natural enemies not
normally available commercially.  Technical bulletins are available for
all the beneficials that we sell.  A  quality control specialist works
to insure that the best possible product  is sent out. Nevertheless,
sometimes shipments of fragile insects can  arrive injured or otherwise
not meet expectations. As we stand behind all  product shipped, please
feel free to contact us should you ever feel that  there is a problem or
that a replacement may be necessary.

800-248-2847   BENEFITS OF BIOCONTROL  Biological control with
beneficial insects makes dollars and sense, even in  chemically sprayed
fields. Growers using Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma and  other
beneficials (all natural, none genetically engineered) to augment 
indigenous natural enemies can expect to improve profits by reducing or 
eliminating pesticide use.   In many cases, crop yield and quality
improve as previously unrecognized  adverse pesticide effects on plant
physiology disappear. Resistance  problems, and outbreaks of secondary
pests like spider mites, whiteflies  and leafminers are avoided when
biological control is integrated into pest  defense systems. Residue
problems, costs of sprays, scheduling sprays  around irrigations and
when workers are not present, health and safety  liability risks, even
insurance costs, may be reduced when beneficial  insects assume more
pest management chores.   Even gaining a few weeks delay in the onset of
spray programs with early  releases of Rincon-Vitova's beneficials can
produce dramatic monetary  gains, eliminating weeks of costly pesticide
inputs. As if this were not  enough, there are also public relations and
marketing benefits from using  this "green", environmentally-friendly
alternative to conventional chemical  control.  Trichogramma and other
Rincon-Vitova beneficials belong on your crop  production team. 
TRICHOGRAMMA - MICRO MARVELS  Trichogramma are pale yellow micro-wasps
(1/100 inch long) that destroy the  eggs of over 200 pest moth species
(cutworms, fruitworms, leaf worms,  leafrollers, loopers, armyworms,
borers etc.), preventing ravenous worms  (caterpillars) from hatching
out and devouring crops. Trichogramma stop  caterpillars in almost every
imaginable row and field crop, cotton,  vegetables, vines, fruit, nut,
forest and street trees, ornamentals and  interiors, wherever worms
(caterpillars) are a problem.   These tiny pest-fighting farm animals
are the world's most widely used  commercially produced beneficial
insects. Smaller than a pinhead and  dwarfed in size by pest eggs little
larger than sand grains, Trichogramma  are micro-engineering marvels,
with microscopic "stingers" drilling through  moth eggs to deposit their
own eggs. From one to three Trichogramma eggs  are laid inside most moth
eggs, though up to 50 eggs may be laid inside  relatively large moth
eggs. Trichogramma determine the size of moth eggs,  and hence how many
of their own eggs to lay, by timing their walks across  moth egg
surfaces.   Trichogramma larvae eat out the insides of pest eggs,
pupate, and cut an  exit hole in the pest eggshell just big enough for
winged adults to squeeze  through. Male Trichogramma emerge first, wait
for females to emerge, and  immediately mate. The life cycle from egg to
adult is typically completed  in 7 to 10 days (longer in cooler
weather). This short life cycle allows as  many as 30 generations per
season, with rapid increases in Trichogramma  populations. Thus, we
recommend starting Trichogramma releases as early in  the season as
possible, building up large Trichogramma populations ahead of  major
pest invasions.   Trichogramma wasps attack only insect eggs, and do not
harm people, plants,  pets or livestock.   MANY SPECIES & BIOTYPES 
Rincon-Vitova Insectaries began raising Trichogramma in 1960, and
currently  rears several different Trichogramma species and strains
(biotypes) adapted  to a variety of crops and caterpillar (worm) pests.
A phone call will help  us match your pest problems with the right
Trichogramma species or biotype.  In many cases, our staff entomologists
recommend combining Trichogramma  with other beneficials, such as
Rincon-Vitova's green lacewings, excellent  general predators that
further strengthen the natural enemy complex.   Trichogramma pretiosum
is our all purpose species, recommended for field,  row and vegetable
crops, as well as vineyards and selected tree crops. It  is a warm
weather species.   Trichogramma platneri, a western U.S. native, is
recommended for western  tree crops. The avocado strain of T. platneri
has garnered rave reviews on  avocados. We also rear a codling moth
strain of T. platneri (breeding stock  collected in northern California)
for west coast apple, pear and walnut  growers.   Trichogramma minutum
is best for trees in eastern states, where it is  native and overwinters
in moth eggs. T. minutum has proven useful against  spruce budworm on
Canadian forest trees, codling moth in eastern orchards,  and has
parasitized up to 90% of corn earworm eggs in the southeastern U.S.  T.
minutum is most active from early morning to evening, taking a break 
during the hottest (above 90o F), driest midafternoon hours, when it
seeks  the shady undersides of leaves. Optimum temperature for T.
minutum is  65-85o F). All tiers of trees are colonized effectively.  
Trichogrammatoidea bactrae, recently imported from Australia to fight
pink  bollworm in cotton, has a wide host range. Besides fighting pinkie
in  cotton, T. bactrae has potential against tomato pinworm, potato
tuber moth,  Oriental fruit moth, navel orangeworm, peach twig borer,
diamondback moth  and other pests.   From time to time, and on special
demand, Rincon-Vitova Insectaries offers  other Trichogramma species and
biotypes to customers on account.   RELEASE BASICS  Rincon-Vitova
recommends beginning Trichogramma releases as early in the  season as
possible to allow for a Malthusian (geometric) Trichogramma  population
explosion before peak pest moth egg-laying. The basic idea is  creating
a defensive army of Trichogramma positioned to attack eggs  deposited by
hordes of invading pest moths. Periodic releases of  Trichogramma insure
the presence of overlapping generations of mated  females ready to
attack eggs of any moths flying into fields or orchards.   Trichogramma
are shipped (as pupae ready to emerge as adults) inside  parasitized
grain moth eggs, usually glued to perforated cards. There are 
approximately 120,000 Trichogramma per card. Each card can be broken
into  30 squares with 4,000 parasites per square inch -- this permits
even  distribution of Trichogramma in fields and orchards. Loose eggs
can be  divided into paper cups; there are approximately 20,000 eggs in
a cubic  centimeter.   Trichogramma wasps emerge from cards in two to
five days, depending on  temperature, which should ideally be 80o to 90o
F. Emergence can be delayed  by holding parasitized moth eggs at cooler
temperatures (not less than 40o  F). Emerging wasps are usually seen in
the morning. Keep Trichogramma cards  in the shade, out of the hot sun,
or you'll have cooked insects, rather  than live pest fighters. To
maximize pest fighting time in fields and  orchards, don't delay release
after adult wasps emerge from grain moth  eggs.   (Graphic of lifecycle)
 To increase Trichogramma mating prior to release, incubate parasitized
moth  eggs in a gallon jar, paper bag, paper wedge cup or other closed
container.  This can be done by cutting cards (along perforations) into
30 squares, and  placing squares in a paper wedge cup according to the
diagram. Fold the  mouth of the cup closed (folding over twice), and
fold back the two corners  like dog ears.   (Graphic of cutting cards
and folding cups)  Anytime after Trichogramma adults begin emerging and
swarming, cups can be  set out. Cups can be opened and placed in plants,
or punctured with a  knife, creating an exit hole on each side while
protecting remaining  unhatched eggs from predators and moisture.
Punctured cups can be broadcast  on and around plants or vines, set in
branches or stapled to leaves. Large  incubation containers can be
opened at randomly spaced rows or trees; allow  containers to remain
open longer at pest "hot spots," so more parasites  emerge where pests
are concentrated.   Since Trichogramma wasps attack freshly deposited
moth eggs, the time to  release Trichogramma is when moths are in flight
and laying eggs. Begin  releases as early in the season as field and row
crops provide shade for  the parasites, e.g. when tomatoes are 12-28
inches high. It is better to  start releases early than too late, as
Trichogramma populations have the  potential to grow geometrically each
7-10 days, and a long headstart on  pests is more likely to tip the
ecological balance in favor of biological  control.   MONITORING 
Information gleaned from monitoring progress of biological control in
the  field can be used to raise economic treatment thresholds above
published  levels, and reduce spray bills. Large armies of beneficial
insects permit  crops to withstand higher pest populations without
economic damage. Most  published economic treatment thresholds are based
upon numbers of pests on  plants sprayed with pesticides to eliminate
natural enemies. Hence,  economic treatment thresholds can be adjusted
upwards to account for  natural enemies on farms using biological
control.   Careful monitoring is also important because not all parts of
fields get  pests at the same time. It is often possible to identify
pest "hot spots"  that can be targeted for treatment with larger numbers
of beneficials or  spot-treated with least toxic, low residual
materials. While 98% pest kills  may be necessary in heavily sprayed
fields devoid of natural enemies,  softer materials knocking off 50-75%
of pest populations may suffice in  fields teeming with natural enemies.
Natural enemies can mop up pests  remaining after the top is knocked off
pest populations by selective, least  toxic pest controls.   The goal is
establishing an ecological balance with pests at tolerably low  levels,
not eradication. Low pest populations and innocuous alternate prey  are
necessary to feed biological control organisms. Without prey, predators 
and parasites starve. Hence, a few minor pest situations must develop
and  be tolerated, in order to obtain and maintain a buffering natural
enemy  complex that subsequently controls major pest problems.   The
ideal monitoring tool is a vacuum insect net, as it provides the most 
complete sample of relative amounts and ratios of pests and beneficials.
We  recommend working with PCAs and IPM practitioners skilled in
biological  control, and monitoring moth flights and egg laying (e.g.
with pheromone  traps, scouting, D-Vac, sweep net sampling, degree-day
calculations), as  well as natural enemy and pest population parameters.
  Trichogramma parasitism of moth eggs can be monitored by placing cards
of  fresh moth eggs in fields or sampling pest eggs on plants.
Techniques like  two-minute timed egg searches are used in some IPM
programs to monitor eggs  of pests like the cotton bollworm and tomato
fruitworm.   Fresh moth eggs are usually white or a pale shade of yellow
or orange. It  is easy to recognize moth eggs parasitized by
Trichogramma, as the color  darkens to black. The ratio of black
(contains pupating Trichogramma) to  white (unparasitized) eggs is a
measure of Trichogramma parasitism. Field  egg counts underestimate
Trichogramma parasitism, as it takes 48 hours for  freshly parasitized
moth eggs to turn black (holding eggs for 48 hours  overcomes this
problem). Pest egg identification can be quickly learned  from a trip
into fields with farmer advisers, IPM consultants, researchers  et al.  
RELEASE RATE CONTROVERSY  The question of how many Trichogramma to
release is controversial, and  complicated by numerous variables like
pest density, release dates (early  vs late season), single vs. multiple
releases, indigenous natural enemy  populations, cultural practices,
pesticides, pruning, alternate hosts,  weather (e.g. rain and low
temperatures reduce T. minutum parasitism of  codling moth on the east
coast), etc.   Factors like type and growth stage of the crop also need
to be considered  in setting release rates. Numbers of Trichogramma to
release also depend  upon whether releases are intended to bridge a
temporary lag before  indigenous parasites come into effect, are used in
combination with other  measures, such as predator releases (e.g. green
lacewings) or BT  treatments, or are intended to recolonize fields where
biological control  is lacking because of pesticide drift or other
interference.   More Trichogramma are needed in heavily sprayed
agro-ecosystems, than in  ecologically farmed areas where minimal
pesticide use allows natural  enemies to live, multiply and migrate from
crop to crop. The natural  movement of beneficials complicates
scientific field tests, as Trichogramma  freely migrate (usually
drifting downwind) and colonize adjacent control  (no release) plots.
Frequently, Trichogramma destroy 60-70% of pest eggs in  control plots
adjacent to release plots, in effect turning agro-ecosystems  into one
big Trichogramma release plot. Other times, pesticide drift from 
adjacent control plots kill Trichogramma in release plots, effectively 
eliminating all biological control in the agroecosystem. In either case,
 faulty experimental design leads to meaningless conclusions as to
release  rates, and underestimates the value of Trichogramma.   Studies
minimizing these common methodological errors show that caterpillar 
(moth) egg parasitism on crops as diverse as cabbage, tomatoes, bell 
peppers, collards and soybeans can be increased from 0-20% in no release
 plots to 50-85% or more with Trichogramma releases. Trichogramma alone
can  parasitize 80-96% of Heliothis (cotton bollworm, tobacco budworm,
tomato  fruitworm), alfalfa caterpillar, cabbage worm and other pest
eggs  (Lindgren, 1969). There are no computer programs or cookbook
formulas  taking all variables into account and telling exactly how many
Trichogramma  to release in a particular field or orchard.   USDA models
theorize that 12,000 to 50,000 Trichogramma per acre should be  released
for each generation of caterpillar pest in order to achieve the  80% egg
parasitization levels necessary to keep worms below economic levels 
(Ridgway et al., 1981).   Augmenting the indigenous natural enemy
complex with early releases of  Trichogramma and other Rincon-Vitova
beneficials is the real secret to  sustainable biological pest control.
Many release rate experiments spray  pesticides to kill off indigenous
natural enemies, then release  Trichogramma. Though killing off the
natural enemy complex isolates  Trichogramma for scientific study, the
release rate information -- very  high release rates are needed when the
natural enemy complex is murdered,  and quick pest kills are needed --
is mainly applicable to heavily sprayed  fields using Trichogramma like
a quick kill pesticide.   Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma are not intended
to be used like pesticides  for quick pest kills in fields where natural
enemies have been slaughtered  by pesticides. Rather, Rincon-Vitova
intends that its beneficials (all  natural, none genetically engineered)
be integrated into IPM programs and  sustainable ecological farming
systems to augment and strengthen the  indigenous natural enemey
complex, creating an agro-ecosystem where  predator and prey (pest) are
in better balance.   Since our beneficial insects are not intended to be
used as pesticides, we  oppose government regulatory agency expenditures
of taxpayer monies (e.g.  Cal-EPA) to regulate these tiny pest-eating
farm animals as toxic chemical  pesticides subject to the same costly
regulatory policing policies as the  toxic chemicals that brought on the
current environmental crisis and  consumer distrust of agriculture --
Trichogramma are part of the solution,  not the problem.   Indigenous
natural enemies growing wildly in fields and migrating freely  within
the agro-ecosystem are nature's greatest source of free pest control  --
Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma augment this natural control. Over 50% moth
 (caterpillar) egg parasitism is not uncommon. Indigenous predators like
 pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, Staphylinid rove beetles,
Carabid  ground beetles, Collops beetles, lady beetles and spiders can
add an  additional 45% moth egg destruction. Thus, total natural enemy
destruction  of moth eggs before caterpillars hatch out can easily
exceed 95%.   Few pesticides can match the 95+ percent pest egg
destruction potential of  the natural enemy complex -- indeed, pests are
prolific egg layers to  insure that a few individuals survive to
perpetuate the species in this  tough bug-eats-bug natural environment. 
ROW & FIELD CROPS  One of our most popular strategies is initially
releasing small numbers of  beneficials to colonize young plants, and
following up with a series of  weekly releases to insure long-term
establishment of pest-destroying  natural enemies. Ideally, releases of
beneficials are started as early in  the season as possible, when the
first pests enter fields. Monitoring  fields to synchronize parasite
releases with pest life stages maximizes  results.   Ridgway (1981)
reported the following commercial suggestion for cotton,  which can be
modified for corn and other crops:  "Control of Heliothis on cotton. For
light infestations of Heliothis eggs,  10,000 Trichogramma per acre per
week should be released beginning when  squares are one-half grown and
continuing through the fruiting season, or  for about eight to ten
weeks. For heavy infestations of Heliothis eggs, a  minimum of 30,000
Trichogramma per acre should be released biweekly, or  more frequently
if necessary, thoughout the fruiting season."  Weekly augmentative
releases of Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma and lacewings  have been
successful against cotton pests in Central America for over three 
decades. Trichogramma in cotton in California, Texas and other U.S.
areas  have been killed in recent decades by pesticides directed against
boll  weevil and pink bollworm. Rincon's recent decision to begin
commercial  production of Trichogrammatoidea bactrae to fight pinkie,
along with recent  IPM advances like pheromone mating disruption, are
steps toward  reinvigorating biological control in cotton.
Rincon-Vitova's Trichogramma  pretiosum is still recommended to fight
bollworm and cotton leaf worms.  When Trichogramma augment a strong
natural enemy complex, 98% of moth eggs  may be destroyed. Fifty to 80
percent parasitism of eggs of key pests like  Heliothis or Helicoverpa
(i.e. tobacco budworm, cotton bollworm, tomato  fruitworm, corn earworm)
have been reported with release rates of 25,000 to  100,000 Trichogramma
per acre when there are 25,000 Heliothis eggs per  acre. High rates of
egg parasitism are almost always followed by drastic  reductions in worm
(caterpillar) populations.   Another commercial suggestion reported by
Ridgway (1981):  "Control of cabbage loopers on cabbage. For light
infestations early in the  season, 25,000 Trichogramma should be
released twice a week. For medium and  heavy infestations, 50,000 and
100,000 Trichogramma, respectively, should  be released twice each
week."   In cabbages, combining Trichogramma (an egg parasite) releases
with larval  and pupal parasites and predators (e.g. green lacewings)
that get what egg  parasites miss is the best strategy. A southern
California cabbage field  survey (Oatman, 1966) found 10 different
parasite species attacking each  caterpillar pest, with parasites
destroying up to 90% of cabbage  caterpillars in unsprayed fields.  
Reports from former Soviet republics indicate that 20,000 Trichogramma
per  acre, or roughly 1 parasite per 20 pest eggs, produce 90-100
percent  parasitization of cabbage worm eggs. Rincon-Vitova is not
currently  producing the cool weather Trichogramma biotypes needed to
achieve 90%  parasitism of cabbage worm eggs on cool season cole crops. 
 In processing tomatoes, Ridgway (1981) cited 8 seasons of work by
Oatman et  al. at the University of California, Riverside, that "showed
that  biological control of the three key pests (tomato fruitworm,
cabbage  looper, tomato hornworm) on early plantings could be achieved
by releasing  a total of 200,000 to 300,000 parasites per acre. They
further suggested  that, for maximum success, releases should be made
twice weekly from June  through August, or until harvest."   USDA
studies (Agric. Res., April 1981) recommend 50,000 to 70,000 
Trichogramma per acre per release over the growing season for tomatoes. 
Rincon-Vitova's experience is that prevention or control of low to
moderate  tomato fruitworm infestations can be achieved with 100,000 to
300,000  Trichogramma per acre, provided releases are started early in
the season  (when infestations are low) and pesticide interference is
avoided.  Trichogramma pretiosum releases of 15,000 wasps per acre twice
weekly over  10 weeks in the summer successfully control fruitworms,
loopers and  hornworms.    Another approach is aiming for a ratio of 1
parasite per 10-20 pest eggs to  boost parasitization into the 90-100%
range. This requires working closely  with IPM practitioners, monitoring
fields, and timing releases (with pest  egg laying). Reports from former
Soviet republics claim that releases of  6-8,000 Trichogramma per acre
produce 68% cutworm parasitism on wheat and  sugar beets. Extra releases
and higher numbers of Trichogramma are released  if cutworm eggs are
more numerous than usual -- up to 3 releases of 12,500  Trichogramma per
acre are used when there are 30 cutworm eggs per square  meter, with the
aim being a 1:10 ratio of parasites to pest eggs.   Sunflowers were a
key to integrating biological control into a failing  pesticide spray
program at a 10,000 acre processing tomato and canteloupe  cooperative
in the Dominican Republic, where a thousand farmers, each with  an 8-10
acre tomato field, were buying Trichogramma and lacewings from 
Rincon-Vitova to end suffering caused by sweetpotato whitefly, as well
as  caterpillars and other pests. Two plantings of sunflowers 60 and 30
days  prior to tomatoes acted as field insectaries, producing natural
enemies  that moved over to tomatoes with the early sweetpotato whitefly
invasion  and provided control. Pesticide spraying, which had been
continuous, was  reduced to spot treatments, allowing Rincon-Vitova's
Trichogramma (very  sensitive to insecticides) and lacewings to provide
tomato fruitworm  control (Grossman, 1990).   Similar programs with
borders or interplants of insectary crops like corn  and alfalfa have
been successful in southern California (e.g. corn to  protect processing
tomatoes), Mexico and elsewhere. Establishing biological  control in
neighboring crops, particularly those preceding the target crop,  is an
effective agro-ecosystem approach that takes advantage of the natural 
migration of beneficials to adjacent and downwind fields. Alfalfa is the
 best of the insectary crops, though unsprayed sorghum, corn, grains,
oil  seed Brassicas, vegetables and cover crops are also valuable.  
Growing beneficials in the field is the best way to introduce biological
 control, and turn heavily sprayed crop systems into rarely sprayed crop
 agro-ecosystems.  AVOCADOS  Combined with conservation of indigenous
natural enemies, early season  inoculation of orchards with
Rincon-Vitova's T. platneri provides an  alternative to pesticides for
control of omnivorous loopers and Western  leafrollers. In field tests,
T. platneri has produced 60% parasitism of  omnivorous looper eggs and
80% parasitism of Western leafroller eggs.   "These rates of parasitism
should be obtained by releasing 200,000-250,000  parasites per acre for
the year," wrote University of California IPM  specialist Dr. Phil
Phillips (1984). "This total amount released per acre  should be divided
into at least four release sites per acre and releases at  each location
should be made over a period of 6 to 8 weeks following the  peak of the
spring flight. This can be accomplished starting in early to  mid-March
with releases every other week of approximately 12,500 parasites  per
each of the 4 release sites per acre over the 6-8 week release period 
through early May...Releases of parasites after the flight peaks
occurring  in June-July and September-October may also prove beneficial,
but probably  not as effective as releases in the spring. Not only have
the pest  populations increased considerably by these later season
flights, but the  daytime temperatures have increased to a point more
deleterious to the  insectary-reared parasites."    CODLING MOTH  In the
1920s, Prof Harry Smith of the University of California, Riverside, 
urged Stanley Flanders to develop techniques for mass-rearing
Trichogramma  because it was "the most adaptable egg parasite with which
to attempt the  biological control of the codling moth." In 1927,
Flanders released  insectary-reared Trichogramma in orchards, and wrote
that the "increase in  parasitism from less than 1 percent to 50 percent
occurred in a period of  three weeks." Mass rearing of Trichogramma
promptly spread to the Soviet  Union, and then around the world before
coming back to the U.S.  As early as 1930 (Hilgardia, v.4,n.16),
Flanders touted ecological farming  methods to maximize Trichogramma's
pest-fighting power: "Clean cultivation,  by reducing the number and
variety of the food plants of the hosts of  Trichogramma, acts as a
check on the natural abundance of the latter. In  southern California
there is a noticeable difference between the degree of  parasitism of
the codling moth in orchards and on fruit trees in dooryard  situations
where food plants of moths are present throughout the year.  Properly
managed cover crops may aid parasitism under orchard 
conditions...Trichogramma may be of value in maintaining pest
populations  below the economic zero."   As adults, Trichogramma feed on
insect eggs, nectar, pollen and honeydew.  Texas experiments show that
Trichogramma pretiosum and many other parasites  live several times
longer and destroy many more pests when supplied with  nectar. Hence,
borders or strips of alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower, corn,  cover crops,
flowering herbs and certain weeds, like red-root pigweed  (Amaranthus
retroflexus), increase Trichogramma parasitism of pest eggs.  These
refugia (safe havens that are never sprayed) mimic the natural  movement
of beneficials from crop to crop. Biological control of pests is 
maximized when plants act as field insectaries, growing large
populations  of pest-fighting predators and parasites that migrate into
orchard trees  and surrounding crops.   Soviet studies reveal that
Trichogramma minutum parasitism of codling moth  is highest in release
trees. Though there is some T. minutum movement with  the prevailing
wind, downwind from the release point, the parasite tends to  remain on
the crown of the tree where released, leading to the  recommendation
that "Trichogramma should be released in the morning hours  in the lower
tiers of the crown of EACH fruit-bearing tree."   In single release
Soviet studies, there was 6-28% parasitism with 2,000  Trichogramma per
tree. "With 500 and 1,000 eggs of codling moth per tree  and a ratio of
parasites to host of 10:1 and 5:1 the rate of parasitism was  30 to 39%.
A decrease in number of eggs to 200 increased the parasite ratio  (25:1)
but parasitism declined to 17%. This is attributable to the fact  that
if the number of host eggs is low it is difficult for the parasite to 
locate them. In polyphagous Trichogramma, which are characterized by a
low  searching ability, searching activity increases once the first host
eggs  are located."   Achievement of 70 to 96 percent Trichogramma
parasitism of codling moth  eggs required releasing either 10,000 or
20,000 Trichogramma per tree.  Studies in the various climatic zones of
the Soviet Union also "revealed  that when the pest population is low
the release of fewer Trichogramma,  done once in the first days of
oviposition, yield a low rate of parasitism  -- a little more than 10%.
Only with the appearance of the progeny of the  released Trichogramma,
i.e., 10 to 20 days later, does the rate of  parasitism rise to 30 to
40%, gradually increasing to 70 to 90%" (Zhilyaeva  et. al., in
Pristavko ed. 1981).   Hence, growers should not treat either
Trichogramma minutum (species for  east coast release) or Trichogramma
platneri (species for west coast  release) as "magic bullets" or
pesticides. Trichogramma need to be  integrated into a larger natural
enemy complex, and provided alternate  hosts that favor a buildup of
predator and parasite populations in  multi-year integrated pest
management programs where pesticide use is  phased out.  ECOLOGICAL
FARMING ENHANCES BIOCONTROL IN ALL CROPS   Best results are seen 3 to 5
years after the start of beneficial insect  releases. The first year of
transition from pesticides to greater reliance  upon biological control
is the most difficult. Each year of ecological  farming, the background
level of indigenous predators and parasites helping  Rincon-Vitova's
insectary-reared beneficials increases. Many farmers shake  their heads
in disbelief when looking back at their past chemical pest  control
practices, which seem wastefully expensive and barbaric in  comparison
to relying on natural enemies.    Pesticide interference and drift is a
major cause of biological control  failure. We recommend Croft's book
(see references at end) to those making  the transition from pesticides
to biological control, as it covers  selective pesticide use concepts
(e.g. lower doses, spraying only borders,  alternate rows, selected
parts of the plant canopy etc.) that conserve  biological control
organisms.   A quality control specialist works to insure that the best
possible product  is sent out. Nevertheless, sometimes shipments of
fragile insects can  arrive injured or otherwise not meet expectations.
As we stand behind all  product shipped, please feel free to contact us
should you ever feel that  there is a problem or that a replacement may
be necessary.  SELECTED REFERENCES  Croft, Brian A. 1990. Arthropod

<center><h2>The Stained Glass Window</h2><br>
A scary story by Aquila Tyndall</center>
<p>
Amy was 12 when her parents decided to move to an old Victorian house on
the edge of town. She had lived in the same house all her life, and she
did <i>not</i> want to move.<br>
But her parents bought the house and they moved in on October 31st.<br>
Amy sulked in her room as she unpacked her things, it was halloween and
where was she? not out trick-or-treating, not at a friend's halloween
party, instead she was moving into a house she didn't want to live in.<br>
Amy's room was big, but oddly shaped, full of angles that didn't make
sense. The only window was a huge stained glass window, with a picture of
some sort of hairy beast that gave Amy the creeps, on it.<br> 
"I hate this house!" she mumbled to herself, "I hate this room! And I
hate that  ugly window!"<br>
Maybe what happened next happened because it was Halloween, or maybe just
because of how rude Amy was being. But anyway, what happened was that the
big, hairy arm of the animal painted on the window reached out and grabbed
Amy with it's long, sharp claws.<br>
When Amy's parents heard their daughter scream they rushed upstairs. But
it was too late, Amy was gone. <br>
When Amy's parents moved out it was as if they had never lived there,
except for one thing: now, on the stained glass window, there was a
picture of a girl who looked like Amy in the claws of the beast.

<H3>Mark S. Hutchenreuther (Hutch)</H3>
This is a living document created on Tuesday, 17-Dec-96 11:37:04 PST.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="newhutch.gif"></A> Yes, I do sometimes dress up!<P>
But usually I dress more casually, like this -- <IMG ALT=""SRC ="hutch.gif"></A><P>
NOTE:  Since creating this page, I have entered a relationship. I welcome your e-mail, but please understand that I am not available at this time. I have high hopes that this ad will be deleted and I will be leaving the ranks of singledom in the near future.<P>
Divorced (1978), non-smoker, no children, no alimony, born 3/9/48, INTP, conservative Midwestern 
value system. Live in San Luis Obispo County on the Central Coast of California, near the beach, but not 
far from the coastal mountains.<P>
I am comfortably bald with graying light brown hair (my mother likes to think of me as blonde, not sure if 
that is good or not...), partially bearded, wear glasses over my blue eyes, stand 5'6", and need more 
exerceise and less food. Other than your basic allergies, I am in great health.<P>
After graduating from college, I went to work for the Navy as a civilian, with the original thought of 
avoiding the draft. I ended up working for them for 25 years until 1995, when I took advantage of an 
opportunity to retire early. I have moved up the coast a ways to a slower, more laid-back, area where I can 
relax, teach, or continue with a second career.<P>
It is difficult to describe someone in a few words, but if I were to pick a few they would most likely be:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Happy
<LI>Creative
<LI>Great sense of humor
<LI>Educated
<LI>Learner and teacher
<LI>Analytical
<LI>Active
<LI>Leader
</UL>
These are described in Greater Detail Below.<P>
<H3>What I Am Seeking</H3>
Obviously, I am seeking someone who enjoys many of the same things I do, but not necessarily all. I 
would hope that we would be interested in the unique activities of each other's, and new activities as well. 
In other words, there should be opportunities to learn and teach in the relationship.<P>
I would rather you were a non-smoker, hope that you are a social drinker who enjoys a good bottle of wine 
or a microbrewery like I do, and have a solid value system without being overly religious. Older children 
are OK, especially if they are no longer at home. (Grin) I prefer a cat person to a dog person, but in any 
case you should be an animal lover, and nature lover, although I am generally turned off by radical 
environmentalists, and radical anythings.<P>
You might be a few years older than I am, but not too much younger than I am, and about the same size as 
I am. I'm more interested in your mind than your body, and really enjoy a quiet evening at home in front 
of a fire with cats in our laps, sharing stories and a bottle of wine, laughing ourselves silly.<P>
You need not be a computer nerd, or even own a computer, but should be comfortable with new 
technology. You should be educated with a lifelong desire to learn, and might be an artist or writer. If my 
past is any indication of the future, you will probably be a Leo or Pisces. (G)<P>
<H3>Greater Detail Below</H3>
I could easily devote an entire page to each of those topics above, and in several cases they DO link to 
another page that gets into great detail on those topics. Happy? You betcha! Early retirement was just 
what I needed, and I didn't even read "New Passages" by Gail Sheehy until after I did it. I am still 
thinking about a second career, and it will be one that is related to my creative side.<P>
People seek me out because of my creative mind and talents. Now that I have more time, I will be doing 
more paintings and other <A HREF = "arts.html">crafts</A>, as well as more writing. I edit a number of 
newsletters because it gives me a chance to write on a regular basis, but I also have a couple of screen 
plays I am working with. I have written a number of essays and <A HREF = "articles.html">articles</A> 
that have been printed in the newsletters I edit, and I continue to write jokes for my <A HREF = 
"cm_sig.html">Creative Mischief SIG</A>, a special interest group I founded and coordinate within 
Mensa. My sense of humor shows through in the jokes, the articles, my editor's columns, and even in 
some of my arts and crafts. Artistically, I am a surrealist, and have done some erotic works.<P>
<A HREF = "degrees.html">I have</A> a BS in mechanical engineering, and an MS in electronics and 
computer engineering, but my most recent work was in programming and computer <A HREF = 
"resume.html">engineering</A>. I still spend a lot of time on my computers at home, and offer some of 
that time and talent to organizations I am a member of. I hope to teach part-time at CalPoly again now 
that I am retired and in the area, or maybe at one of the two nearby community colleges. In the meantime 
I continue to present programs at Mensa gatherings, and am looking into building that seminar list into a 
part-time <A HREF = "laugh.html">business</A>. I also enjoy attending classes, and continue to learn as 
I prepare for the seminars and classes I teach. I often apply my analytical engineering background to other 
areas I am involved in.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.mensa.org/">Mensa</A> is my primary source of activity, but I am also 
involved in the local <A HREF = "groups.html">ski club</A> and three local singles <A HREF = 
"single.html">clubs</A>. I am the editor of our local Mensa newsletter, having served for several years as 
their president. (I seem to become the leader in whatever group I join.) I am also editing the newsletters 
for two of the singles groups, and may create a commercial <A HREF = "weird_em.html">newsletter</A> 
or two as yet another part-time business.<P>
I enjoy skiing, bicycling, sightseeing (including wine tasting), art shows, music festivals, fruit and 
vegetable festivals (strawberries, artichokes, broccoli, garlic, etc.), cats, gardening, writing, books, 
renaissance faires, tennis, coffee, chocolate, and more. Did I mention that I enjoy cooking?<P>
Favorite movies include "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai," "This is Spinal Tap," "A Fish Called 
Wanda," and all Monty Python movies. Favorite books include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy of five books, though I am not a hard-core Sci-Fi fan
<LI>Self help books
<LI>Personality assessment books
<LI>Anti-clutter books, which I discovered I have six of, and which were located in six different 
bookcases in five different rooms of my old house.
<LI>Local history books
</UL>
And all the stuff in the many boxes in the garage awaiting unpacking and shelving.<P>
<H3>How to Contact Me
</H3><P>
I would be delighted if you simply called, but understand why you might be reluctant to do that. So, you 
can send me e-mail or regular mail, and we can go from there.<P>

<br>
<b><center>This months review by Ayami Tyndall - Grade 2</b></center>
<br>
<h2><b>How would you survive? Published by Grolier.</h2></b>
</p>
<p>
"How Would You Survive?" has lot's of information about the ancient 
Egyptian, Aztec, and Viking cultures, which you can find in movies, 
stories, and pictures throughout the CD.  You can learn about each 
Civilization's food, clothing, medicine, architecture, family structure, 
beliefs, and much more.  You can find out all sorts of interesting 
things, like what would it mean to an ancient Egyptian if they dreamt 
their teeth fell out?  How would a Viking Blacksmith make a sword?  Or 
what would an Aztec have for dinner?
</p>
<p>
And once you have thoroughly explored one of the cultures you can play 
the game specific to that culture, and test your knowledge about how the 
ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, or Vikings lived.
</p>
<p>
<b>The KNN gives "How Would You Survive?" - a CD-ROM for both Windows and
Macintosh, four stars! <img src="bl_sdi.gif"><img src="bl_sdi.gif"><img

<b><center>Eggplant Pita Sandwiches</b></center>
</p>
<p>
<b>Serves: 4
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 cup cooked brown rice
<br>
1 Tablespoon virgin olive oil
<br>
1 Eggplant, peeled and chopped
<br>
1 Onion, chopped
<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced
<br>
1 16 ounce can whole tomatoes, chopped (reserve liquid)
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
<br>
4 large pita rounds, cut in half
</p>
<p>
<img src="turq.gif">
<b>In a wok or large skillet, heat the oil and stir-fry the eggplant for 
5 to 10 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic, and stir-fry a few more 
minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato liquid, salt and cayenne pepper.  
Cover and simmer until eggplant reaches desired tenderness.  Place 
mixture in a bowl, stir in rice.  Fill the pita pockets with the 
rice-eggplant mixture.  Heat the filled pockets in your microwave or 
toaster-oven.
<br>
Before cooking, cut eggplant into rounds, salt and let sit for one hour, 
then rinse and pat dry with paper towels.  This removes the bitter tannic 
acid from the eggplant.

<p>
<h1><i>Notes From The Director</h1></i>
</p>
<p>
<h2><b>Kids' Window on the World</h2></b>
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center>
</p>
<p>
<b>Children's Librarians from throughout the tri-counties gathered at 
the Faulkener Gallery of the Santa Barbara Public Library early in March 
to explore resources for children on the Internet.  The Children's 
Committee Workshops, hosted by the Black Gold Cooperative Library System, 
was an excellent introduction to the web for many of our tri-county 
public librarians.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally in the role of accessing and providing information, 
librarians throughout America are beginning to understand their central 
role as navigators or guides to the new literacy born from the Internet.  
World Wide Web computers will soon be a regular part of the Library 
Interface.
</p>
<p>
Presenting selected sites and resources for Kids' Window on the World 
were Roxanne Burg from the Thousand Oaks Public Library and student 
presenter <a href="http:mailto:aquila@rain.org">Aquila Tyndall, 8th 
grade.</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Camp Internet is now an affiliate of the Wildlife Preservation Trust.</b>
Many new resources, from their printed newsletters, to an incredible web 
site that provides a forum for children to address environmental issues, 
are now available to Camp Internet Families.
</p>
<p>
<b>RAIN's Net-Time T.V. program featured the Kids News Net on several 
shows this year.  Our Chief Editor went on site to UCSB Studio Arts and 
Brooks Institute, to interview teachers working with art and technology. 
KNN also visited the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and 
the Santa Barbara Middle School to do interviews for Net-Time TV. Kids at 
Middle School were filmed in the computer lab, working on a CD-ROM 
authoring project and on the Internet.
</p> 
<p>
<b>Election '96</b> and the impact of Internet based voting and political 
information access via the Internet on kids who use the Internet.  In a 
special Net-Time TV show Ken Petit, SB County Clerk/Recorder and Ken 
Owen, Chairperson of the Democratic Central Committee and Santa Barbara 
Harbor Commissioner, discussed the deep importance of new technologies like
the Internet. The Internet provides a tool as powerful as Television to
make the Democratic Process really work.  The Internet and local Community 
Networks give regular people the long needed tool that lets them be in 
contact with elected officials as well as have access to the most current  
information.  The empowerment of the democratic process through the use of 
the Internet will be very visible during the 1996 Presidential election.
</p>
<p>
<img src="dust.gif">
<b>What do you think will be the impact when 18 year olds can vote via 
the Internet.  <a href="mailto:styndall@rain.org">Leave your opinion 
here.</a>  Will it shift the balance of voting power in a dramatic new 
way?  Follow RAIN's Election '96 and we'll see what the Kids in the 
tri-counties think.
</p>
<p>
<b>Camp Internet 1996</a> - This summer is really special.  The 
RAIN-Dolphin program continues for it's second year as does the 
RAIN-Atlantis project, both addressing topics fascinating to parents and 
kids alike.  Added to the Summer Internet Camp this year is the 
RAIN-Habitat Project, the RAIN-Seed Project and the RAIN-Nipumu Project.

<TITLE>Attitude, Age, and Attraction</TITLE>
<H1>Attitude, Age, and Attraction</H1>
<H2>Happy people are naturally younger looking 
and a whole lot more attractive</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Perhaps the biggest issue I discuss in my talk on being single is the issue of being happy with who you are. The 
problem is that we first have to figure out who we are, then we have to figure out if we are happy with who we are, 
and if we are not happy with who we are then we need to figure out how to change that.<P>
How do you figure out who you are? Well, when it comes time to fill out a form for a free personal ad at one of the 
local <I>New Times</I> Connections parties, it's a bit late. You are probably not going to describe 
<B><I>who</I></B> you are, but rather <B><I>what</I></B> you are. Your height, weight, and hair and eye 
color do nothing but describe you physically. Save that information for describing yourself when the two of you are 
going to meet for coffee for the first time. If you don't list any of this and they want to know about it, think about 
that for a minute. Do you really want to get into a relationship with someone who is more interested in your height 
and weight than your hobbies and interests?<P>
Take some time one day and sit down with a fresh cup of coffee, or a martini, and really think about who you are. 
What is important to you? Religion? Sports? Fine arts? A certain cuisine? What makes you tick? How and where 
were you raised? What are you looking for in a partner? Make a list of questions like this and then write down the 
answers. Think about what you do each day, week, month, and year. Don't be afraid to hang a few labels on 
yourself, labels like conservative, religious, optimist, etc.<P>
You might want to pick up a book or two that includes a self-scoring test. Or, if you are a student, see if you can 
take a test or two through the school's counselling center. The Myers-Briggs or Kiersey test is a good one that 
determines which of sixteen personality types you are. For example, I am an INTP, which stands for Introverted 
iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving. Or you can take a similar short test to determine your Enneagram and which of 9 
personality types you are. I forget which number I am, but I prefer the Myers-Briggs anyway. And there are many 
other types of tests.<P>
Once you have a handle on who you are, the next step is to figure out if you are happy with that. Why would you be 
unhappy with who you are? Well, you are most likely only unhappy about one or two aspects of who you are, and if 
you set your mind to it, you can work on changing those. For example, you may be judgmental. You may be 
making quick remarks about what other people are discussing, and that may be turning them off. So you need to 
work on letting people make their statements, without dismissing their opinions outright. You probably won't 
convince them they are wrong, nor will they convince you that you are wrong, but at least you can carry on a 
conversation for several minutes rather than several seconds. If this sounds overly simplified, it is. It isn't easy 
changing aspects of our personality, but the first step is to figure out what could be changed.<P>
Once you have gone through this drill, you can work on something else. You can figure out what you want, and 
what you are looking for. The list you create will be preliminary, and as you begin to actually explore what you are 
looking for, you will find yourself making adjustments in that list. You will make progress in your quest and waste 
less of your time, and your life will be more fulfilling.<P>
OK, so now let's assume that you have figured out who you are, and are happy with this. First of all, now you can 
describe yourself in a much different light in a personal ad, And you also have something to talk about in a mixer 
environment. And now comes the big bonus.<P>
A happy person is much more attractive than an unhappy person. Initially it might show most in the eyes and 
smile, but it eventually spreads to the whole body and becomes an aura. Others don't notice that your hair is gray, 
or that you are bald. They don't notice that you are a bit overweight, or wear glasses. They want to meet you and 
get to know you. If they already know you, they want to talk to you.<P>
Think about how you feel and what you think of people who are <B><I>not</I></B> happy. The question that 
comes to mind is, "Gee, I wonder what is wrong with them?" Do you really want to find out? Probably not. So you 
certainly don't want to project that image yourself. If there really is something that is bothering you at the moment, 
if people know you as a happy person, they will seek you out to learn what is wrong, and try to cheer you up. 
However, they have to have known you to be a happy person before they will do this. So if you are having a 
problem, be up front about it, and that alone may help make it go away and make you look like the happy person 
you normally are.<P>
The other neat thing about radiating this aura of happiness is that it magically makes you appear younger. 
Carrying around an attitude, or looking unhappy adds years to your appearance and makes you look older than you 
really are.<P>
So lose that attitude. Learn who you are and be happy with who you are. You will look younger and be a whole lot 
more attractive.<P>

<LI><H3><EM><LI> <H3><EM>What can you tell me about the <A HREF=lowom.htm>'Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island'</A> and her tribe?</H3></EM><P>


<H4>The Island of San Nicolas was home to a people who spoke a language in the Uto-Aztecan Linguistic Family.  This family of languages was widespread in California, the Great Basin, the American Southwest and down into Central Mexico.  The Indians of San Nicolas were not related to the Chumash of the Northern Channel Islands, but they traded with them.<P>

     The last Indians on San Nicolas Island were removed in the mid 1830s, except for the <A HREF=lowom.htm>Lone Woman</A>.  She was discovered about 1853 and was taken to Santa Barbara.  The Chumash Indians there could not understand her language.  She died within a few weeks from dysentery.  She was given the Spanish name, Juana Maria, by one of the priests at Santa Barbara Mission.  There are several books and historical articles that describe what is factually known about the Lone Woman. The book, Original Accounts of the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island, edited by Robert Heizer and Albert Elsasser, may be available through a College or University Library in your area.</H4><P>

<CENTER><A HREF=womref.htm><H4>References Regarding the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island</H4></A></CENTER><P>

<BR>

<LI> <H3><EM>Where did Chumash Indians live?<EM></H3><P>

<H4>The Chumash Indians lived along the coast, in adjacent inland valleys, and also on the Northern Channel Islands between the town of Malibu and northward to about Paso Robles.  They lived in about 150 independent towns with a total population of about 18,000 people speaking several related but mutually unintelligible languages.  Their neighbors were the Gabrielino (Tongva) on the south, the Tataviam (Alliklik) on the southeast, the Yokuts on the east, and the Salinan on the north.</H4>

<BR>

<LI> <H3><EM>How did the Chumash build their houses?<EM></H3><P>

<H4>The Chumash used tule or bulrush (Scirpus sp.) as thatching for their houses ('ap).  Willow and sycamore were used for the frame.  These domed houses were quite spacious, 30 feet or more in diameter (not simply small huts, as they are sometimes inaccurately portrayed).  On the Channel Islands, seagrass (Phyllospadix sp.) was gathered from tidepools and used as thatching instead of tule.  For further information and pictures, consult Vol. 2 of The Material Culture of the Chumash Interaction Sphere by Travis Hudson and Thomas Blackburn (see <A HREF=topten.htm>Recommended Publications</A> or for ordering information see <A HREF=order.htm>Anthropology Publications for Sale</A>).</H4><P>

<BR>

<LI> <H3><EM>What kinds of weapons, hunting tools, and fishing gear did the Chumash Indians use?</H3><P>

<H4>The Chumash used the bow and arrow for their weapons.  The bow and arrow began to be used by them about 1,500 years ago.  Before that, they used the spear thrower.  They also used a harpoon with a detachable foreshaft for spearing large fish.  They made curved, circular fishhooks from abalone and mussel shells for catching smaller fish.  Their most famous manufactured item was their canoe (called tomol) made from pieces of driftwood that were worked into planks and sewn together with cordage made from the hemp plant.  The seams between the planks were sealed together with tar that was gathered from oil seeps.<H4><P>

<LI><H3><EM>What tool was the most important one for the Chumash?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>It is hard to say which tool was most important, because so many tools were used in their daily lives and all were useful.   One of the most important tools was their plank canoe called the "tomol."  Tomols were used in ocean-fishing and to travel back and forth between coastal towns.  These watercraft also were very important in trade between the islands and mainland.</H4><P>

<LI><H3><EM>How many people could fit in a canoe?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>The typical canoe, called "tomol," held three people.</H4>

<LI><H3><EM>How long did the canoes last?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>We don't really know how long their canoes might last after they built them.  It probably depended on how often they were used an how much wear and tear they experienced.  The last Chumash tomols used for fishing were made about 1850.  In 1913, an elderly Chumash man, Fernando Librado, made a tomol for an anthropologist, John P. Harrington, to show how they were built.  He had seen the last tomols being built when he was a young man. This boat is now on exhibit in the Indian Hall at our museum.  In the past twenty years several Chumash tomols have been made using John Harrington's notes to guide their construction.</H4>


<LI><H3><EM>What was their money made out of?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>The bead money was usually made from small disks shaped from the Olivella shell (also called the Purple Olive, a marine snail).  The Indians who lived on the Channel Islands specialized in making the bead money.  They were the "mint" for the Chumash Indians who lived on the mainland.  The name Chumash comes form the name that the mainland Indians gave to the island Indians.  Chumash and 'anchum' are related words, apparently Chumash originally meant somehething like 'bead money makers'.</H4>

<LI><H3><EM>What was their money worth?</EM><H3><P>

<H4>The value of the money depended on the labor invested to make it and the rarity of the shell that was used.  The disk beads made from the callus (the thick part of the shell near its opening) were worth twice as much as the disk beads made from the wall of the shell, because many more beads could be made from the wall, so they were less rare.  They would measure a strand of beads according to how many spans of a person's hand it would wrap around.</H4><P>

<LI> <H3><EM>How long did Chumash Indians live?</H3></EM><P>

<H4>Their lives were not as long as ours.  The average life expectancy may have only been about 35, or even less, although mission records document that some elders survived into their 70s and 80s.  After California became a Spanish colony, diseases were introduced that had a devastating effect on the Chumash, especially on very young children.  Not too many people survived childhood, so the Chumash population declined rapidly.  The worst epidemic of the Mission Period was a measles epidemic in the winter of 1806.  It took many lives all up and down California.  The Chumash had never experienced measles before the coming of the Europeans, so it was a deadly disease to them.</H4><P>

<LI><H3><EM>Were there doctors?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>The Chumash had several kinds of doctors.  They believed that disease resulted from problems with a person's spiritual state, so they concentrated on healing the spirit.  More information about Chumash medicinal practices are contained in a book, Chumash Healing (see <A HREF=topten.htm>Recommended Publications</A> or for ordering information see <A HREF=order.htm>Anthropology Publications for Sale</A>).</H4>

<LI><H3><EM>What was the Chumash Indians medicine made out of?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>Many kinds of plants were used to make medicines.  One of the most powerful was called chuchupate.  It was a root in the Carrot Family that grew high in the mountains.  It was chewed to give a person strength and ward off disease.</H4>

<LI><H3><EM>What does the medicine look, feel, taste and smell like?</EM></H3><P>

<H4>There were many kinds of medicine.  Besides bark, roots, and flowers of various kinds of plants, minerals were sometimes ground up and used by mixing with animal fat.  Sea water was used as a purgative to clean the digestive system.  Certain kinds of treatment required swallowing live red ants.</H4><P>

Few figures in California history have the enduring appeal of the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island.  Every year hundreds of schoolchildren read Scott O'Dell's fictional account, <EM>Island of the Blue Dolphins</EM>, and many people contact the Museum for information about the Lone Woman.  Her story embodies the demise of native peoples and traditions following Spanish and American colonization.<P>In the early 1800's, Russian and Aleut sea otter hunters clashed violently with Indian people living on remote San Nicolas Island.  The mission padres requested that these Indians be moved to the mainland for their own safety, and in 1835 a schooner was sent to pick them up.<P>As the ship was being loaded, a woman discovered her child had been left in the village and went back to find it.  Meanwhile a strong wind arose.  The ship was forced to sail and the woman was abandoned on the island, her child apparently killed by wild dogs.  The schooner was unable to go back for her, and she spent eighteen years alone on the barren, windswept island.  She never saw her fellow islanders again.<P>In 1853 when she had been all but forgotten, a party headed by sea otter hunter George Nidever found the Indian woman alive and well on San Nicolas.  Clad in a dress of cormorant skins sewn together, she lived in a shelter made from whale bones.  She was pleased to see her rescuers and willingly went with them, bringing along only a few possessions--water baskets, bone needles, and the feathered dress.<P>Nidever brought her home to live with him and his wife in Santa Barbara, where she caused quite a sensation.  She enjoyed the company of the steady stream of visitors who came to see her.  No one, including the local Chumash Indians, could understand her language, which was related to that of native peoples in the Los Angeles area.<P>In town, the new living conditions and altered diet affected the woman's health.  She contracted dysentery and died after she had been on the mainland for only seven weeks.  The Lone Woman was baptized conditionally with the Christian name Juana Maria (her Indian name is unknown) and buried in an unmarked grave at Mission Santa Barbara.<P>It was said that the mission priest sent her feathered dress to Rome, but researchers have found no indication that it was ever received by the Vatican Museum.  The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed the woman's water basket and bone needles, which were part of the collections of a museum there.  Now only memories remain of the Lone Woman and her tragic story.<BR>

<P>

<H4>The Museum's Anthropology Department is a foremost center for Chumash studies. Active research in ethnohistory, ethnobiology and material culture is disseminated through professional meetings and publications as well as public lectures, field trips and workshops conducted by Anthropology staff. The department is a popular community resource for artifact identification and information on Native American cultures. Numerous Indian people participate in Museum research, programs and collection management.



<P>The archaeological collection of 50,000 objects from the Santa Barbara coast and islands spans nearly l0,000 years of cultural development in the region. Large collections of photographs, field notes, linguistic materials, John P. Harrington papers, and rock art archives further enhance our understanding of Chumash culture and history. Ethnographic collections representing tribal groups throughout western North America include basketry, textiles, pottery, woodcarvings and other materials which are used for research and exhibition.

<TITLE>Secrets of Chumash Social Life</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H2><EM>Secrets of Chumash Social Life</EM></H2>

<H4><EM>By John R. Johnson, Ph.D.</H4></EM>

<BR>
<BR>
Why did the Chumash chiefs marry differently than other people in their society?  Why did men who were chiefs have more than one wife, while others were monogamous?  Why did most Chumash men move to their wife's community while the chief's wives followed their husband?  Why did chiefs' families intermarry and why did their spouses often come from distant towns?  These are some of the questions that have been raised through studies of Chumash social organization over the past decade.<P>

When the Chumash Indians were first contacted by Europeans, they lived in a society that differed sharply from the one to which the newcomers were accustomed.  Rather than possessing a national identity, the basic units of Chumash society were independent towns and villages.  Sometimes a particularly effective chief would have authority over several towns, but he was by no means all-powerful.  While the basis for his leadership may partly have been determined by birth, it was more dependent on personality, the ability to control certain economic activities, and success in creation of alliances with other chiefs.<P>

Unfortunately, no fully-detailed descriptions of the social and political workings of Chumash society were written down during the Spanish Period.  Several generations were to pass before anthropologists like John P. Harrington began to unveil the Chumash past through ethnographic investigations.  By this time, pre-European social and political patterns had long been forgotten.<P>

Although the Franciscan missionaries did not describe Chumash social life, the meticulous records they kept of Indian baptisms and marriages at each mission comprise a remarkable source of information for anthropological research.  Over the past two decades, I have systematically collected data contained in the mission records to study Chumash marriage and family patterns.  From this effort has emerged a regional view of how Chumash economic and political relations were reinforced through intermarriage.<P>

A highly significant piece of information obtained from the study of mission register data is that the Chumash practiced matrilocal residence: that is, the husband would usually move to his wife's community upon marriage and live among her relatives.  The discovery that the Chumash were matrilocal was unexpected, because anthropologists had previously believed the Chumash to be partilocal like neighboring cultural groups who surrounded them at the time of European contact.<P>

Chumash chiefs were different than the rest of their society in the way they married and where they lived after marriage.  This summer I was invited to attend an Institute in Comparative Anthropological Research sponsored by the National Science Foundation.  This gave me the opportunity to pursue research in marriage patterns of political leaders in the 14% of the world's cultures that practice matrilocal residence.  I discovered that the Chumash were not unique--chiefs in other matrilocal societies often deviated from the general population in their marriage habits.  In the majority of cases I studied, chiefs would bring their wives to reside with them when they ascended to political office.  In most societies with matrilocal residence, polygamy was limited to chiefs only.  This contrasted with polygamy in patrilocal societies, where any man could accumulate wives based on his ability to support them.<P>

It would seem, therefore, that living with one's wife's relatives, as is the case with matrilocal societies, is the major factor determining what kind of polygamy is allowed.  Chiefs vary from the rest of society, not only because they usually live among their own relatives, but also because their authority is partly based on economic and political alliances that can be built through marrying additional wives from other chiefs' families.  Throughout the world, marriage practices tend to influence other aspects of cultural behavior.  Understanding Chumash marriage and family patterns will allow us to further our knowledge about a culture whose history is still being written.<BR>

<TITLE>Weathering an Environmental Crisis?</TITLE>

<H2><EM>Weathering an Environmental Crisis?</EM></H2>
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of a small clam in Indian middens is providing the first archaeological clues to a possible environmental crisis suffered by the Chumash Indians about eight centuries ago.  A major drought hit much of the American Southwest between AD 1150 and AD 1300, evidenced by lowered lake levels and narrow tree-ring growth bands.  Populous pueblos in such places as Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon were abandoned during this period.  Archaeological evidence is accumulating to demonstrate that California Indians suffered as well.  Some Chumash villages seem to have been abandoned or relocated during this time, and social disruption and warfare increased among the people.<P>Detailed study of marine sediment cores from the Santa Barbara Channel reveals a past record of sea temperatures that covers thousands of years.  During the drought on the mainland that began about A.D. 1150, a significant warming of local ocean waters may have led to the collapse of marine resources on which the Chumash depended for their livelihood.  Archaeologists have previously documented major changes in Chumash culture around this period.<P>For the past seven years, the Museum's anthropology staff and volunteers have been carefully sorting and analyzing archaeological samples excavated at <EM>Shuku</EM>, a former village at Rincon Point, to shed light on changes in Chumash life during the 2,000 years preceding European contact.  In addition to sharks and rays, which were a major component in Chumash diet, the residents of <EM>Shuku</EM> were also very fond of shellfish species such as mussel, pismo clam, and littleneck clam.  It is the presence of <EM>Donax gouldii</EM>, a small clam which reaches its northern limit in the Santa Barbara region, that has caused much excitement among archaeologists.  It provides the first archaeological marker that correlates marine sediment core studies with discoveries at an archaeological site.  The clam is an excellent indicator of warm water events and its abundance in certain excavated samples appears to signal the extreme warming of sea temperatures that occurred about eight centuries ago.  The discovery also suggests that changing environmental conditions forced the Chumash to modify their diet in addition to relocating their villages.<BR>

<BR>

Curator of Anthropology Dr. John Johnson has a reputation for asking hair-raising questions.  Over the past five years, John has collected more than 100 hair follicle samples as part of his research into the genetic relationships among California Indian tribes belonging to different linguistic families.<P>Before European contact, California had one of the most diverse populations of Native Americans anywhere in the country.  Over 60 different languages were spoken within a vast patchwork of different cultural groups.  How closely were these groups related to one another?  Did intermarriage result in genetic similarities or did some populations maintain their genetic distinctions?  How can such questions from the past be answered today?<P>Found in the chromosomes of all living cells, nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transmits hereditary information from parents to children.  Outside the nucleus of the cell exist mitochondria that convert food to energy and also contain a DNA molecule which is inherited only along female lines, mother to daughter.  By examining the mitochondrial DNA of Chumash living today, John hopes to gather clues regarding the genetic prehistory of the Chumash Indians who lived in south central California and determine if they were genetically distinct from other neighboring tribes.<P>John has collaborated with Dr. Joseph Lorenz at the Genetic Testing Laboratory in Colorado.  Emerging from their work are a few tantalizing glimpses of Chumash genetic ancestry.  The vast majority of American Indians belong to four mitochondrial groups (A through D) known as clades.  A clade is a group of related genetic lineages that descend from a common ancestor.  The founding populations of the Americas appear to have been relatively small and to have originated in Asia.  The same four clades present among Native Americans are still found in East Asia.<P>Working with Chumash descendants whose family ancestries were established through Mission records and other sources, John located 13 surviving mitochondrial lineages.  With permission from descendants, hair follicle samples were first screened to see into which clade they would fall.  The results indicate that three Chumash samples within Clade A may be traced back to women living in widely separated villages at the time of Spanish contact.  Although they differed slightly, these three Chumash lineages were more closely related to each other than to any other Clade A lineages in the Americas.<P>John's research provides a window into the past through which we see the first hint of genetic relationships among Chumash populations.  The slight degree of variation in mitochondrial lineages may be the result of slowly accumulating genetic change over a long period of time.  If this initial observation is supported by further research, it attests to great antiquity for Chumash presence within the Santa Barbara region.<BR>

<H2><EM>Island Life from Long Ago</EM></H2>

<H4><EM>By John R. Johnson, Ph.D.</H4></EM>

Based on archaeological evidence, it appears that American Indians first arrived on the Channel Islands at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago.  At the time they encountered conditions much different than exist today.  The islands were united in one mega-island, called Santarosae by geologists (see fall 1993<EM> Alolkoy</EM>), which was much closer to the mainland than the present chain.<P>The climate was cooler, and an extensive pine forest covered much of the islands.  Pygmy elephants once roamed there, having evolved from imperial mammoths that swam the Channel.<P>Were the first people to arrive on the Channel Islands the ancestors of the Native American group that we know today as the Chumash?  More than 10 millennia passed before Europeans first encountered the Chumash islanders; conceivably population migrations and replacements took place during the intervening centuries.<P>At the time Spanish settlement began in the late 18th century, there were an estimated 3,000 islanders.  They spoke a Chumash language akin to that spoken on the mainland, yet as distantly related as English is to German.  This indicates many centuries of separation as distinct language communities.<P>"Chumash" is a term used by anthropologists to designate not one tribe but rather a family of related Indian languages spoken in south central California.<P>The name was derived from the word '<EM>anchum</EM>, which meant "bead money," because the Chumash islanders manufactured the Olivella shell disc beads that circulated as a medium of exchange throughout much of southern California.<P>In the early 19th century, Spanish missionaries reported the existence of 10 Chumash towns on Santa Cruz Island, seven on Santa Rosa, and two on San Miguel.  Anacapa Island was not permanently inhabited but was visited for ceremonies and to collect shellfish.  Only the largest island towns had chiefs, and one of the towns on Santa Cruz Island was governed by a chief who was recognized as having authority over the other chiefs of the island.<P>The largest of the island towns may have been composed of 50 domed houses, thatched with seagrass, which held from four to seven people each.  The chief's house was the largest and served also as a meeting place for the village leaders.  The smallest island towns only consisted of a few households.<P>Most island men were fishermen.  They built sewn plank boats caulked with tar for fishing and transportation.  Ethnographic evidence suggests that canoemen belonged to a special guild that cut across village affiliation, called the Brotherhood of the Canoe.<P>The chief, by means of his wealth, seems to have subsidized the making of shell bead money, perhaps by older people, which was then exchanged for resources and manufactured items from mainland towns that were unattainable on the island.<P>Women collected plant foods and shellfish and wove baskets used as containers and for cooking.  Women held a high rank in Chumash society and sometimes became chiefs.  Chumash traditional history records that a princess was the first to unify all the villages on Santa Cruz Island into one political group.<P>Usually men moved to their wife's town when they married.  This fact may be determined by reconstruction of family patterns in baptismal and marriage records kept by the missionaries.  What happened to the Chumash after the Mission Period ended in 1834 is the subject of another story.<BR>

From the outset of Spanish colonization of upper California in 1769, the government moved slowly in its attempts to "missionize" the Chumash islanders.  The Viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Carlos de Croix, wrote Friar Junipero Serra that the Indians were not to be transferred to mainland missions, in part because their presence prevented other nations from settling off the California coast.<P>Forty-Five years passed before the islanders joined their linguistic relatives at missions established on the mainland.  By that time their numbers had been greatly diminished because of disease epidemics.  In particular, the measles outbreak of 1806 may have taken the lives of one-fifth or more of the northern Channel Islands' population.<P>The immediate cause for the massive wave of migration of islanders to the mainland missions in 1814-1816 was apparently related to food shortages.  These years were characterized by a major El Ni&ntildeo event, probably the most severe experienced in the 180 years since then.  The influx of significantly warmer waters into the Santa Barbara Channel would have adversely affected the fishery surrounding the islands.<P>Indications of this are reflected in the correspondence of a missionary stationed at San Buenaventura, who reported that famine conditions existed on the islands by 1816.  By then there were no native mainland towns with which the islanders could trade to offset their shortfall.<P>  The missions' dependable supply of agricultural produce seemed an attractive choice to islanders greatly reduced in numbers and beset by hunger.  More than 90 percent of the remaining islanders joined the mission communities by the end of 1816.  A few remained in their traditional homes, but in 1822 the last of these reunited with families already living at the missions.<P>When large numbers of Chumash islanders arrived in this period, they were not immediately integrated into established mission Indian communities.  By then, the mainland population had become acculturated to Spanish lifeways.<P>Cultural boundaries between the mainland and island subpopulations at mission communities were reinforced by linguistic distinctiveness that existed between their respective populations.<P>Evidence for their existence mostly comes to us from anthropologist John Harrington's early 20th century interviews with elderly Chumash Indians.  One 1824 manuscript in the Santa Barbara Mission Archives mentions that some islanders were living adjacent to the Goleta estuary when the Chumash Revolt broke out.  They fled in their canoes to the islands, where they resided for some months before returning to the mainland.<P>This mainland settlement of islanders was located on More Mesa.  It was called Qwa', the Chumash name for a species of heron.  Its leader was Jose Crespin ("Sudon") <EM>Kamuliyatset</EM>, the former chief of Santa Cruz Island's capital village of Liyam.<P>At San Buenaventura, another settlement composed mostly of islanders was formed in post-mission times.  This was Kamexmey, established just west of the mouth of the Ventura River by Evaristo, a native of Swaxil, once the largest town on Santa Cruz Island.<P>The Kamexmey community seems to have persisted until the 1860's, when the last of its residents died.  Similar communities also existed at missions La Purisma (Lompoc) and Santa Ines (Solvang), which were composed of Santa Rosa and San Miguel island families.<P>The existence of residential subgroups of islanders within the larger Indian community at each mission preserved aspects of traditional island society that mirrored pre-European conditions.  These settlements featured tule houses, sweatlodges (temescals), acorn granaries, and other traditional shelters.  Traditional economic activities, such as fishing, canoe-building, and bead money-making also took place.  Shrines, where offerings were made, were located near these communities, and pre-European rituals and ceremonies were revived and maintained.<P>Because of high infant mortality, the Chumash population continued to decline after the Mission Period to the end of the 19th century.  Eventually the Chumash subgroups combined through intermarriage, but island Chumash lineages have persisted and may be traced in many family trees of modern descendants of the original people to inhabit the Channel region.<BR>

<H2><EM>The Swordfish in Chumash Prehistory</EM></H2>
<H4><EM>By John R. Johnson, Ph.D.</H4></EM>
<BR>
<BR>
The fascination that the swordfish held for the Chumash is well documented in myth, art, oral history, and material culture.  The Swordfish Dance was an important part of Chumash ceremonies and at least three rock art sites contain explicit depictions of this species.  Swordfish remains are found frequently in archaeological sites along the Santa Barbara Channel, and certain nonedible parts of the fish's anatomy were modified for both ceremonial and utilitarian purposes.  New studies based on museum collections help us reconstruct the prehistory of the Chumash swordfish fishery and correlate its development with technological and environmental changes.<P>According to Chumash tradition, all the creatures of the sea had counterparts on the land.  For example, the Chumash considered the sardine to be like the lizard; and the lobster, like the Jerusalem cricket ("potato bug").  People venerated the swordfish as "people of the sea" --marine equivalents of human beings.  They believed swordfish drove whales ashore to provide plentiful food for the people on land.  Marine biological literature documents that a factual basis lies behind this Chumash legend, because there are reports around the world of swords embedded in stranded whales.<P>Frequently both swordfish skeletal remains and finished artifacts manufactured from these remains have been recovered from archaeological sites throughout the Santa Barbara Channel region.  The Chumash modified swords, vertebrae, and vertebral spines for digging implements, cups, and needles.  They made headdresses from the swordfish cranium and decorated with abalone ornaments for dances.<P>Swordfish remains first appeared in 2,000-year-old archaeological deposits in the Santa Barbara region.  Prior to this time, they have been notably absent in collections from both island and mainland sites.  The advent of successful Chumash swordfishing appears simultaneously with two technological innovations: the plank boat (or tomol) which allowed for greater mobility and speed and the barbed harpoon foreshaft that could be thrust into the fish when it "basked" near the surface in calm waters.<P>It seems logical that most finds of swordfish skeletal parts might be recovered in island and mainland deposits nearest the places known today as the best fishing areas, but the data only partially support this expectation.  The distribution of archaeological sites containing swordfish remains extends beyond the current area of the most productive fishery.  According to commercial fishermen, swordfish today rarely enter the main part of the Santa Barbara Channel, yet their remains have been recovered from many prehistoric coastal middens between Ventura and Gaviota.<P>Climatic changes may account for the differences between the archaeological record and modern observations.  Based on analyses of sediment cores, the reconstructed sea temperature curve for the Santa Barbara Basin shows that channel waters have been cooler during the most recent 900 years than they were during the preceding millennium.  Most swordfish remains in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History collection are from archaeological sites dating between 2,000 and 900 years ago when sea temperatures were mostly warmer in the channel.  This discovery illustrates how archaeological finds may provide additional information about past environmental conditions as well as illuminate Chumash cultural history.<BR>

<TITLE>Puzzle of the 'Little Monsters'</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H2><EM>Puzzle of the 'Little Monsters'</EM></H2>
<H4><EM>By Jan Timbrook</H4></EM>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1927, shortly after the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History was formed, museum director and anthropologist D.B. Rogers recorded finding strange artifacts in three Chumash sites on Santa Cruz Island.  His archeological team excavated six, in Roger's words, "peculiar marine growths, like effigies."  Two of them were found in site levels dated at 2,800 to 3,400 years before present.<P>The items were each roughly the size and shape of a large chicken egg, and had three openings at one end.  They were lightweight, porous in texture, hard to the touch--and a mystery to Rogers and his colleagues, though he suspected they might be talismans of some sort.<P>Stumped as to their origin, Rogers filed the objects in museum drawers and cataloged them as "little monsters."  He left behind a puzzle, and no field notes to help unravel it.  No similar artifacts have been discovered in other California sites.<P>From time to time, hopeful staff would take a little monster from its closet and show it to a new set of scientific eyes, but to no avail.  Biologists, archaeologists, invertebrate zoologists, marine mammalogists, ichthyologists, and others all pronounced themselves baffled.<P>Specimens were scanned at a Santa Barbara medical clinic for anatomical features, and tested for proteins and mineral composition.  We ruled out whale ear bones, swordfish hearts, sponges, corals, tunicates, bird syringes and any protein match with 25 known land and sea animals.  We learned the objects were composed of calcium phosphate, similar to bone.<P>Finally, persistence paid off.  Zooarchaeologists at an ethnobiology conference in 1993 disclosed that similar remains found in prehistoric Native American middens in Florida had been traced to sharks.  The little monsters turned out to be a perfect match for the rostrum, a cranial projection, of the salmon or mackerel shark (<EM>Lamna ditropis</EM>).<P>It is commonly known that sharks have no true bones.  But many experts are unaware that some species exhibit such high calcium content, called hypercalcification, of certain skeletal elements they become like bone.  That is what save these unusual structures for thousands of years.<P>Salmon sharks reach 10 feet in length, are usually found in cold waters ranging from the Bering Sea down to San Diego, and swim near the shore as well as in open ocean.  They may have been more common in California during periods of colder water, such as occurred around 3,000 years ago when two of the items were apparently buried.<P>Though the island Chumash had not developed seaworthy plank canoes and harpoons at that time, they did use dead, beach-cast animals throughout their history.  Shark teeth and vertebrae are commonly found in both island and mainland sites.<P>Now that we know what they are, the little monsters still puzzle us.  We are only half way to understanding what these shark parts meant to the Chumash.  Other shark parts were modified for uses beyond that of food.<P>Teeth were perforated to hang as pendants or hafted as tools.  Vertebrae were drilled for use as beads, and sometimes decorated with inlay of tiny shell beads.<P>A human bone with a shark pictograph painted in red ochre was once found eroding out of a Santa Cruz Island site.  Realism is rare in Chumash art and decoration of human bone nearly unknown, so this unique find supports the possibility that sharks formerly had supernatural aspects and were once prominent in Chumash spiritual life.  But the true meaning of the little monsters remains a mystery.<BR>

COUNTY-WIDE VIGIL HELD AT PLAZA PARK ON DECEMBER 14
  We would like to thank everyone for supporting and attending the recent vigil for peace. Over 50 friends, family members, members of the Faith Connection, and members of the new Community for Unity (C4U) gathered on Saturday evening, December 14, at Plaza Park in Oxnard.<p>
  We lit candles, offered prayers, and shared stories in memory and support of our brothers and sisters in Ventura County who have been harmed by violence during the past several years. <p>
  As plans were being made, we learned of the murder of Gabriel Cortez. We offered a special dedication to his life and support for his family during the event.<p>

33 VENTURA COUNTY FAMILIES AFFECTED BY SENSELESS DEADLY VIOLENCE IN 1996<p>
   The young people were our neighbors, our friends, our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, our grandsons and granddaughters. They were caught up in violent environment that overwhelmed them. Their deaths resulted from tragic, cruel, senseless, and thoughtless acts.<p>
   As members of the faith community we no option but to continue to confront and work to transform those things that lead to this sort of senseless loss. We cannot deny that it is happening or walk away from it when it happens in our midst. As people of faith we must stand up against it. Violence is not the final word in any community that seeks to offer life to all who live in it.<p>
   All of our faith communities affirm the value of the life of every individual. The candles that we light at our vigils cannot be extinguished. Their light burns continually in our minds and hearts.<p>
   We remember especially the following seventeen young people who died this year and their families:<p>
					January 1					Manuel Encarnacion 				age	28<p>
																	 Jesus Silva Onofre  				age	22<p>
					January 25				Felipe Hernandez						 age	16<p>
					January 29				J. Bert Deck										 age	33<p>
																	  Luis Magana										age	15<p>
					March 3							Daniel Lara										 age  18<p>
					March 13						James Rex Jensen, Jr.		 age	30<p>
					March 30						Jennifer Vernals						 age 15<p>
					April 15						Gabriel Gomez								  age	15<p>
					April  23					 Gloria de la Cruz							age	18<p>
					May 5								Marco Aurelio Rodriguez	 age	21<p>
					May 21							Ralph Rico												 age 14<p>
					July 25							Jaime Morales									age 17<p>
					September 21		Luis Gerardo Rodriguez		age	17<p>
					October 24				Mark W. Schultz								age	20<p>
					November 23			Luis Carlos Romero					age 22<p>
					December 9				Gabriel Cortez									age 24<p>
<p>
   In addition to the young people mentioned above, we have begun to explore how our congregations can provide strength, safety, comfort, and support for those who have struggle with domestic and sexual violence. Faith Connection members have participated in vigils, meetings, and face-to-face encounters with this concern of broken trust. On occasion this year, this sort of violence has resulted in death. We remember in our prayers the families and friends of those who have struggled and died this year:<p>
				 May 5									Sherri Dally<p>
																		Michael Dally and their two sons<p>
					June 22							Joselin Hernandez<p>
																		Rogelio and Gabriela Hernandez, her father and mother<p>
					July 5								 Martin Reyes<p>
																		Edna Reyes and their eleven year old son<p>

<TITLE>Hutch's Cars</TITLE>
<H1>Hutch's Cars</H1>
Revised 10 November 1995, to reflect purchase of Plymouth and sale of Fiats.<P>
<IMG ALT="My 1977 Lancia Scorpion"SRC ="lancia.gif"></A><P>
<A HREF = "http://www.c2.org/~mark/lancia/lancia.html">1977 Lancia Scorpion</A>.  Known in the U.S. as the 
<A HREF = "http://www.lancia.com/">Lancia</A> Beta Scorpion and Europe as the Lancia Monte Carlo, mine was serial 1722 of 1806 North American 
editions.  The Scorpion/Monte Carlo was originally conceived as the Fiat X-1/20, but was initially produced as the 
Abarth 037.  (Talk about a confusing beginning, and you ought to see some of the part numbers!)  Both the 1976 
and 1977 models were all built in one calendar year, 1976.  I only know of two differences between the two model 
years:  The 1976 had red rather than amber rear turn indicators, and the 1977 has glass in the flying buttresses.  
Power is the Fiat 1756cc twin-cam engine, tilted backwards 15 degrees and placed sideways in a mid-engine 
configuration.  Stock, it is a slug.  Mine has Ansa headers with a functional EGR system, and a glass pack muffler, 
or what is left of one.  I also put in a simpler free-flow air cleaner, and swapped the stock distributor for the Spider 
2000 electronic ignition system.  Sometimes I replaced the automatic choke 32DATRA Weber carb with a manual 
choke 34DMTR, which really adds to the performance.  This was my ski car, since the engine sits over the half shafts 
for excellent winter traction.  Oh, and the trunk space is really awesome too.  I was the second owner of the car, and 
owned it from 1978 to 1996.<P>
I haven't bothered to scan in a picture of my 1994 <A HREF = "http://www.plymouthcars.com/">Plymouth</A> Acclaim, since it is so ordinary.  Which is actually 
why I got it.  I had rented one or two of them previously, and liked the feel of it.  When Enterprise Car Rental 
opened a used car lot up in Ventura, I went up there and found the Acclaim, a stealth gray one that is one of those 
so-called "invisible" cars.  Since I was planning on retirement, and more frequent travel, I needed a truly 
dependable car.  This one has a V6, so it has some guts, yet the engine compartment is remarkably simple.  You 
can actually find things in there, not like the 1976 Buick Skyhawk I used to have, with an engine compartment 
filled with hoses and wires.  The automatic transmission and air conditioning are nice features too, especially in 
LA traffic.<P>
<HR>
<H2>My Former Fiats</H2>
<IMG ALT="1969 124AC"SRC ="fiat.gif"></A>     <IMG ALT="1969 124AS"SRC ="spyder.gif"></A><P>
My Former 1969 Sport Coupe and 1969 Spyder.  I recently sold both of these cars, in preparation for my move up 
north.  The coupe ran fine, and was sold to an artist up in Gaviota.  The spyder was in pieces, and got sold as a 
parts car to a mechanic who was trying to restore his own spyder.<P>
Yes I know, <A HREF = "http://www.fiat.com/">FIAT</A> stands for "Fix It Again Tony."  I just love the sound and performance of twin-cam sports car 
engines.<P>
<HR>
<H2>My Dream Cars</H2>

If I could have my dream car, it would be the <A HREF = "http://www.ferrari.it/">Ferrari</A> 250 GTO.  They only built 39 of them, and 37 are actually 
left.  My old 1970 Z-28 Camaro and the Datsun Z-cars are styled after this classic.  Hey, I can dream!<P>
<IMG ALT="This would do"SRC ="365gtb4.gif"></A> The Ferrari 365 GTB/4.<P>
They made a few more of these, and I have seen a number of them on the road around here.  Unlike the GTO, with 
its 3-liter SOHC Testa Rosa engine, this one has the twin-cam 4.4-liter V-12.<P>
<IMG ALT="Since I couldn't have this"SRC ="512bb.gif"></A> The Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer.<P>
This is the car the Scorpion is styled after.  If only I had the 5-liter flat-12 boxer engine in the Scorpion...<P>
If all else fails, I also have an 18-speed mountain bike.<P>

<b>Kim Chen is a dreamy girl, she always has her nose in a book.  She 
wishes she were one of the heroes in her books.  She wants an adventure, 
something exciting.  Then she gets mad at her pesky little brother, and 
to scare him she says she cancall an evil witch out of her Grandmother's 
ancient (and supposedly magic) mirror.  She chants the "magic spell."  Of 
course, it's just a game, or is it?  Soon her brother starts acting 
strange, he's like a different person, literally.  And then, Kim gets 
pulled through the mirror into a parallel dimension, where everything is 
different, and evil.  Now Kim has to find a way home and save her real 
brother, all by herself.  She's finally got her adventure, but all she 
wants to do is get out of it as fast as she can.  Can she make it?
<br>
This is a great book, full of suspense; perfect for reading under your 
sheets at night, if you're brave enought that is.

I give the Tale of the Secret Mirror five stars!<img

<TITLE>Sushi -- Boat</TITLE>
<H1>Boat Sushi (<I>Gunkan-
maki</I>).</H1>
This is how salmon roe (<I>ikura</I>), small scallops, and sea urchin (<I>uni</I>) is served.  The nori 
is cut into halves and then into strips about an inch wide.  Rice about the size of a ping pong ball is 
formed into a mound.  The nori is wrapped around the rice and held in place by pasting together with 
crushed rice grains.  The rice should be pressed down so that there is 3/8 to 3/4 inch of space above the 
rice.  The rice is coated with a little wasabi and the roll is filled.  These are served in pairs.<P>
For salmon roe or small scallops, about 3/8 inch of space is needed, and the roll filled with the roe.  In the 
case of sea urchin (uni is an acquired taste/feel, though actually quite bland), the space should be closer to 
3/4 inch.  Sea urchin is spooned into about half of the remaining space.  Usually, the sea urchin is packed 
slightly and the unbroken yolk of a quail egg (<I>uzura no tamago</I>) is placed on top of the sea 
urchin.  (This is also an alleged aphrodisiac, and not traditionally offered to women.)<P>

<TITLE>Mayonnaise</TITLE>
<H1>Japanese Mayonnaise (<I>Tamago-
no-moto</I>)</H1>
I usually find it easiest to buy Japanese mayonnaise, from either an Asian market or from Hughes Market 
supermarkets in the Southwest. It comes in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Several people have asked 
about a recipe for this mayonnaise, and I recently found the following one.<P>
<Pre>
3 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1-1/2 oz (50 g) white <I>miso *</I>
1 cup salad oil
salt to taste
sprinkle of white pepper
a pinch of grated <I>yuzu**</I>, lime, or lemon peel
	* <I>miso</I> is salty paste of fermented soy beans. It is available 
in Asian markets and some health food stores. White <I>miso</I> is used 
for soups and dressings.
	** <I>yuzu</I> is a Japanese orange used only for its rind. Kaffir 
lime used in Thai or Malaysian food is an alternative, as is lemon or 
lime rind.
</Pre>
Beat the egg yolks and lemon juice with a wooden spoon in a bowl. Continue to beat, adding the salad oil 
a few drops at a time until the mixture begins to emulsify. Keep on adding the rest of the oil, then stir in 
the <I>miso</I> and the seasonings.<P>
Refrigerate in a squeeze bottle.<P>

<TITLE> Arts and Crafts</TITLE>
<H1> Arts and Crafts</H1>
As of 21 December 1994.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="dawn.gif"></A>  Dawn of Fate, 18 x 24 inches, acrylic<P>
I started painting in 1967, using a small oil-painting set my cousins gave me for Christmas.  I started out 
painting treatments of color 35mm slides I had taken, then somehow turned to original surrealistic 
paintings.  I don't know what causes surrealism, or that it can be cured, but something caused me to turn 
to that style of art and photography.  Maybe someday I will start a Surrealists Anonymous.<P>
<A HREF = "cosmos.gif">An R-rated Erotic Painting.</A>  <B>Please do not 
view if easily offended.</B><P>
When I was attending graduate school full-time on a fellowship from work, and simultaneously going 
through a divorce, I did a number of erotic surrealistic paintings.  Some would call them minimalist more 
that surrealist.  All I know is that I have done over 25 of these, all 16 x 20 inches, and all acrylic.  I 
switched to acrylic from oil a couple of years after I graduated from college, oil dried too slowly.  I soon 
learned the difficulty of acrylic drying too quickly.  Oh well!<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="clock.gif"></A>  Magritte Clock, 18 x 24 inches, acrylic on masonite<P>
I also did a lot of clocks.  My inspiration was a beautiful photographic poster with a clock in the corner.  
So I started painting clocks in context, such as a still life of a nightstand with a working alarm clock.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="drift.gif"></A>  A favorite piece of driftwood by McGrath Lake<P>
Much of the photography I have done was done in the mid '70s, after I got a new black Nikon FTN.  
When I was married, we had two Nikons and a Nikkormat, as well as bunch of lenses.  We gave my sister-
in-law the Nikkormat FT and the 45mm GN (guide number) Nikkor lens, which made flash photography 
very simple.  In the divorce, my wife got the Nikon F2 and a couple of lenses, I kept my FTN and a few 
more lenses.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC="argus.gif"></A>  My Grandfather's old Argus C3<P>
I also inherited my grandfather's old Argus C3 and flash, as well as his old Yashica Model C twin-lens 
reflex camera.  Since then I have added to the collection, first with a Minolta 110 Weathermatic.  That 
works so well that I also got the Minolta 110 SLR.  Both beat lugging the Nikon around for casual 
pictures.  I also have an old Kodak instant camera, as well as a Polaroid.  And now I even have an 8mm 
camcorder for a new dimension of weirdness.<P>
<HR>
<H3> Ceramics</H3>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="vase.gif"></A>  Giant Croissant, 24L x 15W x 8H, red clay<P>
I took five semesters of ceramics at Ventura College in the late '70s and early '80s.  I am not much good 
with a pottery wheel, but I excel at slab techniques.  I have made some fairly large, rather weird ceramic 
items.  Ceramics appears to be in my blood, and I am related to the Hutschenreuther porcelain company in 
Bavaria.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="bavaria.gif"></A>  My relatives<P>
I did some ceramic work while I was teaching at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, for relaxation.  And now I 
teach clay workshops at Mensa gatherings.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="tile.gif"></A>  Black Wrinkle Tile, 8 x 10, Danish white clay<P>
I even created a black-wrinkle finish by combining an engobe with a simple glaze.  This is not what I was 
expecting, but I was very happy with the results.  I was hoping for a matte black finish with gloss brown 
etching.<P>
<HR>
<H3> Miscellaneous Crafts</H3>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="plane.gif"></A>  Patrolled by Aircraft<P>
I did this model many years ago, back when you could get CHP camaro models.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="shirt.gif"></A>  One of my typical Western shirts<P>
I also took two semesters of sewing at Ventura College, and now own both a basic sewing machine and a 
serger.  I had taken it originally with the thought of doing trapunta,or soft sculpture.  I ended up making 
lots of shirts, including some weird Western shirts, and costumes.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Rice</TITLE>
<H1>Preparing Sushi Rice (<I>Shari or 
Sushi Meshi</I>).</H1>
Rice cooked for sushi should be slightly harder in texture than for other dishes.  You will need 
approximately one cup of cooked rice for each roll.  It is easier and better to make too much rice than too 
little.  Every recipe for sushi rice is different, but they all work.  You might find a recipe on the bottle of 
rice vinegar, on the bag of rice, or on the package of nori.<P>
Most recipes call for rinsing the raw rice until the water runs clear, but I often neglect this.  The reason it 
is rinsed first is to remove talc from the rice.  Most rice seems to be coated now with some sort of cereal 
starch, rather than talc, so rinsing could be omitted.  They also suggest letting the rinsed rice drain in a 
colander, or <I>zaru</I>,  for 30-60 minutes.  It's up to you.  <B>Just promise me one thing -- that you 
will not use instant rice, converted rice, or brown rice.</B>  The rice you use should be short-grained 
rice, preferably Cal-Rose.<P>
A fairly consistent recipe is to use equal amounts of rice and water, which will make the same number of 
cups of rice as the total of the rice and water.  Another book mentions adding water until it is one inch 
above the rice, but I would go with the one-to-one ratio.  The rice and water are brought to a quick boil, 
boiled for 1 minute, covered, simmered for 20 minutes, and let stand for 10 minutes after removing from 
the heat.  It is optional to add a piece of <I>kombu</I> to the water and rice while it is brought to a boil, 
then removed.  Another option is to add a few drops of sake or mirin to the water, but it will make little 
difference when the vinegar is added afterward.<P>
Put the hot rice in a large bowl and pour sushi vinegar evenly over the surface of the rice, mixing it into 
the rice with quick cutting strokes.  You should use one tablespoon of vinegar per cup of rice.  Fan the rice 
at the same time to cool the rice quickly.  What I often do is pour the vinegar into the pan and stir it in, 
then spread the rice out on aluminum foil on a cookie sheet to cool.  If you are keeping track of the 
terminology, a <I>hangiri, handai, or sushi oke</I> is a rice cooling tub, and a <I>uchiwa</I> is a rice 
cooling fan.<P>
If you cannot find sushi vinegar, you can make your own.  To make sushi vinegar, combine 1/3 cup white 
vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, and a dash of MSG (optional) in a small saucepan.  
Bring to a boil, stir to dissolve everything, and remove from heat.<P>

<br>
<b><h1><center>Arrival of a new Season!</b></h1></center>
</p>
<p>
<b>Several witnesses from the Northern Hemisphere have reported seeing 
BIG changes in the world around them.
<br>
These changes include trees growing new leaves; flowers blooming; green 
grass growing every where; an increase in the amount of birds and animals 
being born; the temperature rising; and most surprising of all, the days 
getting longer!
<br>
Scientists have come to the conslusion that the only possible reason for 
these drastic changes is that.....Spring is here!
<br>
Yes! That's right, Spring is here!
<br>
And to answer some of your questions about this new season we interviewed 
with Dr. Vernal, an expert on the changing of seasons.  Here is the 
interview:
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Earth Times: "Has Spring really arrived?"
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Dr. Vernal: "For people who live in the NOrthern Hemisphere, yes.  But 
for people who live in the Southern Hemisphere it is actually Autumn."
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Earth Times: "When did Spring arrive?"
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Dr. Vernal: Spring officially arrives on the spring Equinox, which is on 
March 22 this year."
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Earth Times: "What is an 'Equinox'?"
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Dr. Vernal: "The Equinox is the day on which the sun is exactly over the 
Equator, and day and night are therefore of equal length."
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Earth Times: "Can we expect to see another Equinox this year?"
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Dr. Vernal: "Yes, most certainly!  You can expect to see the Autumnal 
Equinox on September 22."
<br>
<img src="rd_sdi.gif">
Earth Times: "Thank you for answering our questions Dr. Vernal"

<TITLE>Sushi -- Hand Rolls</TITLE>
<H1>Hand Rolls.</H1>
A half of a nori is used for the hand roll.  Place a tablespoon of rice on the side of the nori, spread evenly.  
Fill with cucumber, asparagus, cooked shrimp, crab, fresh tuna, smoked salmon, cooked eel, or whatever 
your heart desires.  Then roll the nori into a cone by folding over the bottom corner and rolling.  You will 
have to paste the cone together with some wasabi or crushed rice grains.  Hand rolls also often contain 
some sushi mayonnaise.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Hand-Made</TITLE>
<H1>Hand-Made Sushi (<I>Nigiri-
Zushi</I>).</H1>
This is the classic sushi.  Take about two tablespoons of prepared rice in your hand and shape into an 
oblong about 2 inches by 1 inch.  Fillets of fish should just droop over the sides of the rice.  Put a dab of 
wasabi on the top of the rice, and then the slice of fish.  A butterflied cooked shrimp is especially popular, 
as is raw tuna.  I have seen vegetables such as cucumber on rice like this, wrapped with a thin strip of 
nori, but seafood is the most common.  Giant clam, conch, abalone, squid and octopus are also good this 
way, but the octopus can be quite chewy.<P>
Eel is heated first, then placed on the rice.  A narrow strip of nori is wrapped around rice and eel.  Then 
<I>tare</I> sauce is dabbed onto the top and it is sprinkled with sesame seeds.  The eel must be cooked, 
but not canned, it must be fairly firm like smoked fish.  Actually, any smoked fish would be delicious in 
this manner.  I have had trouble finding tare sauce, which might be described as thickened light soy sauce.  
It is neither too salty nor too sweet.<P>

<TITLE> The Eyes Have It</TITLE>
<H1>The Eyes Have It, Or Do They?</H1><P>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
I got my first pair of glasses when I was in the third grade.  The teacher noticed that I was having 
trouble seeing the blackboard, even though I was sitting near the front row.  Now it seems more 
unnatural when I am <B><I>not</I></B> wearing them.  And I am so near-sighted that I cannot 
see very much without them.<P>
The irony is that people say I have good eyes.  When I played golf I hit a lot of balls out into the 
rough.  I seldom lost any, and I often found a few extras.  Good eyes, they say.  Terrible swing, 
but good eyes.<P>
When I visit my parents, I usually end up helping my father sort stamps for his collection.  I am 
especially good at finding the stamp in question in the catalog, so he can accurately determine its 
value.  I am equally good at picking out the distinguishing marks that determine if a stamp is 
worth a penny or a dollar.  I have good eyes, he says.  But I do sort stamps better at night.<P>
Mornings are another story.  I remember a cold dark autumn morning when I was a freshman at 
Michigan Tech.  I was stumbling off to an 8:00 a.m. class and noticed someone standing in the 
grass next to the sidewalk.  It was a ways off and I was thinking of whether or not I could or 
should say good morning.  As I drew next to the person, I realized it was a tall fire hydrant.  
Good eyes, but not until sufficient quantities of coffee had been consumed.<P>
I also remember another morning when I was married and living in a house on Silverstrand Beach.  
I was the first one up and was staggering down to the bathroom.  I saw our black cat sitting on 
the floor by the heater and bent over to pet him.  It was a purse.  Good eyes, after I wake up.<P>
In Aspen one evening, we were all soaking in a very warm swimming pool after a hard day of 
skiing.  Someone asked about a women's restroom and I told her it was the door on the right.  
Since it was some distance away, and I was not wearing my glasses, she asked how I could tell.  
Simple.  "Women" is longer than "men".  I merely directed her to the door with the longer blur.  
Good thinking, and that was before I joined Mensa.<P>
One night many years ago I stopped at a hair stylist to get my hair cut.  (I had more hair then.)  I 
was directed to a chair in its own little booth.  The stylist latched the door and took my glasses.  
She then proceeded to do the entire job standing in <B><I>front</I></B> of me.  And she was 
wearing a low-cut blouse with no bra.  I finally had to tell her to either stand behind me or give 
me back my glasses.  My eyes may be good, but they aren't <B><I>that</I></B> good.  If that 
happened today, I could accuse <B><I>her</I></B> of sexual harassment.<P>

<TITLE>Mensans Will Eat Anything</TITLE>
<H1>Mensans Will Eat Anything</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Last year I attended the Orange County RG for my third time.  They have an annual event called 
"El Diablo Cantina," at which people can make sickening drinks and win Mensa bucks.  The rule 
is that the person who makes such a drink must also drink some of it.  Creator and coordinator 
John Olsen awards prizes in totally spontaneous categories.<P>
So when I did a workshop on "How to Roll Your Own Sushi" at last year's RG, it seemed like a 
good idea to work with John and do an "El Diablo Sushi Bar."  The winning entry was made by 
Ruth Ancona, costume maker of the Creative Mischief SIG, and contained sauerkraut, fresh 
peach slices, and fruit jelly.  It wasn't bad.  A bit sweet perhaps, possibly in need of more 
sauerkraut.  I made Spam sushi rolls, then learned a few months later that Japanese Americans 
actually do this too.  I even had one, gift of a coworker's mother, and it tasted much better than 
the ones I made.  Life really does imitate art.<P>
I was not sure if I wanted to repeat this event, but several people convinced me I needed to do it 
again this year.  I got really brave this year and bought a jar of gefilte fish for the event.  I had not 
been able to buy it last year, because it seemed too disgusting.  It still does.  Gefilte fish does not 
belong in a clear glass jar, it belongs in a water-filled porcelain bowl.  I have had better cat food.  
Even peanut butter and chocolate syrup will not make it taste reasonable.  God knows I tried.<P>
Ruth won again this year, using homemade plum leather instead of nori for a roll containing 
pickled okra and peanut butter, topped with tiny black caviar.  It was positively awful, especially 
the okra.  Valerie Spear was another winner, with a steak tartare roll.  Yes, she used raw beef 
mixed with onion soup mix, topped with A-1 steak sauce and sliced jalepeno peppers.  I like steak 
tartare, but this was not the same.  I was sweating so profusely that the horns of my El Diablo 
costume fell off.<P>
This year was like last year in that people kept eating the entries.  The judge had to grab quickly, 
and try to save a second piece for the award ceremony later.  People are hungry at midnight, and 
they were actually requesting rolls.  Sardines and peanut butter.  Deviled ham and baby food.  
And they were gratefully eating them!  It looks like I have to do this next year too.<P>
There were other rolls made with okra, all equally awful.  Coming from Michigan, I never had to 
eat that stuff.  In a period of 46 minutes, I ate more okra than I had eaten in my 46 years.  And 
now I am doomed.  You may have read the story that made the rounds of local newsletters about 
the man who hated broccoli.  One night his local group threw him a surprise party and served him 
all sorts of treats made from it -- cookies, ice cream, God knows what else.  I have a strange 
premonition that one night I am going to be presented with more okra than I can possibly 
imagine.  If I don't eat it, others will, because Mensans will eat anything.<P>

<TITLE>How To Do Maps</TITLE>
<H1>How To Do Maps</H1>
<H3>by Mark S. Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
A number of home pages are offering both a map and a menu to link to other parts of the home page or to 
other appropriate pages.  If you decide that you want to do a map, here is how to do it.  Please note that 
this is how we do maps at RAIN.  This is slightly different than how they do a map at <A HREF = 
"http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>.  The best advice I can give you is to look for other maps on 
other pages on your Web server.  See how they did it, then do yours similarly.  If you are the first to do a 
map on your server, here is how to do it.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Step 1</H2>
Do your menu first.  If a person accesses your home page with a text browser with no graphics capability, 
they will not be able to use your nifty map.  They will have to use your menu instead.  Also, if you do your 
menu first, you will know how many entities you will need to have on your map.  An entity is some 
uniquely identified area on your map.  It may be a word, a picture, or merely an area.  Although the entity 
can be something other than a rectangle, I will limit my discussion to rectangles.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Step 2</H2>
Create the graphic for your map.  There are lots of options here.  There may be an appropriate graphic you 
can scan in and use, like a picture of your family.  Clicking on a family member might bring up a page for 
that person.  Or, you can create a graphic with a paint program, like Paintbrush.  For example:<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="ltrs.gif"></A>

The GIF of the whole map is 185 by 108 pixels or pels (x,y).  The upper left corner of the map is 0,0.  
This map actually has nine areas within it -- the eight rectangles defined by the eight letters such as:<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="ltr_b.gif"></A>

The GIF of the letter B is 38 by 40 pixels or pels (x, y).  If the user clicks on the retangle defined by the 
letter B, the user is hyperlinked to a page that deals with that letter.  Each letter is assigned a unique URL 
in the Map File (see below).  Also, the rectangle for each letter is determined relative to the upper left 
corner, hence the area for the letter B might actually be 45,5 83,45.  (The upper left corner of B is 45,5 
relative to the whole map, which is 0,0.  To this you add the 38 and 40.)<P>
The ninth area is the area outside of the eight letters, that is, the rest of the rectangle.  If the user clicks on 
this area, he or she is sent to a default page, usually the current page.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Step 3</H2>
Create the map file.  At RAIN, we are using a newer version of HTTPD, one that does not require that 
your map file either be in the "cgi-bin" subdirectory of the "httpd" subdirectory, or listed in a 
configuration file in that subdirectory.  At RAIN, our map file is actually located in our "public_html" 
subdirectory of our home directory.<P>
A map file should have a "default" line for the aforementioned extra area of the map, and a "rect" line for 
each other entity on the map.  The line preceding the "rect" line is a comment line that is ignored by the 
IMAGEMAP program, but useful to the map maker.  This is what a map file on RAIN looks like:<P>
<Pre>
default http://www.rain.org/~hutch/
#they clicked on Drive
rect /~hutch/cars.html 30,190 120,288
#they clicked on Garage
rect /~hutch/skiing.html 1,60 100,170
#they clicked on Kitchen
rect /~hutch/sushi.html 100,40 220,60
etc.
</Pre>
The syntax for each "rect" line is:<P>
Shape, in this case a rectangle<BR>
URL of the page to link to<BR>
Upper left and lower right coordinate of the rectangle in pixels<P>
<HR>
<H2>Step 4</H2>
Add the map and reference to your home page.  This is actually the easy part.  The reference has four 
elements, the URL of the "imagemap" program in the "cgi-bin" subdirectory, an argument for the 
"imagemap" program of your map file and its path, the image reference of the map GIF file, and the 
inclusion in the image reference of the notation ISMAP.  For example, my map reference looks like 
this:<P>
<Pre>
&lt A HREF = "http://www.rain.org/cgi-
bin/imagemap/~hutch/my_menu.map"&gt <BR>
&lt IMG SRC = "home_map.gif" ALT = "my_menu" ISMAP&gt  &lt /A&gt 
</Pre>
Note that the argument of "/~hutch/my_menu.map" has no space between it and the program 
"imagemap."  Note also that "/~hutch/" is Web shorthand (and Unix shorthand as well) for 
"/usr/users/hutch/public_html."<P>
<HR>
That's all there is to a map.  I hope your system is set up like RAIN, which makes maps so easy.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- California Roll</TITLE>
<H1>The Basic California Roll.</H1>
If you are going to introduce someone to sushi, this is the way to do it.  A California roll contains crab 
meat, avocado, and cucumber.<P>
Spread about a cup of rice on the sheet of nori, leaving about an inch of uncovered nori at one side.  Do 
not pack the rice, rolling will take care of that.  The rice should be less than a 1/4 inch thick -- you should 
be able to see nori through the rice.  The biggest mistake is using too much rice.<P>
Put avocado slices on top of the rice first, one slice thick, near the edge of the rice, the edge opposite the 
uncovered nori.  Unwrap and split a piece of imitation crab meat lengthwise into two pieces.  Place the 
two pieces end to end on top of the avocado.  Then add several strips of cucumber next to the crab and on 
top of the avocado.  (If you put the avocado on last, it is a lot messier to roll.)<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="ca_roll.gif"></A><P>
I prefer to place the nori on a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the bamboo mat, to keep the avocado and rice 
out of the mat.  Slowly fold the mat over, tucking the end of the nori to start a roll.  (Keep lifting up the 
mat and plastic wrap as you go.)  Lessen the pressure slightly to straighten out the roll, if needed.  Then 
continue rolling with medium pressure.<P>
Remove roll from mat and cut into 6 or 8 even pieces.  <B>Important Tip:  Keep the knife very moist 
to prevent sticking, remoistening before each cut.</B>  First cut the roll in half, then fold the two 
halves together and cut into thirds (6 pieces) or quarters (8 pieces).  Sushi bars usually serve the roll sliced 
into 6 pieces, but 8 is easier.  Turn the pieces on end and arrange on platter.<P>
<B>Tip:  Sometimes, if the end pieces are quite uneven, the ends are cut off at the one-third point 
and stood on end.  Then, the other section is cut in half at a slight angle.  All pieces will then look 
more alike when stood on end.</B><P>
Some sushi bars make an "inside out" California roll.  The rice is spread over all of the roll, there is no 
uncovered edge as above.  Then the nori is turned over onto the plastic wrap so it is rice-side down.  The 
ingredients are placed on one edge and the roll is rolled as before.  After rolling, the roll is rolled in 
toasted sesame seeds prior to cutting, or sesame seeds can be sprinkled on top after cutting.  Optionally, 
flying fish roe can be used in place of the sesame seeds (it actually tastes better, but sesame seeds are 
easier to find).<P>

<TITLE>Laugh and Learn</TITLE>
<IMG ALT="Laugh and Learn"SRC ="laugh.gif"></A><P>
Something different in the way of talks, seminars and workshops for clubs, associations, and businesses.<P>
Is your group taking itself a bit too seriously? Have you gone through the entire list at the local speaker's bureau? 
Then maybe it's time to try something completely different.<P>
Laugh and Learn is not merely a one-man speaker's bureau. It is the creative repertoire of a talented, intelligent, 
multi-faceted, fun-loving individual.<P>
Included are creative workshops, informative and interactive talks,and serious seminars.<P>
<H2>Informative and Interactive Talks</H2>
Everyone has a story to tell, but they are seldom given the opportunity to tell it. An interactive talk gives people the 
opportunity to tell their story, to laugh at themselves and others, and to take life a little less seriously for the 
moment. Topics include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Cat Tales, an opportunity to share pet stories
<LI>Mr. Science, an opportunity to tell science jokes and stories
<LI>Computer Nerds Anonymous, an opportunity to tell computer stories and jokes
<LI>Obsessive/Compulsive Revelations, an opportunity to laugh about the harmless things we do (but not make 
fun of those who suffer from OCD)
<LI>Blonde Confessions, an opportunity to tell about the dumb things we do each day (where blonde is an attitude, 
not a hair color).
</UL>
Priority is given to the telling of true personal anecdotes, and a certificate "suitable for framing" is given to 
everyone who participates.<P>
<H2>Serious and Informative Seminars</H2>
Sometimes you just need to find a new and different topic for a meeting or seminar. Laugh and Learn offers talks 
in several areas:<P>
<H4>Club Management and Operation</H4>
<UL>
<LI>How to Start a Club
<LI>Creating an Interesting Newsletter
<LI>Maslow and Creativity in the Context of a Club
</UL>
<H4>Personal Topics</H4>
<UL>
<LI>My Life as a Surrealist
<LI>My Life as an Erotic Artist
</UL>
<H4>Music</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Yardbirds and Their Descendants
<LI>Blues Tunes and Their Covers
<LI>The Road to Crosby, Stills and Nash
</UL>
<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Successful Single
<LI>Weird ElectroMechanics
<LI>Creative Mischief
</UL>
New topics are constantly being created and added to the list.<P>
<H2>Creative Workshops</H2>
Sometimes we need an opportunity to sit down and work with our hands and minds.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Nothing reduces stress so much as working with a lump of clay, and the Clay Workshop allows this.
<LI>For a more creative time, the Wine Bottle Painting Workshop is a chance to create a personal work of art.
<LI>In the Rock Painting Workshop, natural oxide washes are used to create cave art.
<LI>In the Chocolate Painting Workshop edible works of art are created.
<LI>You can learn and eat when you attend a workshop on Rolling Your Own Sushi.
<LI>To combine humor, creativity, and team-building skills, there is the Mr. Potatohead video workshop, where 
the participants craft a script and props and then film a short feature using children's Mr. Potatohead figures, or 
other fruits and vegetables.

<TITLE>Sushi - Terms</TITLE>
<H1>Some Important Terms</H1>
People should associate <I>sushi</I> with the sushi bar or shop, which plays a role in Japan curiously 
similar to that of the Pub in England.  In this relaxed and informal atmosphere, patrons sit at tables or 
booths enjoying their food and beverage.  True aficionados sit at the actual sushi bar on a stool, selecting 
his delicacy from the refrigerated display in front of him and watching the master prepare his 
selection.<P>
Unfortunately, many people associate sushi with raw seafood.  In the first place, not all seafood is served 
raw, and in the second place, raw seafood is more properly called <I>sashimi</I>.  Sashimi is slices or 
slabs of raw seafood, such as tuna and octopus, served on a platter with thinly sliced ginger, finely 
shredded radish, and wasabi (Japanese horse radish mustard).<P>
Sushi types are many, but all include rice.  The <I>nigiri</I> or hand-made sushi is the typical sushi and 
is ordered and served in pairs.  Another type includes sushi rolls, or <I>maki</I>, which are made with 
sheets of seaweed (<I>nori</I>) and served as six slices.  There is also pressed sushi or <I>oshi</I>, 
which is cut into small squares.  And finally, there is stuffed bean curd rolls, or <I>inarizushi</I>.<P>

<H2>Ralph DAYTON</H2>
Born probably in County Kent, England, circa 1588, died in East Hampton, Long Island, NY, between 25 
Jul and 22 Sep 1658.<P>
<H4>Same sources as Robert de DEIGHTON.</H4>
Ralph and his two young sons, Samuel and Robert, possibly with his brothers Thomas and Nicholas, were 
the first of the name ot land on these shores, arriving in Boston in 1636.  Ralph was a widower at the 
time, his wife Agnes, daughter of Henry POOL, having died in London a few years before.  One authority 
thinks that Ralph had lived in Bedfordshire a few years previously to his departure for America.<P>
Some confusion arises in the family records at this point.  One chronicler of the Dayton family says that a 
Ralph DAYTON (it is spelled first DRAYTON and later DAYTON in the record), of Ashford, County 
Kent, accompanied by two sons, Samuel and Robert, and a daughter Alice, journeyed to America at about 
the same time as the above-mentioned Ralph of London.  This Ralph of Kent was the husband of Alice 
TRITTON, a widow, and in addition to Samuel, Robert, and Alice, he had issue by her of a son Ralph and 
a daughter Ellen.  Neither Ralph's wife, Alice, nor his daughter, Ellen is mentioned as making the voyage 
to America, and it is stated that the eldest son, Ralph, remained in England.  That this Ralph of Kent was 
identical with Ralph of London seems likely for only one Ralph DEIGHTON or DAYTON appears 
hereafter in the records.<P>
In 1639 this Ralph moved with his sons, Robert and Samuel, to New Haven, Connecticut.  Ralph is lkisted 
as a signer of the Fundamental Agreement and Covenant of Habitancy, the original governing instrument 
of this town.<P>

Disfrutar de la obra filmica Julio y su Angel, es apoyar el nuevo cine  Mexicano con profundo contenido humano y para toda la familia, esta pelicula se exhibe en el Wallace Town Center Mall de Santa Maria. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.he.net/~jfranks/page7.gif" ALIGN=left><dd>Se esta dejando sentir el espiritu navide&ntilde;o, que con una motivacion comercial los negocios locales promueven, mediante el arreglo de sus aparadores, la colocacion de ofertas al lado de figuras y simbologia invernal navide&ntilde;a, la figura de Santa Claus se deja ver por doquier, y desde luego en las aceras se puede observar gente  caminando, que viste con motivos navide&ntilde;os. <p><dd>La sociedad Estadounidense siente en esta epoca, deseos irrefrenables de gastar su dinero, por el hostigamiento que reciben de los medios de comunicacion, y hacen esto parte de las celebraciones. Esto en voz de los expertos, contribuye al desarrollo de tension, lo que conocemos como  Stress, por la prisa con la que se realizan estas compras, y el impacto que representan para la economia domestica, ya que dejan tambaleando los bolsillos, esto, aumenta nuestra ansia, y provoca tension, que se manifiesta con dolores de cabeza, de brazos, respiracion agitada, incluso estos sintomas de stress, se pueden llegar a confundir con un ataque al corazon, pero no porque ahora lo sabemos debemos descartar la posibilidad de un mal cardiaco. Lo recomendable es revisarse con nuestro medico, y no sufrir las consecuencias del Stress. Algo que debemos hacer es prevenir estas innecesarias inconveniencias de salud, producto de los habitos que se han desarrollado en el consumismo de la temporada. No se deje llevar por la publicidad, obsequie una tarjeta a las personas que estime conveniente, en donde escriba lo que siente por ellos y plasme en ella buenos deseos para la persona que la reciba.  <P><dd>Algo que se disfruta mucho, es el encuentro con los nuestros, los amigos, la convivencia en reuniones, y la reflexion individual de lo realizado, el recordar los gratos momentos del a&ntilde;o, compartiendo estas remembranzas con quienes nos encontremos para desearnos felicidad y paz.<P><dd>Paz es una palabra magica que invita a estar en armonia con nuestro interior, y con lo que nos rodea, toda esa acumulacion de momentos desagradables del a&ntilde;o, tiene en esta epoca una magnifica oportunidad de quedar fuera de nuestras vidas, en una evaluacion que nos muestre despues de un profundo autoanalisis, lo negativo de esos momentos tensos que a partir de su identificacion, debemos hacer el esfuerzo de dejarlos a un lado, y estimularnos con lo grato y lo logrado. La fuerza de la vida se vigoriza con la voluntad de ver al final de cada a&ntilde;o, los propositos del a&ntilde;o entrante, que lo unico que requieren es de la voluntad humana para realizarse.<P><dd>Esta epoca cuide su gasto! Como decia una conocida campa&ntilde;a publicitaria anticonsumista, <u>REGALE AFECTO.

<b>April 14, 1996 - We got our Weather Station kit for the HomeSchool
group taking part in the Nasa sponsored 5 day North America Weather 
Monitoring project.  Part of the HST education programs - (Hubble 
Telescope) - that will produce cloud cover and other weather maps for
a special World Wide Web site and TV program - using the input of around
42 schools/homeschools around the US.  Each school reports at the same 
time each day for 5 days.  Nasa will produce updated cloud cover and 
weather maps at the end of each 24 hour reporting period.
</p>
<p>
<img src="gr_pin.gif">
<b>The Weather Station (cost: $13.00) has:<br>
Dry Bulb Thermometer - to measure the air tempeature in the Fahrenheit scale.
<br>
Wet Bulb Thermometer - to measure the relative humidity.
<br>
Rain Gauge Tube - to measure the rainfall.
<br>
Wind Speed Tube - to measure wind speed up to 50mph.
<br>
Compass - lets you know from what direction the wind is blowing.
<br>
Wind Chill Chart - to look up the wind chill factor based on the air 
temperature and wind speed measurements.
</p>
<p>
<img src="gr_pin.gif">
It makes a great setup.  And email has begun to come onto the listserv
setup by Nasa.  Got mail today from Poland, all around the US.  We'll 
post some of the best in the Journal during the week.
</p>
<p>
<b>That's the report for the night before the project begins.  We make
our report to Nasa at 10am each morning.  We'll send email to the Natural 
History Museum to see what we can find out about Chumash weather making 
and we'll try to check in with the Airport and the Condor to see some 
hi-tech weather equipment.

<html><TITLE> Why Socks Disappear</TITLE>
<H1>Why Socks Disappear</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Socks disappear.  It's a fact of life.  Men lose socks, women lose socks.  Women lose 
men's socks, men lose women's socks.  Do statisticians know whether or not right socks 
really do disappear more often than left?  The pragmatic punster would be quick to note 
that the remaining sock is <I>always</I> left.<P>
Well, I don't know <I>where</I> socks go when they disappear, but I think I may have 
figured out <I>why</I> they disappear.  It is because they are trapped in a life of sin and 
depravity, devoid of morals.  Yes, each time socks are washed and sorted, they end up 
with a new temporary mate.  Some live a life of total depravity, unsorted and unmated, 
thrown together in a drawer until they are matched and mated by their master.  Then, after 
they have been worn, they are thrown into a second den of depravity, the hamper.<P>
Well, it's obvious that given such a life, they burn out and escape.  So much for open 
marriages and mate swapping.  How could this work for people, it won't even work with 
socks.  Luckily, there is hope, and an alternative to this life of depravity.<P>
Yes, I'm talking about sock rings, those little toothed rings of plastic that keep matched 
socks together for life.  Men seem more inclined to become ordained as Lords of the 
Rings, but many women also choose this life path.  Socks that have been matched, mated, 
and married in the eyes of their Lord and master never stray from their wedded bliss.  Of 
course it is up to their Lord to put their ring back on after use.<P>
Pantyhose have made the rings somewhat obsolete for women.  You can't lose one leg of 
a "pair" of pantyhose, the waistband serves much like the plastic ring.  There is still a need 
to match their tennis and knee-high socks, so there is the potential women's need for these 
rings.  There isn't too much need for these rings with sexy decorated nylons, since it is 
unlikely the woman would own two similar pairs.  And if the woman is into BandD, she 
can keep her nylons matched by keeping them attached to the requisite garter belt.  
(Ow!)<P>
Ordination as a Lord of the Rings is a closed-end sort of deal, you can only marry a 
limited number of socks.  Now, I have to advise you that this ordination is normally done 
through the mail, and there are those that will chafe at the thought of becoming a mail-
order minister.  But, it can be done for only $1.99, plus shipping and handling, and tax 
were applicable.  You get a dozen rings, so you can marry 12 pairs of socks.  And you can 
create your own ceremony.<P>
Is it legal and moral to marry two male socks or two female socks?  Well, probably not on 
those terms.  If you think instead of two <I>men's</I> socks or two <I>women's</I> 
socks, the same-gender issue is less of an issue.  Yes, I know that's really reaching, but this 
whole concept is a stretch of a perverse imagination.<P>
Some will note that they can become ordained at drugstores.  Well, this is true, drugstores 
carry these rings.  But drugstores are not for Lords of the Rings.  Drugstores are for 
<I>cowboys</I>.<P>

<TITLE>Hints and Tips</TITLE>
<H1>Hints and Tips</H1>
The number one hint or tip is this: rolling sushi is a self-correcting process. If your first roll does not turn 
out quite right, eat it to hide the evidence and roll another, which will be much better. If it has been a 
while since you made a roll, the first one may leave something to be desired, but it will all come back to 
you, like riding a bicycle or playing a piano (if you knew how to do those activities in the first place).<P>
Rice doesn't stick to nori, or roll does not stick together when rolled. You most likely did not use enough 
vinegar in your rice. The rice should be very sticky, annoyingly so.<P>
Roll is too thick, or does not hold together well. You probably used too much rice, or packed it down too 
tightly. The rice should be spread on the nori to within about 5/8-inch of what will be the outer edge, 
should not be squished onto the nori, and should not cover the nori completely. You should be able to see 
nori between the rice kernals, perhaps 1/4 to 1/3 of the space should be open to the nori below the 
rice.<P>
Cucumber can be cut into larger chunks which are easier to work with. Try quartering the cuke 
lengthwise, removing the seeds, then cutting the flesh into a few large pieces about 1/4-inch thick by 3/8-
inch wide. The length of the pieces should be half the width of the nori.<P>
The thick-skinned black avocadoes are easier to work with. Cut in half and remove the pit. Then cut each 
half into half again. Using a paring knife, slice the avocado in the peel, then run the knife just under the 
peel to cut the slices from the peel. It is easier and faster than peeling the avocado and then slicing it.<P>
Place a square of plastic wrap on between the nori and the bamboo mat when making rolls. This will keep 
the rice and messy ingredients out of the mat and make it last longer. (Washing a bamboo mat is NOT 
recommended, it warps when it dries.) Peel the plastic wrap back with the mat as you roll. When you are 
finished, wrap the roll in the plastic wrap and put the roll in the refrigerator. When you are finished 
making several rolls and are ready to serve them, unwrap them and slice them.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Other Rolls</TITLE>
<H1>Other Roll Sushi.</H1>
A cucumber roll contains just that.  Likewise, a tuna roll or <I>tekkamaki</I> contains only tuna (raw).  
These rolls are made similar to the California roll above.  The tuna should be cut into long pieces about 
3/8 inch square in cross-section, and placed end to end.  The cucumber is sliced into thin "squarish" 
strips, as for the California roll, and enough are placed on the rice to make the equivalent of a 3/8 wide 
and high pile of them (called <I>kappamaki</I>.)<P>
A Campbell roll contains salmon, asparagus, and mayonnaise.  Use the smallest asparagus spears you can 
find, or cut larger ones into smaller strips like the cucumber.  Cut the salmon into long strips about 1/2-
inch wide by 1/8-inch thick.  The packages of smoked salmon you see in the deli sections of supermarkets 
is perfect for this.  Spread some sushi mayonnaise along the edge of the roll.  Place the salmon on top of 
this, and the asparagus on top of the salmon, and use an amount approximately equal to the salmon.  
Sushi mayonnaise is hard to find, but any rich mayonnaise can be used in its place.<P>
A Virginia roll contains crab, eel, mushrooms and seasoned shredded cod fish (pink powder.)  Virginians 
prefer to use real crab meat, but imitation will work just fine.  At the starting edge of the rice, sprinkle 
some pink powder.  Add the crab and eel, like the California roll above, with the eel replacing the 
avocado.  Mushrooms are then placed like the cucumber is above.<P>
Lately I have been finding Portobello mushroom slices in the produce section of supermarkets.  I cut off 
and discard (or eat) the stem section, saute in a little butter, then make them into a mushroom roll.<P>
A couple of years ago I joked about making a Spam roll.  I actually did this as a joke at a meeting I was at, 
and was shocked at how salty the Spam tasted.  When I learned that one of my co-workers was going to 
lunch for Spam rolls one day with her Japanese mother, I was treated with one of her mother's rolls.  It 
was not as salty, but I do not know what was done to prepare the Spam, it seemed broiled or fried.  I did 
not realize that the Japanese actually enjoy Spam rolls, but now I do.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Foodstuffs</TITLE>
<H1>Foodstuffs Needed and Where to get 
it.</H1>
You will need rice, which I will describe in greater detail in the next topic.  You will also need the 
following items, some of which are optional:<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>nori</I>, toasted seaweed sheets, available even at Von's and other supermarkets now<P>
<LI><I>wasabi</I>, Japanese horseradish mustard, comes in cans of powder, just add water<P>
<LI><I>gari or shoga</I>, sliced ginger, a condiment used to reset the taste buds<P>
<LI>shredded <I>daikon</I> radish, optional<P>
<LI><I>su or awaze-zu</I>, sushi vinegar, see Rice section below<P>
<LI>imitation crab sticks, for California rolls, pieces will also work if you can't find the sticks<P>
<LI><I>kappa</I>, cucumber -- I usually use the European cucumbers since they are longer and there is 
less waste<P>
<LI>avocado -- make sure they are ripe, the dark-skinned variety is easier to peel<P>
<LI><I>sakura denbu</I>, seasoned shredded cod fish (pink powder)<P>
<LI><I>hari hari zuke</I>, pickled vegetable mix (yellow)<P>
<LI><I>ao shiso no mi</I>, prepared beefsteak plant seeds (green)<P>
<LI><I>shiso sakura</I>, pickled radish and ginger with beefsteak plant (pink)<P>
<LI><I>kampyo</I>, seasoned Japanese gourd (dark yellow)<P>
<LI><I>nametake chazuke</I>, prepared mushrooms<P>
<LI><I>shoyu</I>, soy sauce, mixed with the wasabi for dipping the sushi, low-salt is available now<P>
</UL>
I usually get my things at the local Hughes Market or Ralph's here in Oxnard, California.  Any Japanese 
or Asian market will have all of this, and a whole lot more.  The crab, cucumbers and avocados are 
available at most markets.<P>

<TITLE>Rolling Your Own Sushi</TITLE>
<H2><H1>Rolling Your Own Sushi</H1></H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Updated 2 December 1996, added some new pages, noted recent fame and glory, changed my address and phone number, and linked books to Amazon Books.  Coming soon -- more photos of my sushi rolls.  See Change Record at end of page.<P>
You are the 80497th person to visit this page (since I added this counter).<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="sushi.gif"></A>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="sushi2.gif"></A><P>
<H4>The content of this page is suitable for children of all ages. However, the procedures that involve cooking rice or omelets, slicing ingredients and rolls with sharp knives, and so on, should only be done with close adult supervision. To resurrect and paraphrase a cliche, the family that rolls sushi together stays together.</H4><P>

<H3>Little Did I Know...</H3>
I originally created this material as a handout for a workshop that I gave at a Mensa regional gathering in San 
Diego.  After I got access to the World Wide Web, I decided to convert my handout into a web page.  That was in 
December of 1994.  Then things started to happen:<P>
The March 1995 issue of <A HREF = "http://techweb.cmp.com/techweb/ng/current/">NetGuide magazine</A> 
featured an editorial review of my original page.  I was alerted to this by a fellow Mensan and lunatic, John Olsen 
aka <A HREF = "http://www.deltanet.com/users/automat/">Johnny Automatic</A>.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.zdnet.com/~zdpress/">Ziff-Davis Press</A> released <I>Atlas to the World Wide 
Web</I> on CD-ROM and in a CD-ROM/book package.  They requested credit information for my graphic of a 
California Roll, as an illustration in the book.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/">ALC Press Inc.</A> in Japan requested permission to use my page in 
their new English class for Japanese based on Internet and WWW resources.  They are the leading company in 
Japan teaching English to Japanese.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.pointcom.com/">Point Communications</A> noted that my page made the top 5% for 
the month, and requested permission to link to it.<P>
A chef Instructor at the Culinary Arts Academy of the <A HREF = "http://www.iup.edu/">University of Indiana in 
Pennsylvania</A> requested permission to use my page in his class on cooking.<P>
A senior at the <A HREF = "http://www.wm.edu/">College of William & Mary</A> contacted me for material for 
a research paper for her class in Japanese Society.<P>
Someone wondered how I got listed on the <A HREF = 
"http://w3.cortland.com/electrazine/japantour/default.html">Japan Infoweb</A> page.  Beats the heck out of 
me!<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.domini.org/kairos/question.htm">Kairos Multimedia</A>, "...a UK organisation 
operating within the not-for-profit sector and aims to help Churches/charities/educational bodies take advantage of 
Information Technology," requested permission to list my page in their CD-ROM for WWW newbies.<P>
A television network in Japan, NHK Satellite Broadcasting, requested permission to use my page in their program, 
<A HREF = "http://www.nhk.or.jp/tv-i">"TV-Internet"</A> over a period of several months.<P>
My page is listed in <A HREF = "http://www.vol.it/UK/EN/HOBBY/CUCINA/">"In the Kitchen" pages, "Recipes 
from around the world"   "Japan"</A>, in Italy.<P>
It airs on <A HREF = "http://www.nhk.or.jp/tv-i/">"TV-Internet"</A> every Sunday for 20 minutes from 12:10 AM to 12:30 AM through March 1997, Japanese time.<P>
It will be included in a book published by Diamond, Inc. that includes internet white pages of celebrities.<P>
It was listed in issue #18 of "Internet" a magazine published in the UK.<P>
The page is linked from <A HREF = "http://www.splash.com/wsdocs/vs4.htm">"Splash Kids"</A>.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.osborne.com/int/int7.htm">"The Internet Kids Yellow Pages"</A> includes the page.<P>
The page was reviewed in the "Watching the Web" feature in the July 25, 1996 issue of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>.<P>
The page is included in the book and CD-ROM called "Internet Smart Start Guide" published by <A HREF = "http://www.gihyo.co.jp/syoseki/promo/smart/index.html">"Gijutsu Hyoron Co., Ltd.,"</A> of Japan.<P>
I got a review in the "after 5" feature in the October 1996 <I>The Institute</I> of the <A HREF = "http://www.ieee.org/">"IEEE"</A>.<P>
I have been selected as a safe site for children at the <A HREF = "http://www.bonus.com/">"Bonus Network"</A>.<P>
Who knows what is next!<P>
Andy Warhol would not be able to explain all this with his quote about all of us getting our 15 minutes of fame.  
He would have to come up with something else.  I think Garrett Morris of the old Saturday Night Live cast would 
be better able to explain it through his Puerto Rican baseball player character, who might have said, "World Wide 
Web been berry berry good to me."<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> I choose not to link my page to every individual or business who has linked to this page because I feel it adds unnecessary clutter to the page. If this offends you and causes you NOT to link to this page, my apologies, but that is my policy.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Pressed</TITLE>
<H1>Pressed Sushi (<I>Oshi-
Zushi</I>).</H1>
Prepare a batch of sushi rice, based on three cups of rice.  This will be enough to fill a cake tin with a 
removeable side, an excellent substitute for the wooden box, or <I>oshi waku</I>.  We will also need 
three dried mushrooms soaked in warm water until soft, half a small cucumber, a small carrot, 3 slices of 
roast ham, and 6 prawns and omelet.  After soaking, slice the mushrooms into narrow lengths, cut the 
carrot into matchlike sticks 1-1/2 inches long, and cut the cucumber first into diagonal slices, then cut the 
slices into narrow strips.  In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the water used to soak the mushrooms, 2 
tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 tablespoons wine, and a pinch of MSG.  Add the mushroom 
and carrot and simmer for 5 minutes until well-flavored.  Drain and cool.<P>
<DL>
<DD>
Prepare the <A HREF = "omelet.html">omelet</A>.<P>
Cook, clean, devein and cool the prawns.  Cut lengthwise into halves.<P>
</DL>
Oil the cake tin and pack with sushi rice about half way.  Squeeze any excess moisture from the 
mushrooms if needed.  Top with a layer of mushrooms, carrots, and cucumbers.  Put the remaining rice on 
top of the vegetables and press down evenly.  Spread some wasabi over the rice.  Arrange the prawns, ham 
and omelet on top, remembering that it will be cut into squares.  Cover with plastic wrap and weigh it 
down with another pan for 15 minutes.  Remove from pan and cut into pieces.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Thick Roll</TITLE>
<H1>Thick Rolled Sushi (Futo-
Maki).</H1>
This roll is about 2 inches thick, hence the name <I>futo-maki</I>, or fat roll.  The other sushi rolls 
could be called <I>hoso-maki</I> or thin rolls by comparison.  This roll contains six to eight ingredients, 
most often six, and often the same six.  These always include <I>kampyo</I> gourd, <I>oboro or 
denbu</I> pink powder, <I>tamago</I> omelet, and <I>shiitake</I> mushrooms.  Other ingredients 
can include bamboo shoots, cucumbers, cooked eel, cooked carrots, and cooked spinach or other 
greens.<P>
The nori sheets are cut in half and then quarters, so that a quarter sheet can be pasted onto the end of the 
half sheet to make a sheet half as wide as normal, and 1-1/2 times as long.  The seam should be under the 
ingredients, and the sheets are pasted together with crushed rice grains.  The roll is cut thinner into five 
slices.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Equipment</TITLE>
<H1>Equipment Needed</H1>
One of the advantages of sushi is the lack of equipment needed.  First and foremost, you will need a very 
sharp knife.  The classic sushi knife is called a <I>bento</I> knife, but any sharp knife will do.  It is 
made of razor-sharp carbon steel with a <I>Ho</I> wood handle that does not get slippery when wet.  I 
got my large knife years ago through the mail from Williams Sonoma.  My smaller bento knife is from 
Joyce Chen.  I got it at an international marketplace sort of store in the mall at Tyson's Corner.  (I used to 
have another mailorder source, but it appears to have folded.  Will add new sources as I learn of them, and 
would appreciate knowing of any you may find.)<P>
<UL>
<LI>Mike Bergman (augment@world.std.com) has suggested The Japan Woodworker as a source of 
knives.
</UL>
The second most important tool you will need is a bamboo mat or hot pad, called a <I>sushimaki 
sudare</I> or a <I>makisu</I>.  This is used to roll the sushi.  A wooden spoon can be used to spread 
the rice onto the nori, or you can get a wooden or plastic rice paddle, or <I>shamoji</I>.  (You can also 
use your hands, like a sushi chef, but the rice is very sticky.)  These can be found almost anywhere, but I 
get mine from Hughes Markets.  Anything else is completely optional.<P>
Sushi masters always seem to use a pair of metal chopsticks to pick things up with.  I searched all over for 
a set, and finally found them in a Japanese department store at the end of Ala Moana Plaza in Honolulu.  
And they really are useful, but you can use your fingers or regular chopsticks as well.  At the same store, I 
also got a wooden sushi press, called an <I>oshiwaku</I>, to make oshi.  A number of things would 
work just fine, including a hamburger press.<P>

<TITLE>Basic Rules</TITLE>
<H1>Basic Rules</H1>
<OL>
<LI>No personal attacks.  And be very careful about using specific names, some people do not have a sense of 
humor.  Be sure no one gets hurt.
<LI>Post signs only where permitted.  Use masking tape whenever possible, so as not to damage whatever it is you 
are hanging it on.
<LI>Put a disclaimer on the bottom.  People actually believe these things.
<LI>Check the spelling and grammar.  Mensans are cruel editors.
<LI>Be generic whenever possible.  Generic jokes are recyclable.
<LI>Sacred Cows make great targets of creative mischief.
<LI>Events such as the Treasure Hunt are sacred events, not sacred cows.  DO NOT, under any circumstances 
mess with these events.  You run the risk of ruining an event for someone else, and that really violates Rule 
Number 1.

<TITLE> Coins</TITLE>
<H1> Coins I Collect</H1>
Updated 30 June 1996. Added links and Note at end, preparing to add more coins.<P>
I have been collecting coins since I was a child.  My uncle worked for the city of Saginaw, MI, as a meter 
attendant.  As he emptied the parking meters and sorted the coins, he would sort out rarer pennies he 
would find.  He also gave me some of his Indian-head cents.  Another uncle gave me all the money he had 
when he returned from WWII.  Most of it was English change, but there was some other interesting stuff 
as well.  In the '80s I started collecting coins in earnest, often bullion.<P>
This page is under construction, please be patient.  And yes, I will 
enlarge some of these pictures.<P>

I have managed to put together a 12-piece type set of U.S. gold, just recently adding the $3.00 coin and the Type II $1.00.  I also have a 4-piece type set of 1907 Liberty series gold coins.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="cagold.gif"></A>  California gold type set<P>
I recently had a chance to pick up a three-piece set of California gold.  The coins are a the $1.00, the half 
dollar, and a quarter dollar.  Hard to imagine a gold quarter.  There were only 10,000 pieces made, and 
that includes all 500 or so varieties.<P>
<HR>
<H3> Silver Coins and Bullion</H3>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="silver.gif"></A>  Silver dollars<P>
I also like silver.  I got the 8 reales (pieces of eight) because of the significance of the year.  These were 
once legal tender in the U.S.  I also wanted a trade dollar, and may try to complete a year set of those.  I 
do have a complete set of all 1878 Morgan silver dollars, including the 7-, 8- and 7/8-tail feather 
varieties.  It appears I need to get one more coin in this series, since I am not sure which reverse I have on my 7 tail feather coin.  I also have a complete set of silver Eagles, and continue to add to this collection.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="silbul.gif"></A>  Silver bullion<P>
I should have included the silver Eagles here too, since it is also silver bullion.  I have a complete set of 
silver Cats from the Isle of Man, partly because I am a cat lover.  I also have a complete set of Canadian 
Maple Leaves (Leafs?), and Australian Kookaburras.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="wwf.gif"></A>  WWF bullion set<P>
Another interesting bullion set is the World Wildlife Federation Endangered Species set.  I am in the process of completing another WWF set, one from the Franklin Mint.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="pillar.gif"></A> Pillar Dollar commemorative set<P>
A few years ago the Mexico City Mint was cleaning house and found the original dies of the 1732 pillar 
dollars.  In honor of the find, they minted 1000 of these proof sets of pillar dollars.  The 12-ounce (troy 
pound!) example is especially impressive.<P>
<HR>
<H3> Ancient Coins</H3>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="roman.gif"></A>  Ancient Roman coins<P>
Another thing I have done recently is buy uncleaned unsorted ancient coins.  Some of them are very hard 
to identify, but many are in very fine condition, like these.  Ancient coins are often in excellent
condition, in spite of having been buried for years.  Like squirrels and their nuts, ancients buried 
their coins (there were no banks), then forgot about them or died/were killed.  These coins are from a 
hoard found in an Eastern European country.  Clockwise from top left are:<P>
<DL>
<DD>
Silvered antoninianus of Probus (A.D. 276-282), apparently Sear #3371.<P>
Bronze follis of Maximinus II (A.D. 309-313), Sear #3766 obverse, #3758 reverse<P>
Bronze antoninianus of Claudius II Gothicus (A.D. 268-270, undetermined<P>
Bronze Rome Commemorative (A.D. 330-346), Sear #3894, obverse and reverse shown<P>

<HR>
<H3> Silver Medallions</H3>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="litho.gif"><A>  Israel State Art medals<P>
This is an unusual set of three silver medals with a color painting 
lithographed on one side of each medal.  They are 26mm diameter, and only 
500 sets were made.<P> 
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="dali.gif"></A>  The Dali Olympics

This is a set of silver medallions the Salvador Dali did for the 1988 Olympics.<P>
<A HREF = "astro.gif">Nude Zodiac -- R-rated</A> Please do not view if easily offended!<P>

<TITLE>Oscar Hutschenreuther</TITLE>
<H1>My Great Grandfather, Oscar 
HUTSCHENREUTHER</H1>
My great great grandfather was Karl HUTSCHENREUTHER. He was the second husband of my 
GGGM Katinka ALBRECHT, daughter of ALBRECHT von der Dann, a court priest in Coburg 
and a free thinker who apparently got in trouble with the ruler. (Dann means a village around a 
castle). She had first married KAUFMAN, who was also from a wealthy chinaware manufacturing 
family, as was Karl. KAUFMAN died at 27; together they had two children -- Ida, who died 
young, and Ludwig, who was a soldier of fortune who served as an officer in the Civil War and 
eventually died at sea.<P>
Karl and Katinka had three children -- Barbara, Oscar, and Caroline. On 4 June 1866, the ship 
Hermann arrived in New York from Bremen. Aboard were Oscar, age 14, Catharine (Katinka) 
age 45, Caroline, age 17, and Babette (Barbara), age 8. Also aboard was Josef WERNER, age 25, 
who would apparently become Katinka's third husband. They arrived in America with 
considerable wealth, which was allegedly lost through WERNER. Karl died at the age of 48, 
however I do not know when or where that was, nor when he was born.<P>
Oscar was born 5 July 1851 in Schney near Lichtenfelz in Bavaria. After coming to America, they 
initially settled in Detroit, then moved to Bay City, MI. Oscar sailed on the lakes for about five 
years, worked in sawmills, plaster mills, a brewery, and finally had a business in Salzburg for four 
years, moving it to the West Side (of Bay City) for 28 years. Oscar married Elizabeth 
RAUSCHERT on 30 June 1874. They had four children -- Anna (5 Oct 1878 - 14 May 1933), 
George (23 Aug 1881 - 7 Jan 1928), Emil (26 Apr 1887 - Apr 1976), and Louis (7 May 1889 - ?)  
They may have had two additional children, Heinrich ALBRECHT (20 Aug 1876 - ?) and 
Ferdinand Karl (16 Sep 1880 - ?). Elizabeth was born 27 Apr 1856 in Three Oaks, MI, and died 
10 Jun 1926 in Bay City. Oscar died in Bay City 1 May 1933.<P>
Emil married Lulu May DAYTON 16 Sep 1915. She was born 11 Jul 1889, probably in Paw Paw, 
MI, and died March 1977 in Hudson, OH. Anna married Darcy DAYTON, Lula's brother, and 
died in childbirth. (That inspired Darcy to become a doctor, and remarry, eventually settling in 
Tacoma, WA.) Emil studied naval architecture at the University of Michigan, then homesteaded in 
Montana when his health faltered. Emil and Lula had three children -- John, Charles (my father), 
and Frances.<P>
I can trace the DAYTON line back to 1305, but until recently I encountered a dead end with the 
HUTSCHENREUTHER line. Then I found an interesting group of names during a trip to the 
Family History Center in San Diego a couple of years ago. Carolina Charlotta HORN was 
christened 13 April 1783 in Jerusalem, Berlin Stadt, Brandenburg, Preussen. She appears as the 
mother of several children, whose fathers include Wilhelm HUTSCHENREUTHER, Johann 
Wilhelm HUTCHENREITER, and Johann Heinrich HUTSCHENREUTER. Among the children 
is a Carl Wilhelm HUTSCHENREUTHER, christened 1 January 1819, Drei Faltigkeit, Berlin 
Stadt, Brandenburg, Preussen. I suspect this could be the father or grandfather of Karl. Emil's 
middle name is Wilhelm, and one of his children was named Caroline.<P>
It is interesting that I have found other HUTSCHENREUTHERs, HUTZENREUTHERs, and 
HUTSCHENREIDER/HUTSCHENREITERs in Prussia. REITER or REUTER means "rider, or 
horseman" in old German, and apparently HUTSCHEN is a small stool. The name may very well 
be Prussian, and may have something to do with cavalry. What is weird is that this validates our 
pronunciation of "hut-chin-writer," although the true German would be "hoot-chen-roy-ter."<P>
Hutschenreut(h)er is like Tischenreuther and Kotschenreuther, wherein "reuth = rt, which means 
a clearing. This explains many of the place names near Selb. Another story I have heard is that the 
name means "little house in a clearing." Furthermore, reuten means to root out or to clear for 
cultivation.<P>
I suspect that pure coincidence is at play here. I believe the name originated in Prussia, where 
"reuter" meant "rider." At some point, the family, or part of the family, moved south to become 
china manufacturers. It may be that it just happened that in that part of the German empire, 
"reuter" meant "clearing" and the name evolved from Hutschenreuter to Hutschenreuther.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Other Styles</TITLE>
<H1>Other Sushi Styles.</H1>
<I>Saikuzushi</I>, or festival sushi is an art form.  Rice is tinted different colors, sectioned off and 
rolled.  When it is sliced, complex images are created.<P>
<I>Chirashizushi</I>, or scattered sushi, is rice spread in a box or bowl with nine kinds of fish and 
vegetables scattered on top or mixed in with the rice.<P>
<I>Chakinzushi</I> is sushi rice in a thin omelet wrapper shaped and tied like a lady's drawstring purse.  
Sometimes a single pea or small shrimp decorates the ruffled part of the wrapper.<P>
<I>Makezushi</I> is sushi rice, mixed with vegetables and seafood that has been molded into bowls or 
square tins and covered with strips of omelet, shrimp and vegetables.  <I>Fukusazushi</I> is a variation 
of this, where the square-molded rice mixture is wrapped in a thin sheet of omelet.  This is turned over to 
conceal the seams and garnished with a nori ribbon and ginger.<P>
<I>Temarizushi</I> are rice balls tightly wrapped in thinnly-sliced marinated fish.<P>

<b>Welcome to the Parents' section of the <a 
href="http://www.rain.org/knn596.html">Kids News Net</a>, a monthly 
publication by the Youth of the RAIN Network.
<br>
As we experience the dramatic impact of Internet technology on our kids, 
with schools, public libraries and our homes becoming Internet Learning 
Centers, we, the parents, need to have a firm understanding and 
familiarity with the Internet as a learning tool and as a home management 
resource.
</p>
<p>
Each month the RAIN Network's KIDS NEWS NET will be accompanied by an 
issue of the Parents' Guide to the Internet.  Look for news from Parents 
who are using the Internet to help their children with homework and to 
expand the sharing and learning that goes on within the Family by making 
that important leap from the family that watches TV to the family that 
reads, learns and plays together on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
Special friends will be adding articles and resources to the Parents' 
Guide to the Internet.  We'll have educators, business people and 
community leaders online and in print to expand what you can gain from 
your CAMP INTERNET access.
</p>
<p>
Look for the publicatiions web site at <a 
href="http://www.rain.org">http://www.rain.org</a> where you'll find the 
print copy and a whole lot more every month.
</p>
<p>
The entire family can take part in Camp Internet for as little as $75 a 
year.  Everything from Email to field trips and daily access to the very 
special online teachers make your family's Internet experience very 
different than just logging on.  Socially Responsible, focused on 
Families - RAIN is your best choice for Internet access -

<TITLE>Sushi -- Stuffed</TITLE>
<H1>Stuffed Fried Bean Curd Bags 
(<I>Inarizushi</I>).</H1>
The package should have directions on it.  If it doesn't, try this.  Prepare the fried bean curd by pouring 
boiling water over them to remove excess oil.  A package is assumed to contain 10 sheets of the 
<I>aburage</I>.  Cut into halves and pull open the center of the pieces, making bags.  (Yes, this is like 
preparing pita bread.)  In a saucepan, combine 2/3 cup <I>dashi</I> broth, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 
tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon <I>sake</I>, and  teaspoon MSG.  Bring to a boil and simmer the bean 
curd bags for 10 to 15 minutes until the liquid is almost absorbed.  Remove from heat, drain and cool.  
Press out remaining liquid with a clean cloth.<P>
Add 2 teaspoons of heated sesame seeds to the sushi rice, and/or add small pieces of mushroom, carrot, 
dried gourd or other vegetables cooked in the same liquid as the bean curd.  Fill the bags with the rice 
mixture and roll the top of the bean curd over the rice to enclose it.<P>

<H2>Answers and advice for active and successful

<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther (under a lame alias)</H3>
Last month I took by bottle of wine to a club event and someone else drank it. What can I do?<P>
Thirsty in Arroyo Grande<P>
<I>Apparently some people just don't understand that BYOB means Bring Your Own Beverage, and that the 
beverages people bring are their own unless they offer a drink to you. Write your name on the label with a thick 
marking pen, on a plastic cup placed over the bottle, or on the paper bag the bottle is in. If you catch someone 
drinking from your bottle, don't make a scene, discuss it with them discretely and politely.</I><P>

I got a love letter in the mail from one of the men in the club. I never give out my address, and now I'm scared he 
might be stalking me.<P>
Sleepless in Oceano<P>
<I>I understand your concern. You have to remember that many of the people in your club are suddenly single 
and middle-aged. They have forgotten how to date, or ask for a date. Rather than calling the police, I would 
suggest writing an open (and equally anonymous) letter to the editor of your club newsletter for 
publication.</I><P>

The club calendar has lots of events on it, but none of the stuff I like to do. I end up going to movies and concerts 
by myself, or watching HBO and rented videos with my dog.<P>
Home Alone in Halcyon<P>
<I>I have two ideas for you. The best idea is to go to the club board meeting and get an event of your liking onto 
the calendar. You don't necessarily need to know which movie or band is playing that night, you just need a time 
and place to meet. The other idea is to write up a short ad for the club newsletter, one listing your name and 
phone number and what nights of the month you like to go to the movies or dancing.  Good luck!</I><P>

The last time I hosted an event in my home, I was up half the night and spent all next day cleaning up the mess. 
Where did everyone go?<P>
Grumbling in Grover<P>
<I>I hope you continue to host events in your home, in spite of the fact that some people can be quite messy, and 
accidents will happen. Rules help, but you have to post them prominently and clearly, like "No food without a 
plate." As far as cleanup goes, a signup sheet may work, but I prefer to use my own charms on some of the people 
at the event. If you ask them in just the right way, they can hardly wait until the end of the party to help you. (And 
no, you don't have to change into some slinky negligee at the appointed hour, although that will work.)</I><P>
How can I get people to leave my home at a reasonable hour when I host an event? The men in particular seem to 
just hang around forever.<P>
Still Up in Nipomo<P>
<I>First of all, be sure your event has a clearly defined and advertised start and END time. If you are a woman, I 
also recommend that you ask a man in the club if he will stay with you until the end of the event, not so much to 
clean up as to ensure that people actually leave. It should be someone on the board, or someone you already 
know, and if it is someone who interests you, well, Suzi doesn't get into that sort of thing, if you know what I 
mean.</I><P>

Only certain people in our club get a list of members and their phone numbers. That doesn't seem fair.<P>
Miffed in Santa Maria<P>
<I>Usually phone lists are for phone committee members and officers. Trust me, you really don't want any Joe 
Blow to be able to get his hands on a phone list, and certainly not any listing with addresses on it. (Just ask 
Sleepless in Oceano.) If you see someone interesting at an event, you have to make the effort to talk to them and 
get their name and number. That's the mixer part of a club event. If you failed to do this, then call an officer and 
get the name and number that way. They might even tell that special someone that you are interested in them, and 
that will have an effect. Oh, and if you volunteer for a position on the board, you may be entitled to one of those 
lists.</I><P>

I want to go to one of the club events but I don't know what to wear. Among other things I  have my Sunday-go-to-
meetin' suit and a Grateful Dead tie-dye T-shirt, any suggestions?<P>
Naked in Nipomo<P>
<I>Put on a robe, your curtains are open!  Seriously, most of the club events are informal, but not quite casual. A 
suit is a bit much, but T-shirts are not enough. A sport shirt or blouse and slacks are the norm, but no polyester 
unless you are going to Retro Night at the Graduate. Save the Rolex and jewels for Vegas, and that plaid for the 
golf course. Remember that you live on the Central Coast, and feel free to wear what you wear to work, unless you 
are a pig farmer or an investment  banker. Most successful singles are interested in your personality, not your 
wardrobe.</I><P>
<B>Next Month:</B> Less contrived questions from real people in the club. Some questions this month are based 
on real people and events, and we apologize if we have embarassed you in any way. Suzi is not necessarily one 
specific person.<P>

<TITLE> How To Drink Brandy</TITLE><P>
<H1>How To Drink Brandy</H1><P>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
I got turned on to brandy many years ago, when I was traveling a lot to Minneapolis.  Actually, 
for around a year and a half I was spending one week out of each month up there.  When we went 
out to eat dinner, we often ended up at one of several Greek restaurants.<P>
I fell in love with Greek food, and ended up with a collection of three outstanding Greek 
cookbooks.  My first was one recommended by a business associate named Toupusis, or 
something like that.  He was Greek and knew all the good restaurants there.  That book is really 
the best one, and the one I would recommend.  It is, <U>The Complete 
Greek Cookbook</U>, by 
Theresa Karas Yianilos, published by Avenel Books in MCMLXX.<P>
One of these days, when I have the time it takes, I will make stuffed grape leaves or Dolmathes.  
It will have to be in the Spring, when ground lamb is more readily available.  Ground beef just 
doesn't make it, and I would probably be extradited and shot if I tried to use ground turkey!  I do 
use grape leaves from a jar, but their distinctive flavor adds to the dish.  And the real challenge is 
getting the damned things out of the jar.<P>
Getting back to Minneapolis, after a fine dinner of Dolmathes or Moussaka we would usually 
discuss the day's efforts over a snifter of fine Greek brandy.  This was usually Metaxa 5-star, 
although we occasionally had their 7-star.  To say that Greek brandy is unique is a gross 
understatement.  Some will say that Metaxa tastes awful, but they are the ones who haven't 
developed a taste for Greek wines like Retsina either.  Metaxa is strong and distinctive, to say the 
least.<P>
Brandy service in a restaurant is minimalist at best.  To the amusement of the staff, we made use 
of the candle at the table to heat the brandy in our snifters.  Sometimes they would honor our 
request for a second candle so we didn't have to share.<P>
This led to a Christmas list one year that included a brandy set.  And Santa obliged, as she usually 
did.  (Santa is really a woman, but you knew that.  Especially those of you living in Santa Maria 
or Santa Barbara.)  I found fuel for it and actually used it a couple of times.  Some of the 
aforementioned detractors might suggest that the Metaxa itself should have been used as the 
fuel.<P>
Then, one year I discovered the ultimate brandy set -- my hot tub.  No messy fuel.  No tricky 
flames.  I did find that a brandy snifter with a heavy base and taller sides works best.  It has 
something to do with the center of buoyancy and center of gravity if you are technically inclined.  
I'm sure there is a name for the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity, 
but it escapes me.  Whatever it's called it needs to be positive and maximum.  And as the tall sides 
imply, you need a good freeboard as well.<P>
And this must be savored in solitude or with an intimate minimum of guests.  In other words, you 
need to minimize the sea state in the hot tub.  You don't want to accidentally dilute the brandy 
with green water over the bow, and you don't want to lose any brandy overboard either.  Nor do 
you want to have a fatal collision at sea, because snifters <B>are</B> made of glass.<P>
Try it sometime.  Even if your brandy isn't Metaxa.  And even if your hot tub is really a bath 
tub.<P>

<H2>Robert de DEIGHTON</H2>
<H4>From "The Name and Family of Dayton" from Nancy Dayton's records.</H4>
This information appears to be from the book "Genealogical Story (Dayton and Tomlinson) told by Laura Dayton 
Fessenden, 1902, Crist, Scott & Parshall Publishers, Coopertown, NY.<P>
The surname DAYTON is perhaps a weak form of DALTON or more probably a variation of DEIGHTON. The 
form DALTON is derived from the word "dale", probably referring to the farm or habitation of the earliest English 
forbears of the American family of DAYTON. The name DEIGHTON is derived from the Danish and originally 
meant the dike enclosure of the farm by the dike. Variations of this latter form are DAITON, DATON, 
DAIGHTON, DAYGHTON, and DIGHTON.  In early American records, DRAYTON was sometimes used 
interchangeably with DAYTON.<P>
It is recorded that a family, variously noted as DEIGHTON, DYGHTON, and DEYSON, as early as the thirteenth 
century resided in the vicinity of the hamlet of Deighton, in the parish of Deighton, in the east riding of Yorkshire. 
This hamlet is about four and a half miles south south east from the present city of York.<P>
The early DEIGHTONs appear to have been for generations tenants of a farm on the Manor of Deighton. The 
Abbott of St. Mary's of York is named as the lord of the manor. The family at that time was of the yeomanry, but 
the family annals reveal a steady rise in both social and economic position.<P>
The first individual recorded in the family history is one Robert de DEIGHTON, who was admitted a freeman in 
1305 and was a Yeoman. In 1300 a Yeoman implied a gentleman of small estate who beside being a freeholder, 
was an officer in the Militia of his section of the country, hence the expression "an officer of the guard." This 
Robert, by an unknown wife, was the father of four sons, Robert, William, Nicholas, and John.<P>
(2) Robert de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1329. His occupation is given as "pistor." Sir 
Edmund Sandus says "A pistor is one who maketh small fire arms or little pistols." The sons of 
Robert were John, Walter, Galpudis, and William.<P>
(3) John de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1349. His occupation is set down as "Tailler" 
which "was not a fashhioner of garments" but "a collector of tolls or taxes." John had William and 
Robert.<P>
(4) Robert de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1372. He was a saucemaker and had two sons 
Willard and John.<P>
(5) John de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1389. He was by occupation a Marshal, 
Shakespeare says that a "Marshal, was an officer standing highest in arms," Dryden "the officer 
who regulates combats in the lists," Spencer "an officer who regulates rank and order at a feast." 
John married Isabel a daugther of John de Duffield, a silk merchant of York. The sons of John 
were Golen, William, and John.<P>
(6) William de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1419. He was a wine merchant and he married 
Joan de Morton of York. She was a daughter of Robert de Morton a merchant. Joan had a 
brother Thomas de Morton, who was the "Residentiary of York." In his will this reverend 
gentleman left to his nephew William de Deighton, son of his sister Joan, two separate legacies. 
William de Deighton (6) died 14 Sep 1456 and was buried beside his wife Joan, "on the south side 
of York Minister." Drake's history of York shows that William died a rich man. He had one son 
William.<P>
(7) William de Deighton was a brewer. He was admitted a freeman in 1452. He had John.<P>
(8) John de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1481. He had Henry.<P>
(9) Henry de Deighton was admitted a freeman in 1504. By occupation, he was a "dyer." In 1522, 
he was made City Chamberlain of York. This was the officer to whom all the city revenues were 
paid. He was elected Sheriff 1524-5, Alderman 1525-1551. The position of Alderman at that time, 
was to all intents and purposes (says Bacon) "that of a senitor or governor." Henry de Deighton 
was made Lord Mayor of York in 1531. He was twice married and we are descended from the 
son of the second wife Alice, who at the time of her marriage to Henry was the widow of Robert 
Petty, an Alderman. Henry died in September 1540, and in his will he directed that "he should be 
buried, in All Saints, on North State Street." He had Robert.<P>
(10) Robert Deighton was the first of his line to drop the Norman de and become Deighton. He 
was born in 1525, was made a freeman in 1557. In 1550 he married Elizabeth Copeleyand, a 
daughter of John Copeleyand, and Margaret Copeleyand his wife, who was a daughter of Sir John 
S. Stapleton, of Wighill, York. Robert Deighton had William.<P>
(11) William Deighton was born in York in 1551. He seems to have been the first one in this line 
to leave the home of his ancestors. Perhaps he was not pleased with his mother's second marriage, 
for shortly after Robert Deighton's eath, his widow married Sir Francis Ayscrough. At all events 
William left York, and went to London, settling in St. Martin's in the Fields. He married on 9 Aug 
1584, Agnes a daughter of Ralph Green and Johannah Reed, his wife. William had four sons

<TITLE>Maslow and Mensa</TITLE>
<H3><H1>Maslow and Mensa</H1></H3>
<H4>by Mark S. Hutchenreuther</H4>
<HR>
<H2>The Premise</H2>
Around March of 1994, Janice Johnson asked me if I would give a talk for her Local Officer Training 
sessions at the New England Annual Gathering.  Because of my frequent creative involvement in Mensa, 
she suggested a topic of "How to Bring Out the Creativity in Your Members."  I immediately accepted, 
then set out to figure out what I would talk about.<P>
I had been working on another topic at the time, called "The Singles Curmudgeon."  In that talk, I briefly 
covered Maslow's hierarchy and my own "Hutch's Hierarchy of Relationships."  I quickly realized that 
much of my talk should be about Maslow and his famous hierarchy.<P>
Maslow's hierarchy is variously  described as having five, six, or seven layers.  Fortunately, the lower four 
layers and the top layer are common to all three schemes.  If a sixth layer is included, it is placed between 
Self-Esteem Needs and Self-Actualization Needs, and it is called Self-Fulfillment Needs.  In the seven 
layer scheme, Self-Fulfillment is divided into two layers, Cognitive Needs, and Aesthetic Needs.  I will 
discuss the five-layer hierarchy for a number of reasons:  it is simpler, it is sufficient, and it is what 
Maslow himself used in his last book.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Maslow's Hierarchy</H2>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="maslow5.gif"></A><P>
Maslow believed that an individual must substantially satisfy the needs at the lowest level before he or she 
could begin to satisfy the needs at the next higher level.  Only when the needs of all lower levels were 
satisfied could Self-Actualization Needs begin to be satisfied.  Self-actualization is the fulfillment of one's 
human potential, and is often the point at which an individual becomes truly creative.<P>
<HR>
<H2>The Context of Society</H2>
<H4>Physiological Needs</H4>
This includes food, water, and sex as procreation (but not sex as love).  Were Maslow alive today, I 
believe he would have added drugs to this layer, and more specifically, addiction.  Picture the homeless 
person standing on the corner with a sign that says, "Will work for food."  Or picture the criminal that 
will steal anything to support his drug habit.  These people are trapped at the lowest level, unable to fulfill 
their physiological needs.  Do they have feelings of self-esteem or belongingness?  Not likely.  On the 
other hand, they may appear creative in their means for satisfaction of these needs, but this is an 
aberration and is probably caused by extreme desperation.<P>
<H4>Security and Safety Needs</H4>
This is probably where the homeless problem belongs.  These people are unable to maintain a home and 
are forced to live in the wild, such as the local river bottoms.  They have no roof over their heads, no door 
they can lock.  They may keep all their possessions in a shopping cart, rolling it with them wherever they 
go.  Any problems with unemployment and poverty probably belong here as well.<P>
<H4>Belongingness Needs</H4>
This includes the need to be loved and the other part of sex as lovemaking.  Children of single parents, 
who are left alone or in the care of someone else while their parent works, fit in here.  They lack the 
family their friends and peers may have.  They feel unloved because their overworked parent does not 
have the time to devote to them.  Gangs and cults prey upon these people, as they do the people at the next 
level.<P>
<H4>Self-Esteem Needs</H4>
It has been said that today's youth lack self-esteem.  Schools and other institutions provide special training 
in self-esteem to counter this.  Gangs and cults prey upon these people, and participation in those groups 
can provide self-esteem for these people.<P>
<H4>Self Actualization Needs</H4>
Once a person has substantially satisfied the lower four levels of needs, he or she is able to perform or live 
at his or her full potential.  Now they can work on their curiosity and need to understand.  Now they can 
be creative.<P>
<HR>
<H2>What Does This Mean for Mensa?</H2>
First of all, I will assume that the Physiological and Security/Safety Needs of our members are sufficiently 
satisfied.  I will assume they have enough to eat, that they are healthy, and that they have a home and 
steady employment.<P>
However, the Belongingness and Self-Esteem Needs of our members and potential members may not be 
fully satisfied.  They may be truly gifted, or merely very intelligent.  They may have grown up feeling 
different, and perhaps even shunned for being different.  They may be considered eggheads, nerds, or 
worse.  They may not have a lot of friends, and may not be welcomed by their co-workers.  They are 
intelligent people trapped in a very stupid world.<P>
What if these people could find an organization of people like them?  An extended family?  A group of 
their peers?  An organization that values intelligence?  And more importantly, what if that organization 
could help satisfy their Belongingness Needs, and Self-Esteem Needs?  If they could join such an 
organization, they could then begin to satisfy their Self-Actualization Needs.<P>
Mensa is that organization.  I do not believe we have a traditional <B>product</B> to offer these people.  
I'm not even sure we provide a traditional or alternative <B>service</B>.  What we can provide them is 
an <B>opportunity</B>.  We can provide them an opportunity to satisfy their self-esteem, to feel loved, 
to feel like they belong.  We can provide them with an opportunity to become self-actualizing.  And I 
believe this is what we should be advertising and "selling" to our target audience.  We are sort of like an 
HMO for the mind, or an extended family.<P>
Some may become what I call our "reclusive participants," members we never see, but members who 
renew each year.  (I do not personally like the term "closet Mensan," this is my suggested replacement.)  
Perhaps the membership card and monthly newsletters are enough.  Having that card in their pocket 
shows that they belong to a group.  Once a month they get local and national newsletters that reinforce 
this, and in it they read about others who are just like them.  That's all it takes to satisfy them and let them 
know they are OK, and that they are not merely nerds, or worse.  Their $45 yearly dues are like a 
renewable insurance policy, or cheap therapy.<P>
Some may remain isolated Ms for whatever reason.  Some may participate in SIGs as members or 
coordinators, others may only attend the AG or RGs.  They may even contribute articles or artwork to 
various newsletters, but not attend local meetings.  And this may be enough, in their minds.<P>
At some point we hope they will want more, that they will want to become active participants.  They may 
have an initial fear of attending a local meeting.  In our newsletters we need to project a feeling of 
"Wilkommen."  We want to encourage them to come to our events, but we don't want to berate them for 
not doing so.  We need to appeal to their need to be self-actualizing, to be creative.  It's what Maslow 
would do.<P>

Actualization.</H4></center>
<HR>
<H2>Who He Was</H2>
Abraham Maslow was an American psychologist and leading exponent of humanistic psychology.  He is 
best known for his hierarchy of needs.  Born April 1, 1908, his IQ was once determined to be 195, the 
second highest at the time it was measured.  He died in 1970.  His books include:<P>
<I>Toward a Psychology of Being</I> (1962)<BR>
<I>Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences</I> (1964)<BR>
<I>Motivation and Personality, 3rd Ed.</I> (1970)<B> highly recommended</B><BR>

<H2>Position Desired</H2>
I am a recently-retired computer software engineer with ten years experience in software 
testing and programming and twenty-five years experience in technical writing and 
training. I am seeking employment in one of the following positions:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Programmer
<LI>Software Engineer
<LI>Software Tester
<LI>Technical Manual Writer
<LI>Technical Book Reviewer
<LI>Editor
<LI>Technical Support Representative
<LI>Technical Trainer or Instructor
<LI>Other similar positions requiring similar talents and experience.
</UL>
<H3>Personal Strengths</H3>
I work well with younger personnel, am a team player, and am extremely good at 
explaining complex procedures to people with a wide range of experience. I am equally at 
home in a casual or dressy professional environment.<P>
I am quite PC literate and have had a presence on the World Wide Web for 
over a year and a half. (My sushi page was reviewed in the March 1995 
<I>NetGuide</I> and the May 1996 <I>Yahoo!</I>, and has been 
incorporated in a number of books and programs worldwide.)
The Navy activity I was with for 25 years was 
much admired by the fleet as an effective 
engineering support activity. We proudly 
worked with great independence and a "can do" 
attitude, and I still operate in that manner.<P>
<H3>Operating Systems and Languages</H3>
During my last year with the Navy, I was the only person in our department using 
Windows NT as my operating system, although I am more familiar with Windows 3.X as a 
user and programmer. I am a member of the Microsoft Developers Network, however, I 
have not yet taken the plunge and installed Windows 95 on my home computers. I am also 
familiar with the UNIX, VAX/VMS, and MS-DOS operating systems, and can use a 
Mac.<P>
My last project with the Navy was the development of a missile launcher simulator 
running under Windows 3.1. It was written in C using version 1.5 of Microsoft Visual 
C/C++. Hardware controlled by the software included two 192-channel digital I/O boards, 
a digital-to-synchro converter board, and a synchro-to-digital converter board. While 
working on this project, I was also responsible for testing a contractor-developed training 
system that was the first Navy project to use Ada.<P>
Other programs I worked with were written in BASIC, FORTRAN, and PL/M-86.<P>

<H1> Astrology</H1>
Updated 30 June 1996 to revise links.<P>
Astrology is another interest.  I use the Windows version of AstrolDeluxe from Halloran Software to do 
charts.  My sun and moon are both in Pisces in the 11th house, which is intercepted in the Koch system 
(no Pisces cusp).  My ascendent is Taurus and I have three planets in Leo, which is called a stellium and 
acts as a second sun sign.  My Sun and Moon are in the 11th House, which rules the wide social circle of 
acquaintances and groups, and political aspirations.  My stellium is in the 5th House, which rules 
creativity, the arts, leisure, pleasure, and romance.  Check out my <A HREF = "chart.gif">chart</A>.<P>

<TITLE> Skiing Stuff</TITLE> 
<H1> I Love to Ski</H1> 
Updated 30 June 1996, but unable to test all links, since it is summer.<P> 
<IMG ALT="Hutch NASTAR racing"SRC ="skiing2.gif"></A><P> 
I like to ski and belong to the SLO Skiers. I also like to ski midweek in Wrightwood and Big Bear.  My parents taught me how to ski when I was 4 years old, back in Michigan. While I was a student at  
Michigan Tech, I became a ski patrolman on the school's Mont Ripley ski patrol, eventually becoming the Assistant Patrol Leader. I also served on the Holiday Hill (now Mountain High East) ski patrol in '70/71 when I moved to Southern California.<P> 
I have skied many times in Colorado, most often at Vail, but also at Aspen and Snowmass, A-Basin and Copper Mountain, and Winter Park a long time ago. I've also skied in New Mexico at Sierra Blanca, in Utah at the areas around Salt Lake City, in Oregon at Mt. Bachelor, in Idaho at Sun Valley, in Wyoming at Jackson Hole, and all around California, North and South. I have been on three European ski trips to Austria and Switzerland, and to Banff and surrounding areas in Canada.<P> 
I was President and also Editor of the Downhill Rumblers (Point Mugu Ski Club, now Gold Coast Ski Club) for a number of years. And I also was a member of the Santa Barbara Ski Club for a few years, serving for a while as their representative to the Los Angeles and the Central Councils of the Far West Ski Association. Someday I will find something to do for the SLO Skiers, perhaps initially a web page.<P>

Oh, I also have a set of grass skis and rollerblades. Either is a death wish.<P>
Waterskiing? I did some as a kid, and a bit on the Colorado River with the Pt. Mugu Ski Club.<P>
Snowboarding? Tried it once at Jackson Hole, and wore myself out rather quickly. I never was much good at skateboarding, and never did take up surfing, just bought the music.<P>

<TITLE>Sushi -- Omelet</TITLE>
<H1>Preparing Sushi Omelet 
(<I>Tamago</I>).</H1>
Thin egg sheets.  <I>Yield:  4-6 sheets.</I>  With chopsticks, beat 4 large eggs with 1 Tablespoon sugar 
(or more to taste) and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Pour through fine-holed strainer into glass measuring cup to 
remove any membrane.  Heat skillet and oil well. pour a small amount of the egg mixture (1/6 to 1/4 of 
the total) into the skillet and tilt pan to spread.  When the bottom has set, remove from heat and carefully 
lift up egg sheet taking care not to tear the sheet.  Turn over and return to heat and cook lightly for a few 
seconds until the second side is golden.  Carefully remove and drain.  Repeat.<P>
Thick egg sheets.  <I>Yield:  1 sheet.</I>  Use same recipe, but cook entire amount at once.  Cooking is 
similar.  The preferred pan is a 9-inch square tamago pan.<P>
Americanized medium thick egg sheet.  <I>Yield:  1 sheet.</I>  Beat two large eggs with 2 to 3 
teaspoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Pour into well-greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.  Bake in preheated 300 
F oven for 15 minutes.  Carefully flip egg sheet onto paper towel and drain.  (I would be tempted to cook 
all of these in a similar manner, possibly using a square baking pan.)<P>
<I>Tamago yaki.  Yield:  1 roll or sheet.</I>  Beat four large eggs, 4 Tablespoons <I>dashi</I> (stock, 
see below), 1 Tablespoon sugar (or more to taste), 1 teaspoon <I>mirin</I> (sweet rice wine), 1/2 
teaspoon soy sauce, and salt to taste.  Strain as before.  In a well-oiled tamago pan, pour in about a quarter 
of the mixture and spread as if making a crepe.  As the mixture cooks, and as it bubbles and sets, roll it 
and move to the back of the pan.  Reoil the pan and add more mixture, being sure to get some under the 
roll.  Again, as it cooks, roll the roll to the front of the pan, then move to the back.  Repeat until all the 
mixture is cooked.  Remove the roll from the pan and roll as if for a sushi roll and squeeze out excess 
liquid.  It can be rolled into a round or rectangular shape, then is sliced when cooled.<P>
<I>Dashi.</I>  A basic stock, usually made from dried bonito flakes and dried kelp.  You can use instant 
dashi, called <I>dashi-no-moto</I>, which is like a bouillon cube.  You can also substitute any other 
stock if you don't like the fishy taste.<P>

<TITLE>Creative Mischief</TITLE>
<H1>The Creative Mischief SIG</H1>
Updated 30 June 1996.<P>
You are the 9597th person to visit this page.<P>
<H2>Our Charter</H2>
The Creative Mischief SIG was founded on the premise that Mensa is taking itself far too seriously.  It was time we 
let down our hair and had some fun.  And so it is.  Our primary vehicle is hoaxes, which are posted as signs at 
Mensa gatherings and meetings.  Invariably, these note the cancellation or addition of some non-existent event, 
promulgate some whimsical warning, or offer some sort of silly service through a non-existent phone number.  All 
of our actual hoaxes carry a disclaimer in fine print at the bottom, since Mensans actually believe this stuff.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Our Leader</H2>
<IMG ALT="Hutch as the Energizer Bunny"SRC ="bunny.gif"></A><P>
Mark Hutchenreuther (Hutch) has been in Mensa since 1982.  They let him in based on his GRE scores.  He was 
Local Secretary (President) of the Channel Islands Mensa group of Sourthern California from 1991 through 1995.  
When he lost his bid for Regional Vice Chairman of Region 9, his last act as LocSec was to appoint himself to the 
open position of Editor of <I>Channel M</I>, the newsletter of Channel Islands Mensa.  He has also been appointed to the 
position of Mensa International Boutique Coordinator.<P>
He earned BSME from Michigan Tech in 1970, and an MSEE from CalState Northridge in 1985, and is actually 
licensed as a Mechical Engineer by the poor state of California.  He recently took an early retirement after working 
for 25 years for the Navy as a civilian, most recently as a Computer Software Engineer.  Mensa keeps him from 
going crazy, or so he claims.<P>

<H2>How I Did This</H2>
The documents were done with Word for Windows 6.0, then converted using the Ant converter.  I had hoped to use 
photos scanned by Seattle Film Works and converted to .GIF using their software, but it did not give me the 
resolution and color I wanted, so I ended up scanning them myself as Windows bitmap files and then converted 
them to .GIF files.<P>

<TITLE>Am I Really Gifted?</TITLE>
<H1>Gifted? Me?</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
(Editor, <I>Channel M</I>, former LocSec, Channel Islands Mensa.)<P>
I really enjoyed the December 1995 issue of <I>Bright Ideas</I>. One article wondered about 
what engineers do, another mentioned a take-apart party and pizza. Having recently retired from 
my first engineering career of 25 years, I can attest that engineering and take-apart party are 
related. My parents will confirm that one of the tell-tale signs that your child may become an 
engineer is a need to take things apart.<P>
I did that and still do, take a look around my house and garage. I actually changed brands of 
toothpaste because they appeared to have a different pump mechanism in their dispenser. Do you 
know how all those toothpaste pumps work? I do.<P>
As a practicing engineer, a very appropriate term by the way, I often had to take things apart and 
figure out what was wrong with them, and what broke. Maybe that's why I used to own Fiats 
(allegedly stands for "fix it again, Tony"), which I often took apart and figured out what was 
broken and why it broke.<P>
Heck, if you come to one of Channel Islands Mensa's third Friday TGIF. Pizza Nights, you will 
learn that take-apart and pizzas are related. I often get there early and order a vegetarian pizza for 
the group with all the vegetables (and mushrooms) on it. One of our members who usually shows 
up does not like green peppers, so she takes all those off her slices of pizza. Another member 
does not like some other vegetable, onions I think, so she takes all those off her slices of pizza. 
There you have it, take-apart pizza.<P>
But the real reason I am writing this is that I do not consider myself gifted. People are shocked 
when I mention this, but it is true. I never filled out one of those "Profiles in Giftedness" surveys, 
or whatever they were called, because I do not consider myself gifted. I got into Mensa and 
Intertel based on my Graduate Record Examination scores, with points to spare. Of course, I did 
take the GRE three times -- once while in undergraduate school when I was considering going 
directly to graduate school, once when I actually applied for graduate school several years after 
graduating from undergraduate school, and a third time because it took "too long" for me to 
complete my graduate studies. Each time the scores were higher than the previous time, and the 
percentile ranking was higher yet. I was apparently getting smarter (or better at taking the GRE) 
and the population at large was getting dumber. What a great combination!<P>
Yet, I just barely squeaked through graduate school, getting out with a 3.08 grade point average 
which was just above the absolute minimum requirement of 3.00. Undergraduate school?  Got out 
of there with a GPA of 2.61, although that was on a scale where 70% was passing, not 60%. High 
school?  Somewhere in the B's in what they called the "college prep" track, and within that I was 
taking mostly "level 3" classes, as opposed to the average "level 2" classes or the advanced "level 
4" classes. (I don't recall any of that was actually called, but you get the idea.)<P>
So people conclude that I am talented instead. Makes sense, I guess. My third grade teacher 
thought I was talented in the area of art and should be an artist. It's only a hobby of mine, but 
people are constantly asking to utilize my artistic talents. I'm not sure my former guitar teacher 
would label me at all talented, but music is different from art.<P>
Around here we have this program for kids called Gifted And Talented Education, or whatever it 
takes to make an acronym of GATE. But I can only acknowledge that I would fit into a Gifted Or 
Talented Education program, if I were a kid today (and many people feel I still AM a child). 
Somehow I don't think that is going to get very far. I can see how it would be neat to be in a 
GATE program, since gates are like doors, and we are always using doors in our lofty analogies 
like "the door to the future." Who would want to be in a GOTE program? Goats have evil 
connotations.<P>
The bottom line is that I will acknowledge that I am talented in some areas, but not that I am 
gifted. Would the other writers feel better being labeled talented rather than gifted? Should 
someone create a "Profiles in Talent" survey? Do we need to create a hierarchy of Talented 
Children's Coordinators? Will people be changing their silly question to, "If you're so talented, 
why aren't you famous?" I think the answers are "no," "please, no," "absolutely not," and "I doubt 
it." (The answer to the silly question itself is, "I don't know.")<P>
Those are my thoughts, but remember, I'm not gifted, merely talented.<P>
This was originally submitted to <I>Bright Ideas</I> for publication. I may print it in<I> Channel 
M</I> too, someday.<P>

<TITLE> Joys of Velcro</TITLE>
<H1>The Joys and Hazards of Velcro</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
I remember when I first discovered Velcro.  It seemed like the greatest thing to come along in 
years.  I got some and started using it for all sorts of things around the home.  I glued it to film 
cans to allow me to fasten them to my camera strap.  (Camera straps back then did not have 
elastic holders for the cans.)  I can't remember what else I did with it, but I tried all sorts of 
things.<P>
Eventually, tennis shoes came out with Velcro rather than laces, which worked so much better.  I 
had to have some then, and still wear shoes of that type.  Besides, our mother taught us some 
weird way to tie our shoe laces and this has plagued me all my life.  Velcro was my liberation!<P>
I even got a ski jacket that had Velcro cuffs to seal out the wind and snow, and Velcro epaulets 
on the shoulders.  The latter was designed to hold your goggles and other accessories when you 
were not wearing them, and this too seemed like the greatest idea since sliced bread.<P>
It seemed like each year brought more items onto the market that took advantage of Velcro.  
Then it happened.  Technology turned on me, and Velcro began to do bad things to me.<P>
My first run-in with Velcro occurred several years ago when I was on a business trip to Los 
Angeles in a rental car.  It was a Ford Thunderbird, or something like that, a free upgrade from 
the microbox I was originally authorized.  I was not used to the large heavy doors, so I planted 
my foot on the kick pad and kicked the  door open as I stepped from the car.  Unfortunately, the 
Velcro on my shoes caught on the carpeting on the kick pad, and my shoe was torn off of my 
foot.  I nearly fell out of the car into the parking lot.  Luckily, I was parked far away from the 
lobby and no one watched me standing there in my sock as I ripped the shoe from the door and 
got dressed.<P>
The second time was more painful.  I had bought a short-sleeved shirt that had Velcro on the 
pockets rather than buttons, and Velcro tabs inside the sleeve to tie the sleeves fully pulled up.  I 
seldom wore the sleeves that way, so I usually just disarmed the Velcro and wore the shirt 
normally.  One day, when I went to remove the shirt, I discovered that the badly matched Velcro 
strips had grabbed onto my underarm hair.  I discovered this when I felt the pain as I pulled my 
shirt off and let it fall down my back.  I almost ended up in a position with the shirt half on and 
half off, with my arms tied up behind me -- like a straight jacket.  Painful, very painful.<P>
The third and most recent case of man versus Velcro came at the San Francisco AG.  It was the 
final day and we were all saying goodbye.  I was wearing a lightweight outdoor shirt with Velcro 
patch pockets, which were open with the flaps flipped up or tucked in the pockets.  I was hugging 
Sherrie Reimers, who was wearing a Lycra-Spandex top that fit her very well.  As the hug came 
to an end, we realized that my Velcro had become stuck to her Lycra and we were firmly attached 
to each other.  It took a few minutes to very carefully pry ourselves apart so as not to  ruin her 
top.  Actually, I kind of enjoyed the cheap thrill of it all.<P>

<TITLE>Lecture Update</TITLE>
<H1>Lecture Update</H1>
(Updated 2 July 1996 to include latest changes and add note about the swimming pool, gym, and sauna. 
MSH)<P>
The MENSAS GOLDEN Booking Form promises other events as part of your registration package and 
many of you have been waiting to hear about them. Well now seems to be a good time to produce an up-
to-date list.<P>
The majority of items on this list is free to registered guests. Some of them are updates on previously 
advertised events, most are new. The only one requiring additional payment is the visit to CATS on 
Wednesday evening which is strictly subject to availability.<P>
<H5>Games</H5>
The Mensa International Games Tournament will run though the week with the initial rounds being 
played between Tuesday and Friday and the finals on Monday. The games to be played are Chess, 
Backgammon, Scrabble and Monopoly. The Games Officer can be reached though the Wolverhampton 
office.<P>
<H5>Dinners</H5>
Each evening there will be groups going to local restaurants, sign up lists and departure times will be 
posted each day. On arrival you will be given a guide to local restaurants and bars so you can make your 
own arrangements as required.<P>
<H5>Swimming Pool, etc.</H5>
The London Metropole Hotel has a swimming pool and small gym and sauna which will be available to 
all registered guests irrespective of whether or not you are staying at the hotel.<P>
<H5>Additions</H5>
In the interest of providing the best celebration service possible the organisers are always looking for 
speakers or events which will add to the program and therefore this list will not be definitive. I can also 
promise that in the true tradition of Mensa gatherings there will be impromptu happenings throughout the 
week.<P>
Have a good journey and I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks time.<P>

<TITLE> The Yuppie Blues Band</TITLE>
<H1>The Yuppie Blues Band</H1>
<H3>Another Weird Concept by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
<B>OVERALL CONCEPT:</B>  A band named "The White Middle Class Blues Band" would 
never quite make it -- racial overtones.  But the idea is sound because of the beating the middle 
class is taking with respect to overall quality of life.  When you are trying to buy a new middle-
class car for less than $25,000 and looking for an under $250,000 first house, you have to roll 
your own sushi at home.  Yuppies are fair game, we all relate to them, but none of us will admit to 
being one.  The blues is associated with those that we now call "the homeless," yet times are hard 
for those of us with homes and jobs too.  It's no wonder so many of us relate so well to the 
blues.<P>
<B>INSPIRATION:</B>  Janis Joplin, who sang, "Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz; 
my friends all drive Porsches, we must make amends..."<P>
<B>BAND MEMBERS:</B>  I envision a quintet -- drummer, lead guitar, keyboard, saxaphone, 
and lead singer.<P>
<B>BAND ATTIRE AND STAGE PROPS:</B>  This is not Elwood and Jake, but there must 
be uniforms.  Appropriate attire would be light blue "alligator" shirts, 501's, blue Reebok's, fake 
Rolex watches, and big dark Rayban's.  (Those $9.95 not-available-in-stores dark yellow "blue 
blockers" would be a bit too ironic.)  Those who must sit should be seated in either Recaro 
automotive-style office chairs, or a new improved good-for-your-back chairs that you kneel in.<P>
<B>ELECTRONICS:</B>  Everything should be wireless.  In place of stage monitors, each band 
member would wear Sony Walkman headsets plugged into FM radios broadcasting the actual mix.  
Two large speakers, arranged to look strangely like a giant headphone, would straddle the band and 
replace the wall of speakers.  The lead singer's wireless mike would look like a cellular phone; in 
fact, use of this or another plastic cordless phone would add to the effect by degrading the vocal 
sound quality to a good grade of gravel.  I also envision the audio technician sitting at a PC using a 
mouse or trackball to manipulate on-screen graphics to control the mix of each instrument.<P>
<B>INSTRUMENTS:</B>  These would all be electronic, a Casio or Yamaha keyboard, a Casio 
Digital Horn (electronic sax), a Casio Digital Guitar, Synsonics drums, and The Phone.  Whatever 
they have on sale at Best...<P>
<B>THE LYRICS:</B>  Blues is short and rough.  Yuppie blues must be somewhat different.  It 
could best be described as "longer words and correct grammar," although I prefer the idea of 
"mellow heavy metal haiku."<P>
<Pre>
<B>EXAMPLES:
Traditional Blues:         Yuppie Blues:</B>
"My baby done left me."    "My spouse is entering another relationship."
"I got drunk last night."  "I consumed too many wine coolers
                               after tennis yesterday afternoon."
"I shot my baby."          "In a fit of temporary insanity, I
                               fatally injured my significant other."
"She took my car."         "I lost custody of my BMW."</Pre>

<TITLE>Singles Clubs</TITLE>
<H1>Central Coast Singles Clubs</H1>
Updated 12/17/96.
I am currently involved with three recently-formed singles clubs in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara 
Counties on the Central Coast. My involvement varies with each club:<P>
<UL>
<LI>SASS -- Single Adults Sharing and Socializing, active in the San Luis Obispo area, they formed 
from the ADAPT support group as those members became more comfortable with their new singlehood. I 
am only a member of this group.
<LI>FLIRT -- Fun Loving Individuals Relating Together, active in the Five Cities area of SLO County. I 
am a member and their newsletter and calendar editor. The working title of their newsletter is <I>Flights 
of Fancy</I>. They have three regularly scheduled meetings each month:
<UL>
<LI>General Membership Meeting, Dinner, and Mixer, First Wednesday of each month, 6:00 PM, The Girl's Restaurant, 1237 Grand Avenue, Arroyo Grande. They meet in the back room, where the $2.00 cover charge includes the newsletter with calendar of events.
<LI>Happy Hour, First Friday, 5:30 PM, Trader Nick's, 1601 Price Street, Pismo Beach.
<LI>Happy Hour, Third Friday, 5:30 PM, Trader Nick's, 1601 Price Street, Pismo Beach.
</UL>
<LI>CCSF -- Central Coast Single Friends, active in the Santa Maria area of SB County. I was also their 
newsletter and calendar editor, but am not as active with this club as I was. The working title of their newsletter is 
<I>Friendly Forum</I>. Several of the members of this club came from an earlier club there called 
Singles Looking Ahead, and after a recent reorganization they have gone back to this name for the club. The plan a number of events each month, but their primary event is:
<UL>
<LI>General Meeting, Wednesdays, 7:30 PM, Bakers Square Restaurant, 1841 S. Broadway, Santa Maria. They meet in the back room, where a $2.00 cover charge covers a non-alcoholic beverage of your choice.
</UL>
<LI>40+ Singles Club was also in the Five Cities area, but has merged with FLIRT.
</UL>
As editor of the <I>Flights of Fancy</I>, I have written an occasional article on singles for the newsletter. These include:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="mas_hier.html">Maslow's Hierarchy</A> and the Singles Club --
or, just what is it that a club like FLIRT can do for me?
<LI><A HREF="msh_hier.html">Hutch's Hierarchy</A> -- an explanation of

</UL>
Do I have a <A HREF = "ad.html">singles ad</A>? Absolutely, I have met a number of people over the 
years through singles ads, as well as many more through active involvement with singles clubs.<P>
As time goes on, I may add pages for each of the singles clubs, stay tuned.<P>

<TITLE>Maslow's Hierarchy and the Singles Club</TITLE>
<H1>Maslow's Hierarchy and the Singles 
Club</H1>
<H2>Or, just what is it that a club like FLIRT 
can do for me?</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Abraham Maslow was an American psychologist and leading exponent of humanistic psychology. He is 
best known for his hierarchy of needs, which included five to seven levels at various points of his career. 
For our purposes, the basic five-level hierarchy will suffice. (For more information, I highly recommend 
his book, <I>Motivation and Personality</I>, 3rd Ed., 1970.)<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="maslow5.gif"></A><P>
Maslow believed that an individual must substantially satisfy the needs at the lowest level before he or she 
could begin to satisfy the needs at the next higher level. Only when the needs of all lower levels were 
satisfied could Self-Actualization Needs begin to be satisfied. Self-actualization is the fulfillment of one's 
human potential, and is often the point at which an individual becomes truly creative.<P>
In the context of Society, Physiological Needs include food, water, and sex as procreation (but not sex as 
love). Were Maslow alive today, I believe he would have added drugs to this layer, and more specifically, 
addiction. The homeless person on the corner with the "Will work for food" sign, or the drug addict who 
steals to buy more drugs are examples of people who are stuck at this level.<P>
Security and Safety Needs include a home and a job. The homeless and the impoverished are examples of 
people stuck at this level.<P>
Belongingness Needs includes both the need to be loved and the other part of sex as lovemaking. Children 
of single parents who are left alone while their parent works, as well as people in the process of divorcing 
fit here. Gangs and cults prey on these people, as they do those at the next level, but support groups can 
truly help these people.<P>
Self-Esteem Needs are self-explanatory. It is said that today's youth lack self-esteem, and someone who 
has just been divorced suffers as well. Again, gangs and cults appeal to these people, but support groups 
are what they truly need.<P>
Before I discuss the next level, I should note that in the six-level hierarchy, a layer called Self-Fulfillment 
Needs fits in here. In the seven-level hierarchy, this is divided into Cognitive Needs followed by Aesthetic 
Needs. In the context of a singles club, or any club, the satisfaction of these needs may be an important 
step towards reaching self-actualization.<P>
When Self-Actualization Needs are satisfied, a person can perform or live at his or her full potential. First, 
the person must have substantially satisfied the lower four levels of needs, then he or she can work on 
their curiosity and the need to understand. Now they can be creative.<P>
So, we first assume that the people joining a singles club have substantially met the first two levels of 
needs. We assume that they have a roof over their heads, a steady and adequate income, are not drug 
addicts (or alcoholics), and they get enough to eat each day. Now comes the tricky part.<P>
We must also assume that their Belongingness and Self-Esteem Needs are at least partially satisfied. If 
not, they really need the services that a support group can provide, at least for a while. They need to 
substantially alleviate the pain they are feeling, and get comfortable with their new single status.<P>
Once they are comfortable, a singles club can help them develop a circle of friends and a social life. They 
can become active and begin dating again. But they have to be ready for a group that is a social club, not a 
support group.<P>
As they attend group events, they will begin to satisfy their Belongingness Needs. As they make more 
intimate friends, they will begin dating and doing things with one special person, and in the process they 
will further satisfy their Self-Esteem Needs.<P>
The singles club itself is a catalyst. Happy hours, parties, and other group events only begin to fill a social 
life. A diverse calendar of events will help fulfill those Cognitive and Aesthetic Needs and begin to lead to 
Self-Actualization. What will really lead to that level is the opportunity for people to meet, get to know 
each other, discover their common interests, and take the important step of going on a date as a couple, 
rather than as a group.<P>
How do you use a singles group to its fullest? Your relationship with the group is a two-way affair. 
Hopefully, you will offer to include events that interest you on the calendar, and host those. And then we 
hope that others will share your interest and join you in attending those events as a group. Among these 
people, you might discover someone special, and take the next step of asking them to an event on a date as 
a couple.<P>

<TITLE>Hutch's Hierarchy</TITLE>
<H1>Hutch's Hierarchy</H1>
<H2>An explanation of friendships</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Last month I discussed Maslow's hierarchy and how it related to the potential purpose of a singles club. (If you 
missed that article, please contact me and I will be happy to give you a copy of that.) To summarize, we assume 
that someone joining a singles club has substantially satisfied their first two levels of needs  their Physiological 
Needs, such as food, water, and sex as procreation; and their Security &amp  Safety Needs, such as a home and a 
job. We further assume that their Belongingness Needs and Self-Esteem Needs are also at least partially satisfied, 
otherwise they may be better served by a true support group.  I then noted that as members attend group events, 
they will further satisfy their Belongingness Needs, and that as they begin dating within the group they will further 
satisfy their Self-Esteem Needs.  Once they substantially satisfy these needs, they can begin to satisfy their Self-
Actualization Needs and can begin to perform at their full potential.<P>
Over the years, I have observed that we have different types of friends. These friendship types seem to form a 
hierarchy somewhat like the one described by Maslow. <I>Ideally</I>, and I cannot overemphasize this, 
friendships progress up the hierarchy.<P>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="msh_hier.gif"></A><P>
At the bottom are mere Acquaintances. In the context of a singles club, these are people you have met. You may 
have sat next to each other at a dinner or a happy hour and had a conversation. In the context of the world at large, 
this group may include co-workers, clerks in stores you frequent, and so forth.<P>
At the next level are Friends. It is difficult to define precisely when an Acquaintance becomes a Friend, but at some 
point this happens. These are the people you seek out at events, people you want to speak with to see what is new 
with them, and people who share a common interest with you. You might have attended an special event with these 
people, or met for tennis or a game of golf. In the case of the opposite gender, these are people you may have dated. 
However, it is important to note that you will develop friendships with members of both sexes, and indeed, you 
<I>should</I> develop friendships with members of both sexes.<P>
As we become comfortable with some of our Friends, we develop an intimate friendship with them. An Intimate 
Friend is someone you can share your deep dark secrets with, and not worry about them running around telling the 
world about them. These are people you can confide in, and they are very important in the scheme of things. In 
general, we have very few Intimate Friends, in many cases, we may only have one. Again, gender differences are 
not significant, and ideally we might have at one Intimate Friend of each gender.<P>
At the top of the hierarchy is our Lover. Notice that I do not use the plural at this level. In this ideal world I keep 
referring to, we only have one Lover, one person we are truly devoted to. This Lover might become our spouse, but 
I would not create a higher level in my hierarchy for a spouse. If we have multiple Lovers, we are probably 
working our way <I>down</I> the hierarchy rather than <I>up</I> it.<P>
And therein lies the key to this whole hierarchy. In an ideal situation, we work up the pyramid. We make 
Acquaintances, some of whom become our Friends. As our friendships mature and grow, some of those become our 
Intimate Friends. And finally, one special Intimate Friend becomes our Lover.<P>
The problem is that we often do not have the patience to go up the pyramid. We are anxious to find a Lover, so we 
take a few shortcuts and go directly from Acquaintance to Lover. Because we have skipped the Friend level, we 
may not have a whole lot in common, other than a desire to go to bed with each other. And because we have 
skipped the Intimate Friend level, we may not be able to talk with each other and work out any problems that 
arise.<P>
Our situation changes throughout life. When we are newly single, especially if we are recently divorced, we are 
often a bit desperate (a harsh word, but accurate). We are suddenly without something, a Lover, and we are very 
anxious to get that back. As we become more comfortably single, we can relax and take our time working up the 
pyramid. And there are other events in our lives that can put us into this shortcut mode.<P>
However, if we work our way up to a Lover, that Lover is also a Friend and an Intimate Friend. We can talk with 
them about anything that is troubling us, because they are an Intimate Friend. We can have fun together because 
they are our Friend. And that is really wonderful.<P>

<TITLE>The Different Types of Single and Divorced</TITLE>
<H1>The Different Types of Single and 
Divorced</H1>
<H2>Your outlook is different if you are single, 
widowed, or divorced</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
The term "single" is a very generic term. Some singles have never been married. Other people are now single 
because they are widowed. Many people are single because they are divorced. (I don't include separated in here, 
because those people are not yet single. In the case of "legally separated" they will never be truly single.) You need 
to be very clear about <B><I>why</I></B> you are single, and just how single you are. And similarly, you need to 
know the same about the other person. Why?<P>
Marriage is a learning experience, as is life in general. People who are married or have been married see life a bit 
differently than those who have never married. And I'm sorry, but close does not count in this regard. The fact that 
you have lived with someone for an extended period of time, or were once engaged, is just not the same.<P>
A person who is widowed has a different outlook on life than someone who is divorced. Both of them have 
different outlooks on life than someone who has always been single. What the divorced and widowed person have 
in common is that they were once married, and lost their spouse in some manner.<P>
Also, there are different types of divorced people. Some have only been divorce once, others have had several 
spouses over the years. And the number of years is significant. A person who has had three spouses over a period 
of 25 years is different from one who has had three spouses in three years. (I might also be more than a little bit 
concerned about someone who has been <B><I>widowed</I></B> several times in a few years.)<P>
Time brings another aspect to this discussion. <B><I>How long</I></B> a person has been single, divorced, or 
widowed is a significant factor. Someone who has been divorced or widowed for many years will be more like a 
person who has always been single that like a person who is recently divorced or widowed. I don't know a lot of 
widowed people, so I can't say a whole lot about them, however, in the case of divorced people, someone who has 
been divorced a couple of months is quite different from one who has been divorced for one or two years. And that 
person is different still from one who has been divorced ten or fifteen years, maybe even only five years.<P>
What I find interesting about the recently divorced is that they are easy to pick out in a group of singles. I am going 
to use an ugly word to describe them, desperate, but I challenge you to come up with a better one. It may be that 
these people need a little more time with a support group before they can become successful singles. But the reason 
I suggest that these people stand out in a singles environment is that they act in a way that is almost annoying. 
They lack the finesse that others have, they are not yet comfortable with their new single status, and they are 
determined to pair off with someone <B><I>right now</I></B>. And yes, I was once one of them, so I speak a bit 
from experience here.<P>
I have already made the point that these recently divorced people may need a little more time with a support group, 
rather than a singles group, but there is another more universal point. The ideal person for someone who is 
recently divorced is another person who is recently divorced. They share the same outlook on life and they may 
actually be quite good for each other. I should also caution you that there are some people who prey on these types. 
Some people recognize that those who are desperate are also "easy."<P>
The universal point I am trying to make here is that like individuals are more compatible than disparate 
individuals. A widow <B><I>may</I></B> be more compatible with a widower than a single, in the same way 
that two singles may be quite compatible. Time affects this, and so someone who has been widowed for ten years 
may be quite compatible with someone who has been divorced for a similar length of time, or with a single. As 
time goes on, you are less likely to be compared to the ex- or late spouse.<P>
At this point a disclaimer is probably in order. This discussion is based on observation and personal experience, 
however, nothing in life is absolute, not even life itself. So do not necessarily rule someone out because of a 
difference in "singleness." But do be aware that this difference may be a factor.<P>
Be honest about your own situation, and be open-minded about theirs. If you are reading a singles ad, realize that 
SWM, DWM, and WWM may be three very different situations. But remember that time is a factor and that in 
some cases these may be more similar than they first appear. If you are placing an ad, and if you have been single 
for a while, then you might note that you are seeking (or in search of, which is ISO) a D/SWF if you are a DWM 
(and if race is not important, leave out the W, B, H, or A). But beware of ads with DS in them. Determine the 
context, because in one case they may be seeking a Divorced or Single person, in the other case they may be 
Desperately Seeking a warm body. If someone is widowed or divorced, be sure to ask them how long that has been 
the case.  It may or may not be significant.<P>

<TITLE>Pickled Ginger</TITLE>
<H1>Pickled Ginger (<I>Gari or 
Shoga</I>)</H1>
In a sushi bar, you will be given a small heap of pickled ginger as well as a small glob of <I>wasabi</I>. 
The purpose of the <I>wasabi</I> is to mix with soy sauce in the small dish that included with your 
place setting. (Start with small amounts of the <I>wasabi</I>, mix it with the soy sauce, and sample. 
Repeat until it tastes more like the <I>wasabi</I> than the soy sauce, or until it tastes "right" to you.) 
The ginger is used to cleanse the palate between bites of sushi. It does not take a lot of the ginger to 
cleanse the palate, so the small pile should be enough for several rolls. If you consume all of either, by all 
means ask the sushi chef for more.<P>
People have asked if the ginger root in grocery stores is the same ginger that is pickled for sushi. It is, and 
up until now I have recommended that you buy it in jars at Asian markets. I recently found a recipe for 
making your own pickled ginger, and will share that with you.<P>
<Pre>
8 oz. (250 g) ginger root
3 fl oz (90 ml) rice vinegar
2 Tablespoons <I>mirin *</I>
2 Tablespoons <I>sake **</I>
5 teaspoons sugar
	<I>mirin</I> is a very sweet rice wine used only for cooking. You 
can substitute a teaspoon of sugar for a Tablespoon of <I>mirin</I>, or 
an equal amount of <I>sake</I>.
	<I>sake</I> is a rice wine that often accompanies sushi. Dry sherry 
is a potential but inferior substitute.
</Pre>
Scrub the ginger under running water as you would a potato for baking. Blanch in boiling water for one 
minute and drain.<P>
Combine <I>mirin</I>, <I>sake</I>, and sugar in a small pan. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar 
has dissolved. Cool.<P>
Place the ginger into a sterilized jar and pour the cooled vinegar over the ginger. Cover and keep 3-4 days 
before using. Will keep refrigerated for up to one month.<P>
The pale pink color develops as it ages, however, you might want to add a small amount of red food 
coloring.<P>

Science in Engineering from California State University, Northridge.<P>

<H2>Hybrid Computer Interface Using Dual 
Coprocessors</H2>
Analog and hybrid computers have not yet benefitted from the impact of microprocessors. 
Combining a state-of-the-art microprocessor with equally modern analog, digital, and 
conversion components results in a compact versatile hybrid computer.  Equal in power to 
room-sized first-generation and rack-sized second generation hybrids, the proposed dual-
coprocessor hybrid computer fits in an expansion unit for the IBM PC or PC-
compatibles.<P>
Like the large hybrid computers of the 1950s and 1960s, either the analog or digital 
coprocessor can operate independently as an analog or digital computer.  Both can 
operate simultaneously in parallel as well, with either the digital coprocessor utilizing the 
analog for subroutines, the analog utilizing the digital for repetitive operations, or both 
operating separately.  Programming and control of both coprocessors is performed by the 
host computer using the high-level language FORTH.  In the case of the digital 
coprocessor, the host computer compiles the FORTH program in the machine language of 
the coprocessor, which is then stored in common RAM.  Programming of the analog 
coprocessor is accomplished by using extensions of the FORTH language to address 
latching buffers which control the digital coefficient potentiometers, analog switches for 
programming and scaling, and input and output summing amplifiers.  Additional 
extensions of FORTH control the numeric data processor and provide mathematic 
functions such as sine, log, cosine, and exponent for the digital coprocessor.<P>
Numerous interfaces are provided both between the coprocessors and host computer, and 
the coprocessors and the physical world.  The purpose of the former is to enable the host 
computer peripherals to be used by the hybrid for display, storage, and printout.  The 
latter enables the hybrid to interface either coprocessor to both analog and digital inputs 
and outputs.  In addition, through various interconnections using ADCs and DACs, the 
hybrid can operate in bilateral mode, or in unilateral mode.  In the unilateral mode, the 
analog coprocessor can precede the digital, or the digital can precede the analog.<P>

<TITLE> Trojan Cup and Pint</TITLE>
<H1>It All Started With the Horse</H1>
<H2>(or, Why American Beer Comes in 12-
ounce Cans)</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
I used to think that coffee makers were uniquely weird, since they considered a cup to be six 
ounces rather than eight.  Then I bought a rice cooker and encountered the same unit of measure.  
A cup of rice was only six ounces.  No wonder nobody cooks anymore, just when you figured out 
how many cups are in a pint, pints in a quart, and quarts in a gallon, along comes Mr. Coffee 
and everyone is confused.  Suddenly, the other night, I figured it all out.<P>
I was preparing for my Second Friday Show and Tell, the topic of the month being art, and 
looking through my coin collection.  I have a set of proof silver Pillar Dollars from Mexico that 
was minted shortly after the Mexico City Mint did a housecleaning and found the original dies 
from 1732.  The set includes a 1/10-ounce, 1/4-ounce, 1/2-ounce, ounce and troy pound version 
of the original silver dollar.  (The Pillar Dollar was actually 8 reales, the source of such terms as 
"pieces of eight" and "two bits," as well as the alleged source of our "$" symbol.)  A troy pound is 
actually only 12 ounces, rather than 16 ounces as with a pound avoirdupois.  We have units of 
measure of dry pints and liquid pints, might there be a "troy pint?"<P>
If there is a troy pint, it would be (logically) 12 liquid ounces.  Since beer normally is served in 
pints (and quarts), this explains our 12-ounce beer cans -- they are troy pints!  Suddenly I was 
onto something.  This probably dates back to our revolution, when we rebelled against everything 
British, including 8-ounce cups of heavily taxed tea and 16-ounce pints of beer.    What a 
revelation.  We secretly adopted the Hellenic system of measure.  Half of a pint is a cup, hence the 
6-ounce cups of coffee and rice.<P>
Carrying this further, a troy quart would be 24 ounces, and a troy gallon would be 96 ounces, 
rather than 32 and 128 respectively for their avoirdupois equivalents.  This even explains why we 
sell hard liquor in fifths of a gallon or four-fifths of a quart.  25.4 ounces is pretty close to the troy 
quart.<P>
96 ounces in a troy gallon.  Did this influence ? and the Mysterians years ago when they wrote 
"96 Tears?"  One-ounce tears, talk about alligator tears.  Maybe ? was a student of Hellenic 
history which influenced his music.  <P>
And what about Helen of Troy?  Isn't she the one whose face launched a thousand ships?  That 
has always seemed a bit strange, was she really very ugly and the people were trying to get away 
from her like today's boat people?  No, not at all.  She was allegedly the most beautiful woman in 
all of Greece.  I think that her people were merely drinking to her beauty, and consumed 1000 
gallons of wine.  Literacy was not real common back then, and someone wrote galleons rather 
than gallons.  The eventual mistranslation resulted in a gross misunderstanding that remains 
today.<P>
So there you have it.  The woman who was associated with the great horse influenced the 
packaging of beer and soda.  This may even be the real reason that our largest brewer maintains a 
stable of Clydesdale horses, in honor of the Trojan horse and the troy pint.  Who would have ever 
suspected this?<P>
DISCLAIMER:  The above is historical humor, it is a joke and should not be taken seriously.  
Editors of the various tabloids might consider it truth and historical fact, but this is not a 
tabloid.<P>

Revised 11/10/95 msh, added anecdote about meeting Dr. Ware.<P>
<H2>Join the Celebration</H2>
Mensa will celebrate its 50th Anniversary in London 20-26 August 1996.  Plans are well advanced 
to make this the biggest and best Mensa party ever.  We will have Mensans and their families and 
guests from all over the world.  Although it appears to be a long way away, advance planning is 
necessary to avoid disappointment.<P>
<IMG SRC="construc.gif">  This page is under construction, please be patient.<P>
<H2>Location</H2>
The main venue is a magnificent London  Metropole hotel, with several overflow hotels available.  
There will also be student-style accommodation at Ramsay Hall of University College London.<P>
<H2>Programme</H2>
<DT>An impressive <A HREF = "program.html">programme of events</A> is included in the 
booking package and will include:<P>
<DL><LI>Sightseeing -- museums, Wembley Stadium, London Dungeon, Tower Bridge, 
Palaces, etc.
<LI>Gala Dinner -- this is a formal dinner, and formal wear will be available for hire.
<LI>Fun Dinners -- such as Planet Hollywood.
<LI>A Day Out to Mensa's Birthplace at Oxford.
<LI>Games -- Alien War, Quasar, Kart Racing, etc.
<LI>Entertainment -- Mensa Variety Show, an Icebreaker, etc.
<LI>Lectures -- will be presented each day and will be free of charge to all registered guests.  The 
speakers have yet to be confirmed, but we hope they will be both controversial and provocative.  
Details are now available on an <A HREF =
"http://www.rain.org/~hutch/update.html">Update Page</A>.
<LI>Etc., Etc.</DL>
<H2>Airfare Discounts</H2>
We have arranged a special deal on airfares with American Airlines.  Departing from anywhere 
within the US or Canada, a 10% discount can be obtained on any applicable round trip fare to and 
from London by quoting the code:  STARFILE 02866D.<P>
If you are attending the British 50th Anniversary celebrations and the AG in Manchester the 
weekend before then a similar discount can be obtained on a round trip arriving in Manchester and 
departing in London by quoting the code:  STARFILE 01866D.<P>
The above discounts are subject to date restrictions.<P>
<H2>Extending the Stay</H2>
During the previous five days, Manchester will host the British Mensa AGM with a tremendous 
itinerary.  The ideal would be to spend eleven days of hedonistic pleasure at these two venues.  
However, you will be able to pick and choose one or both and any part of the programmes.  For 
booking information on "The Big One" in Manchester, contact:<P>

<H2>Registration</H2>
The first notice that Registration Forms are available will appear in the July <I>International 
Journal</I>.  There will be a delay in response as we are aiming for an equitable arrangement for 
those Mensans who live in isolated parts of the globe and whose magazines are received later.<P>
<blink><b>A warning.</b></blink>  Interest shown and a large demand for Registration Forms 
(which will not be sent unless requested on the official form that will appear in the<I> 
International Journal</I>) show that we can expect a very heavy call on our somewhat limited 
accommodation.  It will add to your enjoyment considerably if you obtain a room at the 
designated hotel or main hall of residence, but there is expected to be a big demand following the 
first official announcement.  Please, do not feel that 1996 is somewhere over the horizon, so you 
can book later -- you will probably be disappointed.<P>

<H2>A Brief History</H2>
<IMG SRC="oldlogo2.gif" ALT="Mensa's Original Logo"><P>
In 1945, two men met by chance on a train.  Roland Berrill was an Australian expatriate licensed 
in law, spared the need to practice by a substantial investment income.  Lancelot Lionel Ware was 
an Oxford university student who would someday become a barrister also.  They subsequently 
corresponded about forming a club, which was a lifelong dream of Ware's.<P>
On March 11, 1946, Ware administered the Cattell III 'A' test to Berrill.  It was Berrill who 
printed the first piece of Mensa literature on October 1, 1946, the accepted date of founding.  It 
was also Berrill who named Mensa.  Initially, "Mens" (Latin for mind) was suggested, but 
discarded out of fear of confusion with a popular magazine of that era.  Chosen instead was 
"Mensa" which had three meanings -- mind, table, and month.  This suggested monthly meetings 
of great minds around a table, a common Mensa event that continues today.<P>
On April 22, 1946, the qualifying IQ level for membership was set at 155 on the Cattell test, 
which corresponded to the top 1%.  In 1960, the acceptance level was officially lowered to 148 
on the Cattell test, corresponding to the current top 2%.<P>

<h4>What could be more intriguing to a fifth grader than dissecting a squid, observing whales from the deck of a 88-foot vessel, or petting a sea hare while exploring a tide pool? <p>
These are just some of the activities that make up an exciting yearlong marine education program geared to stimulate a lifelong interest in preserving and protecting the ocean. In cooperation with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Museum administers the Los Marineros program which is offered to fifth grade students in the Santa Barbara School District. <p>

A curriculum guide has been developed, available in English and Spanish, that may be purchased by anyone looking for innovative ways to keep children excited about learning. The guide features activities and information dealing with universal concepts such as tides, currents and geology as well as topics specific to the central coast.<p>

</center>The staff has presented how-to lessons at marine education workshops and is available to take the show on the road. We know it gives teachers an advantage (and courage!) to see and do interactive lessons before they try them with their students.<p> 
Los Marineros also offers internship and volunteer opportunities to anyone interested in developing curriculum and getting right into the trenches to experience working with children in the classroom and out in the marine environment.<p>

<H4>Presents The Ultimate Intimate Accessory For Your Laptop 
Computer</H4>
<H2><I>Pia</I> -- Personal Intimate 
Assistant</H2>
<I>Pia</I> will help you achieve self-gratification with your laptop computer.  <I>Pia</I> is a 
high-technology integrated hardware and software system especially designed for laptop 
computers.<P>

<IMG ALT=""SRC ="piabw.gif"></A>

<I>Pia</I>'s hardware is a soft dimpled personal vibrator system that plugs into the PCMCIA slot 
of your laptop computer.  The high-technology vibrator uses three stepper motors to accurately 
control the triaxial motion that you specify.  These motors use special neodymium alloy 
permanent magnets for consistent, reliable, steady power.  Because these magnets are so 
powerful, the software must be shipped in special mu-metal sleeves.  A six-foot cable connects the 
vibrator to the PCMCIA adapter permanently, there are no parts to lose.  The vibrator and cable 
are sealed so they can be easily cleaned.  (The PCMCIA adapter cannot be immersed.)  Is

<H2>The Laser Drill Perf-Printer</H2>
<H3><I>The Ultimate Braille Printer</I></H3>
Production of documents in Braille couldn't be easier.  This network-ready printer features 
parallel, serial, and Mac printer connections for maximum connectivity.  A proprietary built-in text 
processor uses state-of-the-art OCR technology to convert most typefaces into Braille 
characters.<P>
The high-power laser printer engine then precisely drills holes in the paper to create a Braille 
document.  The standard built-in paper tray handles letter size paper and card stock up to 80-
pound basis.  An legal paper tray is optional.  Manual feed can be used for odd sizes of paper of 
similar weight, even envelopes.<P>
<H3><I>Available Soon!</I></H3>
An optional graphics conversion processor.  This revolutionary processor decomposes graphics 
into basic shapes, then uses a proprietary graphics library to convert the graphic image into Braille 
text.  For example:<P>

<TITLE>Mensa Types</TITLE>
<H1>Types of Mensa Members</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
The Ultimate Dichotomy states that there are two types of people:  those that divide people into 
two types, and those who do not. I guess I am one of the former, although in the case of Mensa 
there are more than two types.<P>
Type 1. For these Mensans, the glass is definitely half empty. On top of that, someone took the 
other half, or else they ran out and the Type 1 M did not get his or her share. These are the 
bitchers and whiners, the ones who point out that whatever the AMC or ExComm does, it is 
wrong. They have no solutions or suggestions, only complaints. They seem to be Type A people 
too, and we have too many of them. A typical comment from a Type 1 would be, "You are out of 
beer, when are you going to get more?"<P>
Type 2. For these Mensans, the glass is half full, and they are working on filling it, not emptying 
it. These are the volunteers and officers, the ones who are on the AMC and ExComm. When the 
beer runs out, they volunteer to restock it. We do not have enough of these members.<P>
Type 3. These are the 80% we never see at events. They are the core of Mensa that renews every 
year and are satisfied to receive the Mensa Bulletin, their local newsletter, and their membership 
card. From them we try to get Type 2's and avoid getting Type 1's. The Bible says, "Blessed are 
the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth." In Mensa, depending on your point of view, we might 
say, "Blessed (or cursed) are the Type 3's, for they shall inherit Mensa." If we allow the Type 1's 
to burn out all the Type 2's, Mensa will fold. We must work to steadily convert Type 3's to Type 
2's, and muzzle the Type 1's.<P>
Type 0. These are our lapsed or quitting members. Some may be burned out Type 2's, others may 
be disgusted Type 3's. We need to work to prevent Types 2 and 3 from becoming Type 0's. But 
I'm not sure we should work to convert Type 1's to Type 0's necessarily, although in some cases it 
may be best.<P>
There is also a Type 1.5, a Type 1 who actually offers alternatives and solutions to the problems 
he or she sees. These are the recovering Type 1's on their way to becoming Type 2's. there is hope 
for these members, and it may be possible to convert them fully.<P>
So, what type are you? Mensa is looking for a few good Type 2's, and a few less Type 1's.<P>

<TITLE> Personal Nuclear Waste</TITLE><P>
<H1>Personal Nuclear Waste</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Well, it has finally happened.  I have made it to the point where I have my very own contribution 
to nuclear waste.  It is hardly a large contribution, and it is really a moral issue anyway.  The two 
smoke detectors that were already installed in my home when I bought it ten years ago, have 
died.<P>
I could just throw them away, which is probably what a lot of people would do -- people who are 
careless, uncaring, or possibly illiterate.  Such a person would fail to read the label on the inside of 
the detector that tells them to return the detector to the manufacturer for disposal.  As a licensed 
Mechanical Engineer, with a minor in nuclear engineering, it is a moral issue for me -- I have to 
properly dispose of these detectors.  I can now pass the buck to Sears, and they can figure out 
how to extract the 5.0 micro Curies of americium from all the plastic and dispose of it.  Hopefully, 
there is enough plastic structure around the americium so they do not achieve critical mass if 
stored to close together.  (I am not sure what to do with two old watches with radium hands.)<P>
Ten years from now I will have to repeat this, but the new detector from Builders Emporium does 
not state where it should be send for disposal.  There is good news, though; the new one only 
contains 1.0 micro Curies of americium -- which, it states, is equal to 37 kilo Becquerels of 
radiation.  (Our efforts to metrify strike again -- Curies have become Becquerels.  I know who 
Madam Curie was, but who was Becquerel?)<P>
I also find it interesting that my expired detectors were made in Hong Kong, and the new one was 
made in Taiwan.  It leads me to ask several questions.  How can something made of americium be 
built anywhere but in America without being unpatriotic?  When the new humongous accelerator 
is built, will they name any new heavy elements hongkongium or taiwanium?  Are smoke 
detectors illegal in nuclear-free New Zealand?  And since radium is radioactive, how do New 
Zealanders read their wristwatches at night?<P>

OPPORTUNITY  $$$</H2>
Are you finding yourself a little short of money as the holidays approach?  We have an excellent 
money-making opportunity for you!<P>
You may have noticed that most toys and many gifts need batteries to operate.  And batteries are 
usually not included.  You can get into one of the most profitable seasonal industries in 
America!<P>
<H2>HOLIDAY BATTERY SALES!</H2>
We provide you with a comfortable pink bunny costume, a small bass drum, stylish sunglasses, 
and a backpack filled with all popular battery types.  Roller skates are optional, good walking 
shoes are highly recommended.  No beach thongs.<P>
<H2>EXCLUSIVE AREAS ARE STILL 
AVAILABLE!</H2>
So, call today!  Applicants must be in good health, have dependable transportation, and be able to 
make change.  Deadline for applications is Thanksgiving.  Specialized training will be provided.  
While most sales occur during the holiday season, this is an excellent year-round business 
opportunity.<P>
<H2>HIGH COMMISSIONS!</H2>
Everyone needs batteries, but no one likes to go out to buy them.  Psychologists have shown that 
people fear going out for batteries because they may also end up buying gum, magazines, 
cigarettes, beer and even groceries.  Take advantage of this fear!  Sell batteries door to door, or 
blanket to blanket on the beach.<P>

<TITLE> Pennies Versus Luck</TITLE>
<H1>Pennies Versus Luck</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
I have an aunt DeeDee who is always stopping to pick up pennies she sees lying on the sidewalk.  She says 
it will mean good luck, but we always giggle anyway.  Perhaps she is right, but I don't always stop to do 
the same.<P>
By the way, her real name is Jean.  When I was little and just learning to talk, I couldn't say Jean, so I said 
DeeDee and the name stuck.  So I can actually say that I named my aunt, who is thirty years my senior.<P>
When I am out riding my bicycle I am always seeing pennies lying in the street.  Sometimes I think about 
stopping to pick them up, but with an 18-speed bicycle to deal with it is not an easy task.  I <B>will</B> 
stop and pick up silver coins, and struggle to restart myself in high gear.  I just cannot ride past a quarter, 
so I continue to do this.  And often it is only a dime or nickel, but they all look like quarters at speed and 
from that height.<P>
Should I stop and pick up the pennies too?  Probably.  If I did so, and saved them, I might be rich someday.  
But it would make much more sense to stop and pick up the lead wheel weights and sell them to a recycler.  
Our streets are so badly pot-holed that I must pass a couple of pounds of lead each time I ride.<P>
Besides pennies and wheel weights, I see a lot of nuts and bolts lying in the road.  And I can't help but 
wonder what critical function they used to perform on the vehicle they fell off of.  Sometimes I see so many 
nuts and bolts I think there must be a disabled car up ahead somewhere.<P>
Which leads me back to pennies.  Maybe, just maybe, pennies are associated with luck.  It is good luck if 
you stop and pick them up.  But if you ignore them, bad luck will befall you.  And so starts another 
myth.<P>
Supposing we were to postulate that driving over pennies causes automobile problems?  What the hell, 
<B>something</B> causes cars to break or degrade for no apparent reason.  So why not blame it on the 
pennies in the road, pennies that would bring good luck if we stopped to pick them up.  We don't, so our 
luck sours.  Driving over pennies brings bad luck.  Picking up pennies brings good luck.  Simple, isn't 
it?<P>
Having begun this myth, let's refine it further.  There will undoubtedly develop several schools of thought 
on this new myth.  One school of thought might be that one or more of your tires must touch the penny in 
order for it to bring bad luck.  This could explain why some people swerve around invisible objects for no 
apparent reason.  They may just be trying to avoid hitting a penny in the road.<P>
Another school of thought could be that the tire need not touch the penny, the car merely has to pass over 
the penny.  This is less precise, but more attractive to physicists, who might suggest that a weak magnetic 
force associated with the penny interacts with the passing car.  And they might also suggest that the more 
massive a car, the less the effect of the penny.  This would explain why small cars break so easily, and 
might be justification for a plastic or fiberglass car, to reduce the magnetic influence.<P>
A third school of thought might be that bad luck will occur if the shadow of your car passes over a penny.  
Associated with this school of thought is the apparent time delay between the time your shadow touches a 
penny and the time the problems occur.  And this might explain why cars break down at night, although the 
shadows from the moon or streetlights are not as strong as those from the sun.<P>
And let's not forget about karma.  If someone intentionally throws a penny into the street, it should be 
<B>them</B> who suffer bad luck, not the cars driving over it.  It's only fair.  And perhaps if someone 
picks up a penny in the street, they should be immune from the effects of driving over other pennies.  But 
only for a while, karma has its limits.<P>
So there you have it, a new myth.  Pass it along, and pick up those pennies!<P>

<H2><I>Super Mouse</I></H2>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="wem_mou.gif"></A><P>
The regular mouse or pointing device is very lightweight, and very sensitive to the slightest hand 
motion.  That's why the cursor points all over the screen when your hand is shaking, you suffer 
from some nervous disorder, or when your boss is looking over your shoulder and making you 
nervous.  Adjusting the mouse driver sensitivity can help, but that causes other problems, like 
slow response.<P>
Super mouse is made of depleted uranium, one of the heaviest materials available.  The base of 
the mouse is made of Teflon-coated high-technology NdFeB magnetic alloy.  When used with our 
polyurethane-coated steel mouse pad, any cursor movement is slow and deliberate.<P>

I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering from <A HREF = "http://www.mtu.edu/">Michigan Tech</A> in

teach EE.  Since I did not yet have my MSEE, they let me teach classes like EE for non-majors (like me,  
at the time), Control Systems (which was common to EE and ME), and Electrical Machinery (which was  
required of EE's, EL's, and ME's).  I had a ball teaching and would love to do it full time, someday.<P>

<TITLE>A Brief History</TITLE>
<H1>A Brief History</H1>
<IMG ALT="The Infamous Duck Parade"SRC ="ducks.gif"></A><P>
The SIG began as a one-man effort at the Mensa Annual Gathering (AG) in San Francisco in 1992.  The sole hoax 
perpetrated at that AG was the alleged postponement of the Mensa Retest, which was promulgated as a sign posted 
in the Hospitality Suite.  As time passed, additional hoaxes were created and posted at Regional Gatherings (RGs) 
in Region 9.  As the Orlando AG approached in 1993, we came up with the idea of dressing as ducks and parading 
out to the fountain at the Peabody hotel in Orlando, FL, ahead of the real Peabody ducks.  It was so well received 
that we had to repeat it.  The hotel staff even helped us with our staging.  We also posted a number of signs at that 
AG.<P>
<IMG ALT="The Tea Bag Parade As Seen On TV"SRC ="teabag2.gif"></A><P>
At the 1994 New England Annual Gathering held in Cambridge, MA, our reputation preceded us.  We were 
virtually expected to have some sort of parade.  Since we were near Boston, it seemed appropriate to dress as tea 
bags and parade through the hotel and into the Charles River.  Along the way, we were filmed by The Discovery 
Channel for their Amazing America program, which aired in November.  Oh, and we keep coming up with more 
and more signs, which we post at AGs and RGs, and even at American Mensa Committee (AMC) meetings.<P>
Our parade in St. Louis in 1995 was proceeded by considerable controversy.  The plan was to parade as "The 
Spirits of St. Louis," in ghost-like sheets with beanie propellors on top.  Our esteemed leader was to wear a Lucky 
Lindy leather helmet with propellor on top, goggles, and a scarf.  Several people were concerned about us parading 
around in sheets, and we learned later that the Ku Klux Klan was planning a protest on the Courthouse steps in St. 
Louis that weekend.  Soooo, Ruth Ancona, our official SIG costume maker dyed the sheets blue and made sure the 
circles around the eye cut-outs were black and large.  (As some of you may realize, the St. Louis National Hockey 
League team is the Blues, so that also fit in nicely.)  Nevertheless, we paraded late at night, and did NOT appear 
near any television cameras.<P>
We are still thinking about a parade for the Black Gold Blowout AG in 1996 in Houston.  The AG logo features 
armadillos, a common form of native roadkill, and that does have us thinking.  We are not sure yet if we will be 
doing a parade in England in 1996 at the <A HREF = "mensa50.html">Mensa 50th Anniversary 
Celebration</A>.<P>

<head>Sharks:  Phantoms of the Santa Barbara Channel</b></head>


<h4>	Cool gray skin and coal black eyes. Hundreds of sharp teeth, but no bones. Powerful crescent-shaped tails moving silently through shadowy kelp forests. Meet the Museums summer guests!
	<p>This year, Fleischmann Auditorium will become a dim underwater world inhabited by 17 life-size shark models, huge photographic murals of actual shark habitats, <b>interactive displays</b>, a walk-in shark cage, and a spectacular recreation of the fossilized jaws of the long-dead <i>Carcharocles megalodon</i>-- a 45-foot monster capable of swallowing something the size of a small car. Accompanied by echoing underwater sounds and constantly changing, eerily beautiful marine images projected overhead, youll be able to take an imaginary trek across the Santa Barbara Channel and take a close look at some of the 24 species of shark that frequent these waters.
<p>	<img align=bottom alt="IMAGE" src="http://www.rain.org/~inverts/bulletin/May95/shark1.gif"></IMG>There are more than 360 shark species world-wide; fewer than 70 (including the vicious star of <i>Jaws</i>) are dangerous to humans. The risk of shark attack is actually 50 times lower than being struck by lightning! Our show will separate fact from fantasy and celebrate the complex, beautiful animals that have inhabited the worlds oceans for at least 400 million years.<p>

<p>Beginning close to the mainland, we plunge into the ocean and encounter a 9-foot Tiger Shark. Nearby are the stomach contents taken from such sharks: license plates, a propeller, a horse skull, and even a 17th century French suit of armor! We head for open waters and come eye to eye with an 8-foot Hammerhead, attended by a small retinue of pilot fish. The path narrows as we enter a submersible which will take us to a depth of 500 feet. So many fathoms down, sunlight is almost non-existent. Suddenly an enormous creature looms out of the shadows -- a Megamouth!
	<p>Retreating from the pressures of the deep we come close to the waters off the Channel Islands in an area known as "Shark Park." Here we encounter the 13-foot Great White Shark, its teeth gleaming as it prepares to dine on a hapless Harbor Seal.
	<p>In the Museum Gallery the anthropological component of the show features how sharks are viewed by different cultures. On display will be artifacts from island and coastal California Indians, the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica, the Nazca people of Peru, and the Bidjogo people of West Africa.
	<p>The Sea Center plans to devote three of its six indoor aquariums to shark embryos and shark relatives such as Ratfish and Hagfish, known for secreting copious amounts of slime. Outside at the Touch Tank, youll be able to handle a live Swell Shark, a Thornback Ray, and other local marine animals.
	<p>The Museum Store will have lots of shark-related items including books, T-shirts, caps, and mugs, and the Shark Shack Caf is planning mouthfuls of tasty treats.<p></h4>

<TITLE>Our First Meeting</TITLE>
<H1>How I Met Dr. L. L. Ware</H1>
<H4>by Mark S. Hutchenreuther</H4>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="leaders.gif"></A><BR>
Mark S. Hutchenreuther and Dr. L. L. Ware at the 1994 AG in Cambridge, MA<P>
At the American Mensa AG in San Francisco in July 1992, I spent a lot of my time wandering between 
the several Hospitality Suites.  At one point, I encountered an older gentleman who was not wearing his 
AG badge, a violation of "The Rules."  I mentioned to him that he must wear a badge in order to be in the 
Hospitality Suites.  He noted that it would obscure his T-shirt, which displayed four Latin words.  I 
continued to insist the he must wear a badge.  He was equally obstinate and asked if I knew what the T-
shirt said.  The T-shirt did not concern me, his lack of a badge did.<P>
In the hallway stood Skinner, founder and coordinator of the American Mensa party SIG, the Hell's 
Mensans, or Hell's Ms.  I noticed he was wearing a giant security badge, so I told him about the rule-
breaker in Hospitality.  This annoyed him and presented him with a dilemma.  First of all, he was in the 
middle of a conversation with an attractive woman, a conversation he was enjoying.  Second, since he was 
in charge of security, it was his duty to deal with this person who was not wearing a badge.  Duty won, 
and off he went.<P>
At the time, I was Local Secretary of the Channel Islands Mensa group in California, so each month I 
received all of the newsletters from other Region 9 groups.  In August, I received a number of newsletters 
containing photos of the very distinguished gentleman I had thrown out of Hospitality for not wearing his 
badge.  He was none other than Dr. L. L. Ware, our founder.  (I would eventually learn that Skinner did 
not know who he was either, and that the entire American Mensa Committee knew what had happened 
within five minutes of it happening.)<P>
Over the Labor Day holiday weekend in early September, I attended the Asilomar gathering in Monterey.  
Who should I see in Registration but Dr. Ware.  I approached him, properly introduced myself, and began 
to apologize for my actions at the AG.  He insisted that I had been correct and apologized to me instead.  
But every so often at Asilomar I just had to nudge him and note that I was happy to see that he was 
wearing his badge.  It was also at Asilomar that I heard him speak about the founding of Mensa.<P>
This year, at the AG in St. Louis, Dr. Ware told me that he values our friendship, and that he enjoys the 
<A HREF = "http://www.rain.org/cm_sig.html">Creative Mischief SIG</A> newsletters that I send him 
(as a sort of honorary member).  He also asked how long we had known each other.  I noted that we had 
met at the San Francisco AG.  His response was something like, "Only that long?"  I was happy to know 
that he had forgotten about the badge incident.<P>

<TITLE>London Bridge</TITLE>
<H3>American Mensa Region 9 Public Service 
Project</H3>
<H1>Return London Bridge</H1>
In honor of the Mensa 50th Anniversary Celebration in London in 1996, we have decided to extend our 
goodwill by returning London Bridge to its proper and original location. As you probably know, London 
Bridge was bought and moved to Lake Havasu many years ago. It is an unnatural artifact in an unnatural 
lake in the middle of the desert in our very own region. It does not belong here and the local Native 
Americans never did like it. So we have decided to help give it back.<P>
If you plan on attending the 50th Anniversary Celebration, will you please help us out by carrying a stone 
or two with you on the plane to London? As long as there aren't too many of us on our various flights to 
London, our baggage allowance should cover two stones each. For our friends in other regions, we have 
arranged to ship stones to them to carry on their flights to London as well. If our attendance is as high as 
expected, we should be able to take the entire bridge with us.<P>
<H2>Leave no stone unreturned!</H2>
<H4><I>Sign up today for this Mensa Anniversary goodwill 
program.</I></H4>
<H5>Is London Bridge falling down again? No, the <A HREF =

<TITLE>Sushi -- Sashimi</TITLE>
<H1>Sashimi (Raw Seafood).</H1>
The important thing to remember about sashimi is that the fish should be saltwater fish, not freshwater 
fish.  (Freshwater fish may contain parasites that are killed by cooking.  Saltwater fish do not contain 
these parasites.)  I would not eat raw freshwater fish, but would not hesitate to eat raw saltwater fish.  
Several years ago, a friend of mine who worked for the FDA investigated a series of food poisoning cases 
in the L.A. area.  The common denominator was that each person had eaten in a sushi bar, and he further 
learned that each had eaten salmon.  He was able to trace the salmon to a specific lake in Alaska, where 
the salmon carried a parasite.  The parasite, which would have been destroyed by cooking, caused the 
illness.  So, I am a little leery of salmon.<P>
I have prepared sashimi for friends, selecting tuna, halibut and red snapper from a fresh fish market.  
Other popular fish for sashimi is yellowtail, mackerel (too fishy for me), albacore and the infamous fugu.  
Personally, I haven't had the fugu, which is the one you hear about that must be prepared exactly right or 
it is fatal.  The tuna and yellowtail are quite rich, but not at all fishy tasting.  The lighter fishes, such as 
halibut and red snapper, are almost bland.  Only the mackerel is fishy tasting, and that only slightly.  Just 
get the freshest fish available, from a fish market on the wharf, not from a supermarket.<P>
Fish for sashimi is usually sliced into pieces about 1 inch wide by 1-1/2 inches long by 1/4 inch thick.  A 
serving is four slices in a sushi bar, but at home you can indulge.<P>

Shakespeare's original theatre has been rebuilt and now plays are being performed in this Tudor 
setting.  This visit will last all day and include a tour of the building in the morning followed by a 
play in the afternoon.  A Shakespearian theatre has two classes of spectator, seated and standing.  
Seated are in the covered balconies around and above the stage similar to a conventional theatre.  
Standing allows spectators (or groundlings) to walk right up to the stage, but they are below the 
eyeline of the actors, and are exposed to the weather.  Whilst it will be an experience, do not buy a 
standing ticket unless you are certain of your ability to stand for two hours in the sunshine -- or the 
rain!<P>

<TITLE>Curtain</TITLE>
<H1>Pay No Attention to the Cat Behind the 
Shower Curtain</H1>
<H2>Assorted True Cat Stories</H2>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
I don't know what it is about cats and water. I had always heard that cats do not like water or 
getting wet, but several of the cats I have owned (or more properly, cats that have owned me) 
certainly prove otherwise.<P>
For several years before and during my junior high school days, I had a long-haired white cat that 
I had named Ruffles. It may have been because her hair was always so matted that it appeared she 
had ridges. Every summer we rented a cabin on Torch Lake in Michigan, near the town of the 
same name. (As an aside, it was also near the town of Norwood. When it came time to name the 
street my parents live on in Midland, since their house sits on a small hill I came up with the name 
Knollwood Court.)  Ruffles went to the lake with us each year and would even go down to the 
beach below the cabin with us. She would get thirsty and decide to get a drink of water from the 
lake. But rather than bend over and drink like a normal cat, she would actually wade out into the 
lake until it was deep enough to get a drink without bending over.<P>
Years ago, when I was married, my sister came to visit us and ended up buying me a kitten from 
The Wharf in Ventura. I named him Kearsarge, after a ghost of a town in the Upper Peninsula 
near Michigan Tech, although I do not recall why I did this. In the morning, Kearsarge would sit 
on the edge of the bathtub while I showered, playing with the drops of water hitting the shower 
curtain. Very early one morning I was showering to wake up, and struggling to do so. Half asleep, 
I dropped the bar of soap. As I bent over to pick it up, my butt brushed against the shower 
curtain. Kearsarge saw this as a nice big target and swatted me with claws bared. I let out such a 
blood-curdling scream that my wife actually got out of bed and came down to see if I was OK.<P>
Kearsarge also liked to get up on the counter and drink water from a paper Dixie cup. Well, that 
isn't completely true. I would set a cup of water in front of him and he would drink for a while. 
When I turned my back, he would bat the cup towards the edge of the counter. If I looked back at 
him, he would immediately resume drinking the water. If I turned my back too long, I would hear 
a splash as the cup hit the floor. Kearsarge would look at me nonchalantly, as if to say, "Gee, 
what happened?"<P>
One of my two current cats, Squeaky, likes to drink from running water faucets. He understands 
the word "hot" and actually obeys me when I tell him the water running is hot. He has managed to 
teach his twin brother, Buckaroo, how to drink water from the faucet, and I am concerned that 
they may yet figure out how to turn the faucet on one of these days. Squeaky will also sit on the 
edge of the bathtub between the shower curtain and liner by the faucet for up to half an hour in 
the morning. He patiently waits for me to finish shaving so I will turn on the hot water faucet for 
my shower. It's a long way from the water heater in the garage to the bathtub, so he has a lengthy 
opportunity to drink the water from the faucet, and reduce the waste. (However, I'm not sure the 
local water company would be interested in him as a spokescat for water conservation.) 
Fortunately, when the water warms up, he leaves. This is good because I still drop the bar of soap 
on occasion. And when I do so, I almost subconsciously look for cats behind the shower curtain 
before I bend over to pick it up.<P>

<H2>Mouse With Two Balls</H2>
<IMG ALT=""SRC ="wem_tbm.gif"></A><P>
<H4>(Side View)</H4>
<H3>Works On Any Surface!</H3>
For rough surfaces, use the larger rough soft ball.  The rough ball is located farther away from the 
heel of the hand for optimum pressure.  This ball works well on rough surfaces such as denim, 
suede, leather, even corduroy.  It even works on top of desktop clutter, so there is no need to 
clear a space for your mouse.<P>
For smooth surfaces, turn the mouse over and use the smaller smooth hard ball.  The smooth ball 
is located nearer the heel of the hand, for maximum pressure with minimum effort.  Use this side 
of the mouse with a conventional mouse pad, or use it directly on your desktop or other smooth 
surface.<P>
Three buttons top and bottom offer total compatibility with all software and mouse drivers.  A 
mercury switch inside the mouse automatically determines which side is in use and activates the 
appropriate buttons.<P>
<H3>Available Everywhere!</H3>

<H1>A Little History</H1>
<BODY>   Fifty years have come and gone since <A HREF = "http://www.silcom.com/sbarb/">Santa Barbara</A> was the center of the motion picture industry in California.  Few traces remain of that glittering era of pre-Hollywood make-believe, when as many as fourteen major production companies were simultaneously using Santa Barbaras mountains, beaches and suburbs as cinema backgrounds.<BR><BR>

Bronco Billy Anderson, the A of Essanay Productions, launched Santa Barbara as a movie-making town in 1910 when he filmed a Western in Mission Canyon, San Marcos Pass and what is now the San Roque district.<BR><BR>

Westerns and serials were the staples of Santa Barbaras movie diet, including such memorable films as Diamond in the Sky,  Winners of the West, and The Perils of Pauline  They were filmed in the foothills and in Montecito.<BR><BR>

<IMG  Align=Left SRC="flyastdl.gif">In 1913 a major studio  the largest of its kind in the world  was erected at the corner of State and West Mission Streets by the American Film Company.   The entire block extending north to Padre and west to Chapala was part of the Flying A lot, with horse stables and a Western cowtown street set occupying the State and Padre corner.
At Chapala and Mission Streets was a long stucco building which housed the Green Room where stars of the silent era, such as Mary Pickford, Wallace Reid and Mary Miles Minter studied their scenes, if not their lines. <br><BR>

The Flying A studio in Santa Barbara turned out several big-name producers.  Frank Borzage got his start here;   D. W. Griffiths puttees, reversed cap and megaphone were a familiar site around the lot.<BR><BR>

Producers found fat pickings in Montecito, where they could photograph English manor houses, Italian villas, Spanish haciendas, Roman baths, and almost any other kind of architecture against spectacular backgrounds of woods and mountains, usually without having to pay for the privilege.<BR><BR>

Keystone Comedy type one-reelers were shot in downtown Santa Barbara. Hope Ranch and the beaches were especially popular as movie backgrounds, but unfortunately a growing need for urban backgrounds made it necessary for the Flying A to send actors and technicians by chartered train or bus to Los Angeles to get big-city backgrounds.
This finally got too costly, so in 1918 the movies left Santa Barbara forever and moved to Hollywood  for which the gods that stand guardian to Santa Barbaras destiny can be devoutly thanked.<BR><BR>

The Flying A studio lasted for 20 years after the producers and the directors and the performers deserted Santa Barbara for Hollywood.  An ice cream parlor now stands at the corner which marked the spot where moviestruck hopefuls once waited for the director to shout :       <BR>

<H1>The Plans Today</H1>
Arleigh Adams, Flying A child actor and present owner/resident of the surviving studio buildings, just celebrated his 91st birthday, July 3, 1995.  During the passing decades Mr. Adams and his late mother have been caretakers of this unique, significant and irreplaceable part of Santa Barbaras artistic and entertainment history. 
<br><BR>

It is the intent, wish and desire of the <a href=mailto:sbfilm@rain.org>Santa Barbara Film 3/W</a> organizaton to establish an Imaginative Committee to explore the feasibility and possibility of bringing such a vision to fruition.  We owe it to the producers, directors, stars and entertainers that went before, and to the future generations of Santa Barbaras students of film history, residents, children and visitors.

Upon returning from Costa Rica with his Parents, Connor sat 
down with me the other day and informed me of his personal
preferences of the Place.

<BR><BR>
"Well, I would highly suggest taking a trip to Dominical
and Arnol Lakes.  They were very beautiful.  If you would
like to see a Volcano then I would recommend going to
La Fortuna.  I also quite liked Coco and if your gonna
go down there, if you get to Tamarindo, you should stay
at the Hotel Tamarindo Deara.  Oh Yeah, if you like to 
fish, I would highly recommend going to Nosara. "

<TITLE>How To Do Counters</TITLE>
<H2><H1>How To Do Counters</H1></H2>
<H3>by Mark S. Hutchenreuther</H3>
Revised 13 February, corrected the code snippet.<P>
Counters are very easy to implement IF your system is set up for them.  Counters are implemented as 
something called a "server-side include."  The person accessing your home page sees something like:<P>
You are the 97th person to access this page.<P>
If he or she looks at the source, all they see is exactly that, they do not see the actual source code that 
inserts the correct count into the expression.  I will explain how we do it here at RAIN, your system may 
be different.  I will also direct you to another interesting site with counters.<P>
<HR>
<H2>How We Do Counters At RAIN</H2>
On our Web server is a subdirectory called "httpd," which itself contains a subdirectory called "cgi-bin."  
Residing in the "cgi-bin" subdirectory is a PERL script file called "counterord," and another called simply 
"counter."  The one you are interested in is "counterord," since it is the one that figures out the correct 
"ordinal" number.  (Yes, "counter" figures out the correct "cardinal" number.)<P>
Whenever someone accesses your page, a snippet of inline code (the "server-side include") is executed.  
This code calls "counterord" and figures out how many people have accessed your page, expresses this as 
an ordinal number, and inserts it into your home page text.<P>
There are a number of ways of determining if your Web server has the script file in the "cgi-bin" 
subdirectory.  You can:<P>
<DL>
<DD>
Ask your webmaster personally or via e-mail<BR>
Do an "ls" of "cgi-bin" at the operating system prompt after you find it<BR>
Insert the code snippet in your home page and see if it works<P>
</DL>
If you do not have this neat program, ask your webmaster about providing it in the future.  Do not be 
surprised if he or she says no, there are some security issues with "server-side includes" as well as forms 
support.<P>
<HR>
<H2>The Server-Side Include</H2>
First of all, you need to insert a line of text in your home page, the one that will note the count of accesses.  
It should say something like:<P>
Welcome.  You are the CODE person to access my home page.<P>
The word CODE must be the following expression.  Note that this code snippet looks a little like an 
HTML HREF, and a little like a PERL command line:<P>
&lt!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/counterord"--&gt <P>
Note that you should use the greater-than and less-than symbols in your 
file, I have to use the ampersand equivalents here or the server will 
merely run the command, and you will never see it.<P>
And that's all there is to it, providing you have everything set up in "cgi-bin."<P>

<H2>Is Life Too Serious?</H2>
I think so, that's why I started the <A HREF = "http://www.rain.org/~hutch/cm_sig.html">Creative

Is your organization taking itself too seriously?  I can help.  I created the first five 
products for <A HREF = 
"http://www.comdex.com:8000/Online/events/cdxfall/index.html">COMDEX95</A> in Las Vegas,

I am also a member of the <A HREF = "http://www.asme.org/">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</A> and the <A HREF = 
"http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</A>, two organizations I feel 
are in need of a bit of humor.  Why not put me on your conference or convention 
schedule, where I can talk about a number of topics, including:<P>
Weird ElectroMechanics -- a lecture on modern electromechanical devices you may not 
have learned about in that Electrical Machinery class you took years ago.  A not-too-
technical look at stepper motors, gnat robots, silicon ants, micromachines, and shape 
memory alloys.<P>
Creative Mischief -- a lecture on various hoaxes I have perpetrated over the years, 
including those above.  If you are really desperate, I can dress up in my <A HREF =

<H2>Coming Soon!</H2>
The <I>Weird ElectroMechanics</I> newsletter.  A serious periodical that will help you 
keep up to date on the latest in weird electomechanical devices such as those I lecture on, 
as well as the not-so-weird devices that we now take for granted and have generally 
forgotten about.<P>

<TITLE>Letter M Elopes</TITLE>
<H1>Older M Elopes With Young Letter 
S</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
On the verge of his 50th birthday, the letter M has eloped with a letter S only 22 years old. The 
couple was wed in Las Vegas in the middle of December. The groom is the logo of a well-known 
international high-intelligence society. The bride is a strikingly beautiful model, often featured on 
the cover of magazines such as <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, including their annual swimsuit issue. A 
lucrative contract with the daily newspaper <I>USA Today</I> is also in the works.<P>
"We were really hurt by this," said his mother, the letter N. "I know he was dreading his fiftieth 
birthday, but I thought his recent facelift was enough to boost his spirits. I remember when I 
turned 50 and my husband's attentions were drifting. I got my serifs lifted and regained his 
attention."<P>
"Boy, did it ever. It straightened me right up," said his father, the letter I. "My wife had really let 
herself go. She drooped so much, she looked almost sans-serif. After the serif lift our sex life was 
like it was 50 years ago when we had M."<P>
"We hope they will be traditionalists and take the name of M &amp  S, but we are a bit worried," 
continued I.<P>
"M had been spending a lot of time with the couple down the street, B &amp  D, and I hope they 
were not a bad influence on him," added N. "I just hope some tabloid doesn't get a picture of them 
with her in front of him."<P>
"At least she is a nice Romanesque S, with a fine set of serifs of her own, and not one of those 
frumpy old English S's or those superficial calligraphy S's," noted I. "And he could have done 
much worse with one of those letter P sluts from the cover of <I>Playboy</I> or 
<I>Penthouse</I> magazines."<P>
"And I think they will make something of this union, unlike that same-sex R &amp  R couple up 
the street that sit around all day doing nothing," observed N.<P>
The couple is honeymooning in England and unavailable for comment. Repeated calls to the 
offices of the international high-intelligence society only reached a recorded message about testing 
and membership information.<P>

<TITLE>Institute of Weirdness</TITLE>
<H1>Institute of Weirdness</H1>
<H4>weird = fantastic, bizarre, eccentric, unconventional in 
behavior</H4>
This page was updated on 30 June 1996.<P>
The Institute of Weirdness is founded on the idea that "Weird is Wonderful."  It is being created now in 
San Luis Obispo County, California.  Initially, it will be located in the home of its founder, Mark 
Hutchenreuther, who lives in the south county community of Oceano.  The title of the Institute is tentative, but 
descriptive.  Its current address is a post office box assigned to an prospective entity called Weird 
Enterprises.<P>
Current activities include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Creative Mischief SIG
<LI>Weird ElectroMechanics
<LI>The Weird Singles Club
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>The Creative Mischief SIG</H2>
This established Special Interest Group of American Mensa was founded in July of 1992 at the Mensa 
Annual Gathering in San Francisco.  The SIG was founded to counter the belief that Mensa was taking 
itself far too seriously and needed to lighten up a bit.  The modus operendi of the CM SIG is to post signs 
at Mensa gatherings that are hoaxes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Added imaginary events, such as High Impact Aerobics which requires extensive protective gear and 
a signed waiver
<LI>Cancelled imaginary events, such as a party to toilet paper the adjacent hotel
<LI>Meetings of non-existent SIGs, such as The Evil Twin SIG
<LI>Preposterous business opportunities, such as raising Desert Hot Springs Pupfish (an endangered 
species) in a home hot tub
<LI>Fake pleas from the organizing committee, such as a request for volunteers to segregate the green 
M&amp Ms
<LI>Fake apologies from the organizing committee, such as a substitution of giant mutant chickens from 
the area around Three Mile Island for Thanksgiving turkeys
</UL>
Beginning with the Mensa Annual Gathering in Orlando in 1993, the SIG has also held some sort of silly 
parade.  It has now become an expectation at subsequent Annual Gatherings.<P>
The activities of the Creative Mischief SIG are documented on a separate <A HREF = 
"http://www.rain.org/~hutch/cm_sig.html">home page</A>.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Weird ElectroMechanics</H2>
Originally this was a series of lectures in a class on Electrical Machinery taught by the founder at Cal Poly 
in San Luis Obispo and subsequently at work at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Port Hueneme, CA.  
These lectures included such topics as stepper motors, linear induction motors, micromachinery, and 
shape memory alloys.  More recently, these topics have been presented in a condensed format at Mensa 
gatherings.  Current plans are to publish a periodic newsletter of this title, which is being test marketed.  
Topics include both state-of-the-art technologies and other technologies with growth potential, such 
as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Micromachinery including gnat robots
<LI>Shape memory alloys such as nitinol
<LI>Superconducting alloys and the Meissner Effect
<LI>Compounds exhibiting Piezoelectric properties
<LI>New applications for the Hall Effect
<LI>Stepper motors and robotics
<LI>Linear induction motors and devices
<LI>Other unusual motor types
</UL>
It is the founder's feeling that the older strange technologies will find new applications in the solution of 
problems dealing with the newer strange technologies.  For example, that superconductors may make 
micromachinery practical through the application of the Hall Effect.  Or that shape memory alloys may 
find an application as substrates for micromachinery or high-frequency integrated circuits.<P>
<HR>
<H2>The Weird Singles Club</H2>
The founder, who is single, has noted that singles clubs continue to proliferate and are getting 
increasingly specific.  There are specialty singles clubs for booklovers, science people, classical music 
listeners, and artists.  There are singles dining clubs, dance clubs, clubs for professionals, clubs for singles 
with children, and clubs for singles with degrees.  Many of these clubs, and the people in them, are a bit 
boring.  The really interesting people are considered "weird," hence the apparent need for the club.<P>
Unlike the proliferating singles clubs, the also-proliferating singles services are incredibly expensive.  A 
number of these are popping up all over, and actively soliciting new clients.  With annual fees in the 
thousands of dollars, it is no wonder the other singles clubs are proliferating, and singles ads are 
appearing in more and more media outlets.<P>
Whether the people in this proposed singles club are truly weird or merely eccentric, the need for the club 
is apparent.  The name of the club is preliminary, yet descriptive.  After upcoming market testing is 
completed, it could become the Creative Singles Club, or maybe even simply the Interesting Singles 
Club.<P>

<TITLE> The Erosians</TITLE>
<H1>The Erosians</H1>
<H4>From the Greek "Eros", not the effects of excess rainfall)</H4><P>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3><P>
Although originally considered to be a supplement to the Gideon movement which places bibles 
in motel/hotel rooms, the Erosians is developing into more of a countermovement to offset the 
gains of the Fundamentalists and the Meese Commission.  The organization is founded on the 
same basis as the Gideons, with the primary goal of placing sex manuals in each and every motel 
and hotel room in the nation.  The original inspiration for the organization came when bored 
travellers realized there was more than one drawer in their motel room, and therefore room for 
more than bibles, phone books and extra blankets.  Not content to merely provide travelling 
businesspeople, vacationing couples and honeymooners with suitable reference materials, the 
organization is expanding into the areas of research and development and education.<P>
The research and development effort is primarily a natural application of the belief in evolution 
and procreation rather than creationism.  Paramount in this belief is the acknowledgement of the 
sexual and sensual evolution of personkind from the Monkey Position to the Asian Basket Trick.  
Research is presently underway towards development and perfection of an Anti- Herpes/AIDS 
(AHA) Position.  Current theory suggests that a position can be developed that will maximize 
penetration of a properly sheathed penis in a properly lubricated vagina with absolutely no skin-
to-skin contact.  Research is centered on determining whether one of the currently known and 
documented positions can be suitably optimized or whether a new position will require 
development and testing.<P>
A byproduct of this research is the analysis of the numerous collections of known sexual 
positions from the Kama Sutra to the various "101 ways" books available from various sources.  
These collections are being analyzed for suspected duplication and will result in statistical 
determination of the actual number of possible sexual positions and a universal rating system for 
relative difficulty.  This will have great educational value and is expected to be the basis for the 
eventual publication of our own Sex Manual.  Whereas most manuals feature svelte young 
couples demonstrating the important sexual positions, our manual will feature normal people 
such as balding men with beer guts, women with love handles and their real hair, and people 
over 40 years old.  Some of these models are expected to be perceived as ugly, however, it is 
important that these people learn how to enjoy sex without the need for extreme darkness or 
paper bags.  Use of high and low technology toys and devices will also be explored and 
described as a means of sexual enhancement.<P>
Our organization also recognizes the importance of music to lovemaking.  In support of this, we 
expect to be marketing specially recorded cassettes and compact disks of suitable music.  While 
others have explored the allegedly sensual sounds of the oboe and guitar (separately, thank 
heavens), our research indicates that the organ is far more appropriate.  Rock music appears to 
result in maximum penetration, but is irritating to many people and lacks overall sensuality.  The 
influence of Bach on heavy metal rock music appears to be an excellent starting point in our 
research.  For sensuality, we are going back to the roots of this phenomenon and are 
investigating the recording of the sensual organ (music) of Bach.  Much of this music is familiar, 
due to its adaptation to religious hymns, and hence we are developing hymns without the clutter 
and confusion of lyrics.  This is expected to aid in the achievement of intense orgasms, which are 
frequently and appropriately described as truly religious experiences.<P>
In addition to the use of Bach, the role of Bacchus in erotica will also be a subject of extensive 
research and development and eventual education.  With the exception of Amaretto, hard spirits 
and beer are considered less appropriate than wine.  In particular, the various varieties of "blush" 
wines would seem most appropriate.  Looking at the dismal results of the noble efforts of the 
wine culture to convince the general public that red wine goes with meat and white with fish, we 
realize we have a major effort confronting us.<P>

<TITLE> RG Addiction</TITLE>
<H1>RG Addiction</H1><P>
<H3>by Mark (Hutch) Hutchenreuther</H3>
<H5>(This was originally written in March 1991.  You can probably substitute 
"seminar" or "SciFi Con" for "RG".)</H5>
I had not attended an RG until last summer.  I attended the AG for the first time, then my first 
RG.  Now that I have attended my third RG, I am addicted.  It's easy to do, but it may be some 
time before you recognize the symptoms.  These are the warning signs of RG Addiction:<P>
<OL>
<LI>You are suddenly very thirsty, so you head for the nearest bathtub, which you expect to be filled with ice and 
sodas.
<LI>You lose interest in cooking.  At the beginning of each week, you get a large party tray from a deli and several 
bags of chips.  You graze on this all week long.
<LI>You buy inexpensive wine in a cardboard box.  You drink this from a plastic cup, on which you have written 
your name with a felt-tipped pen.
<LI>You wear a name tag and only associate with other people wearing name tags.  When guests visit, you fill out 
a name tag for them to wear also.
<LI>Sometimes, after midnight, you fill your bathtub with very hot water and sit in it in the dark in your bathing 
suit, sipping on a glass of wine.
<LI>In the evening, you watch nature specials on The Discovery Channel.  At the end of the show, you raise your 
hand to ask a question.
<LI>You rename the rooms of your house with a common theme, like meeting rooms.  In extreme cases, you 
assign three-digit numbers to the rooms and carry a key to your bedroom.  If you live in a two-story house, the 
upstairs rooms start with "2".
<LI>You find yourself discussing your work, hobby, latest book read, or latest movie seen with your cat, dog, 
parrot, or other pet.
<LI>You number the spaces in your garage, driveway, and street.  Whenever you park your car, you write the 
space number on a slip of paper so you won't forget where you parked.
<LI>Breakfast consists of stale doughnuts, gooey danish rolls and all the coffee you can get your hands on.
<LI>You read through your collection of business cards, trying to recall what you discussed with these people, and 
at which RG.
<LI>You play Scrabble all by yourself.  Sometimes you play two or more hands at once.
<LI>You have your astrological chart done, and interpreted, so that you are prepared in case anyone asks about 
your sign.
<LI>You take the Myers-Briggs test, so you know what type you are.
<LI>You notice that your wardrobe consists primarily of souvenier T-shirts.
<LI>You eagerly read your mail, hoping to find an announcement of yet another RG!
</OL>

<TITLE>So You Want to Open a Sushi Bar</TITLE>
<H1>So You Want to Open a Sushi 
Bar</H1>
One of the things that happens when you create a web page like this is that you become a defacto expert 
on the topic. I do not own a sushi bar, nor am I a professional sushi chef. I am merely someone who 
enjoys cooking, enjoys sushi, and enjoys rolling my own sushi at home for friends and for parties.<P>
However, I still get a lot of e-mail from visitors with some very interesting questions and requests. Among 
the more interesting are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Frequent requests for help in finding a sushi chef for a sushi bar. I still don't know where to begin to 
look, other than advertising at an Asian market or in Asian newspapers.
<LI>A request for advice for opening a chain of sushi bars in the Ukraine.
<LI>A request for information on the prevalance of fishermen eating raw bass and sunfish in the southern 
part of the USA. This did not seem likely to me, since they are usually pretty heavily breaded and fried. 
The requestor is studying the effects of parasites in these fish and their effect on humans. If you have 
information on this, please contact the <A HREF = "mailto:pbio8962@selu.edu">researcher</A> directly.
<LI>A request for an interview for a grocery trade magazine about sushi in grocery stores. More and more 
supermarkets in Southern California are offering individual pre-made servings of sushi, usually California 
rolls, vegetable rolls, and other common rolls. I have bought these myself, and have watched the roving 
sushi chef making them in the morning (thought of offering my services for this myself) but have no idea 
how well they are selling. If you have information on this, please contact the <A HREF = 
"mailto:Plister@aol.com">journalist</A> directly.

<TITLE> Mark's Tree Farm</TITLE>
<H1>A Fake Advertisement</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
<HR>
<H2>MARK'S DRIVE-THROUGH CHRISTMAS TREE FARMS</H2><P>
<H2>FOR FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE ENTHUSIASTS</H2><P>
<H3>CUT YOUR OWN TREE, WITHOUT LEAVING THE DISCOMFORT OF YOUR OFF-ROAD 
4X4 VEHICLE!</H3><P>
<H4>Here are the answers to commonly asked questions:</H4><P>
<DL>
<B>Q:  Do I need a 4x4 vehicle?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Yes, the fields are quite muddy at this time of the year here at Mark's Tree 
Farms.</I><P>
<B>Q:  Can I pick out my tree?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Absolutely!  Just drive around the field until you spot the tree that's right for 
you.</I><P>
<B>Q:  How do I cut my tree?</B><BR>
<I>A:  A running start is best.  Just back up a bit, pick a low gear, and head for 
your tree.  The sharper your bumper or bumper guard, the cleaner the cut.</I><P>
<B>Q:  How do I carry my tree home?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Easy!  Your tree will be imbedded in your grill.  There is no need for rope or 
straps.  You will carry your tree home in it's natural upright position!  When you 
get home, just pry it off.</I><P>
<B>Q:  Aren't the trees damaged on the one side?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Certainly, but consider the advantages.  With one side flattened, the tree can 
be placed close to the wall of your small living room.  And you will only have to 
decorate three sides of the tree!</I><P>
<B>Q:  What size are the trees?</B><BR>
<I>A:  The average tree is 8 feet tall, and the average 4x4 bumper height is 2.5 
feet.  So the average tree will be 5.5 feet tall.</I><P>
<B>Q.  What do you charge for your trees?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Simple!  We charge one low price of $55 for any tree.  That's an average of 
only $10 per foot!  And where else can you get such a rush from clipping off your 
own tree?</I><P>
<B>Q:  How do I pay for my tree?</B><BR>
<I>A:  Just drive up to our drive-through check-out!</I><P>

<TITLE> Files Listing</TITLE>
<H1> Listing of Available Files</H1>
Updated on 30 June 1996, added some, deleted many others.<P>
All files are in Rich Text Format and were created by saving the original Word for Windows 2.0/6.0 documents in this format.  Most Mac software and much Windows software understands this format, as does Interleaf on a Sun workstation.  You should be able to load and view these files from within Netscape or Mosaic, then save them onto your local disk.<P>
I have found a <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.bio.indiana.edu/util/dclap/apps/rtfviewer/">site</A> that carries RTF viewers for Windows, Mac and Sparcs.  I did try the Windows viewer myself, and it appears that it only handles older RTF specifications.  It generally shows the text, but also shows some garbage.  But the price is right.<P>
An older version of Adobe Acrobat Reader understood RTF, but the newer one does not.  Still, you may be able to configure one of your current programs as an RTF viewer within your browser.  For example, you could have Netscape launch Word for Windows to view (and print or save) the files, and other word processors and desktop publishers may be able to do the same.<P>

<TITLE>Why I Speak at Mensa Gatherings</TITLE>
<H1>Why I Speak at Mensa Gatherings</H1>
<H3>by Mark (Hutch) Hutchenreuther</H3>
In March of 1992, I hauled 50 pounds of cheap red clay back to the St. Louis Regional Gathering 
for a clay workshop.  One of the Committee members had asked if I wanted to do another 
program at their RG that year.  I had thought for a moment about what I could do.  On a whim, I 
decided to do the clay workshop, wherein participants could make "genuine fake pre-Columbian 
Native-American artifacts" in honor of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' alleged discovery of 
America.  They bought it.<P>
I had never given a clay workshop before, and little did I know that I would do this many times 
again at other RGs.  It was not that I was a stranger to clay, I had actually taken five semesters of 
ceramics at Ventura Community College, earning a 4.0 GPA from a truly excellent teacher.  She 
made us work our tails off, but she also made it fun.  She constantly encouraged us and pushed us 
to excel.  I am related to the Hutschenreuther china company in Bavaria, so ceramics is in my 
blood.<P>
I gave a short lecture with slides of some appropriate antiquities, the ones we would be creating 
genuine fake reproductions of.  And then I turned them loose with clumps of clay, and a couple of 
rudimentary tools -- bamboo skewers and Popsicle sticks.  I then quickly discovered what I 
should have known in the first place, that Mensans are very creative and talented.  It was amazing 
what they were making that day with so little instruction.<P>
Some wanted to know if they could get their treasures fired.  Others wanted to know where to 
take more "real" classes.  One drove around St. Louis and bought a 25-pound bag of clay to take 
home with her, in case she could not find any in Iowa.<P>
Since then, I have run into some of my students, who have thanked me for  doing the workshop 
and brought me up do date on their progress.  A couple have gone back to school to study 
ceramics.  Recently at HalloweeM in Chicago, one of them showed me her clay "god" she made 
back in the original workshop.  She had arranged for a friend of hers to fire the figurine, which 
she successfully did.  I cannot describe how proud she was of her work, and how proud I was of 
her.<P>
Some of you are teachers and know the feeling you get when you have actually reached one of 
your students.  That is the feeling I felt that weekend in Chicago, and have felt over and over 
again at other gatherings.  When Donna Woolums and I did our presentations at the NEAG in 
Cambridge, after each session we were surrounded by attendees thanking us for doing that session 
and reveling in their newly acquired knowledge.  We had taught, and they had learned.<P>
Whether you are a teacher or not, you may recognize this feeling as love.  Pure and simple love.  
You may have been a student like these, and impressed one of your teachers once too.  And now 
it is your turn to be the teacher.<P>
You have some skill or knowledge to pass on to others.  And you simply MUST do it.  It may be 
that you can give a clay workshop at RGs in your region, and I hope you will.  Or your topic may 
simply entertain, and that isn't bad either.  There is a similar feeling when you have reached your 
audience as an entertainer.<P>
I realized about a year ago that I had a wonderful definition for a Mensa gathering:  A Mensa 
gathering is an opportunity for people with a need to teach to get together with people with a 
desire to learn.  Give it some thought.  Then do it.  RG and AG Program Chairs are waiting by 
their phones for you to call and volunteer your workshop or talk.  And the attendees will come to 
your talk or workshop to learn about what it is you have to teach.<P>

<TITLE>Hutch's To Do List</TITLE>
<H1>Hutch's List of Stuff To Do, Now That 
He's Retired</H1>
I finally got moved up to San Luis Obispo County, to the small south-county community of Oceano, part of the Five Cities. That puts me in between CalPoly and Cuesta College to the north, and Hancock College to the south. Part-time teaching is my goal.<P>
And then there is my dream of starting my very own <A HREF = "institut.html">Institute</A> and doing some lectures and seminars.  I would prefer to teach these at a suitable site in the Lake Tahoe area in the winter months.<P>
I also have time to do more <A HREF = "arts.html">painting and ceramics</A>.  Now I will have the space for my own kiln, and the time to use it.  I have been painting wine bottles, like Magritte, and showing others how to do it at Mensa gatherings.  That could evolve into a community services class at Cuesta or Hancock, or through my aforementioned Institute.<P>
I do plan on publishing a couple of newsletters, one on <A HREF = "weird_em.html">Weird 
ElectroMechanics</A>, and another on <A HREF = "cm_sig.html">Creative Mischief</A>.  The latter 
will basically be a "commercial" version of the Creative Mischief SIG newsletter, with more generic jokes 
aimed at the larger world outside of Mensa.<P>
I have ideas for two screenplays, one virtually completed.  That is the surrealistic western where everyone 
rides bicycles rather than horses and the train that is robbed is one of those little trains you see in a zoo.  
The other is called "Fu Man Aruminum," and is about an oriental homeless person with a speech problem 
that stakes a claim to certain highways for their wealth of aluminum cans.<P>
And so on.<P>

<TITLE> Check Approval</TITLE>
<H1>Check Approval Procedures</H1><P>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
All employees of ********** must follow these procedures to the letter.  If for any reason you 
are unable to comply with any of these procedures, you must call the Manager on duty to assist 
you in approving the check.  ********** has been burned by bad checks too often in the past,

<h3>City Water Quality Surpasses Standards</h3>

The results of more than 2,000 water-quality tests taken throughout the year indicate that the City drinking water not only meets but surpasses federal and state standards for quality. The high quality of City water is primarily the result of three factors: First, the majority of City water originates from 420 square miles of pristine and protected Santa Ynez Watershed. Second, the water is thoroughly treated at the Citys Cater Water Treatment Plant. The third factor involves quality assurance/quality control. Monitoring of the water is conducted 365 days per year by skilled water quality specialists. A summary of the test results is contained in the Citys Annual Water Quality Report, 1993 Edition, which can be obtained by calling the Cater Water Treatment Plant Staff at 687-5361.<p>

If you have questions about the quality of the water in your home or business, we can schedule an assessment visit. Our goal is to continue to provide the best water possible to the citizens of Santa Barbara. <p>
<h3>Block Pride</h3>
Take part in keeping Santa Barbara a beautiful paradise for all of us by joining  BLOCK PRIDE, LOOKING GOOD SANTA BARBARA.  Volunteer to maintain a block of your choice, cleaning up trash and graffiti in the public right of way.  Public Works will supply garbage bags, orange safety vests, graffiti abatement supplies and six T-shirts identifying your group or sponsor. Call 564-5587 to sign up today! <p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
The Transportation and Parking Division provides many helpful options to make commuting more pleasant:<p>

<h3>Commuter Parking Lots</h3>
There are two commuter parking lots offering low-cost parking for downtown employees, with free commuter shuttle service to drop you near your work. Call Downtown Parking at<i> 966-9368</i> for monthly parking rates and shuttle information.<p>

<h3>Free Bike Maps</h3>
Bicycle commuters can get Santa Barbara bike-lane maps by calling 963-SAVE.  The City has installed bike racks in each City parking lot to give bicyclists a convenient place to "park" in the downtown area, too!  <p>

<h3>Downtown-Waterfront Shuttle</h3>
The Downtown-Waterfront Shuttle runs from 10 a.m.  <br>
6 p.m. on State Street (from Sola Street to the Dolphin Fountain) every 15 minutes, and along Cabrillo Boulevard every 30 minutes. Still a <br>
bargain for 25 cents.<hr>

<h2>Scared Safe</h2>

 The Santa Barbara Police Department  has developed a new safety-awareness program and would like to extend an invitation to all to attend a night of Scared Safe.
<br>
Scared Safe is a personal- safety seminar that is presented in a workshop format. Participants will have the opportunity to be challenged in controlled situational settings that will simulate various threatening and undesirable activities that may occur in our daily lives.<br>

Through education, this program will help  participants build the confidence to take control and respond quickly and effectively to undesirable events should they take place. By participating in this valuable program, participants will be taking a step forward in preventing crime and learning how to create a safer environment. <p>

<h2>Tentative dates for upcoming programs are listed below:<br></h2>

<h3>January 19<p>

February 21  physically challenged<p>

March 16<p>

May 17  Students (15-18 yrs.)<p>

June 1  Spanish<p>

August 17<p>

September 28<p></h3>

Admission is free. Enrollment is limited.<br> 
For information, <i>call 897-2320</i><hr>
<h2>Citizen Police Academy </h2>
This successful program is for citizens to  become familiar with their police department, and at the same time, learn a great deal about how the department functions.  Participants meet on Thursdays, 6-9 p.m., in the Police Department's Briefing Room and are given an overview of every angle of the department.  The classes cover the 911 system, traffic, City beats, crime analysis, detective, homicide, gang, K-9 unit, ride a-longs, weapons demonstrations, S.W.A.T., hostage negotiation, even budget information. This free, 12-week program is for any adult interested in finding out more about the Santa Barbara Police Department and its 139 officers.  <br>

The Santa Barbara Citizen Police Academy is a model program which other city governments are implementing in their communities.  Twenty-five students per session are admitted.  The next session starts Feb. 2.  For an application and more information, please call 897-2320. <hr>
<h2>Neighborhood Watch</h2> 
Neighborhood Watch is a crime-prevention program that enlists the active participation of citizens in cooperation with law enforcement to reduce crime in their communities.  By forming Neighborhood Watch programs, citizens learn to recognize and report suspicious activities in their neighborhoods.  They also learn how to implement crime-prevention techniques that will be useful in fighting crime before it begins.  There are currently over 1,000 Neighborhood Watch members involved in fighting crime in Santa Barbara.  If you would like some more information or wish to set up a Neighborhood Watch program in your area, call Officer Tom Rigali or Orit Rayter in Community Relations at 897-2320.  <hr>
<h2>D.A.R.E.</h2>
The Drug Abuse Resistance Education program has taught thousands of Santa Barbara youth how to avoid drugs.  This intensive program brings police officers to the classrooms of local public and private schools one day a week for a full semester.  Students who graduate from the program are treated to a graduation ceremony involving their parents, the department, teachers and more.  By reaching out to 5th and 6th grade students in the area, the Police Department is taking the first step to teach children how to say "NO" to drugs.  <hr><ul>

Dear Friends,<p>

As we begin a new year, it is my pleasure on behalf of the Parks and Recreation Commission and Department staff to provide you with this 1995 Winter/Spring program booklet.<p>

In this issue, you will find a survey (page 24) which I encourage you to complete and return to the department. By doing so, you will be eligible to win a $100 gift certificate for taking a few minutes to respond and drop it in the mail. There is also opportunity to make suggestions for improving City parks, recreation and community services. Please let us hear from you as your comments and suggestions are important to us.
<p>
We hope that you will take time this year to discover or rediscover the value and benefits of the many recreation program offerings and diversified parks that are available on a year-round basis to the residents of Santa Barbara.
<p>
Sincerely, 

<p><p><p>

<body><H4>Interested in how they get those animals ready to put into exhibits?  Wondered how they got that Blue Whale
 skeleton from the beach to the front of the Museum?  Wished you knew what to do with the small bird that just
 flew into your window?  These are all subjects handled by the people who work in the Vertebrate Zoology
 Department, one of the four departments of the Collections and Research Division here at the Museum.<br><p>

Staff members specialize in working with birds, as well as terrestrial and marine mammals.
We accept animals found by Museum friends and remove stranded animals from local beaches.  After preparation
they are integrated into our research collection, which houses over 40,000 specimens including
mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, fish and eggs.  Aside from preparing specimens our department oversees
 the animals in the exhibits, answers public queries, helps scientists, students, and the private sector utilize
our collection for research, and conducts both contracted and personal research. </H4></body>

<TITLE>Mensans and Their Obsessions</TITLE>
<H1>Mensans and Their Obsessions</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
At the joint Los Angeles and Channel Islands RG in February, Carol Young and I did a session on 
Obsessive/Compulsive Confessions.  Each person who reveals their obsessive or compulsive behavior gets 
a certificate suitable for framing.  It was SRO and so much fun that it warrants a repeat whenever we get 
the chance.  The first chance came at Asilomar, where I did it with Donna Woolums.  Some of the same 
people attended, but the confessions were different.<P>
First, a disclaimer.  Medical advice is not given at these sessions, but we do preface each session with 
some basic information.  Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder is exactly that, a disorder.  It is treatable, often 
with medication.  Our object was NOT to make fun of anyone suffering from this disorder, we only 
wanted to share our own obsessive/compulsive secrets.<P>
There are a few that we are all familiar with, like toilet paper.  An overwhelming majority of Mensans are 
"over" people.  Some of us are sufficiently obsessive about this to have actually changed the paper in 
homes we visit.<P>
And then there are stairs.  Many of us count the steps as we go up or down.  (It might have changed last 
night...)  No one seemed to be stressed out by escalators, with their indeterminate number of steps, but 
nearly everyone who gets in an elevator must press the appropriate button, even if everyone else has 
already pressed it.<P>
At least two of us share a problem with sliced bread.  We simply MUST use two consecutive slices of 
bread to make a sandwich, otherwise the sides don't match.  One person has to sort the jelly packages by 
flavor when he eats breakfast at a restaurant.  No one mentioned putting the sugar packages in order by 
type, but I am sure someone does this.<P>
Several of us are stressed out by waffles.  We have to have equal amounts of syrup in each pocket of the 
waffle, and have to cut the waffles into equal sized pieces.  Round waffles are especially stressful.<P>
One person must sort his French fries by length before he eats them.  I don't recall if he started with the 
shortest or the longest.  I also recently discovered that a business acquaintance puts black pepper on his 
fries.  That isn't obsessive/compulsive, that's just plain weird.<P>
And then there are M and M candies.  We learned that several people have specific ways of sorting the 
candies and eating them.  Sorting them by color was a common obsession, but then it gets complicated.  
Some prefer to eat different colors until they have the same number of each color.  Then they eat one of 
each color until they are gone.  Others just eat them in order until they are gone.  So, sort first, then argue 
about whether to eat the odd ones first or last.<P>
When it comes to eating food, there are a number of techniques we employ.  Some eat a bite of each thing 
on the plate or plates, in order, until it is gone.  Others eat all of one thing, then move to the next thing.  
Someone else could not eat and drink at the same time, she had to eat all her food first, then she finished 
her beverage.<P>
We learned of someone who only wears blue clothing.  And others who button their shirts only from the 
bottom, or only from the top.  Some of us count the hangers before we do laundry, to make sure they equal 
the number of shirts.<P>
One person saves the ends of the thread she cuts off.  Another saves the pieces of material she trims off, 
no matter how small.  Each has several boxes of this in her garage, and neither knows why she does 
it.<P>
I have a problem with rolls of stamps.  If you put them in the dispenser, when you pull one off with your 
right hand, it is upside down.  They are apparently made for left-handers.  When I told a friend that I have 
to reroll my stamps so they dispense properly, he noted that all I had to do was turn the envelopes upside-
down, so the stamps would be right-side-up.  Obviously, he just doesn't understand.<P>
Oh and getting back to food, one person has to turn all the upside-down cakes upside-down in the bakery 
section of the supermarket where she shops.  I don't think anyone else did this, but many thought it was a 
good idea.<P>
By now you have probably thought of a few things that you do.  Maybe you will be able to attend one of 
our sessions and tell all.  If not, you might consider conducting one of these sessions yourself.  I will 
guarantee that you will be rolling on the floor with laughter.<P>

<TITLE>Genealogy Stuff</TITLE>
<H1>Mark S. Hutchenreuther -- 
Genealogy</H1>
Revised 30 June 1996 to put ancestry stories on linked individual pages.<P>
I have my <A HREF="hutch.ged">current</A> research available as a GEDCOM 
file, created with Parsons Technology's Family Origins for Windows.<P>
For a while, I ran the Mensa Genealogy SIG.  The irony is that I found I had no time for my own 
genealogy work.  So I passed it on to a new coordinator, and did some more work of my own.  I have done 
an Ahnentafel, but it is too large (and a bit boring) to include here.  Instead, I will show my first few 
generations:<P>
<Pre>
			Oscar HUTSCHENREUTHER (b. 5 Jul 1851, Schney, Bavaria)
		Emil Wilhelm HUTCHENREUTHER (b. 26 Apr 1887, d. Apr 1976)
			Elizabeth RAUSCHERT (b. 27 Apr 1856, d. 10 Jun 1926)
	Charles Oscar HUTCHENREUTHER (b. 16 Jun 1916)
			Charles Wesley DAYTON (b. 3 Apr 1851, d. 17 Jul 1934)
		Lulu May DAYTON (b. 11 Jul 1889, d. Mar 1977)
			Frances Elizabeth MILLIMAN ( b. 1 Dec 1853, d. 8 Feb 1900)
Mark Scott HUTCHENREUTHER (b. 9 Mar 1948)
			Charles HAWKINS (b. 1850, d. 1934)
		Charles P. HAWKINS (b. 22 Nov 1890, d. Oct 1981)
			Edith M. PICARD (b. 22 Nov 1873, d. 5 Jan 1962)
	Harriet Ann HAWKINS (b. 30 Apr 1922)
			John Christian SCHNELL (b. 29 Feb 1850, d. 5 May 1900)
		Kathryn Julia SCHNELL (b. 1895, d. 1966)
			Julia BOGAN (d. 12 May 1906)
</Pre>
I know the most about my DAYTON line.  My aunt Fran gave me a copy of the Ancestry of Daniel Humphrey DAYTON, which alludes to the original <A HREF = "ralph.html">Ralph</A> DAYTON who first came to America.  Her paper was primarily the Descendants of Daniel Humphrey DAYTON, as excerpted from Descendants of Michael Dayton, by Lewis Scott Dayton.<P>
I got further information from Nancy DAYTON, whom I met through the Mensa Singles Network.  She had some papers that described the DAYTON family back through <A HREF = "robert.html">Robert</A> de DEIGHTON, the truly original DAYTON.<P>
I also now own my very own copy of The Early Daytons and Descendants of Henry, Jr., by Donald Lines Jacobus and Arthur Bliss Dayton.<P>
I have also taken some information that came from my grandfather, Emil, and added some information I have learned from researching the <A HREF = "oscar.html">Hutschenreuther</A> line and created a separate page for this.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.rain.org/~hutch/index.html#ToMap">Go back to my 
weird map</A>.<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.rain.org/~hutch/index.html#FromGenealogy">Go back to my 
home page</A>.<P> Go to the <A HREF =

					<H4>Have you ever wondered about an unusual animal you uncovered at the beach, or along a hiking trail in the back country?  The Department of Invertebrate Zoology is your local resource to answer questions on "spineless creatures," be they worms in your backyard, shells from the beach, or sea anemones from the deep sea.
	<p>An incredibly diverse collection of over 2 million invertebrate specimens is housed and maintained in the department.  The collection is used much like a library by researchers and students from around the world.  Voucher specimens from environmental studies are maintained to lend continual credibility to local surveys and publications.
</blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
	<p>Active research is an ongoing mission of the department, with three staff members describing new species in the region.  Human impacts on the global environment, with particular attention to endangered species, are a focus of departmental research.

Where can you touch a live seastar, see live plankton, hatch grunion fish eggs, create your
own sea art and learn about field trips to see whales, all in one day?  At the Sea Center, the
 Marine Sanctuary visitor's center located on historic Stearns Wharf!
<P>

The Center, known as the "window on the Channel" and a cooperative project of the Sanctuary
and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, has a full schedule of daily programs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The Sea Center features presentations that are designed to kindle a desire for visitors to go
 out into the real world of the Santa Barbara Channel, and specifically, the waters of the Sanctuary,
and experience the blow of a blue whale, see the beauty of the kelp forest and touch the spines of a
sea urchin.

<P>
Through live interaction, our participants will see that they are connected to a wonderful system that
depends on mutual support to persist.  They will also become educated about the unique qualities
and the importance of our Sanctuary as a biosphere reserve.
<P>

In addition the Sea Center acts as a venue for a full slate of presentations, seven days a week
given by staff marine biologists, Museum Docents, Whale Corps members and select college and
high school interns working as interpreters.  Shows will be object based, include live specimens
when possible and will be supported by props and graphics to illustrate concepts.

<title>Making a Difference</title><img align=bottom src="http://www.rain.org/~kmw/city/prlogo.gif"><h1>Making a Difference</h1>
<h3>Looking Good Santa Barbara</h3>
Barbara Committee is the local affiliate of Keep America Beautiful, Inc. It is a volunteer organization dedicated to beautifying our community, eliminating litter and graffiti-defacement, and educating citizens of all ages about ways to "reduce, reuse and recycle."  
<br>
Local residents are encouraged to participate in many different ways.  You can help at a beach or park cleanup day, or join the Graffiti Task Force.  You might want to become a member of the Friends of the Santa Barbara Depot, help the Education Project Team write curricula or visit classrooms with Keep America Beautiful, Inc. materials.  If you are interested, please call the Committee Coordinator, Linda Clough, at 969-2920.
<p>
<h3>Graffiti Hotline</h3> 
If you see graffiti in your neighborhood, near your business or on public property, please notify Looking Good Santa Barbara's Graffiti Busters at 897-2513 and a crew will be sent out for removal.  John Schoof, Street Maintenance Manager, oversees this program.  For more information,<i> call 963-0611, ext. 5412.  </i><p>
<h3>Renovation of Los Banos Pool Phase I</h3>
The projected start date for Phase I is Fall/Winter 1995. This phase will include renovation of the pool liner, circulation lines, gutter system, decking and disabled access into the pool. Friends of Los Baos del Mar Pool raised $183,000 toward the project and the City (which includes the Redevelopment Agency) added $367,000 to fund the $550,000 total cost. It will take approximately four months to complete. Funds for Phase II (locker-room restoration) are currently being solicited and will require approximately $415,000. <i>Contact Cheri Savage at 969-9389</i> for more information.<p>
This active committee is comprised of local parents and volunteers who wish to provide accessible play equipment at City parks for children of all abilities. Recently, the committee worked with Department staff to install accessible play equipment at Oak Park.<p>
<h3>Access to Play</h3>
This active committee is comprised of local parents and volunteers who wish to provide accessible play equipment at City parks for children of all abilities. Recently, the committee worked with Department staff to install accessible play equipment at Oak Park.<br>Currently, Access to Play is sponsoring a tile project to fund the purchase of the equipment. Personalized tiles will be sold throughout the year, fired and displayed on tile walls at several City parks.<br> 
Please<i> call Catherine Zitzer at 897-2505</i> for more information if you wish to participate.<p>
<h3>Playgrounds for Children: Update</h3>
The Playgrounds for Children Project has funded the replacement of City park play equipment at Oak, Bohnett, Shoreline and Escondido parks and Harding Elementary School. The replacement schedules will continue in 1995 to include MacKenzie, Stevens, Sunflower, Willowglen, plus new playgrounds for Wentworth Park and the Westside Center. 
<br>
Volunteers are needed to assist at each construction site. 
<i>Please call 564-5462</i> to sign-up!<p>
<h3>A Walk Through ORPET PARK</h3>
High on the hillside overlooking the glistening harbor, one of the Citys most popular passive parks invites visitors to view an exotic collection of horticultural displays as they enjoy a picnic lunch.
<br>
Rare specimens, planted in the 1930s, plus a wonderful collection of commemorative plaques, are located throughout lower and upper Orpet Park, which is split by Alameda Padre Serra at the parks western edge.
<br>
I remember enjoying this spot as a child, says Jeff Cope, the Parks and Recreation Departments Assistant Director. What a great place to see the entire City! You feel like youre on top of the world when you visit Orpet Park.
<br>
In 1913, the City Council reserved the land (originally called Hillside Park). Later, in 1921, Park Superintendent E.O. Orpet began to establish the park as a horticultural showplace. With help from the Riviera Company, irrigation water was manually turned on and off to establish new plantings. 
<br>
In 1936, the City Park Commission named the park Batchelder Park and then changed the name in 1963 to what its currently called, Orpet Park in honor of the Superintendent.<br>

Today, a group called the Friends of Orpet Park is forming to provide community input for park upgrades. The public is invited to call with comments, suggestions or to express an interest in joining this group. <i>Call 564-5433</i>, weekdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.<p>
<h3>Fuel Vegetation Management Plan</h3><br>
The second-year implementation of vegetation-management work in the undeveloped park sites of Parma, Honda Valley, Skofield and Rattlesnake Canyon will begin in January and be completed by March 1. This work will be accomplished by contracting for services with two or more local tree-service companies and the California Conservation Corps. All work performed will be as prescribed in the City Five Year Vegetative Fuels Management Plan adopted by the City Council in 1992.<p>
<h3>PARC Foundation Named Gift Opportunities</h3>
<br>
The Parks and Recreation Community Foundation is now making    available opportunities for individuals, families and organizations to purchase park trees and benches to commemorate special occasions such as the birth of a child, an anniversary, birthday, retirement or in memorial for a loved one. Each named gift will include an engraved brass plaque with an inscription that acknowledges the purpose of the gift and contributor.<p>
<pre>Selected gift opportunities include:
	New Tree Placement	$250
	Mature Tree		$500
	Park Bench		$500</pre>
<br>
Contributions for named gifts (excluding cost to place gifts) will be used for park and recreation facility improvements. By making a named gift, you will be supporting the Parks and Recreation system while at the same time recognizing someone important to you. Take this opportunity today!
<br>
PARC is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit foundation, #95-6000-787, and all 
contributions are tax deductible. For information on named gift opportunities regarding available park sites, placement time schedules and placing an order, please <i>call 564-5433</i> any weekday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.<p><ul>

<title>One Bowl Bread</title>
</head>
<body>
<h5>
 <p>This recipe, adapted from the Los Angeles Times Home Magazine by Elizabeth Hvolboll, has been passed on to many of her friends.  It has been served at home and has been used for Girl Scout cooking projects and numerous church suppers.  For a bread and soup meal, plan for about seven people per loaf. </p> 
Ingredients for two loaves:</p><br>
6 to 7 cups flour<br>
1/2 cup sugar<br> 
2 tsp salt<br> 
1 to 2 packages  rapid rise yeast<br>
3 to 4 tablespoons softened butter or margarine  (1/2 cube)<br>
2-1/4 cups very hot tap water<br> 
1 egg at room temperature<br><br>
<br>
Directions: Thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and dry yeast in a large bowl.  Add softened margarine.  Gradually add very hot water and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl now and then.  Add Egg and 1 cup or more of the flour to make a thick batter.  Beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl now and then.  Stir in enough more flour to make a soft dough.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.  Divide into 2 equal portions and shape into form wanted.  Place on greased pans.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.<br>
Punch down dough, turn out onto floured surface, cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes.  Divide into 2 equal portions and shape into form wanted.  Place on greased pans.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.<br>
Bake loaves 30 to 35 minutes in a moderately hot oven, 400 degrees if you use a metal pan; 375 degrees if you use ovenglass.<br>
Remove from oven and cool on racks.  If desired brush tops with butter or a mixture of sugar and water.<br>
 Ingredients for 30 loaves, feeds about 200 people<br><br>
38 pounds of flour<br>
7-1/2 cups sugar<br>
2 tablespoons salt<br>
15 eggs<br>
15 packages rapid rise yeast<br>
7-1/2 cubes butter<br>
About 33 cups very hot tap water<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Cancer can strike anyone, regardless of age, background,
or financial means. To effectively fight this disease, patients
need quality medical care plus emotional and practical support.
Since 1949, thousands of Santa Barbara residents have come to
the Cancer Foundation with these needs; no one has ever been turned
away.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>At the Cancer Foundation, patients find a caring,
committed staff, state-of-the-art equipment, and renewed hope.
Many patients, after receiving treatment, go on to live long lives,
free of disease; for others, treatment means easing the pain sometimes
associated with the disease, thereby improving the quality of
life.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>A volunteer Board of Trustees, comprised of dedicated
community leaders, oversees Cancer Foundation operations, guiding
its growth and change in response to local needs. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Of the estimated five million people in the United
States who have, or have had, cancer, approximately 60% are considered
cured. Until 100% of these patients are cancer-free, the Cancer
Foundation will continue its work, treating Santa Barbara's cancer
patients with professionalism and compassion. We will actively
pursue more effective treatments through the Clinical Research
Program and continue implementing new technology to help provide
patients with the best possible chance for recovery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The challenge is to provide these services in a climate
of ever-increasing demands on health care. The Cancer Foundation
meets this challenge with a committed staff, strong community
support, and true belief in its mission.<BR>

<title>The History of Santa Barbara</title>
</head><img align=bottom src="http://www.rain.org/~kmw/city/prlogo.gif"><body>
<h1>The History of Santa Barbara</h1>
<strong>From Military Outpost to World-famous Resort</strong><br>
Until just over 200 years ago, the Chumash Indians thrived in this area,
clustering in small villages along the Santa Barbara coast and Channel Islands.
For thousands of years, protected by the rugged mountains and ocean, they
enjoyed a comfortable, easy lifestyle afforded by an abundance of wildlife an
natural resources.  Then, in the short time span of two centuries, these
peaceful, secluded villages developed into a world-famous resort.
<p>
European "civilization" first arrived in 1542, when Portuguese explorer Juan
Cabrillo entered the Channel and claimed the land for Spain.  The Chumash
greeted the visitors with great friendliness and exchanged gifts.  Their next
encounter with the Spanish would not be until the next century.  On the eve of
December 4, 1602, just after weathering a severe storm, three frigates under
the command of Sebastian Vizcaino entered the Santa Barbara Channel. Thankful
to God for answering their prayers to guide the ships through the storm, one
of the Carmelite friars on board named the bay and nearby shore after Saint
Barbara, whose commemorative feast had occurred the same day. According to
some authorities, a Chumash greeting party canoed out to the ship but was
unsuccessful in persuading Vizcaino to visit, even though the Chumash leader
offered each sailor ten Chumash wives.
<p>
In 1782, the Spaniards came to stay.  With plans to establish a military
presidio and mission, a group led by Father Junipero Serra, Captain Jos&eacute;
Ortega, and Governor Felipe de Neve founded the City of Santa Barbara.
Chumash Chief Yanonali welcomed the Spaniards and offered them much assistance.
<p>
From then on, life was different in Santa Barbara.  The Spaniards governed the
area until 1822, when California became a Mexican territory.  Just 24 years
later, in 1846, Colonel John Fremont and his soldiers took Santa Barbara for
the United States.  Thus Chumash, Spanish, Mexican, and United States
influences merged together, forming a unique blend of language and culture.
<p>
Santa Barbara remained a sleepy pueblo until the late 1800s, when wealthy
easterners, after reading rave newspaper descriptions of the wonderful clime,
hot and cold springs, and relaxing atmosphere, came for vacation.  Word of
Santa Barbara as a premier health resort traveled far and wide, attracting not
only visitors, but permanent residents.  Great hotels and cultural
opportunities blossomed, drawing celebrity visitors from around the globe,
including presidents, opera stars, kings, and queens.
<p>
For a short time, Santa Barbara was even the film capital of the world!  In
1910, before the motion picture industry centralized in Hollywood, the
American Film company opened the Flying A Studio on the corner of State and
Mission streets.  The studio was the largest of its kind in the world for
several years.  More than 1200 movies (mostly westerns) were made during the
studio's ten-year life span.  Though Santa Barbara ceased to be center of the
motion picture industry, it continued to be a favorite get-away destination for
film stars and other celebrities.  Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford owned
property in the Santa Barbara hills; they first considered this site for their
famous mansion, Pickfair, before building it in Beverly Hills.  In 1928,
Charlie Chaplin built the Montecito Inn to cater to the Hollywood crowd of the
roaring twenties.  Actors Ronald Colman and Alvin Weingand bought the stylish
San Ysidro Ranch resort in 1935, operating it as an exclusive hideaway for
friends and guests such as Bing Crosby, Jack Benny, Audrey Hepburn, and
Groucho Marx.  Vivian Leigh and Laurence Olivier were married at the Ranch, and
in 1953, John and Jacqueline Kennedy spent part of their honeymoon there. 
Today, many celebrities maintain Santa Barbara residences, finding this a
perfect place to escape the glare of Hollywood, less than two hours away.
<p>
As you explore Santa Barbara for the first time, you will notice many reminders
of its colorful past:  old adobes with quiet courtyards; streets that bear
names of historical figures; and the Mediterranean-style architecture that
dominates the town, inspired by the Spanish residences of the city's early
years.  All these pay tribute to the unique circumstances that created the
Santa Barbara we know today - a resort known around the world for its very
special character.<hr>

<H4>	The Museum's exhibits represent a variety of exhibit styles ranging from the mid-1920s to the very latest in technological equipment. In the Mammal Hall, built in 1927, bears, badgers, foxes and other rarely seen mammals are depicted in dioramas painted by now-famous plein-air artists. The Marine Hall features a model of a giant squid casting a baleful look at visitors below. A graceful condor, now extinct in the wild, spreads her huge wings in the Bird Habitat Hall while minerals and gems sparkle next to a dwarf mammoth skeleton in the Geology/Paleontology Hall. A Chumash Indian shaman dressed in ceremonial garments contemplates fire in the Indian Hall.

	<p>The new Space Lab and Planetarium highlight the heavens with the magic of computers, while in the new insect hall, visitors use video technology and interactive computers to explore the microscopic world of insects.

Where can you touch a live seastar, see live plankton, hatch grunion fish eggs, create your
own sea art and learn about field trips to see whales, all in one day?  At the Sea Center, the
 Marine Sanctuary visitor's center located on historic Stearns Wharf!
<P>

The Center, known as the "window on the Channel" and a cooperative project of the Sanctuary
and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, is launching a full schedule of daily summer
programs, beginning June 17 and continuing through September 2.

The Sea Center will feature presentations that are designed to kindle a desire for visitors to go
 out into the real world of the Santa Barbara Channel, and specifically, the waters of the Sanctuary,
and experience the blow of a blue whale, see the beauty of the kelp forest and touch the spines of a
sea urchin.

<P>
Through live interaction, our participants will see that they are connected to a wonderful system that
depends on mutual support to persist.  They will also become educated about the unique qualities
and the importance of our Sanctuary as a biosphere reserve.
<P>

In addition the Sea Center will act as a venue for a full slate of presentations, seven days a week
given by staff marine biologists, Museum Docents, Whale Corps members and select college and
high school interns working as interpreters.  Shows will be object based, include live specimens
when possible and will be supported by props and graphics to illustrate concepts.
<P>

<h3>Adult Literacy Program</h3>

Since 1986, 1200 English-speaking adults, ages 16 to 70, have received free tutoring in basic literacy skills through the Adult Literacy Program of the Santa Barbara Public Library System. More than 750 trained volunteer tutors, ages 18 to 82, have participated in the one-to-one style of teaching by meeting their learner twice weekly in sites from Carpinteria to Goleta.<br>

Literacy volunteers are helping break the cycles of crime and poverty through two special community programs. The Jail Literacy Program at the Sheriffs Department honor farms help learners prepare to pass a high-school equivalency exam and increase their chance of success in the working world. The Families for Literacy Program helps parents improve their own literacy skills, while providing them with childrens books for the home and encouraging them to read regularly to their children.<hr><ul>

<b>During the week of April 15-19, schools and home schools from all over 
the U.S. and Canada took part in NASA's Global Weather Monitoring 
Project.  Participants in this project recorded temperature, wind speed, 
wind direction, how much of the sky was covered by clouds, and what type 
of clouds were in the sky.  Then at 10:00 AM (Pacific Time) the students 
sent their data to NASA.  The data was then compiled and used to make 
real weather maps of the U.S. and Canada.  Over 30 schools and at least 
11 home schools took part in this project.
<br>
Camp Internet now has a page for this weather project, with links to 
NASA's web, and other related sites.  <a

<TITLE>The Adventures of Schr&oumldinger's Cat</TITLE>
<H1>The Adventures of Schr&oumldinger's 
Cat</H1>
<H3>by Mark Hutchenreuther</H3>
Well, I'm off to the lecture hall again.  We do this every year, Fall quarter, Winter quarter, and Spring 
quarter.  Halfway through his physics course he has to repeat his silly demonstration.  So I get lugged off 
to the lecture hall along with the piece of uranium, the vial of cyanide, and the geiger counter, there to be 
placed in the infamous box.  I really wish he would find a new topic, or create a new theory, or even just 
retire.  I'm tired of this silly box experiment.<P>
And there are all the students sitting in the hall.  Some look at me in horror, not believing that the mild 
Professor Schr&oumldinger is actually going to perform the experiment he has proposed.  Others, cat haters, 
give me that evil eye.  They hope to see a dead cat at the end of the experiment.  Perhaps some are 
gamblers, and fools too, betting on even odds.<P>
Now the lecture begins.  Into the box I go, with the rock, the vial and the counter.  The box is closed and I 
know I have nearly an hour of isolation in this dark box.  The students don't know that real uranium is far 
too active for this experiment.  They don't know that the batteries in the geiger counter are long dead, and 
the professor probably doesn't know it either.  Besides, it isn't turned on, and I know how to turn it off.  
The vial of cyanide?  It's been empty for years.<P>
The whole experiment is flawed anyway, and the students ought to be bright enough by now to know that.  
So what if the uranium decays and the geiger counter clicks?  What mechanism is there for the vial to be 
broken when that happens?  This is no ordinary cat here, why I probably know his lectures as well as he 
does.  But why worry about that, I have an hour to nap.<P>
Hey!  Wait a minute!  If I really am simultaneously dead and alive, if I really am in a parallel universe, I 
ought to be able to time travel.  I should have thought of that years ago.  What a great way to occupy my 
boring time in here with all this junk.  This isn't just a box, it's a time machine.  How do I do it?  I guess I 
just close my eyes and meditate...<P>
Wow, look at this.  I'm in the woods.  I'll climb up this tree to get a better view of where I am.  Uh oh.  
There's a little girl over there.  Oops!  She sees me, here she comes.  The least I can do is smile.  She's 
talking to me now, she wants to know which way to go.  That's easy, I'll just string her along and maybe 
she'll go away.<P>
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to."  Hey, this is cool. Not only can I time travel, she 
seems to understand me too.  Oh no, another question.  Now she wants to know who lives around here.  
How would I know?  I'll have to make something up.<P>
"In that direction lives a Hatter, and in that direction lives a March Hare."  All this questioning is making 
me feel a bit lightheaded.  I've told her now that we're all mad here, and now she is talking about the 
Queen's croquet game.  That sounds like fun.<P>
"You'll see me there," I tell her, and then it begins to grow dark.  I must be travelling back to the box.  Not 
yet, I'm not ready and my hour isn't up.  I'll concentrate on getting back to the tree.  Ah, here we are 
again.<P>
This young girl looks like she should have a doll, but she has none.  I'll have to ask her about that.  "By 
the way, what became of the baby?  I'd nearly forgotten to ask."<P>
She replied with some sort of nonsense, and quizzing her about it didn't get me anywhere.  Besides, she 
was complaining about my fading in and out making her giddy too.  Oh no!  The time has flown by, it's 
time to go back to the box.<P>
I'm back in a nick of time.  I can hear footsteps, the students coming over to look in the box for 
themselves.  I smile at them and give them a plaintive, "Meow?"<P>
<HR>
[Author's note:  Where will the cat go next quarter/episode?  Send me your ideas.  Seriously!]<P>

<body>
Click <a href="mailto:esgnet@rain.org">Here</a> to send us e-mail
<hr>
<h3>The Eastside Study Group applies consensus generating techniques to tackle critical urban problems facing the people who live and work in the ethnically diverse Eastside of Santa Barbara.  The process is a model for community organizing and self determination.  The Eastside Study Group has been successful in bringing residents, workers, business owners, social service agencies, city officials, and planning staff together to develop collaborative partnerships addressing mutual concerns and to identify shared values.
<p>
The threefold result is entirely consistant with the Awahnee Principles:
1. A powerful declaration of community,<br>
2. A thirty two page document of principles that will guide future actions in the area,<br>
3. A list of doable action projects that are examples of these principles and declarations in action.<p>

The community has challenged itself to bring the Declaration of Community to life in the form of realizable action projects requiring community involvement.  The work continues in monthly meetings and deep involvement in civic affairs.  Recent topics of investigation include "The Relationship Between the Community and Education", and "Constructive Responses to Proposition 187".  The design of busy Milpas Street is next on the agenda.  Soon, the Study Group will begin an inquiry into Housing.
</h3><hr>
<h1>A DECLARATION OF COMMUNITY</h1>
<h2><i>We who live and work in the vital, ethnically diverse Eastside of Santa Barbara declare that we are a community of people who work together to create our own future.</i></h2>

<h2>Therefore, we shall take action to ensure that:</h2>
<h3>I<br>  The Eastside is a safe and wonderful place to raise our children, care for our families and friends, work, play, worship, and prosper.
<p>
II<br>
Our young people, whom we value and respect, grow up
in a positive, wholesome, supportive environment which encourages their creative self-expression and prepares them for productive lives as adults.
<p>
III<br>
We get to know one another.  We look out for the well being of our neighbors.
Human services are available, accessible and utilized by those who need them.<p>

IV<br>
The physical environment and infrastructure -- the streets, intersections, sidewalks, buildings, gardens, parks, lights -- are designed and maintained to preserve and enhance the unique mix of existing small businesses and residences.
<p>
V<br>
The rich human resources and diverse cultural heritage of the area
form the foundation of our future development as a community.
<p></h3>
 WE ARE A COMMUNITY COMMITTED TO WORK TOGETHER.<br> 
The Eastside Study Group, 1993<br>
Santa Barbara, California

Stephen, the fifth of nine children, was named after Stephen Grover, whose church Stephen's father, Richard Falley Cleveland, had recently taken over.  Stephen was very adventuresome in his early years.  Once, when he was four years old he ran into the road and fell under the wheels of a horse drawn apple cart.  Luckily a school teacher happened to be passing by and saved our future president.</P><P>When Stephen was five his family moved to Fayetteville, New York, ( a small farming community near the Erie Canal) where his father preached at a local church.  When Stephen was growing up he had to memorize Bible verses, read books like <I>The Pilgrim's Progress</I> and Shakespeare. Every evening they had a family worship service in their home.  Stephen went to school at Fayetteville's district school house, where he was a good student but not brilliant.  Stephen decided he didn't like his first name so everybody called him Grover.  Grover enjoyed swimming, fishing, and playing pranks like taking the neighbors gate off its hinges or ringing the school bell.</P><P>When Grover was thirteen his family moved to Clinton, New York.  Grover went to school at the Clinton Liberal Institute.  Grover's father was district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society and made $1,000 a year.  That  was a lot in the 1850's, but with nine children they still could not pay the bills.  So when Grover was 14 he quit school and got a job as a clerk at the general store back in Fayetteville to help his family.  The owner hired Grover as an apprentice for room, board, and one dollar a week.  Grover worked long hours in the store, getting up early to sweep and dust the shelves.  The room he shared with another young clerk above the store was not heated, so during the winter they were very cold.  During the day Grover would wait on customers, run errands, and do odd jobs.  His second year at the store the owner doubled his pay to two dollars a week.  Grover realized he had no future at the store so when his apprenticeship contract expired he moved back home to Clinton.</P><P>Grover wanted to go to College at Hamilton College in Clinton, but when he was 16, in 1853, they had to move to Holland Patent, New York because of financial trouble.  Rev. Cleveland had gotten a job as the minister of the Presbyterian Church in Holland Patent.  Unfortunately he wasn't minister for very long, because he died suddenly on October 1,1853.  Grover decided to forget about college and help his family.  Grover's older brother William got him a job at the New York Institute for the Blind, where William was a teacher.  There were 116 students at the Institute, ages 12-25.  Grover taught writing, arithmetic, and geography.  He was unhappy there because the superintendent treated the students like prisoners, if they broke his rules they received whippings and other punishments.  After one year Grover quit his job and moved back to Holland Patent.</P><P>Grover had always wanted to go west and be a lawyer, so when a wealthy church member offered to pay for Grover's college tuition if he promised to become a minister, Grover thanked him but said no.  Instead Grover decided to go to Cleveland, Ohio, because it was founded by a relative.<P><HR WIDTH=75%><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=576><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=TopPage.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Main Index</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=EarlyCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Early Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=LaterCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Later Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Timeline.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Timeline</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address1.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>1st Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address2.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>2nd Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Bibliography.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Bibliography</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Josh.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Author</TD></TR></TABLE></P></body></html>           

<body background="BFlagcopy.JPG">
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Grover Cleveland Inaugural Address<BR>March 4, 
1885</H1>


<P> Fellow citizens:</P>
<P> In the presence of this vast assemblage of my countrymen I am about to 
supplement and seal by the oath which I shall take the manifestation of the will 
of a great and free people.  In the exercise of their power and right of self-
government they have committed to one of their fellow-citizens a supreme and 
sacred trust, and he here consecrates himself to their service.</P>
<P> This impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of responsibility 
with which I contemplate the duty I owe to all the people of the land.  Nothing 
can relieve men from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interests may suffer, 
and nothing is needed to strengthen my resolution to engage every faculty and 
effort in the promotion of their welfare.</P>
<P> Amid the din of party strife the people's choice was made, but its attendant 
circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a 
government by the people.  In each succeeding year it more clearly appears 
that our democratic principle needs no apology, and that in its fearless and 
faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of good government.</P>
<P> But the best results in the operation of a government wherein every citizen 
has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely partisan zeal and 
effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the heat of the partisan should 
be merged in the patriotism of the citizen.</P>
<P> To-day the executive branch of the Government is transferred to new 
keeping.  But this is still the Government of all the people, and it should be none 
the less an object of their affectionate solicitude.  At this hour the animosities of 
political strife, the bitterness of partisan defeat, and the exultation of partisan 
triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular 
will and a sober, conscientious concern for the general weal.  Moreover, if from 
this hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and 
distrust, and determine, with manly confidence in one another, to work out 
harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny, we shall deserve to 
realize all the benefits which our happy form of government can bestow.</P>
<P> On this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion 
to the Constitution, which, launched by the founders of the republic and 
consecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion, has for almost a century 
borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through prosperity and 
peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the perils of domestic strife 
and vicissitudes.</P>
<P>By the father of his Country our Constitution was commended for adoption 
as "the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession ."  In that same spirit it 
should be administered, in order to promote the lasting welfare of the country 
and to secure the full measure of its priceless benefits to us and to those who 
will succeed to the blessings of our national life.  The large variety of diverse 
and competing interests subject to Federal control, persistently seeking he 
recognition of their claims, need give us no fear that "the greatest good to the 
greatest number" will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of national legislation 
that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall prevail in which the Constitution 
had its birth.  If this involves the surrender or postponement of private interests 
and the abandonment of local advantages, compensation will be found in the 
assurance that the common interest is subserved and the general welfare 
advanced.</P>
<P> In the discharge of my official duty I shall endeavor to be guided by a just 
and unstrained construction of the Constitution, a careful observance of the 
distinction between the powers granted  to the Federal Government and those 
reserved to the states or to the people, and by a cautious appreciation of those 
functions which by the Constitution and laws have been especially assigned to 
the executive branch of the Government.</P>
<P> But he who takes the oath to-day to preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States only assumes the solemn obligation which 
every patriotic citizen--on the farm, in the workshop, in the busy marts of trade, 
and everywhere-should share with him.  The Constitution which prescribes his 
oath, my countrymen, is yours; the Government you have chosen him to 
administer for a time is yours, the suffrage which executes the will of freemen is 
yours; the laws and the entire scheme of our civil rule, from the town meeting to 
the State capitals and the national capitals, is yours.  Your every voter, as surely 
as your Chief Magistrate, under the same high sanction, though in a different 
sphere, exercises a public trust.  Nor is this all.  Every citizen owes to the 
country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a fair and 
reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness.  Thus is the people's will 
impressed upon the whole framework of our civil policy-municipal, State, and 
Federal: and this is the price of our liberty and the inspiration of our faith in the 
Republic.</P>
<P> It is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely limit 
public expenditures to the actual needs of the Government economically 
administered, because this bounds the right of the Government to exact tribute 
from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen, and because public 
extravagance begets extravagance among the people.  We should never be 
ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to 
the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the 
mission of the American people.  Those who are selected for a limited time to 
manage public affairs are still of the people, and may do much by their example 
to encourage, consistently with the dignity of their official functions, that plain 
way of life which among their fellow-citizens aids integrity and promotes thrift 
and prosperity.</P>
<P> The genius of our institutions, the needs of our people in their home life, 
and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and development of 
the resources of our vast territory dictate the scrupulous avoidance of any 
departure from that foreign policy commended by the history, the traditions, and 
the prosperity of our Republic.  Ii is the policy of independence, favored by our 
position and defended by our known love of justice and by our power.  It is the 
policy of peace suitable to our interests.  It is the policy of neutrality, rejecting 
any share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling 
their intrusion here.  It is the policy of Monroe and of Washington and Jefferson-
"Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations; entangling alliance 
with none."</P>
<P> A due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands that 
our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible basis as 
shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests and make the wage 
of labor sure and steady, and that our system of revenue shall be so adjusted as 
to relieve the people of unnecessary taxation, having a due regard to the 
interests of capital invested and workingmen employed in American industries, 
and preventing the accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury to tempt 
extravagance and waste.</P>
<P> Care for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers 
requires that the public domain should be protected from purloining schemes 
and unlawful occupation.</P>
<P>The conscience of the people demands that the Indians within our 
boundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the Government and 
their education and civilization promoted with a view to their ultimate 
citizenship, and that polygamy in the Territories, destructive of the family relation 
and offensive to the moral sense of the civilized world, shall be repressed.</P>
<P>The laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a 
servile class to compete with American labor, with no intention of acquiring 
citizenship, and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs repugnant 
to our civilization.</P>
<P>The people demand reform in the administration of the Government and the 
application of business principles to public affairs.  As a means to this end,         
civil-service reform should be in good faith enforced.  Our citizens have the right 
to protection from the incompetency of public employees who hold their places 
solely as the reward of partisan service, and from the corrupting influence of 
those who promise and the vicious methods of those who expect such rewards; 
and those who worthily seek public employment have the right to insist that 
merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or the 
surrender of honest political belief.</P>
<P>In the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact justice 
to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the 
freedmen in their rights or their security in the enjoyment of their privileges 
under the Constitution and its amendments.  All discussion as to their fitness for 
the place accorded to them as American citizens is idle and unprofitable except 
as it suggests the necessity for their improvement.  The fact that they are citizens 
entitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them with all its 
duties, obligations and responsibilities.</P>
<P>These topics and the constant and ever-varying wants of an active and 
enterprising population may well receive the attention and the patriotic 
endeavor of all who make and execute the Federal law.  Our duties are practical 
and call for industrious application, an intelligent perception of the claims of 
public office, and, above all, a firm determination, by united action, to secure to 
all the people of the land the full benefits of the best form of government ever 
vouchsafed to man.  And let us not trust to human effort alone, but humbly 
acknowledging the power and goodness of Almighty God, who presides over 
the destiny of nations, and who has at all times been revealed in our country's 
history, let us invoke His aid and his blessing upon our labors.</P>

Lewis convinced Grover to stay and work with him for five months, because Lewis thought going west would be to dangerous.  Lewis raised cattle, so Grover kept the books for his uncle's business.  He lived with his uncle and got paid ten dollars a month.  After five months Grover decided to stay in Buffalo, so Lewis got him a job as a clerk at a local law firm called Rodgers, Bowen, and Rodgers.  On Grover's first day the elder Rodgers gave him a book called "Blackstone's Law Commentaries" and told him, "That's where they all begin."  Grover learned a lot at the law firm, watching the clerks prepare legal documents, listening to Bowen and the Rodgers discuss cases, and reading his law book.  In a letter home in 1857 Grover  said, "My employers assure me that if I keep on I'll make a lawyer."  And he did, in May of 1859, when the New York court admitted him to the bar.  Grover, now twenty-two years old, was immediately offered a job with Rodgers, Bowen, and Rodgers, which he accepted.</P><P>Ever since he had arrived in Buffalo, Grover had been interested in Democratic politics.  During elections he would walk around reminding people to vote.  Because of this Cleveland was elected Democratic Supervisor of his city ward in 1862.  Grover was also appointed Assistant District Attorney.  In 1863 Grover was drafted by the army to fight in the civil war.  Instead of going to war he hired a Polish immigrant to take his place for $150, which was legal at the time.</P><P>In 1870, Grover decided to run for Sheriff of Buffalo, and he won the election.  While Sheriff, he found out that the political leaders were cheating the prisoners out of their food and Grover stopped it.  His term ended in 1873, and he returned to practicing law.  In 1881, when Grover was forty-four years old, the Democratic Party asked him to run for mayor of Buffalo and he accepted.  Grover easily won the election and took office in 1882.  He vetoed bills that wasted city money, and got such a good reputation that they nominated him to run for governor of New York.  Running on his reputation for being an honest politician, Cleveland won the election without making a single campaign speech.  As governor he made sure the state got its moneys worth for every dollar spent.  He cleaned up the state and got such a wide spread reputation for honesty that he got the Democratic nomination for president.<P><HR WIDTH=75%><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=576><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=TopPage.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Main Index</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Childhood.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Childhood</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=LaterCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Later Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Timeline.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Timeline</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address1.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>1st Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address2.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>2nd Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Bibliography.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Bibliography</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Josh.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Author</TD></TR></TABLE></P></body></html>                                                                                          

<html><head><TITLE>Grover Cleveland Inaugural Address #2</TITLE></head><body background="BFlagcopy.JPG"><H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Grover Cleveland Inaugural Address<BR>March 4, 1893</H1><P>My Fellow-Citizens:</P> <P>In obedience of the mandate of my countrymen I am about to dedicate myself to their service under the sanction of a solemn oath. Deeply moved by the expression of confidence and personal attachment which has called me to this service, I am sure my gratitude can make no better return than the pledge I now give before God and these witnesses of unreserved and complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those who have honored me.</P> <P>I deem it fitting on this occasion, while indicating the opinion I hold concerning public questions of present importance, to also briefly refer to the existence of certain conditions and tendencies among our people which seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their Government.</P> <P>While every American citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country, the sufficiency of our institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence, the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our people, and the demonstrated superiority of our free government, it behooves us to constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national vigor.</P> <P>The strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the sternest activities of life and rejoices in the hardihood ofconstant labor may still have lurking near his vitals the unheeded disease that dooms him to sudden collapse.</P> <P>It can not be doubted that our stupendous achievements as a people and our country's robust strength have given rise to heedlessness of those laws governing our national health which we can no more evade than human life can escape the laws of God and nature.</P> <P>Manifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the beneficent purposes of our Government than a sound and stable currency. Its exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most enlightened statesmanship, and the danger of depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest incentive to prompt and conservative precaution.</P> <P>In dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of finance and trade. At the same time, in our efforts to adjust differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion, and our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests.</P><P>I am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudent and effective remedial legislation. In the meantime, so far as the executive branch of the Government can intervene, none of the powers with which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed necessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster.</P><P>Closely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country's greatness which tends to a disregard of the rules of national safety, another danger confronts us not less serious. I refer to the prevalence of a popular disposition to expect from the operation of the Government especial and direct individual advantages.</P><P>The verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining protection for protection's sake enjoins upon the people's servants the duty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are the unwholesome progeny of paternalism. This is the bane of republican institutions and the constant peril of our government by the people. It degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers established and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and veneration. It perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and tempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived from their Government's maintenance. It undermines the self-reliance of our people and substitutes in its place dependence upongovernmental favoritism. It stifles the spirit of true Americanism and stupefies every ennobling trait of American citizenship.</P><P>The lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while the people should patriotically andcheerfully support their Government its functions do not include the support of the people.</P><P>The acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and subsidies, which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizens to aid ill-advised or languishing enterprises in which they have no concern. It leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless pension expenditure, which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition of patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people's prompt and generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country's defense.</P><P>Every thoughtful American must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow. The toleration of this idea results in the waste of the people's money by their chosen servants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life of our countrymen.</P><P>Under our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime against the citizen, and the contempt of our people for economy and frugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and sturdiness of our national character.</P><P>It is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expenditures should be limited by public necessity, and that this should be measured by the rules of strict economy; and it is equally clear that frugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and strong support of free institutions.</P><P>One mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when appointments to office, instead of being the rewards of partisan activity, are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return of work for the compensation paid to them. To secure the fitness and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing madness for spoils, civil-service reform has found a place in our public policy and laws. The benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of political sentiment and the purification of political methods.</P><P>The existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and combinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting production and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be open to every independent activity.  Legitimate strife in business should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the demands of combinations that have the power to destroy, nor should the people to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results from wholesome competition. These aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people, and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our American sense of fairness. To the extent that they can be reached and restrained by Federal power the General Government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions.</P><P>Loyalty to the principles upon which our Government rests positively demands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every citizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the land. The enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship wherever found, and, unimpaired by race or color, it appeals for recognition to American manliness and fairness.</P><P>Our relations with the Indians located within our border impose upon us responsibilities we can not escape. Humanity and consistency require us to treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly and considerately regard their rights and interests. Every effort should be made to lead them, through the paths of civilization and education, to self-supporting and independent citizenship. In the meantime, as the nation's wards, they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of designing men and shielded from every influence or temptation that retards their advancement.</P><P>The people of the United States have decreed that on this day the control of their Government in its legislative and executive branches shall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms to the accomplishment of tariff reform. They have thus determined in favor of a more just and equitable system of Federal taxation. The agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service.</P><P>While there should be no surrender of principle, our task must be undertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness. Our mission is not punishment, but the rectification of wrong. If in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantages too long enjoyed, this is but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice. If we exact from unwilling minds acquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the governmental beneficence treasured up for all, we but insist upon a principle which underlies our free institutions. When we tear aside the delusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their condition under vicious tariff laws, we but show them how far they have been led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity. When we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the Government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people, we announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power. And when we seek to reinstate the self-confidence and business enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence upon governmental favor, we strive to stimulate those elements of American character which support the hope of American achievement.</P><P>Anxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and solicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have reposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom I am to cooperate that we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set before us only by the most sincere, harmonious, and disinterested effort. Even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the consummation of our task, we shall hardly be excused; and if failure can be traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us to a swift and exacting accountability.</P><P>The oath I now take to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States not only impressively defines the great responsibility I assume, but suggests obedience to constitutional commands as the rule by which my official conduct must be guided. I shall to the best of my ability and within my sphere of duty preserve the Constitution by loyally protecting every grant of Federal power it contains, by defending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness, and by enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the States and the people.</P><P>Fully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and mindful of my weakness, I should be appalled if it were my lot to bear unaided the responsibilities which await me. I am, however, saved from discouragement when I remember that I shall have the support and the counsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will stand at my side in Cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative halls.</P><P>I find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and generous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and approval.</P><P>Above all, I know there is a Supreme Being who rules the affairs of men and whose goodness and mercy have always followed the American people, and I know He will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek His powerful aid.</P><P><HR WIDTH=75%><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=576><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=TopPage.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Main Index</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Childhood.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Childhood</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=EarlyCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Early Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=LaterCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Later Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Timeline.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Timeline</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address1.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>1st Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Bibliography.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Bibliography</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Josh.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Author</TD></TR></TABLE></P></body></html>                                                                                                            

The Republicans nominated James G. Blaine to run for president, but half of the Republicans wanted reform and did not like Blaine.  Grover won the election by just 37 electoral votes, and 62,683 popular votes.  On March 4, 1885, Grover Cleveland was sworn into office and gave his first inaugural address.  </P><P>As president, Grover worked hard on reforming the federal government, like he had done with the New York state government.  He hired better government workers, made sure the Navy got the best ships possible for the least possible money, and forced the railroads to return 81 million acres of government land they had taken illegally.  Often he was at his desk until two or three in the morning studying every bill Congress passed, and he vetoed more than 300 of them.  The previous twenty-one presidents had all together only vetoed 132 bills, which is why they called him, "The Veto President."</P><P>On June 2nd, 1886, Grover Cleveland, now 49, married Francis Folsom in the Blue room of the White House while thousands of citizens jammed the White House lawn.  Grover was the first and only president to be married in the White House.  </P><P>One of the countries biggest problems in 1888 was the tariff, the tax on imported goods.  The merchants wanted a high tariff so they could charge more for their products, and the farmers wanted low tariff so they could buy goods cheaply.  Grover Cleveland and the rest of the Democratic Party stood for a low tariff during the election of 1888, while the Republicans and their candidate, Benjamin Harrison, stood for a high tariff.  It was a very close election, but even though Cleveland received more popular votes than Harrison, Harrison won in the electoral college.  When the Clevelands were moving out of the White House, Mrs. Cleveland told one of the servants," Take care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, don't let any get lost or broken, and have everything just the way it is now when we come back in four years."</P><P>After his term had ended, Grover and Francis moved to New York where Grover joined a well known law firm.  On October 3, 1891, Grover wrote a friend, "A few minutes after midnight, a little strong, healthy girl arrived at our home."  America fell in love with Ruth Cleveland, and the newspapers followed her progress closely.  Ruth even had a candy bar named after her, "Baby Ruth." </P><P>Grover was angry about many of the decisions Harrison made while he was president, so he agreed to run for president again, predicting national disaster if things continued as they were.  Benjamin Harrison again won the Republican nomination for president, and a new party, called the Populists, nominated James B. Weaver.  In October of 1892, first lady Caroline Harrison died, and President Harrison stopped campaigning.  Respectfully, Grover also stopped his campaign.  Grover won the election, becoming the only President to win two non consecutive terms.</P><P>Clevelands second term was much like his first, he worked hard, and he did what he thought was right, whether it was popular or not.  When a railroad strike interfered with the mail, he sent federal troops to break up the strike.  Cleveland said, "If it takes the entire army and navy to deliver one postcard in Chicago, that card will be delivered."  When a serious depression swept the country, Cleveland, thinking it unconstitutional to help individual businesses or citizens, tried to improve the treasury system.  Unfortunately he was not very successful, but when his term ended in 1896 the federal government was a better working and more honest organization.</P><P>During the elections in 1896, the Democrats parted themselves from Cleveland (because of the depression), and picked William Bryant to run against William McKinley, the Republican candidate.  Grover would not support Bryant and had nothing to do with the election, which McKinley won.</P><P>Grover moved to Princeton and decided to retire.  The Cleveland family had five children now, which he had more time to play with.  In 1904, twelve year old Ruth Cleveland got sick and died.  It was a long time before Grover began to get over his oldest daughters death.  When Grover reached his 71st birthday his health began to fail, and he was forced by aching joints to lay in bed for days at a time.  On June 24, at 8:40 in the morning, Cleveland died in his bed of heart and kidney disease.  His last words were, "I have tried so hard to do right."  Cleveland was buried in Princeton, and the citizens remembered him as, "Grover the Good."</P><P><HR WIDTH=75%><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=576><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=TopPage.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Main Index</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Childhood.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Childhood</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=EarlyCareer.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Early Career</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Timeline.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Timeline</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address1.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>1st Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=address2.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gifHEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>2nd Address</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Bibliography.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Bibliography</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=Josh.html><IMG SRC=nixstars.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60 BORDER=0><BR>Author</TD></TR></TABLE></P></body></html>                                                                                                    

This migration, from the Bering and Chukchi seas between Alaska and Siberia to the warm lagoons of Baja California and western Mexico constitutes a 10,000 to 12,000 mile roundtrip-one of the longest known migrations of any mammal.<p>The Gray whale was historically very numerous; population estimates placed their numbers at being between 25,000 to 30,000 whales. Whalers hunted them extensively, and due to their slow traveling speed and well-known migratory route they were easily found in numbers. The discovery of their breeding lagoons in Mexico further hastened their decline. At one time there were 15 on-land stations in California alone for the processing of Gray whales. Each whale yielded 25 to 45 barrels of oil, which sold for $27 to $40 a barrel in 1855. Whale oil was very important at that time for use in lamps, lubricating machinery <A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~inverts/WHALECORP/product1.htm">and other whale products</A>.<P>When Gray whale stocks near shore were depleted, hunting pressure let up on them for a bit; but the development of steam and diesel "factory ships," which could catch, process and store the whale products all on board, renewed the slaughter. In 1946 the nternational Whaling Commission (a "self regulating" body comprised of members of nations that have or had whaling industries) afforded protection to the Gray whale, since it was obviously endangered. Since then it has come under the further protection of the Marine Mammal Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other federal and international protection treaties. The whale numbers have now rebounded to an estimated 21,000+. They are still exempt from hunting, with the exception of the allowed "take" of 180 per year by natives of Siberia and Alaska who have traditionally used them as a source of food and materials. The Gray whale is considered an environmental success story and was recently removed from the Endangered Species List.<hr><br><font size= 5>Some Gray Whale Facts </font><br>Gray whales mate one year and give birth the next. Calves are usually born in the warm, shallow lagoons of Baja California, from late December to eary February. Calves average about 15 feet long at birth and weigh an estimated 1500 pounds. Nourished by approximately 50 gallons of the mother's rich milk each day, calves may gain 60-70 pounds daily and reach 18 to 19 feet in length by the end of winter.<br><br><font size= 5>Migration</font><br>By mid-February, newly pregnant females leave the lagoons to begin the northward migration. They are soon followed by males, who continue courtship, and by juveniles of previous years. Mothers and new calves are the last to leave, occasionally remaining as late as May or June.<br><br><font size= 5> How Old Do Gray Whales Get?</font><br>Gray whales reach sexual maturity at six to eight years of age, and physical maturity at a mean age of 40 years. They are thought to live from 40 to occasionally 60 years.<br><br><font size=5>Feeding</font><br>Unique among whales, Gray whales are bottom feeders, which led them to be improperly called "mussel diggers" in past times. Mussels, however, are not an item on their diet; though they can  occasionally eat schooling fish or planktonic crustaceans (krill), the bulk of their diet appears to be bottom dwelling crustaceans called amphipods, which are exceedingly abundant in the cold, nutrient rich <TABLE width=20% ALIGN=right BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="krill.jpg"><tr><td><font size=1>Krill is a small shrimp-like crustacean</font></TABLE>waters of the northern hemisphere's summer. The whale dives to the bottom, rolls to one side (usually the right side, though there are some "left handed" whales), and suck up huge quantities of bottom sediment and water. This is pushed back out of it's mouth through the baleen with the gigantic tongue, straining out edible matter. It is during this time (summer) that the whales put on most of their weight. It is thought that they eat very little, if at all, during the migration; however, evidence shows that some may do limited feeding, and mothers with calves have been seen "mouthing" giant kelp during their return trip. Also, it is likely that the whales take advantage of occasional "blooms" of small creatures such as pelagic red crabs that occur, for example, during the "El Nino" periods of oceanic warming.<br><br><font size= 5>PREDATORS</font><br>Aside from man, the Gray whale's only "enemies" are probably large sharks, and Killer Whales (orcas). Killer Whales have been known to hang onto the flippers and flukes of large whales, even Blue whales, until the giant is tired out and succumbs to attack.<br><br><font size= 5>Parasites</font><br> Gray whales are also infested with "parasites," animals that live on or in the body of the whale.<table align=right width=20%><tr><td><img src="lice.gif"><tr><td><font size=1>These are whale lice, otherwise called cyamid crustaceans</font><tr><td></table> The two major external parasites are whale barnacles, which imbed themselves in the whale's skin, especially around thehead, back and tail; and cyamid crustaceans called whale lice which cluster about the barnacles and in the folds and slits of skin. They are thought to eat dead skin cells as they slough off the whale, while barnacles are filter feeders that strain microscopic food from surrounding water. Thus, these particular creatures probably don't harm the whale, although they may be irritants. They may even slow the whale down- a large Gray whale can carry 100 pounds of barnacles!<br><br><font size= 5>Temperment</font><br>Although generally docile by nature, Gray whales can be dangerous because of their size strength, and timidity. They often do not like to be approached by divers in the water, though they will sometimes come along side boats, and have even been known to allow petting by people in small rafts. However they are highly protective of each other, especially of their young, and if they sense danger they can be formidable. This earned them the nickname "devilfish" by early whalers. <p>Some other behaviors among Gray whales should be noted. One is called spyhopping, or pitch-poling. Some scientists believe that Gray whales can see as well in air as they can in the water. Occasionally a Gray whale will be seen extending its head vertically from the sea, 8 to 10 feet above the surface, sometimes turning slowly. They support themselves in this position by thrusting their flukes ("treading water") or resting their tail on the bottom in shallow water. Are they taking bearings? Looking for landmarks or obstructions? Just taking a casual glance around?<p>Many whales breach, which is when 1/2 to 3/4 or more of the whale's body suddenly bursts from beneath the surface, often twists to one side or upside down, and re-enters the water with a terrific splash. Is this courtship? An effort to dislodge something? An expression of stress? Or is it done in play, just for fun? Gray whales have been seen to breach several times in succession, and continue for a dozen or more displays.<hr>This page is part of the Whale Corps, and it's continuous effort to educate about the whales off our coast.For more information please <a href="mailto:vertzoo@rain.org">e-mail</a> us.<hr><center>You are the 641st person to see this page.</center><hr width= 70%><br><A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~inverts/WHALECORP/whlcorp.htm"><H6>Back to the Whale Corps</H6><IMG align=middle SRC="comdol.gif" border=0>

STATUS: ENDANGERED<P>

POPULATION: Presently ~10,000<BR>
Worldwide population pre-whaling ~400,000<BR>
The world's largest stock found off the coast of California ~2,000<P>

GEOGRAPHIC RANGE: North Pacific, North Atlantic, Antartic, and Indian Ocean.  Usually seen individually, or in pairs. May be found in larger numbers when feeding. Blues in the Northern Hemisphere move north in Spring, and the Southern Hemisphere stocks move south. Blue whales prefer open seas, and are typically not a coastal species.<P>

DESCRIPTION:  Blue whales are light bluish-gray with gray or grayish-white mottling. Blues are sometimes called "sulphur-bottomed" whales. The underside of some individuals has a yellowish cast due to attached diatoms (phytoplankton) accumulating when they have been in colder water for a long period of time. They have a broad U-shaped head with raised blowholes, and an extremely small dorsal fin located 3/4 of the way back on it's body. The flukes are large, 12-15 feet across with a median notch in the center.<P>

SIZE & WEIGHT: Blue whales are the largest living animal in the history of our planet! Females are slightly larger than males; adult females average 26.0 meters (85.3 feet) in length, males 24.0 meters (79 feet). The largest ever recorded was a female at 33.5 meters (110 feet).<P>

SWIM SPEED: Smooth and streamlined they can reach speeds in excess of 20 knots. Average speed = 8-10 knots, feeding speed = 1-4 knots.<P>

REPRODUCTION: Calving occurs every 2-3 years in late fall or winter.<BR>
Gestation period: 10-11 months<BR>
Newborn calf length: 7-8 meters (23-26 feet)/ 2-3 tons<BR>
Weaning: 7 months, calf is approx 52 feet long<BR>
Milk: contains up to 50% fat. Calf can consume up to 50 gallons/day while gaining 200 pounds/day or 8 pounds/hour.<P>

AGE:  Blue whales live between 30-90 years and reach sexual maturity at 23-30 years. Age is determined by counting the rings of the waxy ear plug.<P>

DIVE CYCLE/ BREATHING: Shallow dive: 12-14 surfaces at 10-20 second intervals.<BR>
Deep dive: up to 15 minutes long.<BR>
Deepest dive: 630 feet, measured with a time-depth recorder in the Santa Barbara Channel by a researcher on the WHAPS96 research expedition.<P>

FEEDING: Blue whales are baleen whales which feed on timy shrimp-like creatures called krill (euphausids). Krill swarms usually occur in 100-200 meters of water (330-660 feet). They have 270-395 baleen plates on each side of their upper jaw, and 55-88 ventral throat grooves for expansion of their mouths while feeding- either by gulping or lunging through swarms of krill. Blue whales may consume 3-4 tons of food in one day, with a basic metabolism requiring up to 3 million calories per day! Blue whales can be found from June - October feeding on krill in the cool, plankton-rich waters off of California.<P>

RESEARCH: An increase of blue whales in the Santa Barbara Channel over the past few summers has given researchers a rare opportunity to study these magnificent creatures. The Whale Habitat and Prey Study (WHAPS96) has successfully tagged 3 animals. Only seven blue whales have previously been tagged. This includes 2 satellite tags to track the migratory patterns of the whales, and 5 time-depth recorders to study their diving and feeding behaviors. Photographic identification research is also being conducted in the Santa Barbara Channel on both blues and humpbacks.  The blue whales have a mottling pattern on their sides, below their dorsal fins which is unique to each individual.

<CENTER><BOLD><H1>The Condor - Whale Watching Information
</H1></BOLD></CENTER>
<H4>The 1996 summer whale watching season is in full swing.
 There is a flurry of very exciting activity with the presence of both the Blue and Humpback Whales off the northern coast of Santa Rosa Island.  Spectacular views of both species are reported on out day-long whale watching trips.  Other species reported include Dall's Porpoises, Common Dolphins, Risso's Dolphins, Pacific White-Sided Dolphins, Minke Whales, and lots of great sea birds!  The trips leave the Sea Landing by 8:00am and return at 5:00pm.  The journey takes passengers across the Santa Barbara Channel, along the shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands with a short trip into Painted Cave, the world's largest sea cave!<P>

We hope you will think of the Condor when you think
of whale watching. We offer the only truly professional
whale watching crew in the Santa Barbara area, which
is why the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History
chose the Condor for its whale watching program. All
whale watches on the Condor will have Whale Corp volunteers
from the museum aboard to enhance the experience
for you and your guests... and a portion of the
price of each ticket goes to benefit the Museum
of Natural History.<P>

The Condor is 88ft long, powered by whisper quiet,
environmentally sensitive, twin diesels, and offers
a full galley serving hot and cold meals, drinks
and a full cocktail bar. All of our trips are
professionally narrated and we offer all around
seating on deck and a full sun deck for enhanced
viewing of these magnificent animals.<P>

Our trips are guaranteed! If we don't sight whales,
or get a significant sighting of other marine mammals,
we issue a free ticket good for another trip during
this whale watch season.<P>

This promises to be the best year of whales ever...
we hope to see you aboard.<P>

<H3>The SBMNH Whale Corps has had a wonderful opportunity this summer to get involved with Cetacean research in the Santa Barbara Channel.  The project is known as WHAPS96 (Whale Habitat and Prey Study) and is in it's second year of existence.  Many groups from all over California such as <A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~cinms/index.html">CINMS</A>, SWMFS, UCSC, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and Cascadia Research are converging in the channel to study the occurrence, abundance, and feeding activities of the blue and humpback whales that can be found in our area between the months of April to October.  Little is known about the year long patterns of these animals and many questions about their biology may be explained through this research.<P>

Museum Whale Corp members and staff are assisting in this project by compiling sighting reports of blues and humpbacks from the vessel Condor, and by photographing individuals in attempts to identify them based on the identification catalogs of Cascadia Research who has been identifying both blue and humpback whales all along the coast of California and Baja.<P>

Staff members will be compiling these sightings reports and integrating them into our historical sightings database.  We have been documenting cetacean abundance and distribution in our local waters for over 20 years.  We will also be posting summaries of the current sightings of blue and humpback whales to allow everyone to see the methods in which data is collected and to learn the areas of concentration and numbers of animals in the channel.<P>

This is blubber, a thick layer of fat and connective tissue that covers the whales, dolphins, sea lions, and seals. In the whaling days the whalers caught the whales mainly for the blubber. The fat, when boiled down became an oily substance that they could use for many things, ranging from soap, to lantern fuel! For a list of <A HREF="product1.htm">whale products</A> click here

DESCRIPTION: Males up to 8 feet long, 600 pounds (occasionally to 1000 pounds); females grow to 6 feet long, 200 to rarely 600 pounds; general color is dark brown, with females generally lighter than males; adult male has a prominent crest on the forehead, the hair of which is lighter than on the rest of the body; ears present; flippers long and naked; rear flippers can be rotated under body for locomotion on land.

<br>
  A species of temperate and subtropical waters, the California Sea Lion breeds on offshore islands from the Santa Barbara Channel Islands to San Benito Island off the west coast of Baja California; on some islands in the Gulf of California; and along the west coast of mainland Mexico, south probably to Mazatlan. There is some post-breeding migration, primarily by adult and subadult males, in which they travel as far northward as British Columbia A subspecific population (Z. c. wollebaeki) is present in the Galapagos Islands, and another, (Z. c. japonicus), once considered extinct, is found in small numbers on Honshu Island, Japan.
<p>
The California Sea Lion is familiar to many people, not only because it is the most common and often seen pinniped along this coast but because it is the trained "seal" of circuses, toes and marine park shows.
It is easily trained, and does well in captivity. Their smaller size, dark color and staccato, bark-like calls distinguish them from the Steller's Sea Lion with which they may be associated. They are also seen with elephant seals. They mingle with these other species apparently without antagonism; not uncommonly sea lions have been seen sleeping on top of elephant seals where the two occur together.
<p>
   Sea lions are rapid, skillful swimmers, using their front flippers for propulsion. Curious and investigative, they will approach divers and boats quite loosely. They will "porpoise" over the surface of the water when trying to attain speed, and they will ride the crests of waves like surfers. Much of their time, however, is spent resting on sandy beaches, flat reefs of islands, buoys, and inaccessible spots on the
mainland. Groups of sea lions may rest on the surface in "rafts," flippers often extended into the air.
<p>
  Sea lions feed on a variety of foods. They mainly consume cephalopods (such as squid) and fish, but also eat crustaceans, mollusks -- even an occasional seabird! In captivity they are normally only fed (vitamin supplemented) fish, and on this diet they can thrive for more than 20 years. They are compulsive swallowers of hard, indigestible objects such as stones, which they may use for ballast or perhaps in aiding digestion. This is a habit that can cause them much misery, as they will ingest coins, pins, sixpack rings and even plastic bags with disastrous results.
<p>
  The breeding season is mainly in June and July. Just prior to this time the males, which spend most of their time north of the areas occupied by females and juveniles, move south to the rookeries on the islands. Bulls (mature males) become strongly territorial and aggressive, and those that are dominant establish territories. These are adiacent to the water, and the bull spends much time in the water patrolling bull for any length of time. A single young pup is born between mid-June and mid-July. Females
tend their pups closely for the first few days, but growth is rapid and within several weeks pups begin to gather in groups together. Females continue to nurse for several months to a year. Pups play in shallow water and on land during their early weeks, but as they grow older and larger
they venture farther out into the water.
<P>
   Mating occurs about two weeks after the pups are born. Gestation takes nearly a year, including a time of delayed implantation that allows the female to get back into good physical condition and to have her pup at the optimum season. Males leave the rookeries in late July and August, and again spread northward along the coast in bachelor herds.
<P>
   During the early part of the 19th century, sea lions were heavily hunted, mainly for oil. It took the blubber of three adult sea lions to procure a single barrel of oil. Aside from the fact that seal and whale oil is no longer needed, sea lions and other seals are now under the protection of
the Marine Mammal Act.

<p>Aside from man, predators upon sea lions are probably only large sharks and Killer Whales.

<h1><center>Cetaceans</center></h1>
<p>
<p>
The cetaceans are a very highly specialized group of mammals. All mammals are believed to have evolved on land from reptilian ancestors, but sometime between 30 and 70 million years ago several of these early mammals on land returned to sea, and in the eons that followed have become wonderfully adapted to the marine environment.
<p> They have developed a number of unique morphological characteristics that allow them to live their aquatic lives:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Hairless, streamlined bodies
<li>Forelimbs modified into paddle-like flippers
<li>External vestiges of hind limbs lacking
<li>Tail horizontally flattened, with lateral extensions called flukes
<li> Dorsal fin present or absent
<li>Sebaceous glands absent (in terrestrial mammals these lubricate the skin and fur)
<li>Sweat glands lacking
<li>Scent glands lacking
<li>Ear pinna (ear flaps) lacking
<li>Nipples of mammary glands of females retracted into slits on either side of vent when not in use
<li>Nostrils (blowholes) situated on top of head, rather posterior in position in all but the Sperm whale
<dl><dd><li>A pair of blow holes in baleen whales
<li>A single blowhole in toothed cetaceans
</dl></dd>
<li>Upper and lower jaws very elongate </ul>
In addition, cetaceans have a number of physiological adaptations to the marine existence:
<ul>
<li>A heavy layer of fat and connective tissue beneath the skin, called <A HREF="blubber.htm">blubber</A>, which may account for up to 1/3 of the body weight of some species; insulates against loss of body heat.
<li>Respiratory and circulatory systems specialized to withstand long periods underwater:
<dl><dd>
<li>The relative lung capacity of dolphins and porpoises is about 1 1/2 times that of terrestrial mammals, although the relative lung capacity in deep-diving whales is only about 1/2 that of terrestrial mammals.
<li>At depth the lungs compress, alveoli collapse and air is forced into non-respiratory air spaces which are supported by cartilage.
<li>The number of red blood corpuscles per cubic millimeter is about twice that of terrestrial mammals, thereby providing a greater holding capacity of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues.
<li>Pulse rate when submerged may drop to about 1/8 of what it may be at the surface.
<li>Circulatory shunts automatically reduce blood flow to certain body parts during dives, insuring adequate oxygen getting to the brain and heart, and heat to the vital core organs; many cetaceans rarely go more than a few minutes without coming to the surface to breath, but deep diving species may stay under for over an hour at depths of over 3,000 feet! (example: Sperm Whale)
<li>Skin provided with well-developed capillary networks; when the body gets overheated, blood passing through these tiny chambers near the body surface is cooled; likewise, when their body temperature drops, the flow of the blood to these peripheral areas is reduced, and body heat is thus conserved. The countercurrent heat exchange mechanism in the dorsal fins and flukes of cetaceans also involves an artery surrounded by veins.
</dd></dl>
<li>Locomotion is accomplished primarily by vertical movement of the posterior of the body, the broad flukes providing the push; the flippers function as stabilizers.
<li>They surface to breath, and apparently have no sense of smell.
<li>Sight is well developed in many species, although it is reduced in others, especially those inhabiting turbid (cloudy) waters. (ie. River Dolphins)
<li>
Many kinds of cetacean produce sounds covering a wide range of frequencies:
<dl><dd>
<li>In all large baleen whales, sounds are thought to function largely for social communication
<li>In toothed cetaceans sounds are also employed for orientation and food finding <A HREF="http://www.bev.net/education/SeaWorld/bottlenose_dolphin/echodol.html">(echo-location)</A>
<dd><dl><dl><li>Sound pulses are produced in nasal sacs and beamed in a certain direction:

<p>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>

Six feet long, up to 300 pounds (rarely 550 pounds); females to 5 feet
long, 150 pounds; muzzle short,
head noticeably round; color
extremely variable, from pale silver
gray spotted with black to dark brown
or almost black with spots hardly
discernable; flippers well-haired.
<p>
<B>OCCURENCE:</B>
<br>
  Called the Common Seal in Europe, this small "true" seal occurs along parts of the Arctic coast in
North America, Europe and Asia, as well as southward along the coasts of all three continents. Along the
east coast of North America it occurs as far south as North Carolina, while on the west coast it extends
south to Baja California. On the European coast it extends to Portugal and is in the Baltic Sea. In the
western Pacific it occurs southward to the coast of China

 <p> <b>BEHAVIOR:</B><br>The Harbor Seal is fairly common along the California coast, but is never found in large numbers.
They usually occur in groups ranging from a few to as many as 400 to 500, but they do not exhibit the
social behavior that is characteristic of sea lions, fur seals or elephant seals. They often occur in bays and
estuaries, resting on the sand at low tide. Along the outer coast they haul out onto reefs or small offshore
rocks. They are very wary and will seldom venture far from the water, they will plunge into it at the first
sign of danger or disturbance. Their movements on land are clumsy, hopping along on their bellies with
inchworm-like motions. In the water, they often swim with their heads above the surface to observe. They
are quite curious, and will follow the movements of a person on the beach from 50 or 100 yards offshore.

  Harbor Seals are notably silent, although they will frequently slap the surface of the water with their
flippers, a sound that can be heard for some distance. This presumably acts as a warning signal. Their
enemies, like those of other pinnipeds, are sharks, Killer Whales, and man.
<p>
<b>YOUNG:</b><br>  In California, young are born from March to May, born at low tide on a reef or sandbar and are able
to swim shortly thereafter. They are about 28 inches long at birth, and weigh about 25 pounds. Pups are
usually born singly; twins are born rarely, but if left to the natural mother only one will be reared, the
other being ignored. Pups are very light in color, and are born with an embryonic coat of soft, whitish fur
that is soon lost.

  It is not unusual for people to find newborn Harbor Seals on beaches or reefs and believe them to be
abandoned. Many of these are taken to toes, museums or marine parks. More often than not, the young
are not abandoned; the anxious mother is probably watching (frantically) from not far offshore.

  <p><b>DIET:</b><Br>Harbor Seals eat mainly fish, and also squid and shellfish They have been kept for more than 10 years
in captivity.

<title>What Lurks in the Depths of the Santa Barbara Channel?</title>

<head>What Lurks in the Depths of the Santa Barbara Channel?</b></head>
<h3>By Paul Scott, Department of Invertebrate Zoology</h3>

<h4>Slowly swimming by the craggy rocks, the greenspot rockfish is looking for prey amid the majestic glass vase sponges and giant white sea anemones. The fish's large eyes look for any movement on the lushly covered rock surface. Suddenly, a small segmented worm darts out from amongst the moss animals and solitary cup corals. The fish quickly sucks the worm between its strong jaws, and without stopping, continues in search of another snack.
<p>	Although dark and very cold, the depths of the Santa Barbara Channel burst with tremendous numbers of fascinating animals. Brittle stars wave their frilly arms attempting to catch morsels from the ocean bottom current. Sea stars dine on clumps of fat brachiopods while crimson crabs scurry about the encrusted rocks in search of carrion.
	<p>The Channel has been extensively studied since the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969, but little has been published on this rich transitional area between the warmer waters to the south and the much cooler to the north.
	<p>Actively pursuing its mission to increase knowledge of the natural history of the area, the Museum is serving as the axis for an international investigation on the abundant invertebrate life off Santa Barbara. Sea anemones, crabs, amphipods, sponges, clams, octopus, and brittle stars from the Channel have been packed up by Museum staff and sent off to specialists around the globe.
<p><center><img align=bottom alt="IMAGE" src="http://www.rain.org/~inverts/bulletin/July95/anemone.gif"></IMG></center>
<p>These scientists have written descriptions and provided illustrations for each of the 1,300 species we have collected. The Museum is collating their manuscripts into the most extensive guide to the deep water invertebrates ever written. The Taxonomic Atlas will be a 14-volume series (over 4,000 pages) on the incredibly diverse assemblage of animals living in the Channel from 100 to 1,000 meters deep.
	<p>Exploration of new regions often leads to new discoveries. That has certainly been the case in this project. Over 100 NEW SPECIES of animals have been found and are being described for the first time in our Atlas series. We have already published three Taxonomic Atlas volumes describing unsegmented worms, segmented worms, and deep water sponges. In the coming year, additional volumes will be produced on crustaceans, mollusks, moss animals, and sea stars.
	<p>An unexpected benefit to developing these guides has been the resounding response from the world scientific community. We posted the availability of the Atlas on the Internet in January, and have received non-stop inquiries ever since. Scientists and libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, and even a graduate student in Turkey have all wanted to learn more about the diversity of invertebrates in the Santa Barbara Channel.
	<p>Not only have we found strong and surprising affinities between the Santa Barbara Channel and other regions around the world, but we have also uncovered many unique qualities to our area. The Taxonomic Atlas series will provide a comprehensive blueprint for exploration of our Channel well into the next century.

<h1>Museum Notes</h1>
<p><p>
<h2>Dr. Breunig to Serve on National Museum Board</h2><p>
<h4>Museum Executive Director Dr. Robert Breunig was recently confirmed by the U. S. Senate to serve a second term on the National Museum Services Board (NMSB). The NMSB serves to guide the Director of the Institute of Museum Services (IMS) in policy matters. Dr. Breunig joins 14 other NMSB members selected from across the country to contribute specific expertise and broad knowledge of the entire museum field. <p>
	IMS is an independent agency within the Executive Branch of the federal government, established by Congress to encourage and assist museums in modernizing their methods and facilities so that they may be better able to conserve the nations cultural, historic, and scientific heritage. <p>
	NMSB is composed of 15 presidentially-nominated members confirmed by the Senate. Dr. Breunig began his first term in 1991, nominated by President Bush. Dr. Breunig is the only appointee to NMSB to be renominated by President Clinton. <p>
	IMS is the only federal agency that provides general operating support for museums of all disciplines. The agency supports museums educational roles through grant programs that encourage outstanding museum management and comprehensive collection care practices. <p>
	In the past, the Museum has been the recipient of numerous IMS grants, most recently including a general operating grant for 1994-95, and a grant to help renovate the Museums antiquated lighting and electrical systems. <p>
	Dr. Breunigs long museum career began in high school when he worked at the Childrens Museum of Indianapolis. His dedication to the museum field and conservation is reflected in numerous professional and community activities. He is currently a Senior Museum Associate for the Museum Management Institute. In the past he has been a committee chairman for the Western Museums Conference, a member of the board of trustees for the Center for Plant Conservation, president of the Museum Association of Arizona, and vice-president of the board of directors for the Arizona Native Plant Society. </h4><p><p><p>

Begin your search with "Job Description." Use "Any Of" to keep your search
broad, "All Of" to narrow your search. You may further define your search by
specifying other fields (e.g., job title, company, city, etc.). When
specifying a job title, you'll usually get more returns by using word roots
instead of the entire word (e.g., use "account" to search for "accountant" or
"accounting").

<h1>Our Country</h1>
<p>
Diverse, distinct, and very cool.  Being Canadian can mean many things, but to
most, being Canadian means living in one of the greatest countries in the
world.  Part of what we think makes Canada great is its diversity, commitment
to change and an abundance of resources.  
<p>
We profile Canadian cities and provide links to sites that will
help you get to know them better ... and help with any travel plans you might
be arranging. As always, your suggestions are welcome.  
<p>

<p>
<b>Where to?</b>  How about ...
<p>
<center><img src=/cm/canada/images/calgary.gif border=0 alt="Calgary"></center>
<p>
<p>
A western city, with a uniquely western flavour, Calgary has seen significant changes over the past fifteen years. Still the oil and gas hub of the country, Calgary has evolved to become a high technology centre with a strong base of local and international businesses. For many, Calgary is once again, the place to be.
<p>
But hey! Don't think Calgary's lost the charm that's made it a real western town. The Calgary Stampede is still one of the biggest attractions of its kind ... anywhere. And if horses and steers aren't your 'cup of tea', journey a little 'bit west towards Priddis and beyond, and you'll find yourself in some of Canada's most beautiful country. It's a magical journey ... from prairie, to foothills to mountains. Hiking, climbing, skiing. You can do it all, and you can do it with style.
<p>
If professional sports is more your style, catch a Flames game. And for the culturally adventurous, there are museums and history galore. The bottom line is that Calgary is a thriving urban centre that offers more than you could possibly imagine.
<p>

<h1>Post Your Resume</h1>
Posting your resume to the CareerMosaic Canada ResumeCM is easy. Simply fill
out the form below, and enter your resume into the box provided. If you
already have an ASCII text resume, you may copy and paste it into the box. 
<p>
If you do not want to write your resume online, you can go offline and compose
your resume using your favorite word-processing application. Since you will
copy your resume as ASCII text, remember to avoid special characters (e.g.,
"smart quotes," mathematical symbols, etc.) and tabs
(use your spacebar instead). Fonts will become whatever a computer uses as its
default face and size, so boldface, italics, and various sizes will not appear
in the ASCII version. 

<p>
For tips on how to prepare your resume, check out the CareerMosaic Canada
<a href=/cm/canada/canada9.html>Career Resource Center</a>.
You'll find helpful articles, links to wide variety of
resources to help you with composition, grammar, spelling, and other skills,
as well as examples of good resumes. 
<p>
Your resume will appear after the next indexing session (within 24 hours), and will remain on 
the CareerMosaic Canada ResumeCM database for six months. You are welcome to post another resume when yours expires.

<p>
<b>Please fill in each box, all of these fields are required.</b>
<p>

<h1>Get Your Fresh, Hot Jobs!</h1>
<p>
We are averaging over 57,000 postings daily from the top USENET newsgroups,
and our index is rebuilt every 24 hours on a rolling basis. The postings are
always current, as we expire them every seven days. With so many postings, the
more specific you can be, the more relevant the response will be. 
<p>
Use the search box below. An "ideal" search might be: "UNIX and Toronto,"
which would find jobs mentioning UNIX and Toronto.  You have to use "and"
between each word since the search uses "or" as the default. Select a province
or state from the scroll box on the right to find opportunities in the area of
interest to you (your choice will be added as an "and" to your search
criteria; you may select "No Location" if you wish). 
<p>
Also go to our <a href=/cm/canada/canada2.html>CareerMosaic Canada J.O.B.S.</a> (Jobs Offered By Search) page.  You'll find thousands of jobs from hundreds of top employers in
high tech, health care, finance, retailing, and other fields. It's a
CareerMosaic exclusive!

<b>NEW Employers Section for Faster Loading</b>
<p>
You'll notice a new look to the Employers section of CareerMosaic. Instead of one, 
giant (and getting larger every day) image, we've divided the employers into 
roughly equal groups. Click on the letter group of your choice in the masthead above to begin your 
survey of today's top employers in high tech, finance, health care, 
retailing, communications, and other fields. As you visit each group, 
the masthead will allow you to navigate to other letter groups or you 
can explore the employers listed in that group.
<p>
New employers are added to the appropriate letter group, so be sure to check often in all groups, as we are adding new employers all the time.

<h1>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. Database</h1>


Begin your search with "Job Description." Use "Any Of" to keep your search broad, "All Of" to narrow your search. You may further define your search by specifying other fields, e.g., job title, company, city, etc. When specifying a job title, you'll usually get more returns by using word roots instead of the entire word (e.g., use "account" to search for "accountant" or "accounting").

We also offer a <a href=/cm/usenet-help.html>search page with detailed instructions</a>.

<b>Who Exactly Are We?</b>
<p>
Nortel is one of the world's most broadly diversified developers of telecommunications
products and systems in four network businesses - Wireless Networks, Public Carrier Networks, Broadband 
Networks and Enterprise Networks.
<p>
<b>Now that we have that out of the way, this is what we do.</b>
<p>
We work as a partner with customers worldwide to offer an unmatched breadth of products for designing, 
building and integrating digital networks for information, entertainment, education and business.
<p>
<b>The name is Nortel, but you might call us... </b>
<p>
You've probably used our products, so you might know us by our product names. Phones for the home and 
business like <b>Interlude, Jazz, Maestro, Nomad, PowerTouch, Quick Touch, Silhouette and Meridian.</b> 
If you're familiar with the world of broadband technology then you may have heard of Magellan.<b> Magellan </b>
products on the market today include <b>Magellan Passport</b> and <b>Concorde</b> switching systems, 
and Nortel's highly 
successful <b>DPN-100</b> data networking switch. 
<p>
These names are, however, just a fraction of our products and initiatives. For a more extensive 
overview of all our products, you can link directly to the 
<a href=http://www.nortel.com>Nortel Home Page</a>
<p>
In short, we make everything from wireless phones and networks for business and personal use, to switching platforms for phone companies in the constantly evolving communications marketplace. We also develop broadband networks for cable and multimedia providers so that they can transmit ultra high resolution video and graphic images that require much more bandwidth in order to be moved quickly. When it comes to communications, we are on the cyber edge of all aspects of wired development and totally hands free when it comes to staying in touch, no matter where you are.
<p>
So, <b>how</b> do we stay at the forefront of these constantly changing technologies? 
We put 17,000 heads together! 
<p>
Nortel's research and development division is one of the world's largest research organizations, with over $2 billion invested annually. Of our approximately 63,000 employees worldwide, more than 17,000 of them work in research and development. We have 17,000 minds researching, designing, developing, integrating and testing some of the hottest and coolest products on the planet. 
<p>
Nortel's research presence around the world includes a network of 33 R&D facilities in 11 countries, 
affiliated joint ventures, university research chairs, and other collaborations fostering innovative product 
development and advanced design research.
<p>
<b>That's how!</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Nortel: A World of Networks</b>
<p>
In 1995, Nortel had revenues of $10.7 billion (U.S.) and currently has approximately 63,000 employees worldwide. 1995 was also Nortel's 100th Anniversary and it marked a century of innovation, leadership and challenges. Those are some pretty big numbers and they translate into a lot of initiatives, services and products ... and opportunities. 
<p>
We view ourselves as architects of "A World of Networks."  To people at home, at work, and on the move, networks offer vital links to each other and the world. To corporations, networks provide "telecompetitiveness" by integrating their businesses with partners, suppliers, and customers. To service providers, wired and wireless networks generate revenue by delivering new ways to inform, entertain, and communicate with further enhancements on the horizon through the convergence of telephones, computers, and cable/video/television. To students of any age, networks are a link to information, classmates, teachers, families, and businesses across town, and around the world.
<p>
So there you go. A quick overview of what we do. Now you will 
probably want to know a little bit more about Nortel and the types of career opportunities we can 
offer you. Check out what is currently available in our 
<a href=/cm/nortel/nortel7.html>Menu of Opportunities.</a> For information on what

What makes Nortel so unique? As you can imagine, when a company operates around the world with so many sites in countries from China to Germany, there are a lot of different cultures. So how do you manage to set a common understanding for business operations that everybody can relate to and use as a guide? Simple ...
<p>
<b>Nortel's Core Values</b>
<p>
<menu>
<li> We create superior value for our customers.
<li> We work to provide shareholder value.
<li> Our people are our strength.
<li> We share one vision / We are one team.
<li> We have only one standard - excellence.
<li> We fulfill our commitments and act with integrity.
<li> We embrace change and reward innovation.
</menu>
<p>
<b>A Guide to Ethical Business Practices</b>
<p>
We trust our employees and we believe that our own personal values and integrity will guide us in the right direction. We also believe in giving people the responsibility they need to do their job effectively and part of that responsibility is taking leadership in ethical decision making.
<p>
We provide all of our employees with Nortel's 
<a href=http://www.nortel.com/ethics/>Code of Business Conduct</a> which is meant to be used as a resource and 
guide to making the right decision. When employees have questions or concerns about business practices, their first 
responsibility is to use the corporate resources we've put at their disposal to find out more. We've made it that 
simple because we believe that adherence to our corporate values is that important.
<p>
<blockquote><b>
"As an operating principle, we will conduct our business honestly and ethically wherever we operate in the world. Acting with integrity builds credibility - that fragile, intangible asset that's so hard to gain, so easy to lose, and so difficult to regain. Ethical conduct is the way we protect our credibility as a company, establish respect for the dignity of every individual, earn the trust of our partners and customers, and define the character of our business."</b>
<br>
Jean C. Monty, President and Chief Executive Officer
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Leadership in Every Aspect of Our Business</b>
<p>
How does this translate into everyday business practices? As excited as we get about our products and initiatives, there is more to leadership than just creating the latest and greatest technological innovations.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>"Our corporation encourages and desires a diverse employee population because we believe that a diversity of interests,
 backgrounds and perspectives will produce more imaginative ideas and better decisions."</b>
<br>
Jean C. Monty, President and Chief Executive Officer
</blockquote>
<p>

<img src=/cm/nortel/images/nortel3b.gif img align=left alt="">
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leadership is knowing that we live, work and play in a world where there exists a delicate balance between human 
initiative and nature. Because our environment sustains us, you will find that Nortel plays a full and active role 
in promoting awareness and understanding of that delicate balance. For more information check out

<font size=+2>W</font>e're a company with vision. We're a company with history. Perhaps most important, we are a company that is not afraid to say that we've learned from our mistakes. We began business building snowmobiles out of a garage. The product was a failure. But we learned and moved on. We began manufacturing high speed molds for thinwall containers. It was very successful ... and today we supply entire injection molding systems for customers around the world. 
<p>
<font size=+2>O</font>ur mandate - to make a significant contribution to our customers' success - 
is achieved through: providing a rewarding workplace, quality manufacturing and excellence in customer 
service; excelling in our core business and providing customers with the most reliable product through quality management and leading edge technology; and strengthening our core business through strategic alliances with the best companies in the world.
<p>
<font size=+2>O</font>ur operating divisions are: 

<a href="#F">Advanced Manufacturing Center;</a> 
<a href="#G">Mold Operations; </a> 
<a href="#H">Machine Operations; </a> 
<a href="#I">Robotics Division; </a> and

<p>
<font size=+2>F</font>or over 40 years, Husky has developed innovative manufacturing solutions for the injection molding industry. This evolution led to the birth of the Advanced Manufacturing Center, or AMC.
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he AMC provides customers with facilities and expertise to accelerate the 
development of new technologies and reduce manufacturing costs. Through technology 
alliances with companies like Demag and GE, we bring together our traditional 
manufacturing strengths with key suppliers and other mold makers to offer total 
factory automation solutions and optimized manufacturing plants. Our fully-equipped 
AMC is designed for optimum production flexibility 
and accommodates a broad range of customer applications. Combining this state-of-the-art 
manufacturing facility with 'hands-on' production experience and engineering resources, 
we provide services designed to support customers in the development of solutions to 
meet their specific injection molding needs. Our services include: Workcell Design; 
Systems Integration & Production; Factory Planning; and Training.

<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>hat does Mold Operations do? Deliver molds that produce products you probably use in everyday life. From soft drink bottles to salad dressing containers, you run into products we helped manufacture virtually everywhere.
<p>
<font size=+2>O</font>ur strategy is based on specialization ... enabling us to standardize and automate our process. We've moved to dedicated plants and are focusing technology and manufacturing expertise to meet the specific needs of customers worldwide. As a matter of fact, from the time a specific inquiry for a mold is made, a project engineer is assigned to that customer. They're responsible for everything from ensuring that the mold design meets the customer's specification to on-time delivery.
<p>
<font size=+2>M</font>eeting the needs of our customers is ensured by continuous reinvestment in training, business processes and equipment. We've implemented advanced business and scheduling systems to track costs. Real-time scheduling of all work centers plays a key role in ensuring we continually meet delivery schedules. And we've backed up that investment with over 14,000 hours of training. 
<p>
<font size=+2>M</font>old Operations operates in 

<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/canada/ontario/toronto/>Bolton, Canada</a> and

<p>
<font size=+2>H</font>usky began building injection molding machines over 30 years ago in response to our mold customers' need for a machine that could operate their thinwall molds more profitably. The solution was a 100 ton, fully mechanical machine that cycled 50 shots per minute. And while many of our early machines are still in operation, today, our Moduline consists of a range of pre-engineered modules that can be selected to meet the specific requirements of any molding application.
<p>
<font size=+2>I</font>n 1987, we started building large tonnage machines ... with the first of many sold to a US automotive molder. Today, our large tonnage machines range from 900 to 3650 tonnes (1000-4000 US tons) and produce parts for a wide range of applications, from automotive and appliance to garden furniture, industrial and waste containers and material handling. 
<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>e take a global view of our business and a great deal of pride in our ability to supply complete manufacturing systems to ensure prompt support for equipment operating throughout North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Pacific Rim. Our machines have always been designed to meet the most exacting standards ... and always will.
<p>
<font size=+2>M</font>achine Operations sites are in 

<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/canada/ontario/toronto/>Bolton, Canada ... </a>

<p>
<font size=+2>H</font>usky started as a mold maker more than 40 years ago ... and began building injection molding machines and robots in the 1960s. As a single source supplier of injection molding systems, we've earned a reputation for innovation in the development of automated product handling systems for the plastics industry. 
<p>
<font size=+2>O</font>ur robotics and product handling systems have been developed for applications as diverse as ... housewares... cutlery... test tubes... petri dishes... CD cases... PET preforms... closures... conveyor components... resin furniture... automotive parts, from tail lights to large interior panels... and industrial containers.  
<p>
<font size=+2>H</font>usky introduced servo-drive robots in 1988 for improved speed, reliability and performance. Over 600 robots have been shipped to customers in over 50 countries.

<font size=+2>E</font>xcellent customer service. It's critical to success. And it's an 
integral part of our operating philosophy. We operate a de-centralized Service & Sales 
organization that allows us to be closer to our customers ... both geographically and in 
a business sense. We have 26 regional offices meeting the needs of customers in over 65 countries. 
These Regional Offices are part of the Husky organization, which differentiates us from those who use agents.
<p>
<font size=+2>A</font>t the very heart of our de-centralization are regional Technical centers. They're located in: 

<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/california/los_angeles/>Los Angeles, California; </a>
<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/luxembourg/>Dudelange, Luxembourg; </a>
<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/japan/>Yokohama, Japan;</a> and 
<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/georgia/atlanta/>Atlanta, Georgia. </a>

These Technical centers offer machine and mold training, systems integration and technical support. We operate an 80,000 
square foot global spare parts facility in 

<a href=http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/new_york/buffalo/>Buffalo, New York,</a> from which parts are shipped directly to customers throughout the world.

<font size=+2>B</font>uilding a company takes more than just growing sales. It takes values and vision. With strong values and a broad vision, a company can evolve into a lasting institution. It can make an impact ... it can make a difference. Not only for the people who work and grow with that company, but to people beyond the boundaries of business. People in a community that is not just around the corner ... but around the world.
<p>
<font size=+2>O</font>ur vision is inspired by our core values ... values that we live 
by and adhere to everyday. We believe so much in these values, that we've been known to 
turn down work that would have compromised them. And while those decisions have 
sometimes been difficult at the time ... they have gone a long way to making us 
who we are, and proven to be wise in the long run. The future belongs to companies
that take a long-term view and have a vision and purpose beyond money. Our core values are:


<p>
<dl>

<dd><img src=/cm/husky/images/husky3b.gif align=middle alt="">  Uncompromising honesty.
<p>
<dd><img src=/cm/husky/images/husky3c.gif align=middle alt="">  Genuine care for all who are affected by what we do.
<p>
<dd><img src=/cm/husky/images/husky3d.gif align=middle alt="">  Proactive environmental responsibility.
<p>
<dd><img src=/cm/husky/images/husky3e.gif align=middle alt="">  Drive to do things much better.

</dl>



<font size=+2>A</font>s Robert Schad, President of Husky says:
<p>
<blockquote>
"I have always wanted to build more than a business. I wish to create an institution that will be known for its commitment to 
society. The spirit of this commitment is reflected in many ways ... we contribute to charitable causes and embrace the 
environment, health and education. Furthermore, we will not take on projects that compromise the environment. 
The future of our company is based on our ability to understand, communicate and practice our values. In doing so, 
each and every one of us is empowered to make a positive contribution."
<p>
</blockquote>



<p>
<font size=+2>H</font>onesty and integrity mean everything at Husky. The Honor 
Code is more than just words. It's an integral part of our operating principles. 
Breach that code, and you disqualify yourself from participating in the community of trust that 
is Husky. That trust extends well beyond that which might be normally expected. It's the 
practical embodiment of everything we do. There are no executive perks, no preferred 
parking, no executive dining room. 
We trust in people's judgement and in their desire to be honest and forthright. 
<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>e live our working lives based on that honor code. Whether it's a simple matter of making your own change when paying for your food in one of our three diverse, subsidized cafeterias (we only have cashiers during peak hours), filling out your own time sheets (no time clocks anywhere), or putting through expenses without an encumbering expense claim bureaucracy, you'll find that code extends into every aspect of our business and our corporate culture.

<img src=/cm/husky/images/husky4b.gif alt""> people worldwide make up team Husky. 
They all share in our success and they all share in the benefits of our operating philosophy. 
We constantly endeavor to attract and retain the very best people. 
We support life-long learning and encourage employees to strive to reach their 
fullest potential ... and place strong emphasis on training and career development. 
<p>
<font size=+2>E</font>veryone will pay you for the work you do. And, most likely, that pay will be competitive. But we believe that, while compensation should reflect your dedication and commitment, it should also encourage you to continually better yourself and feel as if you're part of a team that encourages you to grow.
<p>
<font size=+2>H</font>ow do we do that? For starters, we pay 100% of fees for tuition, registration, course materials and required text books. Our incentive strategy is based on performance and designed to develop a sense of ownership.  We have a unique and rewarding retirement savings plan and our outstanding benefits plan extends well beyond accepted norms.  
<p>
<font size=+2>A</font>nd to give you a sense of just how important our employees' 
well-being really is ... when we identified the need to provide on-site child 
care facilities, we didn't just convert an existing building or space. 
Instead, we hired a child care expert to provide guidance, leadership and expertise. 
As a result, "The Copper House" is equipped with the latest educational materials and superb
creative facilities to provide a warm and nurturing environment where children can grow and develop.
 Parents can visit their children as it fits into their day.  
<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>hether it's fitness centers, cafeterias that serve wholesome food, subsidized naturopathic care or performance based compensation, we do nothing in half measures. Why? Simply put, we wouldn't be who we are - or where we are - today, without our employees.
<p>
<p>
<img src=/cm/husky/images/husky4c.gif alt""> at Husky exist in Canada, the US, Europe and Asia. We're a global company and we have global hiring requirements.
<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>hat we look for most, are Mechanical Engineers. 
They are, without a doubt, the intellectual capital of our company. 
However, we recognize it takes more than that to build a successful company.  
We look for people who have energy ... thrive on project ownership ... and enjoy working in fast 
paced environments.

<img src=/cm/husky/images/husky5b.gif  alt="Many companies "> talk about a commitment to the environment. We live that commitment everyday. We will never - ever - knowingly pollute the air, water or ground in the towns, cities and rural areas in which we manufacture. In 1994, we received the Lieutenant Governor's Conservation Award for outstanding achievements in conserving and protecting the natural environment in Ontario.
<p>
<img src=/cm/husky/images/husky5c.gif alt="In the workplace "> we make every effort to reduce waste, recycle and reuse materials such as lubricating and cooling compounds. Energy saving programs have been put into place and several plants have already been retrofitted with high efficiency lighting. In our product design, we conserve energy with water-cooled motors. Our Environmental Committee is empowered to address every issue in the company that in anyway impacts the environment. It is chaired by the Director of Environment and can stop any project if work is perceived to endanger the environment.
<p>
<img src=/cm/husky/images/husky5d.gif alt="In 1993, "> we established the Husky Environmental 
Award recognizing products and processes in the injection molding industry that have - 
and continue to make - a major contribution to the environment. The intent is to promote 
environmental solutions that reduce waste and pollution while conserving energy and natural 
resources. The 1995 winner of US$150,000.00 was A.R. Arena Products Inc.  
The winner of the 1996 award will be announced in May.

endeavors with a focus on the environment, health, education, and community. We take an active interest 
in the 
<a href=http://www.panda.org/home.htm> World Wild Life Federation</a> and have had many noted conservationists such as Jane Goodall and David 
Suzuki address our employees.

<h1>Get Your Fresh, Hot Jobs!</h1></center>
<p>
Welcome to our index of over <b>60,000 postings daily</b> from the top USENET
newsgroups. To search most effectively, connect your keywords with "AND" (e.g., "UNIX and New and
York," which would find jobs mentioning UNIX and New York. You have to
use "and" between each word since the search uses "or" as the default.
Select a state or province from the scroll box on the right to find
opportunities in the area of interest to you (your choice will be added
as an "and" to your search criteria; you may select "No Location" if
you wish).

Details about our index of USENET
</h2>
</center>
<p>
Our index is rebuilt every 24 hours on a rolling basis.
The postings are always current, as we expire them every seven days.
With so many postings, the more specific you can be, the more relevant
the response will be.
<p>
For your information, USENET is a collection of newsgroups distributed electronically around 
the world.  Also known as USENET Newsgroups, USENET can be thought of as a world wide 
bulletin board system with newsgroups numbering in the thousands.  CareerMosaic indexes 
the newsgroups that are of interest to the job seeker and recruiting department thereby 
saving you a great deal of time.  USENET is not an organization and therefore no one 
person or group is in charge of it as a whole, rather, many USENET sites are at 
universities and a large number of sites are now commercial organizations.

Real people find real jobs with CareerMosaic.  They write in from all over to tell us their true stories: 
how CareerMosaic helped them get new jobs.  From the newly-employed graduate who writes "I responded 
to an ad on the <a href=/cm/usenet.html>J.O.B.S. database</a> (and) I start my new job ... in two weeks" to the recent hire who 
tells us that <a href=/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a> started generating responses for him "within 48 hours after posting my resume," 
to the ex-job seeker who tells us that the CareerMosaic <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employers</a> section "gave me ... access to the 
information I needed (about) the companies I was interested in," job seekers around the world are 
discovering that the resources on CareerMosaic really work.  For these and more true stories, keep reading:

<p>



"I interviewed with 15 companies through CareerMosaic.  There would have been no other way I would 
have been able to get in contact with these employers.  This is the most challenging and rewarding 
position I have ever had.  I can honestly thank CareerMosaic for providing this wonderful service.  
I have recommended your service to everyone I know."
<br><i>- J. G., Georgia</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"I have obtained a very well paying and exciting job ... through CareerMosaic ... at a company 
which is at the very top in my field.  CareerMosaic gave me the access I needed to get the 
information I needed with regard to companies I was interested in.  The best part of my story 
is that I obtained this job, even before graduation. Thanks to you, I will not be wasting any 
time between graduation and joining the work force."
<br><i>- L. J., Florida</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"I applied for a position on the J.O.B.S database ... I had several phone interviews and then I 
found myself on a plane from New Hampshire to Tampa, FL for a personal interview ... I was then 
offered a position one week later.  I was a product marketing manager (in my old job) and I have 
now moved to (a company), which is 10 times larger, as a product manager in their retail software 
division. CareerMosaic really gets you results!"
<br><i>- R.G., Florida </i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"CareerMosaic was INVALUABLE in finding my new job ... recruiters were calling me daily.  I give 
the CareerMosaic URL to anybody I encounter that is either hiring or looking for a job."
<br><i>- M. K., Tucson, AZ</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"What happened was that I got hired by (a major software company) for the corporate online 
marketing group -- thanks to  CareerMosaic!!!  Isn't that wonderful?  I never thought e-mailing 
my resume to (the Company) ... was going to lead to this.  One day I get a phone call, the next 
week I go in for an interview, and the next thing I know, the offer is in the mail."
<br><i>- P.L., California</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"Upon receiving my MBA, my career objective was primarily focused on Interactive 
Marketing; newspapers and career centers at schools rarely list these types of 
jobs. CareerMosaic became a constant resource in my search and ultimately helped 
me achieve my goal.  I never dreamed I would get the "perfect" job immediately after graduation."
<br><i>- T. P., Ohio</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"After my friend showed me how to get into CareerMosaic, I spent one hour locating 
positions, then filled out the (on line) resume form.  After two weeks, the company 
called me for the interview, and I got the job.  CareerMosaic is very helpful."
<br><i>- O. V., New York</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"I wouldn't have had this great new opportunity if it wasn't for CareerMosaic. 
Within 48 hours after posting my resume, I started to receive inquiries. In less 
than two weeks (!) I received an offer for a great new job, for a much better salary."
<br><i>- H.B., California</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"Just got hired as a contractor by (the Company) to work at the (Company) Computer 
Center - in the Command Theatre.   I started working there yesterday actually and I like 
it very much.  Next week the new hires will go to Little Rock, AR, for a full week of training.  
Then it's back to the Computer Center where I will answer calls from customers and using 
(the Company's products), I will help customers find a resolution to their problems or 
service needs.  As I said earlier, I just started working yesterday so there are a lot 
more interesting and exciting elements of my new job I haven't told you yet but I am 
sure will happen in the following weeks to come."
<br><i> - J. M., Louisiana</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

"I am a Senior Manager with Worldwide Network and Desktop Consulting practice, 
Global Customer Services, at (the Company). Our group provides management 
consulting, program management, network assessments, network integration, 
and network management to wide variety of customers world wide. It is a 
challenging and rewarding job I found while browsing the WWW on CareerMosaic's home page."
<br><i>- E.R., New York</i>
<br>
<hr width=50%>

<h1>CareerMosaic Awards</h1>
</center>

<p>
<b>Pardon Us for Beating Our Own Drum, But...</b>
<p>
...we at CareerMosaic are proud of the recognition and accolades we've received from the 
Internet community. Such acclaim lets us know we're doing a good job, and also helps 
millions of those interested in their careers (folks like you!) find us more easily.

The first award out of the box is the "4-Star Site Award" given to CaraarMosaic by
<a href=http://magellan.mckinley.com/review.cgi?sid=34263>The McKinley Group</a> 
 -- the highest rating an Internet site can achieve in Magellan, 
McKinley's comprehensive Internet directory of over 1.5 million sites and 40,000 reviews.
<p>
CareerMosaic has been added to the
<a href=http://www.bigbook.com>BigBook ShortList</a>, a hand-picked collection of the best shopping aids on
the Web. Look for our listing in the Business Services category under
Employment Agencies. After being nominated and reviewed, CareerMosaic was 
selected to receive the <a href="http://www.webcom.com/biztobiz/">All Internet Business-to-Business Directory's</a> 
"Top Business Site" award.
<p>
<a href=http://www.eyeontheweb.com/dyn.cgi/categories/ts.html>EyeOnTheWeb</a> 
is dedicated to reducing the glut of information on the Web to a manageable level. 
They focus on sites that show superior design, depth, value of content, suitability for the Web,

Industry. And, <a href=http://www.pointcom.com/reviews/database/carmoz.html>Point Communications</a> 
ranks CareerMosaic among the "Top 5% of all Web Sites".
<p>
The "Super Site Award" we received from <a href=http://info-s.com/sites.html>Maczynski's Info Service</a> 
is also among our treasures, as is the "Best Of The Planet Award" bestowed upon CareerMosaic 
by the <a href="http://www.2ask.com/">2ask Internet Directory</a> in the category of Online Business & Services: Job Search.

CareerMosaic was chosen by <a href="http://techweb.cmp.com/hpc/websites/30WEB12.HTM">HomePC</a> as one of "The Top 500 on the 
Web" in their first Best Web Sites survey. 
CareerMosaic is prominently featured in Shannon Turlingon's 
<a href=http://www.vmedia.com/newhome2.html>Walking the World Wide Web</a> 
as being "a huge resource" and "an invaluable guide." Our inclusion in both the first 
and second editions of this bestseller is quite a tribute!
<p>
CareerMosaic has also been recognized as a "Pick of the Month of Interesting Business 
Sites on the Web" list at <a href="http://owi.com/netvalue/">Net.Value</a>, the Web Strategy Forum. We are  
an <a href=http://www.cciweb.com/iway500/profess.html>Iway 500</a> winner in the Professional 
Resources category of the "Iway 500 Listing of the best 500 Web Sites in the World".

<title>Detailed Search Description</title>

<BODY background="" bgcolor="#ffffff" >

</pre>
<h1>JOBS.OFFERED</h1>
<p>
<form method=get action=http://jobs.hodes.com/j2/owa/srch.jl>

Now you can find your ideal job with a few simple keystrokes. CareerMosaic
allows you to search our comprehensive database of opportunities which
include current jobs from around the world. Start with the first field-- Job
Description-- then define your search through other parameters such
as company or location.  Note:  It is not necessary to fill in every field or section, however, it will greatly help narrow your search.
<p>
A general rule of thumb-- the more specifically you describe your dream job,
the faster the search will happen. Even though a CareerMosaic search can yield
dozens of jobs, the database must search through several hundred at a time.
Fill in as much detail as you can to make your search zip along. All searches
are case insensitive-- "new york" will work as well as "New York" or even
"NEw yOrK" (just pray there's no typing test for your job).
<p>
<pre>

<img src=/cm/images/Description.gif alt="">
</pre>
Description: <input type="radio" name="cj" value="and" checked> All of
<input type="radio" name="cj" value="or"> Any of
<input type="text" size=50 name="ds" value=""><p>

If you want to broaden your search here, you must specify "ANY OF." That
tells CareerMosaic you want one word or another or another, etc., as in
"driver OR Formula One OR Ferrari." Unfortunately, any job description with
the word "one" in it would appear. To get the job responsibilities you want,
leave the default "ALL OF," which translates to "driver AND Formula One AND
Ferrari." Then tell Gerhard Berger "hi" from us.
<pre>

<img src=/cm/images/Title.gif alt="">
</pre>
Title: <input type="text" size=30 name="ti" value="">
<p>
This is a full text indexed section, so use word roots (e.g., "pil" yields
job titles containing the words "pilot," "pillow fluffer," "pill taster,"
etc.) to cover the variations in titles. You can specify more than one word
to find only those jobs of greatest interest to you, but they must match
exactly (e.g., "duck feathers quality assurance manager" will not yield
"manager of duck feathers quality").
<pre>

<img src=/cm/images/Company.gif alt="">
</pre>
Company: <input type="text" size=30 name="co" value="">
<p>
If you are interested in a particular company, put that name in here. This is
full text indexed, so if you just put "Int" for example, you get
"Intelligent," "International," "Intact," etc. If you specify "Intergalactic,
Inc." you might miss the company you want (known as "Intergalatic Corp.").
<pre>

<img src=/cm/images/City.gif alt="">
</pre>
City: <input type="text" size=20 name="ct" value="">

<center><h2>"Ask Kit" -- Practical Answers For The Emerging Work Force</h2></center>

<p>
<b>You've got questions -- we've got answers.</b> 
<p>
There are some things you just can't ask your roommate. For instance, should you put your GPA on your resume? Or how many paragraphs your cover letter should be? For accurate answers to questions like these, you've come to the right place.
<p>
Not only do we post questions and answers as a column, we go a step further by encouraging you to <a href="/cm/cc/cc35.html">Ask Kit</a> -- our On-line Editor -- your employment-related questions. If your question is picked, Kit will answer it in one of our quarterly columns, appearing right here on this page. Answers to previous questions are housed in our<a href="/cm/cc/cc13.html"> Q&A Archive.</a></p>
<br>


<b>Now on to the pressing issues:</b><br>
<p>
<b>Dear Kit,</b><br>
I've heard horror stories about how difficult it is to get a job these days. Is the job market really as bad as people are making it out to be?<br>
 -- Hopeful
<p>
<b>Dear Hopeful,</b><br>
If you're serious about getting a job, you shouldn't worry. A survey conducted in 1995 by the College Placement Council found that, of the 227 employers it questioned, 50 percent were planning to hire more recent college graduates than they had in 1994. Similar trends are predicted for 1996 -- that is, employers anticipate hiring more new graduates than in years past. This doesn't mean, however, that you should sit back and wait for the job offers to roll in. You'll need to prove to employers that you have what they want -- and what they want is an employee who demonstrates excellent oral communication skills, interpersonal skills, and someone who places importance on teamwork. If you already have job experience -- through internships, co-ops, or other employment -- that will be another selling point to future employers. By honing your presentation and focusing on your job search it should be only a matter of months before you find a position that is right for you. If your job search takes longer, you should reevaluate your job hunting strategy.
<pre>

<b>Dear Kit,</b><br>
I'm about to begin my first professional job and am concerned about how to dress. It's expensive buying new clothes -- especially suits -- and if I can avoid going on a shopping spree my checkbook would thank me.<br>
 -- Frazzled in Philly
<p>
<b>Dear Fraz,</b><br>
Buying new clothes on an entry-level budget can be tight. You should keep in mind, however, that you will be judged on your appearance. Before you begin your job, ask your supervisor if there is an official office policy concerning dress. Some offices and industries frown on casual dress, while others are pretty liberal about it. The type of position you will be holding may also influence what you should wear. The best advice is, if you are concerned, wear professional attire until you establish what is appropriate for your office. And if you currently own enough nice outfits to get you through the first few weeks, you can put off that shopping trip for a while. 
<pre>

<b>Dear Kit,</b><br>
How important are summer jobs and internships if I want to get a full-time position when I graduate? -- Heather
<p>
<b>Dear Heather,</b><br>
That question is tougher than it seems. On one hand, there is no substitute for experience. Employers like to see resumes representative of motivated people, and the number and types of jobs you've held prior to graduating will give them an indication of seriously you take being employed. On the other hand, employers realize that many graduates simply have not been given the opportunity to work a lot before graduating. So, don't feel like you have to prove you've worked every summer since you were 10, but, if you haven't already, go get a summer job. Being employed in any position -- especially ones that will give you experience in your career field -- will be an asset to you once you begin looking for a full-time job. And who knows -- that summer job may eventually lead to something more permanent.

<center><h2>The CollegeConnection's Official Resume Proofreading Checklist</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Print a copy of this checklist and mark it up to help you gauge your progress.</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>__ Spelling Mistakes
	<dd>To avoid spelling mistakes:
		<dd>__ Don't use words with which you aren't familiar.
		<dd>__ Use a dictionary as you write.
		<dd>__ Perform a spell check on your finished resume.
		<dd>__ Carefully read every word in your resume. If you write "from" instead 			of "form," your spell check will be unable to detect your mistake.
		<dd>__ Have a friend or two proofread your resume for you.
<p>
<dt>__ Punctuation Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Things to look for:
		<dd>__ Periods at the end of all full sentences.
		<dd>__ Be consistent in your use of punctuation.
		<dd>__ Always put periods and commas within quotation marks. (i.e., Won 			awards including the "John H. Malcom Memorial Service Award.")
		<dd>__ Avoid using exclamation points.
<p>
<dt>__ Grammatical Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Grammar hang-ups to watch for:
		<dd>__ Do not switch tenses within your resume. The duties you currently 			perform should be in present tense (i.e., write reports), but ones you may 			have performed at past jobs should be in past tense (i.e., wrote reports).
		<dd>__ Capitalize all proper nouns.
		<dd>__ When expressing numbers, write out all numbers between one and 			nine (i.e., one, five, seven), but use numerals for all numbers above 10 
		(i.e., 11, 25, 108).
		<dd>__ If you begin a sentence with a numeral, spell out that numeral 
		(i.e., Eleven service awards won while employed.).
		<dd>__ Make sure your date formats are consistent (i.e., 11/22/96 or 				November 22, 1996, or 11.22.96.  Choose one and stick with it.).
<p>
<dt>__ Choose Your Words Carefully<br>
	<dd>Phrase yourself well:
		<dd>__ Be on the lookout for the following easily confused words:
			accept (to receive), except (to exclude)
			all right (correct), alright (this is not a word)
			affect (to bring about change), effect (result)
			personal (private), personnel (staff members)
			role (a character assigned or a function), roll (to revolve)
		<dd>__ Use action words (i.e., wrote reports, increased revenues, directed staff).
<p>
<dt>__ Other Potential Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Don't forget to check:
		<dd>__ Dates of all prior employment.
		<dd>__ Your address and phone number -- are they still current and correct?
		<dd>__ The number of returns separating your categories: are they consistent?
		<dd>__ Abbreviation of state names. All state abbreviations are two letters -- no 		periods. For example, New York is abbreviated NY, California is CA, and 			Florida is FL. Look up other state abbreviations.
<p>
<dt>__ Design Is Important<br>
	<dd>Keep the following tips in mind:
		<dd>__ Don't overcrowd your resume; Allow for plenty of white space.
		<dd>__ Keep your resume to one page whenever possible.
		<dd>__ Keep the number of fonts you use to a minimum -- two at the most.
		<dd>__ Use a font that is easy to read. Times Roman works well.
		<dd>__ Do not justify the lines of type on your resume. Allow the right side of the page to "rag."
		<dd>__ Do not over use capitalization, italics, underlines, or other emphasizing  features.
		<dd>__ Make sure your name, address, and a phone number appear on your 			resume and all correspondence, preferably at the top of the page.
		<dd>__ Print your resume on white or cream paper using a good-quality 			printer. Second and third-generation photocopies are a no-no.
		<dd>__ Print on one side of the paper only.
<p>
<dt>__ What To Omit<br>
	<dd>Do not put any of the following on your resume:
		<dd>__ Salary history.
		<dd>__ Sex, age, race, marital status, or other similar personal information.

<b>Networking -- Rules Of The Game</b><br>
by Kit Haines
</p>
<pre>
</pre> 
<p>
Get a job! It's the not-so-subtle message to today's college graduates -- and one that seems easier said than done. After all, most of the people you hear dishing out the career advice are gainfully employed. What do they know about the job market? The answer is, a lot. And, if you get familiar with the concept of networking, you may find that those same harbingers of advice hold the key to your first post-graduation job.
<p>
It's never too early to begin to play the networking game, but for many students and recent graduates, the rules seem somewhat obscure. Is there a right way and a wrong way to network? Where does networking take place? And who should you network with? Here are a few tips to help you learn -- and eventually win -- the networking game.
<p>
Step One: Shuffle The Cards<br>
In the networking game, the playing cards are your business cards. You will need something that says a little bit about you that you can leave with the people you meet. If you do not have business cards, go to a local copy shop or art supply store and inquire about getting some made. They can be simple: your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, if you have one, should be sufficient. Also begin to think about preparing a portfolio that illustrates you: if you get the opportunity, it is nice to be able to present a folder that contains your resume and any samples of your work that you feel are pertinent to your career.
<p>
Step Two: Roll The Dice<br>
Assess your current circle of business contacts. You won't believe how easy this is until you begin -- include your parents, their friends, your professors, the woman down the block for whom you baby-sit, the guy who owns the rollerblade shop, the referee for your Tuesday night pick-up basketball games ... anyone you know who holds a professional job. Then begin to think about whether any of these people do something that would interest you, or work in an industry in which you are interested. Talk to these people. Find out if they know about any job openings or can recommend someone you can talk to about your career. Your uncle the programmer might know of someone in his company looking to hire an intern -- and just by asking you've made an excellent networking move.
<p>
Step Three: Move Around The Board<br>
Now that you've begun to make some contacts, keep your ears open for events where you can make some more. Sometimes a local chamber of commerce or professional group may hold a "networking evening." Or you may hear about a lecture being held in your area that falls within your career interests. Attend these events, and be sure to bring along your business cards. Also consider volunteering for a cause: other volunteers or organizational leaders make good networking contacts, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to talk to them during the course of your volunteer work.
<p>
Step Four: Accumulate Points<br>
When you meet someone, engage them in conversation. Ask intelligent questions. Some examples: Do you foresee any technological advancements that may change the industry within the next five years? What steps does someone like myself need to follow in order to hold a position similar to yours? Can you recommend any periodicals you feel are useful for keeping up with industry trends? After speaking with your contacts, offer your business card. Mention that you are interested in learning about openings within the industry, and if the contact knows of any or wants to pass your name along to someone they know, you would be very grateful.
<p>
Step Five: Cash In To Win<br>
You now have contacts. They know about you. Maintain those relationships and follow-up on them by periodically calling or visiting your contacts to maintain good will. The more often they hear your name, the more likely it is that they will think of you when an opening arises (just don't be a pest -- keeping casual contacts should be just that ... casual). If you feel you have a particularly good relationship with one of your contacts, consider making him or her your mentor -- someone you go to for career advice and guidance.
<p>
Remember: The Game Is Never Over<br>
Chances are that your contacts will pay off for you in one way or another. Whether you get your job through one of them, through the help-wanted pages in the local newspaper, or by way of an on-line search, the contacts you make can increase your knowledge of the industry - which will ultimately lead to better positions within your field. Having people within your field respect you is also an added bonus, regardless of whether you work directly for them or not. And who knows, if you don't find your first job through your contacts, you may find your second or third job using them. 
<p>
Networking is an ongoing responsibility. Don't take the game lightly, but do have fun with it. It is a game with changing rules and only a few steadfast guidelines, but observance of those guidelines and the ability to spot opportunities when they arise will make you a winner in the long run.

<b>Could It Be "A New Day Begun" For Minorities Seeking Employment?</b><br>
by Maurice Cooper II 
<pre>
</pre>
<p>
It is extremely beneficial for college students to learn hints that prove helpful in their search for employment. And though those precious resources are included throughout this article, it was created for deeper purpose. This article was written to educate the reader about the disparity of employment in the minority community, while providing them with information which can change that threatening trend. It is vital to know this information not just as member of the minority community, but as a member of the human race and fellow participant in the fight for equal employment.
<p>
It's no secret that minorities in the workplace continue to remain victims of employment discrimination. Furthermore, it's been no secret that the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> has declared an all out war on this subtle predator, which continues to unravel the very fabric of democracy and equality on which this country was ideally built.
<p> 
The battle, however, that has remained relatively silent and out of the public eye is <a href="http://www.naacp.org/programs/labor.html">the NAACP's relentless struggle against unemployment</a>. Though still continuing its fight against discriminatory practices, the NAACP has realized that this economic depletion is systematically destroying the minority community, in particular the African American community. Employment figures from the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> show that unemployment in the African American community is more than double the rate of unemployment in the Caucasian community.  
<p>	
National job fairs are emerging as one of the most effective ways for the NAACP to help reverse this economic depression. Job fairs provide people with a much more convenient means of orchestrating their job search. These job fairs, developed by the NAACP Labor Department (an organization created in 1949), have served as a sign of dedication to a fight waged by the NAACP against its formidable foe, unemployment. For the third straight year, the Labor Department hosted a fair at the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/president/columns/newday.html">87th Annual National Convention for the NAACP</a>. The convention, which was held in Charlotte, North Carolina during the week of July 5-11, 1996, had over 10,000 participants and was geared at focusing on the new found optimism that has begun to shine throughout the association as a result of the new leadership structure. The association, which had been struggling but recently dug itself out of a huge deficit, has declared "A New Day Begun" in which the values and goals established in the past will be carried to new heights by a new generation. Among those ideals is the fight for equal opportunity employment everywhere.
<p>
The NAACP National Labor Department held the two day Diversity Job Fair during the convention, attracting over 80 companies including <a href="http://www.cocacola.com">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/lockheed/lockheed1.html">Lockheed Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>. The job fair focused on providing those seeking employment, in particular minority candidates, with access to companies that understand the value of creating a diverse workforce. Covering this job fair from the perspective of the future or current college student, I asked recruiters questions ranging from <a href="#C">what they expect from future employees</a> to how people new to the job market could effectively market themselves. In addition, I asked for tips which might prove useful in the <a href="/cm/cc/cc7.html">development of an effective resume</a> or in navagating through the <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/career/intervw.html">interview process</a>.
<p> 
Leslie Lucas and Al Pollard, two recruiters from <a href="http://www.erac.com/">Enterprise Rent-A-Car</a>, were interviewed with the purpose of providing students with advice that would possibly increase their  chances of success in today's job market. 
<p>
<a name="C">
<b>What are companies looking for?</b>
<p>
The interview started as I asked the recruiters to discuss what skills they believed college students should possess, not just to achieve but to maintain a successful career. "We look for leadership, a desire to succeed," said Pollard, a Human Resource Supervisor in Charlotte, NC. He stressed the importance of possessing skills that would prove necessary in order to become a team builder. "You have. . .to have drive and possess people skills."
<p>
Leslie Lucas, a Human Resource Supervisor in Cayce, SC, took it a step further. "You have to be outgoing," she says. Having a forthright personality will pay off during the unnecessarily dreaded interview process in which "the outgoing person is much more readily noticed." 	    
<p>	
The discussion shifted and I asked the recruiters to tell me the most effective means by which college students and new graduates can market themselves.<a href="http://www.jmu.edu/career/resume.html">An effective resume</a>showing not only experience, but leadership traits, drive, and "extras, such as internships prior to graduation," says Lucas are great." But, says Pollard, "more than anything, <a href="http://www.careermag.com/newstarts/interviewing.html">the interview</a> sets you apart." This is, of course, the greatest opportunity you have to sell your potential to the employer. Equally as important as the interview, however, is follow up. Pollard mentions that "it is extremely important to follow up after your interview." This effectively demonstrates your commitment to becoming an employee at that particular company.
<p>
Presently, there seems to be a trend where managers lean more towards hires who don't need to be trained extensively, someone who can produce an immediate contribution to the company. When asked how the unexperienced college graduate can compete effectively with that fact, Pollard responds, ". . .at Enterprise everybody starts on the same level and is initially trained, but future success depends more on enthusiasm than anything else."
<p>
"Coming out of college," Lucas adds, "one of the major problems I find with college students is that they don't have the maturity to come in and seriously work. Maybe that's why managers are leaning towards experience. Some students just don't realize. . .that this is the real thing. It's time to really go to work now."
<p>
<b>What's is the job market really like ?</b>
<p>
As college students prepare to take that next step into the world employment, many find themselves wondering how strong today's job market is for college graduates. When asked this question, Lucas answers, "It's pretty strong. However you have to be conscious of the jobs that you take." She explained that a college graduate shouldn't jump at the first job that they are offered. Rather, the goal should be to find employment that will benefit you, while at the same time reflecting your major and providing you with experience in the field that you studied in college. "It won't matter that you have a degree in engineering if your resume shows you working Burger King. Your work experience can lessen the value of your degree."
<p>
<b>What about the minority student?</b> 
<p>
It has been the opinion of some that making the transition into the job market is a different experience for the minority student. When asked if she had any personal advice for the minority student preparing to enter the job market, Lucas responded, "Do your homework. <a href="/cm/cc/cc32.html">Research the particular company or companies at which you plan to seek employment."</a>She pointed out that another major mistake made by people just starting their job search is that they don't thoroughly find out about the employer they're applying to. They're more apt, in fact, to trust a familiar name rather than read an annual report and other materials to make sure that this is indeed the company where they wish to be employed. Furthermore, detailed research prepares job seekers properly for their future interview.
<p>
In addition to researching potential places of employment, it is also important to explore all your options. "Look at the different careers related to your major and explore all options, said Lucas." Finally, she stressed how immensely important it was to "maintain a professional attitude at all times." This advice will help to make the transition from college to employment a smooth and profitable one.
<p>
<b>Is diversity all that diverse?</b> 
<p>
Having shifted to the subject of <a href="/cm/cc/cc26.html">diversity</a>, I asked the recruiters about the percentage of minorities presently employed at their company and even more relevant, in what ways their company valued that diversity. Lucas responded,  "We don't have an actual percentage on us, however we are an equal opportunity employer." She also went on to point out the fact that Enterprise helps sponsor groups like the Lakeshore Foundation in events put on for the community.  "When we go into urban neighborhoods," said Lucas, "diversity allows us represent the people and it becomes an avenue through which we learn about different cultures." Plus it's a lot more fun to work with different people, Pollard responded, on a lighter note. "You learn so much more." As the conversation continued, an interesting fact surfaced. Pollard pointed out that the Enterprise staff, in fact, learns more from their new hires, particularly those of color, than any one else. 
<p> 
Many companies have recently begun to concentrate on developing a more diverse body of employees to take them into the next century. The two recruiters were asked what steps Enterprise was taking in order to create a more diverse workforce. According to Lucas, Enterprise has developed their Human Resources Department and has begun to focus on getting out to more "<a href="http://web.fie.com/web/mol/schlmap.htm">ethnically diverse colleges</a>in an attempt to meet different types of people." Pollard went on to reaffirm that statement citing examples of Enterprise's minority recruiting process. "We are definitely more involved at <a href="http://web.fie.com/web/mol/schlmap_.htm">minority schools</a>," he concludes.   
<p>
A common theme that continually rises when diversity is mentioned is the fact that diversity is "good for business." When asked what advantages diversity brought to Enterprise, Lucas once again emphasized the fact that the education received from interacting with different people and cultures is not only invaluable to the company, but personally serves as a plus. The job becomes a means by which employees can learn lessons about life, rather than just how to make a living.
<p>
<b>Will the company really guide and prepare me?</b>
<p>	
One of the more beneficial things that can happen to a college graduate is to <a href="/cm/cc/cc25.html">connect with someone</a>who can basically serve as a mentor  and take him or her under their wing. The interview ended with an explanation of the mentorship role that corporations assume as they bring in their new hires. "At Enterprise our Branch Manager is responsible for guiding those in training. Employers nowadays know how important it is to give new hires direction and quality training."     
<p>
As booths were being taken down and the Diversity Job Fair was no more, there was a sense that NAACP had won yet another battle in its tedious and demanding fight against unemployment. As a future college student I was immensely enlightened by the knowledge I received. And maybe more importantly, I began to see a glimmer of hope that suggested it was finally "A New Day Begun" for the minority population in their attempt to be a more prominent participant in today's job market.

<p>
Some of the other exciting features we bring to the Web are our extensive listing of employers in our <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employer Profile</a> section, 
our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cgi-bin/rotate-jobs.pl>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> database, 
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a>, and other career tools that include our 
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/crc/>Career Resource Center</a>, a link to our exclusive 
<a href=/cm/cm35.html>OnLine Job Fairs</a>, and, for the emerging work force,

<p>

<p>
<li><b><a name="B">How will CareerMosaic&#174 help me find a new job?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic currently houses five main sections -- all of which can aid in your job search. Here are brief run-downs on each:
<p>
- Our <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employer</a> section is an impressive and ever growing collection of world-class companies interested in hiring top talent. These employers profile their companies and job descriptions in their individual listings -- so you can decide if a company is the right match for you. Use this section to delve into a company's corporate culture or to find out more about its mission. Some employers post their company history or product reviews, others include information on benefits plans. Still others detail the countries and states in which their offices are housed and many of our listings provide a direct link to their web site. This kind information is unique and invaluable to the job seeker, and we hope that you find it helpful in your job search.
<p>
- The <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cgi-bin/rotate-jobs.pl>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> database houses thousands of up-to-date opportunities from hundreds of employers. This highly-searchable database allows you to enter the criteria that is important to your job search -- such as the title of the job you are looking for, the country in which you want to work, or the company you want to work for -- and then returns the results of the search within moments. CareerMosaic also allows you to perform a full-text search of the jobs listed on the USENET "jobs.offered" page. This page includes jobs listed in regional and occupational newsgroups in the U.S. and abroad, giving you additional access to employers world-wide.
<p>
- You may continue your job search by posting your resume via <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a>. This CareerMosaic resource makes your resume accessible to interested employers, and is just one more CareerMosaic resource you can put to work for you -- for free. In addition, ResumeCM indexes the most popular USENET ".jobs.wanted" newsgroups each day, and then adds your resume to them. No stamps to lick, no faxes to send -- just one convenient stop on your way to getting a job.
<p>
- To find out more about specific employers, visit the CareerMosaic <a href=/cm/cm35.html>OnLine Job Fairs</a> section. Every month several prestigious employers host on-line job fairs to better acquaint users with their companies and the positions they have available, and to invite interested individuals to submit their resumes on-line.
<p>
- The <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/crc/>Career Resource Center</a> is your link to tips on job hunting, resume writing advice, pointers to professional industry organizations, and other resources that can help you in your job search.
<p>
- The <a href=/cm/cc/cc1.html>CollegeConnection</a> is our special feature for college students -- or those just beginning their job search. In the CollegeConnection we offer information on companies with emerging opportunities, provide connections to university and college career centers, give links to financial aid information, and provide access to other sites which are helpful to new job seekers.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="C">Can CareerMosaic&#174 help me find a job in another part of the world?</b></a>
<p>
Yes -- our global experience and international reach help define CareerMosaic, and we are fast becoming a global tool for our users. We currently feature international companies in our Employer Profiles section and list jobs worldwide in our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cgi-bin/rotate-jobs.pl>J.O.B.S.database</a>. Users can utilize our resources to find jobs all over the globe. In addition, sites like CareerMosaic Asia are expanding our reach, making CareerMosaic available to different countries on a regional basis.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="D">What is the advantage of using CareerMosaic&#174 to find a job?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic gives you access to the freshest jobs from premier employers -- you will find jobs and employer information here that is unavailable elsewhere. The jobs listed in our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cgi-bin/rotate-jobs.pl>J.O.B.S. database</a> are continually updated, keeping the content current. You won't find stale or outdated postings here. In addition, the information provided in our <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employers</a> section gives you in-depth insight into company cultures, programs, and philosophies -- and much of this is information exclusive to CareerMosaic users. And because our Employer profiles and job postings are constantly growing, you benefit from being able to access information about thousands of jobs.
<p>
In addition, we provide you with access to employment tools in our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/crc/>Career Resource Center</a> and <a href=/cm/cc/cc1.html>CollegeConnection</a> -- you can visit these sections to improve your resume writing skills, gain job-seeking advice, and master the art of networking.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="E">How do I respond to CareerMosaic&#174 job postings and Employer listings?</b></a>
<p>
As a job seeker you can search our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cgi-bin/rotate-jobs.pl>J.O.B.S. database</a>, view <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employer</a> Profiles, or attend <a href=/cm/cm35.html>OnLine Job Fairs</a>. The job leads you collect will specify how you should respond to the opportunities -- either by on-line response mechanisms, e-mail, regular mail, phone, or fax, depending on which option the employer has chosen. Occasionally an employer will place a confidential job posting, in which case you will be directed to submit your resume to an impartial third party, either by mail, fax, or online. In any case, forwarding your information to an employer becomes easy.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="F">What is an OnLine Job Fair?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic <a href=/cm/cm35.html>OnLine Job Fairs</a> are a unique way of bringing job seekers and employers to the same virtual space. OnLine Job Fairs are hosted by top-notch companies with immediate recruiting needs. To attend an OnLine Job Fair you simply need to go to a company's job fair Web pages. Once you are there you can find out more about the company, its opportunities, and even respond right over the Web. The beauty of OnLine Job Fairs is that you and the employer can communicate from different locations.

<li><b><a name="A">What is CareerMosaic?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic is...
<p>
...the premier employment site on the World Wide Web;
<p>
...the pioneer in making career and job information easy to find and pleasing to read;
<p>
...the place on the Internet more people go to find out about employers and opportunities in high tech, health care, finance, retailing, marketing, software, telecommunications, biotechnology, the military, consulting, and other industries.
<p>
CareerMosaic is a product of <a href=http://www.hodes.com>Bernard Hodes Advertising</a>, the world's leading recruitment advertising agency. With over a quarter-of-a-century of experience in recruitment and employee communications, Bernard Hodes Advertising understands what it takes to match employers with employees, and we're bringing that knowledge to the Web with CareerMosaic. CareerMosaic is a registered trademark of Bernard Hodes Advertising, Inc.

<li><b><a name="B">How will CareerMosaic help my company hire new employees?</b></a>
<p>
Recruiting today is tough. People with advanced skills are in high demand. Companies downsize and expand at the same time. Yet management looks to Human Resources to provide a steady stream of qualified candidates quickly and cost-effectively.
<p>
More and more employers find traditional methods of recruiting alone don't create the desired results. In 1992, we began exploring the use of the Internet as a way to improve the results from recruitment advertising. Starting with e-mail response and a special section on America OnLine, the effect was dramatic on the quality and quantity of response.
<p>
In December, 1993, the public announcement of NCSA Mosaic unveiled the World Wide Web and its potential for startling multimedia and extraordinary depth of information. By January, 1994, a prototype of CareerMosaic was prepared and on July 4th the server "went live."
<p>
Since then, hundreds of employers - including the cream of the FORTUNE 100 -- have promoted themselves as employers and their opportunities on CareerMosaic. They recognize its flexibility and appeal to Web-savvy people. As the audience for the World Wide Web expands, its rate of growth is nothing short of breathtaking. Traffic on the Web accounted for just 3% of all Internet traffic in May, 1994; one year later, it was the largest source of traffic at 22%, overshadowing e-mail, gopher and other forms of Internet communications. Analysts estimate the number of Web sites is doubling worldwide every two months.
<p>
<a href=/cm/cypress/index.html>Cypress Semiconductor</a> offers an excellent example. The company in Silicon Valley needed to kick-start its college recruiting program. It was already spring and many of those about to graduate had already accepted offers. Cypress staged an "online job fair" that began in May, 1995 and concluded on July 4th. Within those 75 days, they were able to hire 75 qualified technical majors - a hire a day. Other employers report hiring 12 to 15 professionals a quarter from CareerMosaic at a fraction of the cost of hires made through traditional means. Does CareerMosaic work? Yes.

<li><b><a name="C">What specific tools does CareerMosaic offer?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic offers you five ways to use the power and appeal of the Internet and the World Wide Web to recruit more effectively:
<p>
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.(TM)</a>: List your current opportunities in our powerful, easy-to-use database that is queried over 60,000 times every day. Prospects search using keywords for job description, job title, company name, or location and receive a list of the opportunities most closely matching the prospect's criteria. Click on the opportunities of interest and get full-text descriptions, usually with links to online reply forms and/or the employer's site on CareerMosaic or elsewhere on the Web.
<p>
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm12.html>Employer</a> Profiles: Profile your organization, its culture and mission, with eye-grabbing graphics or video and comprehensive descriptions of your opportunities, products or services, benefits, or whatever else might attract top candidates.
<p>
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm35.html>OnLine Job Fair</a>: Feature hot opportunities and an easy-to-use, convenient online reply form and you have the opportunity to accelerate the recruiting process dramatically.

<p>
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a>: A searchable database of resumes from around the world, available to you at no cost.
<p>

<p>
<li><b><a name="D">How can CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. help me?</b></a>
<p>
<a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> (Jobs Offered By Search) is a state-of-the-art database that gives users a powerful way to search for opportunities.  It also gives employers a convenient and flexible way to post those opportunities.
<p>
Users can search using keywords in job description, job title, company name, city, state or province, ZIP or postal codes, even country.  One click of "Submit" and a bank of advanced computers goes to work, searching the CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. database for matching entries. Within seconds, a list of those opportunities appears and the user selects those of interest by pointing and clicking.
<p>
Descriptions in the J.O.B.S. database can be as long and as detailed as you like. The length does not affect the cost. Many employers discover they can now complement their investment in newspaper, magazine or broadcast advertising by referring prospects from those media to specifics readily available on the World Wide Web. They save money and increase impact.
<p>
You may also have a custom "Search and Response Package" designed for your postings. A header appears with your message and a link to more information about your firm. At the bottom of the page is a link to a custom online response form prospects can fill out on screen and send to you or wherever you designate with the click of a mouse.
<p>
Employers with HRMS systems can export job requisition files directly to CareerMosaic for posting in our CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. database. Responses can be imported from CareerMosaic, as well, without scanning or other manipulation. CareerMosaic offers users <a href=/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a> and advice in our <a href=/cm/crc/crc1.html>Career Resource Center</a> to help them prepare and format their resume for sending or posting. No other Web employment site offers these unique capabilities.
<p>
Whether you want to post one or one thousand opportunities, CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. is powerful and flexible enough to meet your needs.
<p>
<b>How CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.(TM) Saves You Money & Time:</b>
<p>
1. Use traditional media to sell your organization and point people to your presence on CareerMosaic; provide complete, comprehensive and timely job descriptions on CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.
<p>
2. Increased exposure to hundreds of thousands of users every month means you can get more qualified response.
<p>
3. Import/Export feature for employers with HRMS means you handle less paper, get responses faster than mail or even fax.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="E">How can an <a href=/cm/cm12.html>Employer</a> Profile help me recruit?</b></a>
<p>
One of the reasons so many publications and books cite CareerMosaic as the best employment server on the Web is the depth of information provided. Employers can tell a complete recruitment story - from current opportunities to details about sites or benefits - in one location. Text, photographs, graphics, sound files and even digitized video may be used to enhance and expand your message to prospects.
<p>
Timeliness is as important as depth. By the time you conceive, develop and print a brochure, much of the information is already out of date - such is the pace of modern business. On CareerMosaic, however, you may post late-breaking news releases, financial results, or new product announcements to ensure that prospects get the most up-to-date picture of your organization. Changing content on your site also encourages repeat visits, as prospects come back again and again to find out the latest information about your firm.
<p>
Some employers on CareerMosaic link their staffing sites to their companies' corporate servers to allow prospects to get more information about products, services, or other information. Many report that CareerMosaic is a major source of traffic to their corporate sites, adding value to the overall corporate communications effort.
<p>
If your organization already has a World Wide Web server, you may wonder if you need CareerMosaic. A server in and of itself, though, is no guarantee of audience. Many people may visit your corporate server in order to find out about your products or services. It may not occur to them that you have opportunities. CareerMosaic visitors, however, have careers and employment uppermost in their minds. And our reputation makes CareerMosaic one of the most heavily-visited sites on the Web. Even if you already have a server, CareerMosaic delivers an audience that no individual company server can duplicate.
<p>
So, whether you opt for a full Employer Profile on CareerMosaic, or simply a link between our Employers pages and your staffing section on your server, CareerMosaic delivers a qualified, interested audience ready to discover your recruitment message.
<p>
<b>What's in an Employer Profile?</b>
<p>
Each Employer Profile on CareerMosaic is unique. But they all share some common elements. They include:
<p>
<menu>
<li>Home Page - the "cover" of the section, used to welcome visitors and 
     outline the content of the section;
<li>Mission - a description of the products, services, sites, and/or goals 
     and objectives of the employer;
<li>Opportunities - what jobs are available, linked to the <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic 
     J.O.B.S.</a> database so they can be found by the thousands who search 
     there daily;
<li>Benefits - a description of benefits and programs.
</menu>
<p>
The Employer Profile has a theme, or "metaphor," that helps the visitor navigate and enhances the recruiting message. It may emulate a building, with lobbies and doors, or a map, with islands and rivers, or use artifacts from the prime site of the employer such as souvenirs, or construct a surreal space that embodies the spirit of the employer. That's the fun and excitement of creating an Employer Profile on CareerMosaic- in cyberspace, you can be just about anything imaginable.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="F">What is an OnLine Job Fair?</b></a>
<p>
The concept of an OnLine Job Fair is similar to the face-to-face variety - connect job prospects with employers at a specific place and time. Only the place is cyberspace, and the time can be as long or as short as you like!
<p>
The first event occurred in April, 1995. Promoted through traditional media as well as on CareerMosaic, it yielded over 4,000 visits over a ten-day period; 385 resumes were uploaded, a quarter of those deemed qualified enough to warrant interviews with hiring managers.
<p>
Since then, many employers have made the OnLine Job Fairs section of CareerMosaic a regular part of their recruiting mix. Typically, elements include a banner announcing the event, which links to a page describing current opportunities. Users can click on an opportunity to find a complete description; at the bottom of the page they may link to a "smart page" which includes an online response form and automatic reply capability.
<p>
Users tab through questions such as name, address, etc., and can electronically paste a text version of their resume in a blank space designed for that purpose. Once the user completes the response form, it can be sent to the employer's e-mail system, directly into a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) database, or to CareerMosaic for handling as requested.
<p>
You can use your OnLine Job Fair in conjunction with a live event to reach people who may be unable or unwilling to come see you in person. Or you can stage it to reach a specific, hard-to-reach group such as professionals in a rare discipline. OnLine Job Fairs are also an excellent way to test CareerMosaic if you do not yet have a full Employer Profile. However you choose to use your OnLine Job Fair, you'll find it's a cost effective and quick way to recruit on the Web.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="G">How can CareerMosaic help me recruit on campus?</b></a>
<p>
The <a href=/cm/cc/cc1.html>CollegeConnection</a> on CareerMosaic offers you a showcase for your university recruiting and relations efforts. It's the ideal place to highlight co-op and internship opportunities, assimilation or rotation programs, or discuss issues of importance to students you want to recruit.
<p>
That's why you'll find the CollegeConnection listed in such places as t@p Online and Prodigy. Students, guidance counselors and educators agree that it offers one of the best online resources for those exploring where to begin their careers.
<p>
College recruiting will become more critical to employers, even when overall recruiting is slack. Why? College enrollments are not keeping pace with the growth of the population. Minority enrollments, in particular, are declining. And many who begin work in a technical major eventually drop out because of the difficulty. As a result, the number of well-trained entrants into the workforce will drop for years to come. Only those employers who aggressively market themselves to this highly-desirable market will have success in attracting and hiring the "best and brightest" off campus. If your organization wants to succeed in this market, you want to include the CareerMosaic College Connection in your recruiting plans.
<p>
<b>Do College Students Use the Web?</b>
<p>
Do they ever! A study by the University of Michigan in late 1995 revealed that students spend an average of 20 hours a week surfing the Web - more time, on average, than they spend watching TV!
<p>
We surveyed 1,344 members of student IEEE chapters at campuses throughout the United States. They report that 88% have personal Internet accounts; two-third of those log on at least once a day. Conclusion? The World Wide Web is the place students go for information.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="H">Does CareerMosaic&#174 have resumes from prospects?</b></a>
<p>
<a href=/cm/cm39.html>ResumeCM</a> is the place on CareerMosaic where users may post their resumes and employers or recruiters may search among them. ResumeCM includes the most popular USENET ".jobs.wanted" newsgroups, indexed so their contents can be searched using keywords. As a recruiter, you have literally thousands of resumes at your fingertips and - unlike USENET - you can search not only on the subject lines, but the text of the resumes as well. You get a convenient and much more comprehensive way to search among job-seekers across the nation. Users get the ease and convenience of posting their resumes where many employers can find them, instead of having to find the appropriate newsgroups, send multiple faxes or mail cover letters and hard-copy resumes. Best of all, you can search among these resumes at no cost!
<p>
ResumeCM is a new section on CareerMosaic. Watch for enhancements that will make it more powerful and more useful for you and for candidates in the months to come.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="I">How can CareerMosaic help me recruit employees around the world?</b></a>
<p>
The World Wide Web is exactly what its names suggests - a global network. Since CareerMosaic is a vital part of that network, and since doing business internationally is essential to be competitive in a global economy, CareerMosaic offers international sites to help you recruit in markets other than North America. You can find these in our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/gateway/>CareerMosaic International Gateway</a> section.
<p>
Southeast Asia, Europe and other areas have or soon will have localized sites of CareerMosaic geared to help job seekers and employers alike. These international sites will feature many of the same sections as the original, including our powerful CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. database and colorful employer profiles.
<p>
CareerMosaic is the first employment server to offer you this array of international choices. But, then again, being first is what CareerMosaic is all about.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="J">How can CareerMosaic work for me if my organization already has a site?</b></a>
<p>
Many employers on CareerMosaic have their own World Wide Web site.  They choose to maintain a presence on CareerMosaic because they know we are THE site job seekers visit when looking to research available employment opportunities.
<p>
CareerMosaic delivers literally hundreds of thousands of people interested in jobs every day. Most of those probably aren't seeking opportunities specifically with your firm. When those prospects come across your opportunities while searching our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> database, for example, you're reaching quality candidates you wouldn't otherwise.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="K">How can job-seekers respond to my CareerMosaic opportunities?</b></a>
<p>
It depends on which of the many options from which you choose. Generally, your job listing in our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> database can include phrasing to direct interested respondents to forward a resume and cover letter back to you at your e-mail, fax, or mailing address. Many employers, though, prefer to use Custom Response Form. This online form allows people to reply immediately and conveniently, a big attraction for casual prospects.
<p>
If you have an applicant tracking system such as Resumix, Restrac or Desktop Recruiter, the information can be fielded so that it can be imported into your system. Such responses can be sent to you via Internet e-mail or whichever method you prefer.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="L">Can I place "blind" listings on CareerMosaic</b></a>
<p>
In our <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html>CareerMosaic J.O.B.S.</a> database, you have the option of not specifying the company placing the job listing. The date of the job posting, the job title or description, and the city in which the job is located are displayed, along with the phrase "company confidential." To keep the process completely confidential, responses to such "anonymous" ads can be directed to CareerMosaic, allowing candidates to respond via phone, 800-numbers, fax, e-mail, or mail.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><b><a name="M">How do job-seekers find CareerMosaic&#174 on the Internet?</b></a>
<p>
CareerMosaic is a quality site, and as such enjoys favorable exposure from other World Wide Web sites. Just a few of the prestigious locations currently directing job-seekers to CareerMosaic are:
<p>
Indexes including Point, Yahoo, Excite, the Infoseek Guide, Magellan, and Lycos A2Z; The Microsoft Network; U.S. News Online; The Society for Human Resource Management; The Main Quad; and such employment-related sites as The Catapult, Job Search and Employment Opportunities: Best Bets from the Net, and The Top 25 Electronic Recruiting Web Sites as ranked by The Internet Business Network.
<p>
We actively seek out locations-- both on the 'Net and in print-- in which to promote CareerMosaic. It is our goal to develop a good base of referring sites, enabling job seekers to find CareerMosaic from all reaches of the Internet. After all, the more traffic we receive, the more exposure the jobs and employers on CareerMosaic receive.

<h1>Search Resumes</h1>
<p>
Welcome to ResumeCM on CareerMosaic. Instead of having to search through all
of the USENET ".jobs.wanted" newsgroups, now you can search them all in one
convenient place. CareerMosaic indexes the most popular ".jobs.wanted"
newsgroups daily, and adds resumes posted through ResumeCM. Type in the
keyword(s) you want to search on, and our efficient, full-text search engine
will examine all of the resumes and return to you those that most closely
match your search criteria. 
<p>
As an employer, you may also want to post your opportunities in the 
<a href=/cm/canada/canada2.html>CareerMosaic Canada J.O.B.S. database</a>. Searched by thousands of
users every day, it's acknowledged to be the premier place on the Internet to
look for outstanding opportunities. Or, you may want to have your firm
profiled in the 
<a href=/cm/canada/canada3.html>CareerMosaic Canada Employers section</a>.  The
top employers in high tech, finance, health care, retailing, and other
industries choose CareerMosaic Canada to showcase their opportunities and
environments. Use our 
<a href=/cm/canada/canada16.html>Inquiry Form  </a>  to learn more about the
CareerMosaic J.O.B.S. database or an Employer profile. 
<p>
To search most effectively, connect your keywords with "AND" (e.g., "software
AND engineer AND C++ AND Halifax"). In this example, that would identify
resumes of software engineers with C++ experience in Halifax. The more
keywords you use, the more targeted your search will be, yielding candidates
who most closely match your desired qualifications. Good luck!

<a href=http://www.hodes.com>The company story</a>? Let's start at the beginning. Twenty-seven 
years ago we were two people with a dream. A dream to build an agency that was 
better than any other in our field. 
<p>
And that field is recruitment advertising and communications. Yes, we are your 
hosts on <a href=http://www.careermosaic.com/>CareerMosaic</a>. However, we 
also create and produce a range of communications materials for some of the 
world's most prestigious companies. Trade advertisements, campus recruiting 
campaigns, brochures, newspaper ads, internal corporate communications, are 
all in a day's work. We also perform market and media research, conduct focus 
groups and provide a range of response handling services.  Overall, it's our job 
to make companies appear delectable, irresistible, and unique to future employees.
<p>
Now back to the dream. We set out to be the best. An agency that was capable of 
<a href=http://www.hodes.com/portfolio.html>first class creative</a>. An agency 
that got it right the first time. An agency that delivered for clients. An agency with a 
talent for 'out of the box' thinking -- an innovator. An agency that was honest -- 
and dealt fairly with everyone who came through the door -- and everyone who 'manned' a desk. 
<p>
And the nice thing is 'better' made us bigger. We are currently an agency with 
over $650 million in billings and more than 
<a href=http://www.hodes.com/locations.html>40 offices</a> in the U.S., Canada, 
and the U.K. - and affiliates throughout the world. 
<p>
And we are a member of the Omnicom (NYSE; OMC) family -- the second largest 
advertising and communications group in the world. 
<p>
To sum up - we're the biggest, we're the best, we're literally everywhere 
in the world - and we're aligned with one of the most prestigious communications groups. 
<p>
A great place to work - and a smart career choice? Absolutely. So get 
the story on <a href=http://www.hodes.com/job.html>jobs</a>, details on how to apply - and see 
how people who work for Bernard Hodes Advertising <a href=http://www.hodes.com/culture.html>feel about their jobs</a>...

The landscape of semiconductor fab is changing. TwinStar is building America's first 
U.S./Japanese wafer manufacturing plant in 
<a href=http://www.cor.net/chamber/telecomstory.html>"Telecom Corridor,"</a> 
in the North 
<a href=http://www.gdc.org/>Dallas</a> suburb of  
<a href=http://www.cor.net/>Richardson,</a>Texas.
 TwinStar is a joint venture of Texas Instruments and Hitachi, Inc.
<pre>
</pre>

<h1>A Greenfield Operation</h1>
While this pre-eminent facility has the financial backing and experience of two of the world's largest semiconductor giants, TwinStar itself is a greenfield operation: an independent, competitive venture built from the ground up. At TwinStar, we are inventing our own unique culture, as we define the technological horizons of tomorrow.
<pre>
</pre>

<h1>Blue Sky Thinking</h1>
TwinStar's working environment is being designed and created to encourage the visionary pursuit of 
"blue sky" ideas. We want our team members to imagine the limits of the possible, then roll up their sleeves and create concrete reality. It's the kind of environment where clear, open communication and broad participation are vital.
<pre>
</pre>

<h1>Technology's Brightest Horizon</h1>
TwinStar is being built, equipped and staffed to compete with--and improve on--the latest 
innovations in the semiconductor industry. In a world where the rate of change is 
accelerating exponentially, our team members aren't afraid to make waves. The work 
we do here will contribute to a bright technological future for humankind, and a bright 
future of 
<a href=/cm/twin_star/tw2.html>opportunities</a> for both technical and non-technical professionals. The TwinStar 
<a href=/cm/twin_star/tw3.html>site</a> will be equipped with the world's most sophisticated wafer fab technology, and will 
produce .35 micron, 8" wafer, 16- and 64-megabit CMOS DRAMs for PC, telecom and video.

<p>
<center><h2>Networking Navigator -- Get Mileage Out of the People You Meet</h2></center>

<p>
Part of the art of getting ahead lies in networking (and we don't mean "working on the Net!").  Developing professional contacts is a skill and can actually be quite fun. Your friends, family, teachers and colleagues form the basis of your networking circle. New alliances and business contacts help you expand it.  
<p>
Networking is a way of communicating that nearly every professional incorporates and it's really nothing more than meeting people and following up. But it could be the difference between a standard entry-level job (which you got through the human resources department) and one with a little more responsibility and pay (which you got by way of a personal introduction through one of your professors or mentors). As you begin to work your way up, the associations and people with whom you affiliate become even more important. So get started now with the preliminary contact information provided below and you'll be shaking hands and passing out cards before you know it.
<p>

<a href="/cm/cc/cc25.html">Professional Associations</a>-- Become involved. Here's a list of groups you may wish to join.
<p> 
<a href="/cm/cc/cc26.html">Diversity Links</a>-- Your connection to minority organizations and professional resources.
<p>
<a href="/cm/cc/cc27.html">Convention and Job Fair Information</a>-- The opportunities are out there. Check out these sites for more information on job fairs and conventions you can attend.
<p>

<title>Sample Resumes</title>
</head><body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<center>
<img src=/cm/cc/images/L3res.gif alt="">
</center>
<p>
<center><h2>Sample Resumes</h2></center>
<p>
Start here for more information on the three different main types of resumes and what each one looks like.
<p>
<b>FACT:</b> Preparing your resume is probably the single most important step in the job search process. It is also probably the most confusing. What do you include? What do you omit? One page or two? What kind of paper should it be printed on? All of these are valid questions, and the CollegeConnection is here to answer them.
<p>
Let's begin by taking a look at the three different types of resumes: Chronological, Functional, and Combination. These three standard "outlines" should be used as guides -- remember that your resume may include important details these resumes do not. The type of resume you choose will be influenced by a number of factors described below.
<p>
Click on any of the headings to see an actual resume formatted in that style.
<p>
<a href="/cm/cc/cc16.html">The Chronological Resume:</a>
The most popular of the standard resume forms is the Chronological Resume which allows you to present your work history and education in chronological order. Your information is arranged in categories; popular category headings include relevant work experience, education, and special skills. This type of resume is especially effective for entry-level job seekers or professionals who want to highlight their industry-specific job progression.
<p>
<a href="/cm/cc/cc17.html">The Functional Resume:</a>
The Functional Resume focuses more on the skills you have acquired than on the actual positions you have held. Again, information is presented in categories, some of which may include specific abilities, education, or jobs held. If you have extensive work experience, are seeking a job outside of your industry or have gaps in your employment history, this is the appropriate resume format for you. 
<p>
<a href="/cm/cc/cc18.html">The Combination Resume:</a>
The Combination Resume melds parts of the Chronological Resume with parts of the Functional Resume, making this an appropriate format for those changing jobs or careers. This can be most effective when skills and job experience need to be emphasized.

<center><h2>Cover Letters:  Tips & Techniques</h2></center>
<p>
More than just window dressing for your resume, a cover letter is more like a partner to that all-important document. Many employers today won't even look at your resume if you don't submit it with a cover letter. Your cover letter gives employers the opportunity to evaluate your ability to communicate -- do you know the proper form for a business letter? Can you string together coherent sentences? Are you able to express yourself well on paper? Your cover letter will give employers insight into all of these things.
<p>
Here are some things to consider when putting your cover letter together:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your cover letter should draw employers to your resume. Don't clutter it with needless facts.
<li>Keep it brief -- no employer wants to read your life's history.
<li>Tailor it to the position and company to which you are applying -- a cover letter shouldn't be "canned."
<li>Open by explaining why you are writing and where you heard about the opportunity -- you may want to say something similar to "your recent Daily News advertisement caught my attention."
<li>Be sure to say why you think you would be a good match for the position. If the advertisement lists several traits or skills the employer wants to see in job applicants, reference those skills in your letter and say how you exemplify them. Mention traits that will set you apart from other candidates.
<li>Refer the employer to your resume -- "you can see from my resume that I have the experience you are looking for" may be a good way to do so. Experiment with your own wording.
<li>Remember to sign your cover letter.
<li>Note "enclosure" or "enc." several lines after your signature if your resume is enclosed.
</ul>

<center><h2>Thank You Letters:  Tips & Techniques</h2></center>
<p>


You crafted your cover letter. Perfected your resume. You've even been invited on an interview. If you think you're home free -- not quite. You still have to master one more important piece of correspondence: The Thank You Letter.
<p>
More than one eager interviewee has been passed over for a prime position after failing to follow up after the interview. It's such an easy step that it can get overlooked -- but not by you, because now you know better. Employers like a conscientious employee, and by sending a thank you letter you are showing them that you know proper business etiquette and appreciate the opportunity they have extended to you.
<p>
What should you include in a thank you letter? Good question. Here are some tips:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Thank the employer for his or her time during the interview -- this is, after all, a thank you letter.
<li>Mention some of the things you learned during the interview -- especially those things you feel you are qualified to do. For example, "I was especially excited to learn that you are looking for someone with QuarkXPress experience. As you may recall my mentioning, I have over five years of experiencing designing brochures using QuarkXPress."
<li>If you forgot to mention something during the interview, include it in the thank you note.
<li>Invite the employer to contact you for more information if necessary.
<li>Mention that you are looking forward to the employer's decision.
<li>If the employer requested that you submit samples of your work, you may attach them to the thank you letter. Be sure to mention the attachments in your letter: "As requested, I am forwarding samples of press releases I have written for your review."
<li>Be sure to sign your thank you letter.
</ul>
