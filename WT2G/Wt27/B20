The development of least restrictive environment (LRE) options for children with
disabilities by local education agencies (LEAs) has been mandated resulting in
pressure being placed on educators to develop model service delivery programs and
options.  Head Start has a long and successful history of providing quality
programs for preschool children including children with disabilities.  However,
oftentimes the children served in Head Start programs have only had mild or
moderate disabilities.  LEAs and families require new options for serving all
children in least restrictive environments.  This project proposes to further
develop materials and strategies for support of children with severe disabilities
in Head Start programs.  This project will provide on-site training, follow-up,
and technical assistance to Head Start programs in southeast Kansas to support
the integration of children with severe disabilities.  Three levels of training
will be addressed.  These include state level needs identified by RAP, local
needs identified by Head Start disabilities coordinator, and individual needs
based on classroom staff needs related to specific children with disabilities. 
Collaborative efforts by the Kansas UAP, Region VII RAP, and local Head Start
program will insure the development of materials and support systems to meet the
goals of the project.<P>

This project is designed to meet the continuing need for a comprehensive
statewide inservice training and technical assistance system for early childhood
special education professionals, paraprofessionals, related services
professionals and parents of children with disabilities in the State of Kansas.
The project will continue, expand and enhance the inservice training and
technical assistance opportunities by providing and supporting collaborative
training and technical assistance activities on a comprehensive statewide basis.
The project will provide training and technical assistance to preschool programs
in the State, for children with disabilities.  Additionally, parents and staff of
agencies collaborating with those preschool programs will be afforded
opportunities to be involved with training and technical assistance activities.
Inservice needs will be addressed at three levels of training - state, regional,
and individual.  This will be accomplished through a needs assessment for the
identification of the statewide priorities, regional needs, and for
implementation of technical assistance services developed in concert with
Individual Development Plans of professionals.<P>

The project's goals will be completed through activities such as the summer
institute, dissemination of information through a newsletter, provision of
inservice training, provision of agency and individual technical assistance,
development of new teacher and technical assistance packets for practitioners in
the field, management of the identification of exemplary practices in the state,
and support the continued development of a profile of services in the state. 
Finally, this program will continue to support and utilize existing structures
and opportunities for staff development currently occuring throughout the state
through collaborative linkages with other agencies, programs, organizations, and
projects in the field of Early Childhood Education.<P>

This three year project is designed to meet the need in Southeast Kansas for
provision of ECSE services within the least restrictive environment (LRE) through
the development of family-guided, community-based early childhood service
options.  This program will assure collaboration between the current Part H (SEK
Birth to Three Program), Part B providers (ANW and Tri-County Special Education
Cooperatives and Fort Scott - a QPA pilot school), an educational service center
(Southeast Kansas Education Service Center), an institution of higher education
(Kansas University Affiliated Program at Parsons) and community-based regular
education providers (e.g., Head Start, Parents as Teachers) across a six-county
area.  Through the development of family-guided transition procedures that
promote shared decision making, family/professional partnerships, and options for
community placements and service delivery, it is anticipated that significant
restructuring of preschool services will result.  To accomplish the proposed
collaboration, critical issues identified in the reauthorization, will be
targeted and include:  a) the use of an IFSP/IEP for the delivery of services to
children with identified disabilities ages 3 to 5 years; b) the development of
flexible transition procedures as the child moves from Part H services to Part B
programs; and c) the identification of policies and procedures to assure the
content and intent of the law is met during transition.<P>

This resource and referral project is designed to meet the needs of a rural,
sparsely populated area by the continuation and further expansion of a child care
resource and referral center.  Until this Resource and Referral Center was
established in 1992, southeast Kansas in general, and Labette and Cherokee
counties specifically, did not have a central point of contact for families in
need of daycare services.  This Resource and Referral Center employs a
state-of-the-art computer managed data based system designed to match and link
families with daycare providers, based on specific needs identified by the
family.  The center through an extensive public awareness program also
coordinates its services with state and community agencies, the general public,
and other service providers to create a cost efficient and effective program to
enable families to identify daycare opportunities.  The staff works closely with
the public health departments, SRS offices, and educational programs to make this
no cost service available to low income families and families of children with
disabilities.  This center will also continue the expansion and development of a
professional network for daycare providers through the publication of a quarterly
newsletter and the development of a resource center designed for the production
of play and interactive materials for child care programs and the lending of
equipment and materials.<P>

This project proposes to identify and analyze student and ecological setting
variables that serve to facilitate or hinder transition of students with severe
behavior disorders into general/less restrictive educational settings.  To
identify these variables project staff will conduct a series of studies that
investigate the setting events critical to the transition process.  First, the
school records of approximately 200 students (14-21 years old) enrolled in
regular and special education classes will be reviewed to identify their current
placements and obtain demographic information and other permanent record data
thought to be related to successful transition.  Semi-structured interviews will
be conducted with a smaller sample (100) of these students and their special and
regular education teachers and parents to obtain additional current information
regarding their educational status, teacher, student, and parent perceptions of
barriers to transition, and the social networks of students.  Next, 50 of these
students will be followed over the remaining years of the grant to document
changes in their educational placements and variables associated with their
transitions.  Finally, a more comprehensive study involving a sample of these
students is proposed which will measure a variety of student, teacher, and
educational setting variables.  The relationship of these variables to students'
educational placement and teacher-related adjustment will be analyzed.  The
proposed research will provide a data base to guide future transition research,
begin the process of identifying the variables that influence the outcomes of the
transition process, and identify the influence of personal and ecological factors
in the transition of these students.<P>

This project will utilize full inclusion innovative models and best practices to
improve and expand opportunities for placement of students with severe
disabilities including those with dual sensory impairments in neighborhood
regular education classrooms.  Target participants include inservice
professionals in regular and special education, parents, and related service
personnel who are engaged in or planning for the full inclusion into the regular
education classroom in a neighborhood school, students with severe disabilities,
including those with dual sensory impairments.  Specifically, the goals of the
proposed project include the development, implementation, validation, and
dissemination of an inservice training approach and a set of multi-media training
materials that support professionals engaged in developing full inclusion
efforts.  The training modules will focus on development of the knowledge and
skills necessary to implement educational programs which have the following full
inclusion process elements:  1) support for a student placement in neighborhood
school regular classroom; 2) dual ownership (regular and special education) of
students regardless of academic and adaptive functioning; 3) increased
opportunities for integration and social interactions with nondisabled peers; 4)
collaboration and cooperation among parents, regular, special, and related
service personnel; 5) infusion of regular and special education methodologies;
and 6) increased independent functioning and greater acceptance and appreciation
of the individual within the community.<P>

This project investigates relational learning in subjects with mental
retardation.  Such learning is essential to independent human functioning.  A
hierarchy of three relational discrimination skills will be studied:  arbitrary
matching, arbitrary matching learning set, and emergent arbitrary stimulus (i.e.,
Sidman equivalence).  The first aim is to study arbitrary matching and arbitrary
matching learning set in subjects who are initially unable to acquire arbitrary
relations without highly structured teaching procedures.  The studies will
follow-up on findings that procedures designed to facilitate acquisition of
arbitrary matching by training skill components can be adapted to promote rapid
trial-and-error learning.  This extension of the learning set outcome to
relational discrimination will extend the generality of an important set of
observations that have been made to date primarily with simple discrimination. 
Subjects with varying degrees of retardation will be include to extend earlier
research that indicated a relation between level of retardation and learning set
formation.  The second aim is to investigate "emergent" matching performances in
subjects with low mental ages (MA).  The emergent performances investigated will
be those identified by Sidman and Tail (1982) as indicating that arbitrary
matching relations are relations of meaning, or equivalence relations.  It is
unlikely that many subjects will initially not show these capacities.  The
studies will test the prediction of relational frames theory that the provision
of a history of trained symmetric and transitive performances will be sufficient
to produce emergent symmetry and transitivity.  Such emergent performances have
been considered an integral part of linguistic and symbolic behavior.  Little is
known about the mechanisms of their development, however, perhaps because they
occur so readily in normally developing humans.  The studies are expected to
contribute to an understanding of retardation and its remediation.<P>

<h1 align=center><b>Parent to Parent Support</b></h1><p>
     Hundreds of active Parent to Parent programs provide emotional and information support to
parents by matching a veteran parent who has "been there" to a parent newly referred to the
program. Major program components include screening and training veteran parents, making
one-to-one matches between veteran and newly referred parents, and providing follow-up
support to each match. Many programs also offer  activities such as group meetings for
education and support, sibling activities, resource libraries, social events, and training opportu
nities for professionals.  <p> 
                          
<h3><b>History</b></h3><p>
     From the start, parents have had the lead role in Parent to Parent program development.
The first known Parent to Parent program in the U.S.  was founded by Fran Porter, a parent,
who collaborated with Shirley Dean, a social worker, in 1971 and petitioned the Greater Omaha
Arc (formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens) in Omaha, Nebraska, to set up a program
in which parents of children with disabilities could share information and emotional support
through a one-to-one match.<p> 
     In 1974, Patty McGill Smith, now executive director of the National Parent Network on
Disabilities and the mother of seven children, including one with a disability, heard about a job
opening at Pilot Parents."I thought it was a little part-time job that was going to take just a bit of
time and I could earn a little money. So I applied for the position. We had 20 couples at the time
who were trained Pilot Parents. We had the complete system of services just sitting there wait

ing to be activated. It was just a wonder to be able to put into place what had been the dream of
those planners. It never slowed down once the whole time I was there, and I was there five
years."<p>
     Shortly after Smith came on board, Pilot Parents received a regional developmental disability
grant covering the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri to establish Parent to Parent
programs. Within two years, those four states had 33 programs, and parents were calling from
all over the U.S. for information on setting up a Parent to Parent program in their area.<p>

<h3><b>Previous research</b></h3><p>
     Parent to Parent programs have been providing support to parents for 25 years. But it wasn't
until the Beach Center on Families and Disability analyzed data from its national survey of
program administrators, veteran parents, and referred parents in 1992 that anyone knew the
number of programs, their structure, services offered, budgets, and the answers to a host of
other questions.  This information has proven useful to those wanting to start a Parent to Parent
program and for established programs.<p>

<h3><b>Beach findings</b></h3><p>
     From the survey, the Beach Center learned that there are over 500 active programs serving
an estimated 35,000 parents across every region of the country. These programs range from
those serving just a few parents to very large ones serving several hundred families (with the
average program serving 13-25 referred parents at a time). Some programs have no annual
budget, (over half operate with less than $5,000) while a few have $100,000+ budgets. Slightly
fewer than half of the programs have a paid coordinator, and all veteran parents are volunteer. <p>
     Most programs are cross-disability. Of referred parents, 85% have a child with special needs
younger than 12, although increasing numbers of veteran Parent to Parent programs match
families with adolescents and young adults. Early intervention legislation, too, has influenced
matches, with more families connecting to programs in the early months following their child's
birth.<p> 

<h3><b>Project director comment</b></h3><p>
     Said Betsy Santelli, Beach Center Parent to Parent project director, "We came to understand
that Parent to Parent programs vary on the continuum of one-to-one support. <p>
     "Some programs follow the original Pilot Parent model initiated by Fran Porter, Shirley Dean,
and Patty Smith precisely, carefully making one-to-one matches between trained veteran
parents and newly referred parents. <p>
     "The progress of each match is followed, and ongoing support is available to the veteran
parents as they pilot the referred parents. In other programs, matches happen more informally,
and training for the support parents may not be a formal program component.     <p>
     "Yet in all programs, parents connect one-to-one to other parents to share emotional and
informa-tional support."<p>

<h3><b>Current Research</b></h3><p>
     Parents and professionals have said for years that Parent to Parent supports are valuable.
But no scientific data had ever been collected on the effectiveness of these programs. "The
need for hard data on the efficacy of Parent to Parent is enormous," said Nancy DiVenere,
director of Parent to Parent of Vermont. "We know this process is one of the most powerful
forms of support that we can provide for families of children with disabilities. We know that
when parents are strengthened, their children are strengthened." <p>
     Because parents and program directors wanted research on the value of Parent to Parent, a
group of parents and researcher met together in 1992 to plan the study. This consortium
submitted a grant to  the National  Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR)
to conduct a national efficacy study. NIDRR granted the funding for a 3-year study that began in
July of 1993. Dr. George Singer, University of California-Santa Barbara, directs the project that
involves parents and researchers in Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont, and
New Hampshire. <p>
     While the final data have not been analyzed, preliminary data suggest that for parents of
younger or more recently diagnosed children, one-to-one Parent to Parent support significantly
increased the sense of having a reliable ally and being able to cope. This support also led to a
reduction in the amount of stress these parents felt. Parents of older children reported that the
support helped them get their emotional and informational needs met. For all parents in the
study, satisfaction with Parent to Parent support increased with the number of contacts 
received from the supporting parent.<p>

<title> Squires </title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000" TEXT="#004000">
<h1 align=center><b>The Squires: Parent to Parent
Supporters</b></h1><p>
     There was no reason for Sara Squires, pregnant with identical twins, to think that her twenty-
second week obstetrical checkup would be unusual. <p>          
     However, as soon as the doctor read the sonogram, she said: "Go to the hospital immediately.
One twin has almost no amniotic fluid. It's twin-to-twin transfusion."<p>
     Overnight, the Squires family changed dramatically. Confined to a hospital bed for the remainder
of her pregnancy, Sara gave birth to Abigail and Kimberly nine weeks prematurely. Seventeen months
later, doctors formally diagnosed Kimberly with cerebral palsy. <p>
     Sara did not know where to turn. Then a social worker gave Sara a brochure about Families To

gether, the Kansas Parent Training Center. <p>
     Said Sara, " I did not know anything about CP [cerebral palsy], the disability world, or anything.
I was very naive. I called, and found myself talking with another parent. I did not have to say a whole lot.
She knew exactly where I was coming from. She knew the exact resources I needed."<p>
     Sara and Lyle started going to parent training workshops offered by Families Together, and soon
     Sara became a trainer, then a full-time staff member. A year later, Families Together established
a statewide Parent to Parent program; Sara became the program's first statewide coordinator.<p>
     Not long after, the opportunity arose for Sara to be part of the consortium team of parents and re-

searchers conducting a national survey to determine the effectiveness of Parent to Parent. <p>
     "I had been bitten by the research bug. I was the one at meetings asking, 'How do you do that?' I
was the parent, the non-researcher, and I wanted to know.'"<p>
     Presently, Sara works at the Beach Center as a research assistant. Her average day consists of
monitoring the progress of the research, answering phone calls from people interested in starting Parent
to Parent programs, and responding to parents, asking "I have a child with such and such. Where do I
go?" Sara usually points them to their local Parent to Parent program, because she's a believer.<p>
     "The very nature of Parent to Parent is people going above and beyond. Parent to Parent
programs do wonderful things day in, day out.<p> 
     "I heard about this one mom traveling by herself across the U. S. Her car conked out in rural Ne-

braska. She  called the local Parent to Parent program. The program coordinator called a mechanic, put
her up for the night--the whole 40 yards--then hooked her up with assistance the rest of her trip!"<p>
     The Squires (Lyle, 45, Sara, 43, Courtney, 18, Joel, 12, Abigail and Kimberly, 5) continue to
benefit from their local Parent to Parent program. <p>
     "We use matches when Kimberly is in transitional times or, for instance, with power mobility. I
was matched with three other parents who gave me ideas and input. Then I have had matches around
financial issues: We always seem to fall through the cracks, and there just are financial realities that
come with having a child with a disability. <p>
     "Leg braces--every six months. Power wheelchair. Eyeglasses. And, of course, there are lots of
tests and that long line of specialists. Our Parent to Parent network helps us make sure we get what we
should be getting."<p>

<title> Parents Say </title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000" LINK="#FF0000" VLINK="Fuchsia">
<h1 align=center><b>What Parents Say About Parent to
Parent</b></h1><p>
<b>A parent writes:</b> Our support parents have been terrific! After our daughter was diagnosed with a major
heart defect that would require open heart surgery, we were given the number for a couple who had a two
year-old who had gone through the same surgery. Our support parents came down to see her in the
hospital, called us a lot, sent letters, etc. The dad even gave blood for our daughter's surgery. They live
two hours away but that hasn't been an obstacle. I hope everyone can have such a great experience with
their Parent to Parent programs.<p>

<b>The gift lives on:</b> At the birth of my severely disabled son, I instinctively felt the need to speak with a
mother exactly like me. I didn't know this support was available. I couldn't ask for the help I needed. I
truly believe in peer support, Parent to Parent support, and it has been my pleasure to be involved as a
volunteer in this field for the last seven years. The sense of really being helpful to families in crisis is
very gratifying and has led to great personal growth. My son is deceased and although I can no longer
care for  him, his life and pain he suffered are somehow justified through my helping others. <p>

<b>Seeing the light:</b> Our group was the foundation for our attitude and acceptance of our new life situation.
The parents and children helped us to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and the light that Kelsey
brings to our lives. Total acceptance of her has allowed her to be all that she can be, and she is a
beautiful, worthy person. She has brought a new dimension of love to our lives, and our parent group has
helped us to open our hearts to her. <p>

<b>A word of advice:</b> Ours is an informal program and the phone is used a lot to discuss problems or to
relay good information between families. You have to be there either physically or by phone when the
new parent needs someone to talk to. Listening is very important. Offering optimism is equally
important. I have found that taking my own child to the new parents can make them feel better--they see
a child capable of playing, seeing, hearing, etc.<p>

<b>Sharing hope:</b> When our son was born three years ago, my husband and I were shocked and devastated.
We called our Parent to Parent program, which supplied us with invaluable information, as well as send-

ing us a support couple to talk with. It was important for us to meet with a couple--not just a mother--
since my husband takes as much responsibility for caring for our children as I do. The couple sent to us
were such warm, optimistic, "normal" people, they gave us hope. About a year later, my husband and I
were trained to be support parents. The office has many requests for

 visits from both fathers and mothers. My husband was one of very few men willing to go through formal
training. I have also found that support for non-English-speaking families is hard to come by. It has been
satisfying to serve the Spanish-speaking community.<p>

<b>Making needs known:</b> I was so afraid that our son wouldn't make it through those first few days, and
that I would never have a chance to hold him close to my heart. I didn't see how I possibly could with all
of the tubes and machines all around. The nurses on the unit were always so busy keeping these babies
alive that I didn't dare ask if I could simply  hold my son. Yet my arms ached. To have the veteran parent
practically insist that I make my own needs known to the NICU staff was exactly the gentle push that I
needed. And holding was exactly what we all three needed to get us through those first few days. <p>

<b>Valuable perspective in decision making.</b> I found the support from the veteran parent  extremely useful 
when I needed to make a difficult decision. Because she had also had to make this same decision, her
perspective was much more helpful than that of others who had not. She shared many of her own family
experiences with Ritalin, and in fact I even had a chance to talk with her son about how the Ritalin had
been for him. Their collective wisdom was just what I needed to make my own decision with confidence.<p>

<title> Statewide P2P </title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000" LINK="#008000" VLINK="#8080FF">
<h1 align=center><b>Statewide Parent to Parent</b></h1><p>
     Twenty-three states have statewide Parent to Parent programs, in addition to their local
programs. Statewide programs provide training and technical assistance to the local programs in many
different ways and make it possible for parents to be matched statewide. According to Beach Center
research, statewide programs appear to contribute to the number of local programs, which means that
Parent to Parent services are available to more families. <p>  
     One of the more established statewide programs--Parent to Parent of Georgia--in its early years
trained all veteran parents and provided technical assistance to new programs. <p>
     Now, while the central office in Atlanta still coordinates more than 30 local programs,
two regional satellite offices have been established to work more closely with local programs.
(Atlanta still remains the point of contact with referrals made to appropriate regional or local
programs.)<p>
     "We do what we call a double match," said Cathy Spraetz, execu-tive director of the
Georgia program. Whenever we can, we put someone in touch with two parents--a person in
their community and another parent whose child has the same disability. A statewide  database
helps us make matches. The toll-free number helped, too. Parents didn't have to think twice
about giving us a call for support. <p>
     "The other thing we did was identify money to reimburse our parents for long-distance
telephone expenses if we matched them outside their local calling area. That's been a great
resource. We've been doing that since 1987; we've never had any kind of abuse of the system.
In fact, last year we added a place on the reimbursement request form for parents to donate
telephone costs as in-kind support. Many parents have done just that.<p>
     Vermont and New Hampshire are organized similarly to the Georgia statewide program
with admin-istrative support, training and technical assistance, and matching all performed out
of the state office, and a common brochure and newsletter used by local programs.  <p>
     Several states, including North Carolina, Florida, Washington, New Mexico, Iowa, and
Virginia, have less centralization, but coordinate to varying degrees local programs.<p> 
     Arizona and California have yet another style of statewide organization. In Arizona, two
large Parent to Parent programs, which started at the same time as local programs, provide
technical assistance and a training manual to local programs throughout the state. Tucson
concentrates on the Tucson area, while Pilot Parent Partnerships in Phoenix  covers the
rest.     "Outreach is one major advantage of decentralization," said Nancy Morgan, Pilot Parent
Partnerships. "It could not be done well  from Phoenix. <p>
     "Rural areas and agencies know their own communities best. We cannot dictate their
best practices. To meet the need of training, we provide training to our most experienced pilot
parents.<p> 
     "They are four hours closer than we are and can provide training to other parents more
efficiently. That gives us more continuity. "<p>

Because so many parents are interested in learning more about the establishment and operation of a
statewide Parent to Parent network, the Beach Center has been conducting surveys of statewide Parent
to parent programs to learn more about their efforts. We are looking at their funding, organizing, training,
public relations, matching, use of computerized databases, collaborative efforts, and other components.
Data and a manual on developing a statewide Parent to Parent program will be available in 1997. For
those who want to know more,  the 1996 International Parent to Parent Conference will have an all-day
presentation moderated by  Beach Center staff on "Everything You Wanted to Know About Statewide
Parent-Parent Programs, But Didn't Have to Ask," featuring more than a dozen statewide directors. The
Beach Center will also be publishing information on this topic in the future.<p>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<h1 align=center><b>Reaching Underserved Populations</b></h1><p>
<b><i>Iliana Hernandez, Parent to Parent
Hispanic, Miami, Florida</i></b><p>
     I don't look Hispanic, but I am 100%,
born in Cuba, of Spanish descent. In 1986,
I helped found Parent of Parent of Miami.
My first attempt inviting parents to a
Spanish-speaking meeting was a translated
flyer. Guess what happened? <p>
     Nobody showed up. That's when I said,
"Well, if I want to start helping my people, I
have to know my people." <p>
     I started researching and educating
myself, and interviewing families from
different countries. A few months later, I
invited them to a support group, and it was
packed. We needed more than language.
We needed cultural understanding.<p> 
     For instance, something I realized is the
impact of the grandmother. There is nothing
more powerful in a Hispanic family than the
grandmother. That old lady is the one who
sets the rules of the house. Another thing
that works well with Hispanic families is
one-to-one support.  We work more
effectively on a personal basis. We hate
papers. Parents tell me, "I don't want to
read it. I want you to tell me what you have
for me. I want you to tell me that you trust
me, that you are going to do something for
me."<p>
     My best strategy to reach Hispanic
families is the radio. Guess why? Because
grandmothers listen to the radios. Mothers
that work in factories listen to radios. <p>
     Once a year, I talk on the Spanish radio
stations in Miami about our services. From
the callers, fifty percent of the listeners
were grandmothers who will tell their family
and friends. In my culture, we use  word of
mouth a lot. <p>
     We also acculturate materials. 
For example, we make our support notices
in Spanish personal. It's like if you have this
problem, you need to come to help your
child, rather than come to a "support group
meeting" at the hospital.<p>
     Fathers, they ask me a lot how  to get
Hispanic fathers involved. Use their energy
and abilities. Tell them you need to fix
something and they will come. Once there,
invite them to be part of the meeting.<p> 
     I also work a lot with migrant workers. I
take my husband to migrant camps and
train parents. I have to take my husband,
because if I  address a Mexican worker, it's
not going to work. Typically, men pay more
attention to other men. <p>

<b><i>Ruth Tracy, Arizona, Pilot Parent
Partnership, Ganado, Arizona</i></b><p>
     I got involved in the Navajo Parent to
Parent as a single parent. Of my five
children, I have four daughters and an 11-
year-old son who was born with Down
syndrome. My husband left after our son
was a year and two months because of the
disability, the shock. I brought in grand-

parents outside the extended family to
come in to help that year.  I used other fam-

ily, too. We are at least four clans. I couldn't
use my parents because they were in
shock.<p> 
     My family related the disability back to
my long walks, since there has never been
anyone in our family tree who had given
birth to a child with a disability.<p>
     What we do at the Navajo Parent to
Parent, we do real slow. We don't think in
calendars. <p>
     Our cycles are according to the
conservation of the universe and the earth
and the seasons, and so we put these into
our grant applications.<p> 
     How we work is through the Navajo
nuclear family and the grandparents and
the siblings of that parent. Disability is a
shock to all of them. Usually the nuclear
family members come up and are real
supportive of each other. <p>
     The way I make contact is one-to-one.
Now it is just starting, where they want
groups or gatherings.    There are  certain
teachings and sharing of information.
Sometimes you do this mainly with women
and then do it with the men. <p>
     Then when you get together, even if
there are just two of you, you are sharing
your whole self. You also go through
prayers or bless the mountains within the
season.<p>
     That's how we do it, and it's real slow.
When you go to a parent, she or he will not
make any decisions the first time you
contact them.<p> 
     You meet their basic needs first, and
then you help to get resources and link
them to services. <p>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<h1 align=center><b>Beach Center Update</b></h1><p>
<h4><b>1996 International Parent to Parent Conference.</b></h4><p>
 Families and Parent to Parent programs connect with
each other at the International Parent to Parent Conference held every other year. Attendance has grown
from fewer than 300 in 1989 to over 1,200 participants at the last conference. This year's March 29-April
1 conference in Albuquerque with its theme of "Keep Alive the Dream" will have 70 workshop sessions
in the areas of: Family Caregiver, Health, Medicine, Education, Community, and Advocacy. A sampling
of workshops includes How to Implement Family Enrichment Weekends, How to Get Individualized
Funding, Promoting Strategies for Involving Families Affected by HIV in the Parent to Parent
Movement, Reaching Families in Their Communities, and numerous other concurrent sessions. The
Beach Center will be part of the  presentations on Parent to Parent efficacy, statewide Parent to Parent
programs, "getting a life in the community," and strategies for dealing with challenging behavior of
children with disabilities.  For more information, contact Parents Reaching Out, 1000A Main St., Los
Lumas, NM 87031, 505-865-3700.<p>

<b>Policy evaluation.</b> In an ongoing evaluation of family centeredness in services and programs in four
states, Beach staff have published a preliminary report on North Carolina statutes A similar report on
policies in the state of Kansas is being completed after extensive evaluation. For a copy of these reports,
contact Amy Buchele-Ash, project director, at the Beach Center.<p>

<b>Service provision to fathers. </b>This Beach quantitative study is halfway completed. Information has been
gathered to develop a survey for providers and fathers to determine strategies used by early intervention
service providers to include fathers and other male family members. Preliminary findings suggest that
program variables such as evening and weekend hours, child care during meetings, and transportation
alone appear not to be decisive factors in father participation.<p>

<b>Scale development.</b> After  completing a national validation study, Beach staff have developed
the Family-Centered Behavior Scale for use in research and program evaluation to improve
family centeredness in services. <p>

<b>Positive behavioral support grant.</b> The Beach Center was recently awarded a U. S.
Department of Education grant to synthesize and disseminate research on positive behavioral
support. Seven focus groups have been conducted (in collaboration with the University of
Oregon and State University of New York at Stony Brook) representing administrators, policy
makers, general and special education teachers, families, friends, individuals with disabilities
and challenging behavior, and researchers. Data from the focus groups are in preliminary anal-

ysis, and it is too early to discuss emergent themes. Five more focus groups are planned. The
study will develop "what works" manuals as well as a range of products for stakeholder groups
to close the gap between research and practice.<p>

<b>Text revision.</b> Families, Professionals, and Exceptionality, a text used at 220 colleges and
universities in the United States and written by Beach co-directors Ann and Rud Turnbull, has
been revised. This Merrill/Prentice Hall publication third edition focuses on collaboration and
empowerment and will be available in August.<p>

<h1 center=align><b>Best Support Practices<p>
Pierson Award.</b></h1>
 To learn more about best practices in Parent to Parent programs, Beach Center staff
asked programs to share their ideas in 1991. Two years later, over one hundred programs had responded.
The result was A Treasury of Best Practices, a source book with listings in program development, special
family issues, strategy implementation, program-developed materials, and contact information. The
Beach Center continues to compile ideas. In fact, this year, the Beach Center initiated the Pierson Award
that honors and celebrates excellence in Parent to Parent programs. Funds for the Pierson Award come
from the James McDonald Fowler Fund, established by Sherleigh G. Pierson at the Kansas University
Endowment Association  in memory of Jamie, who was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy in a time
when family-centered approaches were not widely available. <p>
     The award will be presented at the International Parent to Parent Conference held every two
years. Descriptive information about each nominated program is included in the Pierson Award
Directory, available at the International Parent to Parent Conference and through the Beach Center.<p>

<b>Training medical students.</b> Parent to Parent of Vermont not only provides training for veteran parents,
but also provides training for preservice medical students, nurses, speech language pathologists, physical
therapists, and early interventionists preparing to work in the disability field. In partnership with the
University of Vermont, it established a four-part seminar required of all medical students. Third-year
medical students visit families whose children have a chronic illness or disability, listening and learning
from the perspective of families about the kinds of lessons that cannot be taught in a clinic or classroom.<p>

<b>Expense reimbursement.</b> For easier recruiting of prospective veteran parents, Pilot Parent Partnerships
in Phoenix, AZ, reimburses veteran parents for mileage and telephone costs on behalf of the referred
parents.<p> 

<b>Diverse populations.</b> To meet the needs of its Tacoma, WA, population, Pierce County Parent to Parent
has set up informal sharing groups for Asians (Cambodian, Laotian, and Korean), military families, and
fathers.<p>

<b>Greeting cards.</b> As a promotion and fund raiser, TRENDS in Holland, MI, has holiday greeting cards
featuring art work done by children with Down syndrome.<p>

<b>Retreat.</b> Family Support Network of North Carolina holds a beach retreat once a year for its
coordinators. "It is a wonderful weekend. We go to the beach. Nobody ever believes the work we get
done," said Lynn Blanchard.<p>

<b>Response options.</b> When new parents are referred to Down Syndrome Society of Rhode Island, DSSRI
responds within 24 hours by presenting parents with the options of meeting a veteran DSSRI member or
receiving the New Parent Package in the mail. New parents are also given a free one-year membership to
DSSRI, which includes newsletter subscriptions.<p>

<b>Puppet show.</b> FACE (Friends for Aid, Correction, and Education of Craniofacial Disorders), Sarasota,
FL, produces an award-winning puppet show about individual differences and prejudice. The show  is
presented to elementary students.<p>

<b>Break time.</b> In Portsmouth, NH, the Parent to Parent coordinator has worked with area hotels and
restaurants for "Respitality" outings, which give local families time off from their responsibilities.<p>

<b>Peer program.</b> Parent to Parent Walla Walla /Columbia, WA, collaborates with the school district in
Children Helping Children, a peer mentor program that assists children with disabilities in accessing
community recreation activities.<p>

<title>Dads and Disability</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor = fffdal>

<center><h3><b>Dads and Disability</b></h3></center>
     A few years ago, Dr. Vicki Turbiville was attending a class on collaboration between
families and service providers. The sole male there said he would rather talk with mothers
about their children than fathers. <p>
     Turbiville remembered thinking at the time that if male teachers don't want to talk with
fathers, then fathers must really be out of the information loop. This thought set in motion
a line of research centering around the priorities and preferences of fathers with children
who have disabilities and how  service providers respond to fathers.<p>
     Throughout the studies, Turbiville has been advised by a number of fathers who have
children with disabilities. "I'm obviously not a father," Turbiville said. "So to be sure that
what we do and what we learn is accurate and appropriate, I need feedback from those
who are fathers." <p>
     Routinely talking with fathers around the country, Turbiville has developed questions to
be answered by her research, conducted studies, and reported the findings.<p>

<html><head><title>One Family's Story</title></head>
<body bgcolor = fffdal>
<center><h3><b>One Dad Who Makes a Difference</b></h3></center>
<i>Bob Dale, Portageville, Missouri, is an active advocate for children with disabilities. The following are
excerpts from the chapter "Creating Answers" in 
<a href = "news215.htm">"Uncommon Fathers: Reflection on 
Raising a Child With a Disability."</a></i><p>
<b>Smile of beauty.</b> In February of 1990 my daughter Jessica, was a happy, healthy seven-month-old,
pulling up and walking along the edge of the sofa, smiling a smile so bright and beautiful that
angels were envious.<p>
     Today Jessica lies virtually motionless on her back--deaf, blind, and paralyzed, but still
smiling that angelic smile and displaying the nature of the unimpaired beauty that was born to us.
[Jessica had spinal meningitis.]<p>

<b>     A good cry.</b> Most fathers are told to do the same thing I was: <p>
 Be strong for your family.<p>
Sometimes I don't feel very strong. Someitmes I'm tired and want all of it to go away.<p>
 Sometimes I
cry. I let my two boys know they can cry, too.<p>
 Sometimes we cry together.<p>

<b>Taking a break.</b> How do you take care of Jessica, and Zachary, and Devon and Robbie and
yourself without blowing a gasket? <p>Over the years we have devised an answer: We escape!<p> I
arrange for help with Jessica from whatever resources are available and plan a time to do some-

thing with the rest of the family. I think the operative word here is plan.<p>

<b>     Appreciation of today. </b>How  do I characterize my relationship with Jessica?<p> I don't know.<p> 
     You need to realize that Jesse is not expected to live much past the age of twelve or thirteen,
so every moment with her is a precious gift; a point in time to be savored.<p> Every smile is a prayer
answered. Every time I stroke her cheek I feel a sense of wonder and appreciation that she is here,
with me now. <p>

<b>     Life directions.</b> Because of Jessica, I have increased my awareness of people with
disabilities.<p> I have become educated in many areas of policy and law, and I have attended over fifty
I.E.P. meetings, other than hers, to help other kids get the most out of their education. Because of
her I have met hundreds of parents, and talked at length with them about the challenges they face
raising their child with special needs. <p> I have lobbied our state legislature for Jessica, and together 
with hundreds of other parents, helped to effect positive change in the state of Missouri.<p> Because of
Jessica I have helped to raise the level of awareness on  to the part of state officials and educators.
All because of a little four-year-old girl. <p>

<html><head><title>Dads Feel Left Out</title></head>
<body bgcolor = fffdal>
<center><h3><b>Dads Feel Left Out</b></h3></center>
     Fathers often report that they feel like second-class citizens when dealing with
service providers. "One time I was trying to say that I felt like less than a parent when I
was dealing with service providers," said one dad. "But the words ran together and I ended
up saying 'I felt less apparent to service providers,' and that was true, too." <p>
     According to James May, Project Director, National Fathers' Network, Bellevue,
WA, their reasons for this are many.<p>
<b>     Service delivery schedules.</b> For one, professional services tend to be offered during
the day when many fathers are at their place of employ-ment. This typically results in
mothers, even employed mothers, becoming  the "experts" on the child. This situation can
leave fathers out of the information loop.<p>
<b>     Gender differences.</b> When a father does meet with service providers or attend a
program for couples, generally he will be surrounded by women, which may make him
uncomfortable.      Discomfort may arise from the providers' way of sharing infor-
mation, or it could be that fathers have needs that female service providers aren't
responding to adequately.<p>
     Said one dad, "A lot of the providers seem to be women. When they run into us,
well, we have a different set of feelings. We have frustrations that they may not be familiar
with. Sometimes they say things we don't appreciate." <p>
<b>     Self-expression difficulties.</b> Wrote another dad on the Internet, "It seems to me we
guys are less likely to share our feelings, do it rather badly when we do, and are more likely
to be blasted. When we talk feeling like the world is on our shoulders--this is not a discount
on moms who feel the same way--it is a feeling, not a rational statement of fact. I am told
that many fathers become overwhelmed and bail out of marriages when handicapped children
 enter the picture. Those of us who are working to stick it out need as much nurturing
(not more) as our spouses." <p>
     The difficulty in self-expression this father refers to makes it tough for service
providers to communicate with fathers. Service providers who encourage fathers to discuss
their feelings may find fathers unre-sponsive to this approach preferred by mothers.<p>
<b>     Child interaction differences.</b> Another fact that service providers need to recognize
is that fathers differ in expression from mothers. They also interact differ-ently with their
child, which may influence a provider's suggested activities and recommendations. <p>
     For instance, one father said he felt most useful to his 7-year-old son with multiple
disabilities when he made practical devices (e.g., drawing board to hold paper and
markers) to make his son's life easier.<p> 
     Another father of a young daughter with rare chromosome deletion said that his
wife was good at working with their daughter, but he was best at playing. His daughter
liked him to get down on his hands and knees and chase her.<p> 
     Or when she is in the bathtub and calls "a-dee-dee-dee," her word for "Daddy," he
replies,"I hear you in there,"which makes her laugh. This play benefits the child as it en-
courages exploration as well as increasing the child's self-esteem.<p>
     Making adaptive devices, play, and verbal interaction are ways that fathers prefer
to spend time with their children. If services are tailored to fit these preferences, then
fathers will be more likely to get involved.<p>
<b>     Inadvertent discouragement. </b>And, if fathers do get involved, service providers can
capitalize on that interest, rather than discourage it un- intentionally.  
Imagine what this  St. Louis father felt when he was called a "father hen" by service
providers, because he wanted to participate in his child's Individualized Education Pro-

gram (IEP) development. <p>
     Not only was it implied that he was over protective, but use of "mother hen" implied
that he was playing  an inappropriate role.<p> 
     His experience was similar to that of  Bob Dale, who said (see 
<a href = "news22.htm">One Dad Who Makes a
Difference):</a>  <i>"Once, after answering a social worker's questions, I was thanked for my
cooperation and informed that the worker would check my answers with my wife for
accuracy.<p> "I found this very curious, especially since the questions dealt with my work
record and employ-ment history. It would be easy to step aside and let my wife take charge
of these activities. After all, stepping aside was the message sent loudly and clearly to me
from many places. But my wife couldn't deal with this trauma alone.<p> 
     "It took two of us to handle all that was happening; service pro-viders would just
have to get to know  me and learn to accept, if not like, the fact that I was involved with my
daughter's life. " </i><p>

<title> Beach Center Fact Sheet</title>

<body bgcolor=fffdal>
<i><h5>How To:</h5></i><hr>
<center><h2><b>Involve Fathers More With Their Children With Special Needs</b></h2></center>
  Mothers are typically viewed as overseeing their children's education and
development, while fathers are thought to be less involved. There are good reasons
for this often true perception. However, better reasons exist to change it and to use
the commonly untapped resource of fathers when working with a family that has a
child with a disability. <p>
  Unfortunately, there isn't much research on fathers and even less on fathers who
have children with disabilities to guide the way.<p> 
  What is known is that fathers of children with disabilities think of themselves as
pretty much the same as fathers of children without disabilities. They both spend
about the same amount of time caring for their children and generally take on the
role of playmate rather than care giver. <p>
  As strong influences on the child and family unit, fathers affect their children's
cognitive, personal-social, and sex-role identification development.<p> 
  Children who have positive relationships with their fathers tend to have higher
achievement, motivation, cognitive competence, and better social skills.<p> 
  Fathers who view their children with disabilities positively also encourage
mothers in their child care activities. <p>
  Factors that influence a father's relationship with his child include the parents'
employment, their personal and cultural characteristics, and the child's traits
(including temperament and gender). <p>
  Service providers should value the participation of fathers and other male
family members. They should also recognize that every male in a child's life has
strengths and these strengths play a major role in family functioning. <p>
  Therefore, personally invite fathers and male family members to take part in all
aspects of service provision. Focus first on providing information to fathers, then
work on relationship building.<p>
  The following research knowledge can be used to encourage father-child
relationships and increase inclusion of fathers and other male family members in
programs.<p>
<ol>
<li> While fathers of children without disabilities spend more time with their
children out of the home in such activities as going to church, cleaning the garage,
or grocery shopping together, fathers with children who have disabilities tend to
interact with their children in the home. Often, this is because a father finds
routine activities less disruptive to the child and family. And the child's disability
might make leaving the home difficult. The father also may be uncomfortable with
public scrutiny of his highly visible child. Therefore, some fathers may be more
comfortable with activities that they can do at home within the home routine.

<li> Fathers tend not to follow activities suggested by educators. When
recommending activities, find out the father's particular present activities and
preferences. Build on these.

<li> Television watching, fathers report, is how they spend a great deal of time with
their children. Collaborate with fathers to identify strategies to increase child
interaction during television watching (e.g., lap sitting, questions about program
content).

<li> Fathers like problem solving. Focus on activities for fathers that incorporate
problem solving with their children, such as toy or transportation adaptation.

<li> Fathers' play differs from mothers' play, which typically is more educational in
nature. Fathers' play (often in shorter sessions) tends to be more physical,
spontaneous, and unpredictable. If planning father-oriented games and activities,
take note of the play difference.

<li> Fathers tend to engage in fewer verbal activities with their children than do
mothers. This can be exacerbated if their child has a disability because the father is
rarely taught how to communicate with his child who has a disability. Not
surprisingly, fathers report that they view the development of communication
skills with their children as a high priority. This may be particularly true for
fathers who have children with disabilities. Fathers suggest that they need
information on interpreting non-verbal cues of their infants and toddlers. 
<p>  Service providers should make sure that fathers have the opportunity to be
included in the family-centered services provided to children with disabilities and
their families. As with all family-centered practices, the mother and father can best
decide how to include the father.
<p>  If you would like to know more about the research on fathers who have a child
with a disability, contact the Beach Center on Families and Disability at 3111
Haworth, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 (913-864-7600).

<center><h3><b>Beach Center Updates</b></h3></center>

<b>PBS training teams.</b> Mike Ruef and Martha Blue-Banning, Beach Center, have completed their
training on the Kansas 12-member positive behavior support training team. During the next four
months, they will conduct training in various Kansas locations. Kansas joins 20 other state
training teams across the United States in providing trainers experienced in dealing with
challenging behavior. The training teams are a result of a grant project spearheaded by the
Research and Training Center on Positive Be-havioral Support headquartered at the University of
Oregon. For further information, contact Mike at (913) 864-7603.</b><p>

<b>Lorenzo Awards.</b> The Beach Center and the Inter-American Children's Institute presented the
1995 Eloisa de Lorenzo Awards in the category of Research in Social Sciences June 29 in
Montevideo, Uruguay. Awardees included: Dr. Ingeburg Fuhrman, Centro de Estudios y Terapia
Sistmica, Chile, "How to Reduce Harm in Families Who Have Disability; Dra. Julieta Zacaras
Ponce, Centro de Adiestramiento Personal y Social, Mxico, "Example of Independent Living
Model"; Lic. Roberto Madriz, Fundacin para la Coop-eracion Internacional de Organ-izaciones
Suecas de Discapacitados, Nicaragua, "People With Disability in Nicaragua"; and Fundacin
General Ecuatoriana, Ecuador, "Taking Care of Children With Mental Retardation."<p>

<b>ADA roundtable. </b>Rud Turnbull, Beach Co-Director, recently participated in a ADA roundtable
discussion convened for the President in Washington, D. C.  Attorney General. Janet Reno,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and assorted congressmen joined the discussion. After hearing
President Clinton say, "There shall not be a life wasted in America," Turnbull, during his
presentation, beseeched the president to maintain federal financing of local special education
programs and block Republican efforts to slash welfare programs. "By God, we need you out
front here!" Turnbull said to Clinton. "And, by God, if you lead, we'll be behind you all the
way!"  <p>

<b>P2P activities. </b>Betsy Santelli and Sara Squires, Beach Center, met with their participatory action
re-search team led by Dr. George Singer, University of California-Santa Barbara, to share
preliminary results on the effectiveness of Parent to Parent programs. They are also beginning to
work with the program planning team for the International Parent to Parent conference  to be
held  March 29-April 1, 1996 in Albuquerque.<p> 

<b>Medical technology.</b> The Beach Center is conducting a study of the transition experiences of
adol-escents ages 14-21 who use medical technology (ventilator, gastrostomy, and dialysis).
Beach researchers hope to develop better services to overcome existing barriers and to make 
recommendations for policy change. If you or someone you know would be willing to participate
in this study, please call Rebecca Moberly, Gardner Umbarger, or Mary Morningstar at (913)
864-7602. Parents or proxies can be used if there is a condition that makes communication
difficult. <p>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "basic">Basic Document Retrieval</A></H2>

This is the most basic, yet most often used, function that your server provides.
When the user clicks on a hot-spot, the browser sends a request to the server
and the server returns the requested document.<P>

Here is a <A HREF = "basic.txt">plain text document</A><BR>
Here is a <A HREF = "basic.html">hypertext document</A><BR>
Here is a <A HREF = "images/rbd.gif">GIF image</A> (the server author)<BR>
Here is an <A HREF = "ring.au">audio clip</A><BR>

You can also use an image
<A HREF = "basic.html">
<IMG SRC  = "/wsdocs/images/question.gif" WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=32></A>
as a hot-spot.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "treenav">Directory Tree Navigation</A></H2>

<h3><a href="demotree/">Look here first</a></h3>

This feature permits the server to display directories on your PC
and lets Web users browse and retrieve files. 
In addition, as server administrator, you can create text descriptions
for files to assist your users in identifying and locating files.
You can look at this feature as a "fancy FTP". It does <I>not</I>
use the FTP protocol; it uses the Web's own HTTP for file transfers.

<P>For this demo, I have created a small <A HREF = "demotree/">directory
tree</A> with some useless documents in it. Have a look and you'll get
the idea. Clicking on the Parent Directory entry at the top of the demo
tree will take you back to this demo document. Can you figure out how
that happens?

<H3>HTML-3 Table Support</H3>

WebSite's directory listing format uses the
HTML-3 table feature.  This produces a much nicer looking
listing, but it will be unusable by people without table-aware browsers.
You can offer the older fixed-pitch format by including a link in the
directory header with <code>?plain</code> appended to the directory URL.
If a directory listing does not have a header, WebSite puts a link for
changing listing format at the top.

<P>Here is the above <A HREF = "demotree/?plain">sample
directory tree in fixed-pitch format</a>. Note that, once the server sees you
use the <code>?plain</code> argument, it will construct parent- and
sub-directory links with this argument appended, preserving the
fixed-pitch mode. 

<p>If you feel that most of your users do not have a browser that
handles the new HTML-3 tables, you can tell the server to <i>default</i>
to using fixed-pitch for its directory listings. 
Turn off the Use HTML3 Tables switch on the Indexing tab
of the server's property sheet (Server Admin). WebSite ships with this
switch enabled.

<H3>Disabling Directory Browsing</H3>

There are two ways that you can disable directory browsing: server-wide
and path-specific. The Dir Index page of the server's property sheet has
a checkbox that you can use to disable directory browsing server-wide.
You can also create an access-control path on the Access Control page of
the server's property sheet and check "Disable directory listings". This
will prevent directory browsing on that path and it's children. 

<P><A HREF="demotree/nobrowse/">Here is a directory</A> that has been protected
against browsing with access control. 

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "imagemap">Image Maps</A></H2>

The server has the built-in ability to process clicks within an inline
image and perform actions based on the <I>location</I> of the click.
This is called "image map" support. With it, for example, you can create
a graphical map of a complex set of Web pages and let your users
navigate visually. Obviously, many other clever things can be done with
image maps.<P>

Here is an inline GIF image. Click in it and see what happens. <b>If
you get an error message, your server is not running, or you are
reading this as a file.</b> Try 
<a href="http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo/index.html#imagemap">
this link</A> to see if your local server is running.

<center>
<p><a href="32demo.map">
<IMG SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100 
BORDER=2 ALT="TEST"></a>
<P>
</center>

<p>In contrast to all other known Web servers, this server does not require
running an external program to handle image map requests. <B>The
support is built into the server</B>. This makes the server very
efficient at handling image mapping.<P>

<h3>Image Map Data</h3>

Using the WebSite Image Map Editor, you can graphically create the
hotspots against a background of the image you want to map. This mapping
information is stored in an image map file, which the server uses to
determine what to do depending on where you click. The HTML used in the sample
above is:

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="32demo.map"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;</PRE>

The <code>32demo.map</code> is the name of the map file. When WebSite
sees a file name ending in <code>.map</code> it assumes that the file
contains NCSA-format image mapping data. This activates WebSite's
server's special built-in image mapper. WebSite reads the map file and
uses the data in it to decide what to do. You can open the map
with the WebSite Imagemap Editor and see the regions
as they were defined, along with their target URLs (right click on a
region). You may have to locate the background image yourself (one time
only) after installing WebSite. Here is the image mapping data for 
the example above:

<PRE>default /wsdocs/32demo/noshape.html
ellipse /wsdocs/32demo/circle.html 8,9 90,89
poly /wsdocs/32demo/poly.html 250,10 212,90 290,90 250,10
rect /wsdocs/32demo/rect.html 130,10 171,91</PRE>

<p>WebSite  1.1 uses standard NCSA-format image map files, and for
backward compatibility with previous versions, it can use WebSite 1.0
registry-based maps as well. <i>We recommend that you use file-based
image maps at all times.</i> If you have any registry-based image maps,
use the new Image Map Editor to read them and save them in NCSA file
format. Then  change your links to point to the image map files instead
of the registry. You can put your map files in the same directory as the
documents that use them.

<!-- Anchor used in return links from imagemap targets -->
<a name="file-imap">
<p>The following
example uses an image map file <code>self-test.map</code>.</a> 

<center>
<p><A HREF="/wsdocs/32demo/self-test.map">
<IMG SRC="images/file-imap.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=68></a>
</center>

<p>Note that the NCSA image map format supports the <code>point</code>
element, in which a click outside of any geometric region resolved to the
nearest point. The presence of one or more point elements bypasses any
background (default) element. The ellipse region is unique to WebSite.
Most other imagemappers support only circles.

<p>The HTML used in this sample is:

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="/wsdocs/32demo/self-test.map"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="images/file-imap.gif" ISMAP&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>

and the contents of <code>self-test.map</code> are:

<PRE>ellipse /wsdocs/32demo/ellipse.html 50,12 170,54
point /wsdocs/32demo/ptleft.html 24,34
point /wsdocs/32demo/ptright.html 194,34</pre>


<h3>The Two Ways to Code Image Maps in HTML</H3>

Actually, there are two ways to code image maps in HTML. The
traditional way is to use the <code>ISMAP</code> element within an
image tag, then enclose it with a link to the image mapper. The
above examples use this method.

<P><A NAME="imagemap2"></A>
Another way to make an image map uses an obscure but useful feature of 
HTML forms. Create an input field of type <code>IMAGE</code> within
a form whose execution target is the image mapper. Forms can use
either the <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> method, but
<i>file-based image maps require using GET</i>. An example, 
along with the actual HTML used, appears below.

<PRE>&lt;FORM METHOD="<B>GET</B>" ACTION="32demo.map"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SRC="/wsdocs/32demo/images/imapdemo.gif"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</PRE>

<center>
<FORM METHOD="GET" ACTION="32demo.map">
<INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100>
</FORM>
</center>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="SSI"><H2>Server-side Includes</H2></A>

<A HREF="ssi.html-ssi"><H3>Test Page Here</H3></A>

WebSite 1.1 introduces the powerful "server-side include" (SSI) feature
found in some other web servers. This feature permits you to dynamically
insert data from various sources into an HTML document. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> WebSite's unique built-in SSI support for page counters
eliminates the need for CGI-based page counter packages completely. 

<P><A HREF="ssi.html-ssi">This document</a> demonstrates and tests 
WebSite's SSI facilities. See the WebSite book for details on the
features and syntax for using SSI.
 
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="urlfix"><H2>Automatic URL-Fixup</H2></A>

This section checks out a vital feature of your server, its ability to
fix up directory URLs that don't have a trailing slash. Don't bother to 
try to understand why this is needed for now. Look at the URL that is
displayed at the top of your browser. It ends either with
<code>index.html </code> or with a trailing slash. Click the link below.
If this document is successfully redisplayed, the feature is working. If
you get an error, your hostname is not configured correctly. Use the
WebSite Server Setup applet to correct your hostname and then try 
this test again. Try it now:

<PRE><A HREF="http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo">http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo</A>  &lt;-- missing trailing slash</PRE>

Now look at the displayed current URL. It should have a trailing 
slash on it, and it also has the port number after the host name
if your server is running on a port other than 80 (the HTTP default). 

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="pizza"><H2>Sample Order-Entry Application <I>(VB4 Runtime Required)</I></H2></A>

This example uses Windows CGI and a form to provide an 
<A HREF="/cgi-win/pizza32.exe">order-entry service</A>.
The external forms-processing program <CODE>pizza32.exe</CODE>
is a Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit) application, compiled into an executable.
The same program generates the form as well as processing
its results. Note that the form has the current time on it.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> This example is an <i>excellent</i> reference
implementation for forms applications. If you are interested in
developing forms-based applications, please take the time to read the
VB code in <CODE>pizza32.bas</CODE>.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME="forms">Forms Processing</A>  <I>(VB4 Runtime Required)</I></H2>

Forms must be processed by a CGI program. One of the difficulties
encountered by most people who develop programs for their forms is that
of decoding the form data. The browser sends this data in a special form
called "URL-encoded". If you use the 
<A HREF="windows-cgi.html">Windows CGI</A> interface,
the server will decode all forms information for you. Furthermore, the
Visual Basic template application contains a module that handles reading
the decoded form information into VB globals, then calls your module
to do the actual processing. This is a major time (and frustration)
saver, and is a feature available only on this server.

<h3>Sample search form</h3>

Here is a simple form that uses a VB CGI program.
Fill in the field and select an option, then click the "Search" button.
The demo back end simply reports
what would ordinarily be submitted to the database search engine:<P>

The "search on" field supports multiple selections (may not be supported
by your browser). Try it and see
how the server handles decoding it. Netscape lets you select multiple
items with the shift and control keys, per standard Windows conventions.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Form">

Search on (multiple)<SELECT NAME="LookFor" MULTIPLE>
<OPTION SELECTED>Name
<OPTION>Title
<OPTION>Department
<OPTION>Location
<OPTION>Employee ID
</SELECT><P>

which <SELECT NAME="How">
<OPTION SELECTED>starts with
<OPTION>contains
<OPTION>is exactly
<OPTION>sounds like
</SELECT><P>

the following: <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Match-pattern"><P>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Use-Case" VALUE="Yes">Case-sensitive<P>
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Search">
</FORM>


<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "docquery">Document Based Queries</A></H2>

Most browsers have a feature that permits a hypertext document to trigger
display of a "query field". When the user enters something into the query field
the browser sends a special request to the server. You can set
up your server to offer query documents and process queries by using the
CGI program facilities. In this way, you can offer services that provide
searching databases, etc.<P>

Here are links to the 
<A HREF="/cgi-dos/demoindx.cmd">Windows NT</A> and 
<A HREF="/cgi-dos/demoindx.bat">Windows 95</A> versions.

for you transparently. The 
<A HREF="/cgi-win/uploader.exe">uploader CGI program</a> is one of

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME = "wincgi"><H2>Windows CGI Interface</H2></A>

The server supports a variant of CGI that is well suited to the Windows
environment. In addition, the server comes with a template Visual Basic
3.0 kit that allows you to develop sophisticated CGI programs quickly. Since
VB can access a wide variety of information sources such as Access and
SQL Server databases, your flexibility is almost unlimited. It is this
capability that sets the Windows Web Server apart from other Windows NT-
and Unix-based Web servers.<P>

The sample is a test program that produces various reports as to the
CGI environment it gets from the server. The reports are in HTML
format. The sources to this test program (and all of the other
samples) are in the /cgi-src directory, plus a "usage" page in the
server document root. The usage page is returned if no test selector
is specified (as "extra path" info). <P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="shellcgi"><H2>Standard CGI Interface</H2></A> 

Web pioneers have developed many CGI applications using Unix shell
scripts and the <code>perl</code> language. Windows NT has a POSIX
subsystem that can be used from the server to execute Unix applications
as CGI programs. The Windows NT Resource Kit contains a basic set of Unix
command utilities, including a Korn Shell clone. 

<h3>Perl 4</h3>

There is a Windows NT port of <code>perl</code> available
via FTP from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.intergraph.com/pub/win32/perl/">
the author, Clark Williams</a>, or 
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/software/ntperlb.zip">
here at WebSite Central</a>. In addition, I have
done an upgrade to this <code>perl</code> that allows it to do
bactic execution on Windows 95, supports filehandle access to
sockets, and Win32 "mutex" support for interprocess synchronization.
You can get this
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/software/ntperl95.zip">upgraded 
<code>perl</code> at WebSite Central</a>. <i>Note that you must
already have the NT</i> <code>perl</code> <i>kit to use my upgrade.</i>

<h3>Perl 5</h3>

The Windows NT 3.51 Resource kit contains 
<A HREF="mailto:Dick_Hardt@hip.com">Dick Hardt</a>'s NT port of <code>perl
5</code>. The latest version (later than that on the Resource Kit) 
<I>does not work on Windows 95</I>.
If you are interested in the most up-to-date information on this new
package, check out Hip Communications'
<A HREF="http://info.hip.com/ntperl/">Perl 5 for Win32</a> WebSite, 
and you can join the <code>Perl-Win32</code> mailing list by
sending a message containing "subscribe Perl-Win32" to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@mail.hip.com">majordomo@mail.hip.com</a>.



<h3>Unix Compatibility</h3>

The Standard CGI interface provided by the server on NT is virtually
identical to that provided by Unix-based servers. Therefore, you can use
existing CGI applications written in shell and perl, as long
as you have the other utilities needed by those scripts. You can also
use 32-bit Windows applications and/or associated documents as long as 
the app is written for the standard CGI/1.1 interface.<P> 

<h3>16-bit Programs</h3>

Windows NT and Windows 95
cannot pass environment variables to 16-bit DOS/Console programs, so you must
use the 
<a href="#doscgi">DOS CGI interface</a> for this sort of thing. It's tricky.
If you have a 32-bit Windows executable that can handle the pure CGI 
interface, you <i>might</i> be able to use such a program with
Standard CGI on Windows 95.

<H3>Associations</H3>
The server uses the "associations" you set up to determine
the correct shell to use for a script or document. In order for the
demos below to work, you must associate files of type <CODE>.sh</CODE>
with the <CODE>SH.EXE</CODE> Korn Shell from the resource kit, and 
<CODE>.pl</CODE> with the NT <CODE>perl</CODE> interpreter. <I>
You must use fully qualified pathnames for these associations</I>. Do
not rely on the "path".

<H3>Korn Shell Script (NT Only)</H3>

(<I>demo requires</I> <code>sh.exe</code> <I>from the NT Resource Kit</I>)<P>
Here is a simple Korn shell script that 
<A HREF="/cgi-shl/ARGS.SH/a/b/c?1+2+3">sends back 
the names and values of some CGI environment variables</a>. 
Note that the pathnames in system-generated and
server-generated variables are in POSIX format. The server
automatically determines whether the shell is a Win32 or POSIX type and 
makes the appropriate conversion on all physical pathnames it sends to
the CGI program.

<H3><CODE>perl</CODE> Script</H3>

(<I>demo requires NT</I> <CODE>perl</CODE> <I>interpreter, and the
extension</i> <code>.pl</code> <i> to be "associated" with your
perl interpreter.</I>)<P>

Here is a 
<A HREF="/cgi-shl/args.pl/a/b/c?1+2+3">small <CODE>perl</CODE> script</A>
which (of course) sends back 
the names and values of some CGI environment variables. Note that
the pathnames are in the native Win32 syntax. The server knows that 
the <CODE>perl</CODE> interpreter is a native Win32 app, not a POSIX
type.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="doscgi"><H2>DOS CGI Interface</H2></A>

The server can use batch files and programs that run in the DOS shell
environment of Windows NT and Windows 95. The command processors are
very limited, so you should use this interface for simple applications
only. Actually, we strongly recommend that you take the time to learn
Visual Basic and use the
<A HREF="#wincgi">Windows interface</A> for your CGI work.<P>

The DOS command processors for Windows NT and Windows 95 are
quite different in their capabilities, therefore we need different
batch files for each. 
By convention we use <CODE>.CMD</CODE> for Windows NT batch files, and
<CODE>.BAT</CODE> for Windows 95.  Here is a simple example that uses a
DOS batch file to send back the name and version of your browser. 
There is a version for <A HREF="/cgi-dos/browser.cmd">Windows NT</A>
and one for <A HREF="/cgi-dos/browser.bat">Windows 95</A>.<P>

This batch file <A HREF="/cgi-dos/args.cmd/a/b/c?1+2+3">(NT version)</A>
<A HREF="/cgi-dos/args.bat/a/b/c?1+2+3">(Win95 version)</A>
generates a report of some info it got from the server. This info
is passed via environment variables, according to the 
Common Gateway Interface 1.2 (CGI/1.2).<P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "access">Access Control</A></H2>

Your server has the ability to provide fine-grain control of access to
documents and scripts. Access can be controlled by user, by group, by
client host (domain) name, client IP address, or any combination of
these. You can also disable
<a href="#treenav">directory browsing and file retrieval</a> for 
parts of your web.

<I>balloon</I>. <A HREF="AuthExamples/bypwmult/demodoc.html">This
document</A> can be accessed either by user <I>Weber</I> with
password <I>Jay</I>, or by user <I>Denny</I> with password
<I>Bob</I>. 

<P>The server also permits access by groups of users, and
the Web Server Setup utility permits easy manipulation of group
membership.All users are automatically included in the group "Users".
Therefore, you can allow access to any valid user by allowing access
by the group "Users".<A HREF="AuthExamples/bygroup/demodoc.html">This
document</A> can be accessed by any user.

<A NAME="filtacc"><h3>Hostname and IP Address Filtering</h3></a>

You can also control access by host name or IP addresses. For
example, <A HREF="AuthExamples/bydomain/demodoc.html">this
document</A> can be accessed only by hosts within the IP address
range 198.211.*.*, and <A HREF="AuthExamples/bydomexc/demodoc.html">
this one </A> can be accessed by any hosts except those in the IP
address range 198.211.*.*. Although it is possible to filter by host
name, we don't recommend it because it requires that the server do a
DNS reverse lookup (to convert the IP address to the host name) on
every request. This will noticably degrade the response time of the
server on all requests.

<h3>Combining Username/Password and Host/IP restrictions</H3>

New in WebSite 1.1 is the ability to apply username/password access
and IP/host filtering in an "AND" or "OR" mode. Previously, only the
"AND" mode was supported. With "OR", you can allow internal people
to access your web (using IP filtering to reject outsiders) without
needing usernames or passwords, while requiring outsiders to
authenticate via username. See the "Access Control" tab on the server's
property sheet.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<A NAME = "stats"><H2>Statistics Reports</H2></A>
The server will send a 
<A HREF="/~stats">statistics report</A> by sending it
a URL of <CODE>/~stats</CODE>. Try it now. If you are connected to the
net, you can see the 
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/~stats">WebSite Central server's statistics</A>.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME = "admin"><H2>Server Administration</H2></A>
You may have noticed that the server responds to certain URLs that start
with the tilde character in special ways. You have seen
<code>~imagemap</code> and <code>~stats</code> so far. As you may have
guessed, there are others. The two just mentioned are "safe", i.e., they
don't "do" anything except retrieve data.<P>

The server supports a few additional special URLs that can be used to
perform some administrative tasks. These functions "do" something,
therefore in keeping with the HTTP protocol, they must be issued with
the <code>POST</code> method. Forms can issue <code>POST</code>s, and
they can have buttons, so you can make up an administration form that
contains the special function buttons you want.<P>

As shipped, the server is set up to protect these special URLs as well,
since they can affect the operation of the server. In order to
successfully use these functions, you must first authenticate yourself
as a member of the <code>Administrators</code> group. If you haven't yet
added yourself as a user in the WebServer realm, do so now. Then add
yourself to the Administrators group.<P>

If successful, these special functions return the HTTP <code>204 No
Response</code> result, so the browser stays on the current page (some
browsers may report "link leads nowhere". This is cosmetic, and is not a
server error!).
<P>

Now that you know the essentials, here are the buttons:

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~zero-ctrs">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Zero Statistics">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-acc ">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Access Log">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-err">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Error Log">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-both">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Both Logs">
</FORM>

If you cycled either of the logfiles, take a look in the
<code>logs</code> directory. You should see the cycled-out files with
extensions like <code>.001</code>.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
That's it for the demo. If you got this far without problems, you have
also done a fairly thorough checkout of your server setup.

This is an example of using the header and footer files within a
directory to annotate the directory listing. This part comes from the
"header" file. The "footer" file is displayed at the bottom (<b>read what
it says down there too!</b>). To see what a directory without a header and
footer file looks like, go to the  
<A HREF="goodies"><code>Goodies</code></A> subdirectory. If you are an HTML
fan, look at the source text for this document with your browser. A new
feature in WebSite 1.1 is the table format listing. <i>Narrow the window
of your browser to about 4 inches to see what happens!</i> You can also
view this in the older <a href="?plain">fixed-pitch format</a>, and
switch back to <a href="?table">table format</a>.

This is a "footer" file located within this directory. It can be used to
add supplemental information that doesn't fit within the heading
area.<P>

Some things to note about the above display:
<UL>
<LI> The <code>Parent Directory</code>, <code>Goodies</code>, and 
<code>note.gif</code> entries show descriptions that are taken from
a "descriptions" file within the current directory. This file is 
hidden from the listing because its name begins with <code>#</CODE>,
and the server is normally set up to hide all files whose names begin
with <code>#</code>.

<P><LI>The <code>note.gif</code> description is an HTML link. You canuse this
to provide extended descriptions for files that need it. The link is to
another hidden file <code>~note.html</code>. As shipped, the server is
set up to hide all files beginning with <code>~</code>.

<P><LI>The file <code>A Sample.html</code> has a description taken from the 
<i>contents</i> of the file. The server looks for the &lt;TITLE&gt; tags
and extracts the string enclosed. Also note that the server supports 
files with blanks in their names.

<P><LI>The file <code>Rubout.txt</code> has a description that is
it's MIME type. This is (optionally) generated by the server when there
is no other description (explicit or via HTML extraction). Note that you
can see the real case of the file name leters.
</UL>

Finally, the address shown below is a "mailto" link. If the footer is a
plain text file, or you have no footer for a directory, a mailto link to
the server administrator is automatically generated. This footer file is
an HTML document, and the mailto link is part of the footer. The server
does not generate one if the footer is HTML. Click it and see what
happens. Depending on your browser, your results may vary.

This page demonstrates most of WebSite's server-side include capabilities.
The file <code>ssi-incl.txt</code> is located in the same directory as this
file, accessible via URL as <code>/wsdocs/32demo/ssi-incl.txt</code>. It contains
the text <code>This came from a text file</code> and a CRLF. Since the display
is in "preformatted (&lt;PRE&gt;) format, line terminators are significant, 
so there are blank lines after those items. The CGI program <code>ssicgi.exe</code>
simply generates <code>Hello World</CODE> with no HTTP headers at all. If your CGI
program generates HTTP headers, they will appear in the output.

<P>First, we set some SSI configuration variables as shown. Note that you can put 
comments inside the SSI directives after the directive itself:
<PRE>&lt;!--#config timefmt="%c" use short date/time --&gt;
&lt;!--#config sizefmt="%d bytes"--&gt;
&lt;!--#config errmsg="##ERROR!##"--&gt;
<!--# timefmt="%c" use short date/time -->
<!--# sizefmt="%d bytes"-->
<!--# errmsg="##ERROR!##"--></PRE>

Then we use SSI directives. The directives are shown followed by the
substituted output resulting from these directives. :

<A NAME = "intro">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>

A large class of World Wide Web applications are best implemented using
external programs that are controlled by a web server. Examples include
front-ends to business applications which are themselves subject to
frequent changes in business rules. The broad acceptance of
rapid-application development (RAD) tools such as Visual Basic and
Delphi have given rise to the need to use these tools to Web-enable many
kinds of business applications. 

The widely used Common Gateway Interface (CGI) uses techniques well
suited to the Unix environment. A different sort of interface is needed
to support common Windows RAD tools for CGI. It is the purpose of this
specification to define such an interface.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<A NAME = "spooling">
<H2>I/O Spooling</H2></A>

A key feature of Windows CGI is its <i>spooled</i> exchange of data
between the server and the CGI program. It is <I>essential</I> that the
server provide efficient transfer of data between the spool files and
the network. This means that the server should use memory-mapped
techniques, and minimize the number of separate network I/O requests
used. 

<P>The reasons for using spooled I/O are:
<UL>
<LI>Most RAD packages do not have native network (socket) I/O
capabilities.
<LI>Socket I/O techniques are relatively exotic, and efficient results
require a thorough knowledge of the Win32 network interface. All input
and output would require complex buffering to achieve acceptable network
efficiency. 
<LI>Sockets cannot be inherited by a 16-bit program.
<LI>Spooled input (e.g. POST content) may be memory mapped and thus
processed far more efficiently than is possible using stream-oriented
techniques.
<LI>A reference set of spool files may be used for regression testing
and debugging in the RAD development environment.
<LI>Spool files may be retained after a CGI program runs, for
"post-mortem" analysis, also using the RAD environment.
</UL>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<A NAME = "form-decode">
<H2>HTML Form Data Decoding</H2></A>

Windows CGI requires that the web server decode HTML form data if
present in a POST request. It is not required that the server decode form
data if it appears in the "query string" portion of a request URL. 

<P>There are two ways in which form data may be may be sent by a
browser to the server:

<DL>
<DT><B>URL-Encoded</B>
<DD>This is the most common form data format. The contents
of form fields are "escaped" according to the rules in the HTML 1.0
Specification, then concatenated using unescaped ampersand characters.
This URL-encoded data is sent as a stream to the server, with a content
type of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.

<P><DT><B>Multipart Form Data</B>

<DD>This format has been introduced to permit efficient file uploading
with forms. It may me used without explicitly including a file upload
form field, however. The contents of the form fields are sent as a MIME
multipart message. Each field is contained within a single part. The
content type indicated by the browser is
<code>multipart/form-data</code>.
</DL>

<B>Compliant servers must decode both form data types.</B>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<A NAME = "launching">
<H2>Launching the CGI program</H2></A>

The server uses the <code>CreateProcess()</code> service to launch the
CGI program. The server maintains synchronization with the CGI program
so it can detect when the CGI program exits. This is done using the
Win32 <code>WaitForSingleObject()</code> service, waiting for the CGI
process handle to become signalled, indicating program exit.<P>

<A NAME = "launch-cmd"><H3>Command Line</H3></A>

The server must execute a CGI program request by doing a
<code>CreateProcess()</code> with a command line in the following form:

<PRE>   WinCGI-exe cgi-data-file</PRE>

<DL>

<DT><PRE>WinCGI-exe</PRE>

<DD>The complete path to the CGI program executable. The server does not 
depend on the "current directory" or the PATH environment variable. Note
that the "executable" need not be a .EXE file. It may be a document,
provided an "association" with a corresponding executable has been
established in either WIN.INI or the System Registry (preferred).
<P>

<DT><PRE>cgi-data-file</PRE>

<DD>The complete path to the <A HREF = "#profile">CGI data file</A>. <P>

</DL>
<A NAME = "launch-meth"><H3>Launch Method</H3></A>

The server issues the <code>CreateProcess()</code> such that the process
being launched has its main window hidden. The launched process itself
should not cause the appearance of a window nor a change in the Z-order
of the windows on the desktop.

<P>The server supports a CGI program/script debugging mode. If that mode
is enabled, the CGI program is launched such that its window shows and
is made active. This can assist in debugging CGI applications.

<A NAME = "associations"><H3>Document Associations</H3></A>

The server must honor document associations. If the target of a
Windows CGI request is a document (not an executable), the server must
attempt to find the associated application for the document and launch
the application such that the document is "processed".

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<A NAME = "profile"><H2>The CGI Data File</H2></A>

The server passes data to the CGI program via a Windows
"private profile" file, in key-value format. The CGI program may then use 
the standard Windows API services for enumerating and retrieving the
key-value pairs in the data file. <P>

The CGI data file contains the following sections:

<PRE><UL>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-cgi">[CGI]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-accept">[Accept]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-system">[System]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-extra">[Extra Headers]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-formlit">[Form Literal]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-formext">[Form External]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-formfile">[Form File]</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#data-formhug">[Form Huge]</A>
</UL></PRE>

<A NAME = "data-cgi"><H3>The [CGI] Section</H3></A>

This section contains most of the CGI data
items (accept types, content, and extra headers are defined in
separate sections). Each item is provided as a string value. If the
value is an empty string, the keyword is omitted. 
The keywords are listed below:<P>

<DL>
<DT><PRE>Request Protocol</PRE>
<DD>The name and revision of the information protocol this request came
in with. Format: protocol/revision. Example: "HTTP/1.0".<P>

<DD>The method with which the request was made. For HTTP, this is "GET",
"HEAD", "POST", etc.<P>

<DT><PRE>Executable Path</PRE>
<DD>The logical path to the CGI program executable, as needed for
self-referencing URLs.<P>

<DT><PRE>Logical Path</PRE>
<DD>A request may specify a path to a resource needed to complete that
request. This path may be in a logical pathname space. This item
contain the pathname exactly as received by the server, without
logical-to-physical translation.<P>

<DT><PRE>Physical Path</PRE>
<DD>If the request contained logical path information, the server
provides the path in physical form, in the native object (e.g., file)
access syntax of the operating system.<P>

<DT><PRE>Query String</PRE>
<DD>The information which follows the ? in the URL that generated the
request is the "query" information. The server furnishes this to the
back end whenever it is present on the request URL, without any decoding
or translation.<P>

<DT><PRE>Request Range</PRE>
<DD>Byte-range specification received with request (if any). See the current
Internet Draft (or RFC) describing the byte-range extension to HTTP for
more information. The server must support CGI program participation in
byte-ranging.<P>

<DT><PRE>Referer</PRE>
<DD>The URL of the document that contained the link pointing to this CGI
program. Note that in some browsers the implementation of this
is broken, and cannot be relied-on.<P>

<DT><PRE>From</PRE>
<DD>The e-mail address of the browser user. Note that this is in the
HTTP specification but is not implemented in some browsers due to
privacy concerns.<P>

<DT><PRE>User Agent</PRE>
<DD>A string description of the client (browser) software. Not generated by
all browsers.<P>

<DT><PRE>Content Type</PRE>
<DD>For requests which have attached data this is the MIME content type 
of that data. Format: type/subtype.<P>

<DT><PRE>Content Length</PRE>
<DD>For requests which have attached data, this is the length of the 
content in bytes.<P>

<DT><PRE>Content File</PRE>
<DD>For requests which have attached data, the server makes the
data available to the CGI program by putting it into this file. The value
of this item is the complete pathname of that file.<P>

<DT><PRE>Server Software</PRE>
<DD>The name and version of the information server software answering
the request (and running the CGI program). Format: name/version.<P>

<DT><PRE>Server Name</PRE>
<DD>The network host name or alias of the server, as needed 
for self-referencing URLs. This (in combination with the ServerPort)
could be used to manufacture a full URL to the server, for URL fixups.<P>

<DT><PRE>Server Port</PRE>
<DD>Tne network port number on which the server is listening. This 
is also needed for self-referencing URLs.<P>

<DT><PRE>Server Admin</PRE>
<DD>The e-mail address of the server's administrator. This is used
in error messages, and might be used to send MAPI mail to the 
administrator, or to form "mailto:" URLs in generated documents.<P>

<DT><PRE>CGI Version</PRE>
<DD>The revision of the CGI specification to which this server complies.
Format: CGI/revision. For this version, "CGI/1.2 (Win)". <P>

<DT><PRE>Remote Host</PRE>
<DD>The network host name of the client (requestor) system, if
available. This item is used for logging.<P>

<DT><PRE>Remote Address</PRE>
<DD>The network (IP) address of the client (requestor) system. This item
is used for logging if the host name is not available.

<DT><PRE>Authentication Method</PRE>
<DD>If execution of the CGI program is
protected, this is the protocol-specific authentication method used to
authenticate the user.<P>

<DT><PRE>Authentication Realm</PRE>
<DD>If execution of the CGI program is
protected, this is the method-specific authentication realm used to
authenticate the user. The list of users for the given realm is 
checked for authentication.<P>

<DT><PRE>Authenticated Username</PRE>
<DD>If execution of the CGI program is
protected, this is the username (in the indicated realm)
that the client used to authenticate for
access to the CGI program.<P>
</DL>

<A NAME = "data-accept"><H3>The [Accept] Section</H3></A>

This section contains the client's
acceptable data types found in the request header as 

<PRE>Accept: type/subtype {parameters}</PRE>

If the parameters (e.g., "q=0.100") are present, they are passed as the
value of the item. If there are no parameters, the value is "Yes".
<P>

<I>Note: The accept types may easily be enumerated by the CGI program with
a call to GetPrivateProfileString() with NULL for the key name. This
returns all of the keys in the section as a null-delimited string with a
double-null terminator.</I><P>

<A NAME = "data-system"><H3>The [System] Section</H3></A>

This section contains items that are specific to the Windows
implementation of CGI. The following keys are used: <P>

<DL>

<DT><PRE>GMT Offset</PRE>

<DD>The numper of seconds to be added to GMT time to reach
local time. For pacific Standard time, this number is -28,800. Useful
for computing GMT times.

<DT><PRE>Debug Mode</PRE>

<DD>This is <CODE>No</CODE> unless the server's "CGI/script tracing"
mode is enabled, then it is <CODE>Yes</CODE>. Useful for providing
conditional tracing within the CGI program.

<DT><PRE>Output File</PRE>

<DD>The full path/name of the file in which the 
server expects to receive the CGI program's results.

<DT><PRE>Content File</PRE>

<DD>The full path/name of the file that contains the content (if any) that
came with the request. 
</DL>

<A NAME = "data-extra"><H3>The [Extra Headers] Section</H3></A>

This section contains the "extra" headers
that were included with the request, in "key=value" form. The server
must URL-unescape both the key and the value prior to writing them to
the CGI data file.
<P>

<I>Note: The extra headers may easily be enumerated by the CGI program with
a call to GetPrivateProfileString() with NULL for the key name. This
returns all of the keys in the section as a null-delimited string with a
double-null terminator.</I><P>

<A NAME = "data-formlit"><H3>The [Form Literal] Section</H3></A>

If the request is an HTTP POST from an HTTP form (with content type of
application/x-www-form-urlencoded or 
multipart/form-data), the server will decode the form
data and put it into the [Form Literal] section.<P>

For URL-encoded form data, raw form input is of the form 
"key=value&amp;key=value&amp;...", with the value
parts in url-encoded format. The server splits the key=value pairs
at the '&amp;', then splits the key and value at the '=', url-decodes the
value string, and puts the result into key=(decoded)value form in the
[Form Literal] section.<P>

For multipart form data, raw form input is in a MIME-style multipart
format, with each field in a separate part. The server extracts the
field namd and value from each part and puts the result into key=value
form in the [Form Literal] section.<p> 

If the form contains any <CODE>SELECT MULTIPLE</CODE> elements, there
will be multiple occurrences of the same key. In this case, the server
generates a normal "key=value" pair for the first occurrence, and it
appends a sequence number to subsequent occurrences. It is up to the
CGI program to know about this possibility and to properly recognize
the tagged keys.

<A NAME = "data-formext"><H3>The [Form External] Section</H3></A>

If the decoded value string is more than 254 characters long, or if the
decoded value string contains any control characters or double-quotes,
the server puts the decoded value into an external tempfile and lists
the field into the [Form External] section as:

<PRE>  key=pathname length</PRE>

where <I>pathname</I> is the path and name of the tempfile containing
the decoded value string, and <I>length</I> is the length in bytes
of the decoded value string.<P>

<I>Note: Be sure to open this file in binary mode unless you are
certain that the form data is text!</I><P>

<A NAME = "data-formhug"><H3>The [Form Huge] Section</H3></A>

If the raw value string is more than 65,535 bytes long, the server
does no decoding, but it does get the keyword and mark the location
and size of the value in the Content File. 
The server lists the huge field in the [Form Huge]
section as:
<PRE>  key=offset length</PRE>

where <I>offset</I> is the offset from the beginning of the Content File
at which the raw value string for this key is located, and <I>length</I>
is the length in bytes of the raw value string. You can use the
offset to perform a "Seek" to the start of the raw value string,
and use the length to know when you have read the entire raw string
into your decoder.

<I>Note: Be sure to open this file in binary mode unless you are
certain that the form data is text!</I><P>

<A NAME = "data-formfile"><H3>The [Form File] Section</H3></A>

If the request is in the <code>multipart/form-data</code> format, it
may contain one or more file uploads. In this case, each file upload
is placed into an external tempfile similar to the form external 
data. Each such file upload is listed in the [Form File} section as:

<PRE>  key=[pathname] length type xfer [filename]</PRE>

where <code>pathname</code> is the pathname of the external tempfile 
containing the uploaded file, <code>length</code> is the length in 
bytes of the uploaded file, <code>type</code> is the MIME content type
of the uploaded file, <code>xfer</code> is
the content-transfer encoding of the uploaded file, and 
<code>filename</code> is the original name of the uploaded file. The
square brackets must be included. They are used to delimit the file and
pathnames, which may contain spaces.

<A NAME = "formex"><H3>Example of Form Decoding</H3></A>

In the following sample, the form contained a small field, a SELECT
MULTIPLE with 2 small selections, a field with 300
characters in it, one with line breaks (a text area), and a 230KB field.

<PRE>    [Form Literal]
    smallfield=123 Main St. #122
    multiple=first selection
    multiple_1=second selection

    [Form External]
    field300chars=C:\TEMP\HS19AF6C.000 300
    fieldwithlinebreaks=C:\TEMP\HS19AF6C.001 43

    [Form Huge]
    field230K=C:\TEMP\HS19AF6C.002 276920

<A NAME = "results"><HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE></A>
<H2>Results Processing</H2>

The CGI program returns its results to the server as a data stream
representing (directly or indirectly) the goal of the request.
The server is responsible for "packaging" the data stream according to
HTTP, and for using HTTP to
transport the data stream to the requesting client. This means that the
server normally adds the needed HTTP headers to the CGI program's results.<P>

The data stream consists of two parts: the <I>header</I> and the
<I>body</I>. The header consists of one or more lines of text, and is
separated from the body by a blank line. The body contains
MIME-conforming data whose content type
must be reflected in the header.<P>

The server does <i>not</i> interpret or modify the body in any way. It
is essential that the client receive exactly the data that was generated
by the back end.<P>

<H3>Special Header Lines</H3>

The server recognizes the following header lines in the results data
stream:<P>

<DL>

<DT><PRE>Content-Type:</PRE>

<DD>Indicates that the body contains data of the specified MIME content
type. The value must be a MIME content type/subtype.<P>

<DT><PRE>URI: &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; (value enclosed in angle brackets)</PRE>

<DD>The value is either a full URL or a local file reference, either of which
points to an object to be returned to the client in lieu of the body
(which the server shall ignore in this type of result). If the value is a 
local file, the server sends it as the results of the request, as though
the client issued a <CODE>GET</CODE> for that object.
If the value is a full URL,
the server returns a "401 redirect" to the
client to retrieve the specified object directly.<P> 

<DT>Location:</PRE>

<DD> Same as URI, but this form is now deprecated. The value must
<i>not</I> be enclosed in angle brackets with this form.
</DL>

<H3>Other Headers</H3>

Any other headers in the result stream are passed 
(unmodified) by the server to the client. It is the responsibility of
the CGI program to avoid including headers that clash with those
used by HTTP. <P>

<A NAME = "dir-ret"><HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE></A>

<H2>Direct Return</H2>

The server provides for the back end to return its results directly
to the client, bypassing the server's "packaging" of the data stream for
its information protocol. In this case, it is the responsibility of the
CGI program to generate a complete message packaged for HTTP.
<P>

The server looks at the results in the Output file, and if the first
line starts with "<CODE>HTTP/1.0</CODE>", it assumes that the results
contain a complete HTTP response, and sends the results to the client
without packaging.<P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>

<H2>Examples:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The following example represents a response made by a CGI program that was
invoked by an HTTP server, and consists of an HTML-formatted body:

<PRE>--- BEGIN ---
Content-type: text/html           &lt;== MIME type of body
                                  &lt;== Header-body separator
&lt;HTML&gt;                            &lt;== Body starts here 
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Sample Document&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Sample Document&lt;/H1&gt;
[... etc.]
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
---  END  ---
</PRE>

<LI>This example represents a redirection response, where the server is to direct
the client to fetch the object indicated by the URL (using FTP):

<PRE>--- BEGIN ---
Location: ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/www/object.dat  &lt;== URL of object
                                                   &lt;== Blank line
---  END  ---</PRE>

<LI>This example represents a direct-return response from a CGI program that
was invoked by an HTTP server, where the results contain a complete
HTTP response:

<PRE>--- BEGIN ---
HTTP/1.0 200 OK                   &lt;== Start of HTTP Header

<IMG SRC="eyeball.gif"> Before looking at the sources, 
I <I>strongly</I> suggest you 
<A HREF="/cgi-win/dbsample32.exe">play around with the application</A>
and become familiar with what it does. Also, you will probably want to
refer to the 
<A HREF="/wsdocs/32demo/windows-cgi.html">Windows CGI 1.3

<P>This is a very simple database of students, classes, and a linking
table describing which student(s) are currently taking which class(es).
It is meant to illustrate these important techniques:

<UL>
<LI>Using HTML forms as a front-end to a relational database
<LI>Basic relational data access, addition, removal and updating using
Visual Basic Professional 4.0 
<LI>Data normalization, and forming many-to-many relations by using a
linking table
<LI>Using Access "queries" to keep complex SQL statements in the database
as precompiled, stored procedures
<LI>Using Access' referential integrity features to simplify removal of
objects which are referred-to by other objects
<LI>Exception handling techniques that send useful error messages back
to the browser instead of letting the CGI program fail silently,
causing the famous "500 Server Error"
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="eyeball.gif"> <B>The code has almost no comments in
it</B>. This is <i>intentional</i>. It is meant to be used in conjunction
with the O'Reilly book that is shipped with every copy of WebSite.

<P>The links below lead to the VB sources, and the Access relations,
tables and queries. The Access description pages show information
pictorially and in SQL source where appropriate.

This is an example of using the header and footer files within a
directory to annotate the directory listing. This part comes from the
"header" file. The "footer" file is displayed at the bottom (<b>read what
it says down there too!</b>). To see what a directory without a header and
footer file looks like, go to the  
<A HREF="goodies"><code>Goodies</code></A> subdirectory. If you are an HTML
fan, look at the source text for this document with your browser. A new
feature in WebSite 1.1 is the table format listing. <i>Narrow the window
of your browser to about 4 inches to see what happens!</i> You can also
view this in the older <a href="?plain">fixed-pitch format</a>, and
switch back to <a href="?table">table format</a>.

<HR>
This is a "footer" file located within this directory. It can be used to
add supplemental information that doesn't fit within the heading
area.<P>

Some things to note about the above display:
<UL>
<LI> The <code>Parent Directory</code>, <code>Goodies</code>, and 
<code>note.gif</code> entries show descriptions that are taken from
a "descriptions" file within the current directory. This file is 
hidden from the listing because its name begins with <code>#</CODE>,
and the server is normally set up to hide all files whose names begin
with <code>#</code>.

<P><LI>The <code>note.gif</code> description is an HTML link. You canuse this
to provide extended descriptions for files that need it. The link is to
another hidden file <code>~note.html</code>. As shipped, the server is
set up to hide all files beginning with <code>~</code>.

<P><LI>The file <code>A Sample.html</code> has a description taken from the 
<i>contents</i> of the file. The server looks for the &lt;TITLE&gt; tags
and extracts the string enclosed. Also note that the server supports 
files with blanks in their names.

<P><LI>The file <code>Rubout.txt</code> has a description that is
it's MIME type. This is (optionally) generated by the server when there
is no other description (explicit or via HTML extraction). Note that you
can see the real case of the file name leters.
</UL>

Finally, the address shown below is a "mailto" link. If the footer is a
plain text file, or you have no footer for a directory, a mailto link to
the server administrator is automatically generated. This footer file is
an HTML document, and the mailto link is part of the footer. The server
does not generate one if the footer is HTML. Click it and see what
happens. Depending on your browser, your results may vary.

This is an example of using the header and footer files within a
directory to annotate the directory listing. This part comes from the
"header" file. The "footer" file is displayed at the bottom (<b>read what
it says down there too!</b>). To see what a directory without a header and
footer file looks like, go to the  
<A HREF="goodies"><code>Goodies</code></A> subdirectory. If you are an HTML
fan, look at the source text for this document with your browser. A new
feature in WebSite 1.1 is the table format listing. <i>Narrow the window
of your browser to about 4 inches to see what happens!</i> You can also
view this in the older <a href="?plain">fixed-pitch format</a>, and
switch back to <a href="?table">table format</a>.

Self-Test & Demonstration</H1>
<I>Version 1.1 (04-Dec-95)</i>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
This document exercises (and demonstrates)
many of the capabilities of your WebSite server
and your browser. Please take the time to work through
each feature. Don't worry if the more esoteric features
don't seem to make sense; you'll know the reasons for them
soon after you start using the server for real things.
<p>
For additional information on these features, check out
<a href=http://website.ora.com/>WebSite Central</a>, which has updates,
Q/A, add-ons, betas, and more.
<p>
If you are having difficulties, please consult the
<a href="/wsdocs/trouble.html">troubleshooting tips</a> before
contacting <a href="/wsdocs/trouble.html#support">technical support</a>
during the 90 days of technical support you get if you send in
your registration card.

Self-Test Checklist</H2>

<P>Here's a checklist you can use to verify your
setup:

<UL>
<LI>You have read <A HREF="/wsdocs/trouble.html">Troubleshooting Tips</A>.
<LI>You are using a browser that supports forms, image maps, 
and basic authentication (most do)
<LI>You have enabled automatic fetching of inline images
<LI>Your browser is configured to accept and view GIF and basic sound
<LI>You have a GIF viewer and sound player installed and tested with your browser
<LI>The WebSite server is running 
<LI>You are reading this document from the server (not as a local file)
<LI>For the Windows CGI examples, you have at least the Visual Basic 4.0
runtime modules installed.
<LI>For the Access/VB integration sample, you have VB4 and Access 95
runtime modules installed.
<LI>You have added yourself as a user in the Web Server realm, and 
added yourself to the Administrators group.
<LI>For Windows 95, you have added the <CODE>CommandEnvSize=8192</CODE>
 line to the <CODE>[NonWindowsApp]</CODE> section of SYSTEM.INI and
 rebooted. <i>This is required only for the DOS CGI examples.</i>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME = "basic">Basic Document Retrieval</A></H2>

This is the most basic, yet most often used, function that your server provides.
When the user clicks on a hot-spot, the browser sends a request to the server
and the server returns the requested document.<P>

Here is a <A HREF = "basic.txt">plain text document</A><BR>
Here is a <A HREF = "basic.html">hypertext document</A><BR>
Here is a <A HREF = "images/rbd.gif">GIF image</A> (the server author)<BR>
Here is an <A HREF = "ring.au">audio clip</A><BR>

You can also use an image
<A HREF = "basic.html">
<IMG SRC  = "/wsdocs/images/question.gif" WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=32></A>
as a hot-spot.

<H2><A NAME = "treenav">Directory Tree Navigation</A></H2>

<h3><a href="demotree/">Look here first</a></h3>

This feature permits the server to display directories on your PC
and lets Web users browse and retrieve files. 
In addition, as server administrator, you can create text descriptions
for files to assist your users in identifying and locating files.
You can look at this feature as a "fancy FTP". It does <I>not</I>
use the FTP protocol; it uses the Web's own HTTP for file transfers.

<P>For this demo, I have created a small <A HREF = "demotree/">directory
tree</A> with some useless documents in it. Have a look and you'll get
the idea. Clicking on the Parent Directory entry at the top of the demo
tree will take you back to this demo document. Can you figure out how
that happens?

<H3>HTML-3 Table Support</H3>

WebSite's directory listing format uses the
HTML-3 table feature.  This produces a much nicer looking
listing, but it will be unusable by people without table-aware browsers.
You can offer the older fixed-pitch format by including a link in the
directory header with <code>?plain</code> appended to the directory URL.
If a directory listing does not have a header, WebSite puts a link for
changing listing format at the top.

<P>Here is the above <A HREF = "demotree/?plain">sample
directory tree in fixed-pitch format</a>. Note that, once the server sees you
use the <code>?plain</code> argument, it will construct parent- and
sub-directory links with this argument appended, preserving the
fixed-pitch mode. 

<p>If you feel that most of your users do not have a browser that
handles the new HTML-3 tables, you can tell the server to <i>default</i>
to using fixed-pitch for its directory listings. 
Turn off the Use HTML3 Tables switch on the Indexing tab
of the server's property sheet (Server Admin). WebSite ships with this
switch enabled.

<H3>Disabling Directory Browsing</H3>

There are two ways that you can disable directory browsing: server-wide
and path-specific. The Dir Index page of the server's property sheet has
a checkbox that you can use to disable directory browsing server-wide.
You can also create an access-control path on the Access Control page of
the server's property sheet and check "Disable directory listings". This
will prevent directory browsing on that path and it's children. 

<P><A HREF="demotree/nobrowse/">Here is a directory</A> that has been protected
against browsing with access control. 

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "imagemap">Image Maps</A></H2>

The server has the built-in ability to process clicks within an inline
image and perform actions based on the <I>location</I> of the click.
This is called "image map" support. With it, for example, you can create
a graphical map of a complex set of Web pages and let your users
navigate visually. Obviously, many other clever things can be done with
image maps.<P>

Here is an inline GIF image. Click in it and see what happens. <b>If
you get an error message, your server is not running, or you are
reading this as a file.</b> Try 
<a href="http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo/index.html#imagemap">
this link</A> to see if your local server is running.

<center>
<p><a href="32demo.map">
<IMG SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100 
BORDER=2 ALT="TEST"></a>
<P>
</center>

<p>In contrast to all other known Web servers, this server does not require
running an external program to handle image map requests. <B>The
support is built into the server</B>. This makes the server very
efficient at handling image mapping.<P>

<h3>Image Map Data</h3>

Using the WebSite Image Map Editor, you can graphically create the
hotspots against a background of the image you want to map. This mapping
information is stored in an image map file, which the server uses to
determine what to do depending on where you click. The HTML used in the sample
above is:

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="32demo.map"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;</PRE>

The <code>32demo.map</code> is the name of the map file. When WebSite
sees a file name ending in <code>.map</code> it assumes that the file
contains NCSA-format image mapping data. This activates WebSite's
server's special built-in image mapper. WebSite reads the map file and
uses the data in it to decide what to do. You can open the map
with the WebSite Imagemap Editor and see the regions
as they were defined, along with their target URLs (right click on a
region). You may have to locate the background image yourself (one time
only) after installing WebSite. Here is the image mapping data for 
the example above:

<PRE>default /wsdocs/32demo/noshape.html
ellipse /wsdocs/32demo/circle.html 8,9 90,89
poly /wsdocs/32demo/poly.html 250,10 212,90 290,90 250,10
rect /wsdocs/32demo/rect.html 130,10 171,91</PRE>

<p>WebSite  1.1 uses standard NCSA-format image map files, and for
backward compatibility with previous versions, it can use WebSite 1.0
registry-based maps as well. <i>We recommend that you use file-based
image maps at all times.</i> If you have any registry-based image maps,
use the new Image Map Editor to read them and save them in NCSA file
format. Then  change your links to point to the image map files instead
of the registry. You can put your map files in the same directory as the
documents that use them.

<!-- Anchor used in return links from imagemap targets -->
<a name="file-imap">
<p>The following
example uses an image map file <code>self-test.map</code>.</a> 

<center>
<p><A HREF="/wsdocs/32demo/self-test.map">
<IMG SRC="images/file-imap.gif" ISMAP WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=68></a>
</center>

<p>Note that the NCSA image map format supports the <code>point</code>
element, in which a click outside of any geometric region resolved to the
nearest point. The presence of one or more point elements bypasses any
background (default) element. The ellipse region is unique to WebSite.
Most other imagemappers support only circles.

<p>The HTML used in this sample is:

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="/wsdocs/32demo/self-test.map"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="images/file-imap.gif" ISMAP&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>

and the contents of <code>self-test.map</code> are:

<PRE>ellipse /wsdocs/32demo/ellipse.html 50,12 170,54
point /wsdocs/32demo/ptleft.html 24,34
point /wsdocs/32demo/ptright.html 194,34</pre>


<h3>The Two Ways to Code Image Maps in HTML</H3>

Actually, there are two ways to code image maps in HTML. The
traditional way is to use the <code>ISMAP</code> element within an
image tag, then enclose it with a link to the image mapper. The
above examples use this method.

<P><A NAME="imagemap2"></A>
Another way to make an image map uses an obscure but useful feature of 
HTML forms. Create an input field of type <code>IMAGE</code> within
a form whose execution target is the image mapper. Forms can use
either the <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> method, but
<i>file-based image maps require using GET</i>. An example, 
along with the actual HTML used, appears below.

<PRE>&lt;FORM METHOD="<B>GET</B>" ACTION="32demo.map"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SRC="/wsdocs/32demo/images/imapdemo.gif"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</PRE>

<center>
<FORM METHOD="GET" ACTION="32demo.map">
<INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SRC="images/imapdemo.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100>

<A NAME="SSI"><H2>Server-side Includes</H2></A>

<A HREF="ssi.html-ssi"><H3>Test Page Here</H3></A>

WebSite 1.1 introduces the powerful "server-side include" (SSI) feature
found in some other web servers. This feature permits you to dynamically
insert data from various sources into an HTML document. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> WebSite's unique built-in SSI support for page counters
eliminates the need for CGI-based page counter packages completely. 

<P><A HREF="ssi.html-ssi">This document</a> demonstrates and tests 
WebSite's SSI facilities. See the WebSite book for details on the
features and syntax for using SSI.

<A NAME="urlfix"><H2>Automatic URL-Fixup</H2></A>

This section checks out a vital feature of your server, its ability to
fix up directory URLs that don't have a trailing slash. Don't bother to 
try to understand why this is needed for now. Look at the URL that is
displayed at the top of your browser. It ends either with
<code>index.html </code> or with a trailing slash. Click the link below.
If this document is successfully redisplayed, the feature is working. If
you get an error, your hostname is not configured correctly. Use the
WebSite Server Setup applet to correct your hostname and then try 
this test again. Try it now:

<PRE><A HREF="http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo">http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo</A>  &lt;-- missing trailing slash</PRE>

Now look at the displayed current URL. It should have a trailing 
slash on it, and it also has the port number after the host name
if your server is running on a port other than 80 (the HTTP default).

<A NAME="pizza"><H2>Sample Order-Entry Application <I>(VB4 Runtime Required)</I></H2></A>

This example uses Windows CGI and a form to provide an 
<A HREF="/cgi-win/pizza32.exe">order-entry service</A>.
The external forms-processing program <CODE>pizza32.exe</CODE>
is a Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit) application, compiled into an executable.
The same program generates the form as well as processing
its results. Note that the form has the current time on it.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> This example is an <i>excellent</i> reference
implementation for forms applications. If you are interested in
developing forms-based applications, please take the time to read the
VB code in <CODE>pizza32.bas</CODE>.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME="forms">Forms Processing</A>  <I>(VB4 Runtime Required)</I></H2>

Forms must be processed by a CGI program. One of the difficulties
encountered by most people who develop programs for their forms is that
of decoding the form data. The browser sends this data in a special form
called "URL-encoded". If you use the 
<A HREF="windows-cgi.html">Windows CGI</A> interface,
the server will decode all forms information for you. Furthermore, the
Visual Basic template application contains a module that handles reading
the decoded form information into VB globals, then calls your module
to do the actual processing. This is a major time (and frustration)
saver, and is a feature available only on this server.

<h3>Sample search form</h3>

Here is a simple form that uses a VB CGI program.
Fill in the field and select an option, then click the "Search" button.
The demo back end simply reports
what would ordinarily be submitted to the database search engine:<P>

The "search on" field supports multiple selections (may not be supported
by your browser). Try it and see
how the server handles decoding it. Netscape lets you select multiple
items with the shift and control keys, per standard Windows conventions.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Form">

Search on (multiple)<SELECT NAME="LookFor" MULTIPLE>
<OPTION SELECTED>Name
<OPTION>Title
<OPTION>Department
<OPTION>Location
<OPTION>Employee ID
</SELECT><P>

which <SELECT NAME="How">
<OPTION SELECTED>starts with
<OPTION>contains
<OPTION>is exactly
<OPTION>sounds like
</SELECT><P>

the following: <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Match-pattern"><P>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Use-Case" VALUE="Yes">Case-sensitive<P>
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Search">
</FORM>


<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "docquery">Document Based Queries</A></H2>

Most browsers have a feature that permits a hypertext document to trigger
display of a "query field". When the user enters something into the query field
the browser sends a special request to the server. You can set
up your server to offer query documents and process queries by using the
CGI program facilities. In this way, you can offer services that provide
searching databases, etc.<P>

Here are links to the 
<A HREF="/cgi-dos/demoindx.cmd">Windows NT</A> and

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME = "wincgi"><H2>Windows CGI Interface</H2></A>

The server supports a variant of CGI that is well suited to the Windows
environment. In addition, the server comes with a template Visual Basic
3.0 kit that allows you to develop sophisticated CGI programs quickly. Since
VB can access a wide variety of information sources such as Access and
SQL Server databases, your flexibility is almost unlimited. It is this
capability that sets the Windows Web Server apart from other Windows NT-
and Unix-based Web servers.<P>

The sample is a test program that produces various reports as to the
CGI environment it gets from the server. The reports are in HTML
format. The sources to this test program (and all of the other
samples) are in the /cgi-src directory, plus a "usage" page in the
server document root. The usage page is returned if no test selector
is specified (as "extra path" info). <P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="shellcgi"><H2>Standard CGI Interface</H2></A> 

Web pioneers have developed many CGI applications using Unix shell
scripts and the <code>perl</code> language. Windows NT has a POSIX
subsystem that can be used from the server to execute Unix applications
as CGI programs. The Windows NT Resource Kit contains a basic set of Unix
command utilities, including a Korn Shell clone. 

<h3>Perl 4</h3>

There is a Windows NT port of <code>perl</code> available
via FTP from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.intergraph.com/pub/win32/perl/">
the author, Clark Williams</a>, or 
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/software/ntperlb.zip">
here at WebSite Central</a>. In addition, I have
done an upgrade to this <code>perl</code> that allows it to do
bactic execution on Windows 95, supports filehandle access to
sockets, and Win32 "mutex" support for interprocess synchronization.
You can get this
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/software/ntperl95.zip">upgraded 
<code>perl</code> at WebSite Central</a>. <i>Note that you must
already have the NT</i> <code>perl</code> <i>kit to use my upgrade.</i>

<h3>Perl 5</h3>

The Windows NT 3.51 Resource kit contains 
<A HREF="mailto:Dick_Hardt@hip.com">Dick Hardt</a>'s NT port of <code>perl
5</code>. The latest version (later than that on the Resource Kit) 
<I>does not work on Windows 95</I>.
If you are interested in the most up-to-date information on this new
package, check out Hip Communications'
<A HREF="http://info.hip.com/ntperl/">Perl 5 for Win32</a> WebSite, 
and you can join the <code>Perl-Win32</code> mailing list by
sending a message containing "subscribe Perl-Win32" to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@mail.hip.com">majordomo@mail.hip.com</a>.



<h3>Unix Compatibility</h3>

The Standard CGI interface provided by the server on NT is virtually
identical to that provided by Unix-based servers. Therefore, you can use
existing CGI applications written in shell and perl, as long
as you have the other utilities needed by those scripts. You can also
use 32-bit Windows applications and/or associated documents as long as 
the app is written for the standard CGI/1.1 interface.<P> 

<h3>16-bit Programs</h3>

Windows NT and Windows 95
cannot pass environment variables to 16-bit DOS/Console programs, so you must
use the 
<a href="#doscgi">DOS CGI interface</a> for this sort of thing. It's tricky.
If you have a 32-bit Windows executable that can handle the pure CGI 
interface, you <i>might</i> be able to use such a program with
Standard CGI on Windows 95.

<H3>Associations</H3>
The server uses the "associations" you set up to determine
the correct shell to use for a script or document. In order for the
demos below to work, you must associate files of type <CODE>.sh</CODE>
with the <CODE>SH.EXE</CODE> Korn Shell from the resource kit, and 
<CODE>.pl</CODE> with the NT <CODE>perl</CODE> interpreter. <I>
You must use fully qualified pathnames for these associations</I>. Do
not rely on the "path".

<H3>Korn Shell Script (NT Only)</H3>

(<I>demo requires</I> <code>sh.exe</code> <I>from the NT Resource Kit</I>)<P>
Here is a simple Korn shell script that 
<A HREF="/cgi-shl/ARGS.SH/a/b/c?1+2+3">sends back 
the names and values of some CGI environment variables</a>. 
Note that the pathnames in system-generated and
server-generated variables are in POSIX format. The server
automatically determines whether the shell is a Win32 or POSIX type and 
makes the appropriate conversion on all physical pathnames it sends to
the CGI program.

<H3><CODE>perl</CODE> Script</H3>

(<I>demo requires NT</I> <CODE>perl</CODE> <I>interpreter, and the
extension</i> <code>.pl</code> <i> to be "associated" with your
perl interpreter.</I>)<P>

Here is a 
<A HREF="/cgi-shl/args.pl/a/b/c?1+2+3">small <CODE>perl</CODE> script</A>
which (of course) sends back 
the names and values of some CGI environment variables. Note that
the pathnames are in the native Win32 syntax. The server knows that 
the <CODE>perl</CODE> interpreter is a native Win32 app, not a POSIX
type.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<A NAME="doscgi"><H2>DOS CGI Interface</H2></A>

The server can use batch files and programs that run in the DOS shell
environment of Windows NT and Windows 95. The command processors are
very limited, so you should use this interface for simple applications
only. Actually, we strongly recommend that you take the time to learn
Visual Basic and use the
<A HREF="#wincgi">Windows interface</A> for your CGI work.<P>

The DOS command processors for Windows NT and Windows 95 are
quite different in their capabilities, therefore we need different
batch files for each. 
By convention we use <CODE>.CMD</CODE> for Windows NT batch files, and
<CODE>.BAT</CODE> for Windows 95.  Here is a simple example that uses a
DOS batch file to send back the name and version of your browser. 
There is a version for <A HREF="/cgi-dos/browser.cmd">Windows NT</A>
and one for <A HREF="/cgi-dos/browser.bat">Windows 95</A>.<P>

This batch file <A HREF="/cgi-dos/args.cmd/a/b/c?1+2+3">(NT version)</A>
<A HREF="/cgi-dos/args.bat/a/b/c?1+2+3">(Win95 version)</A>
generates a report of some info it got from the server. This info
is passed via environment variables, according to the 
Common Gateway Interface 1.2 (CGI/1.2).<P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<H2><A NAME = "access">Access Control</A></H2>

Your server has the ability to provide fine-grain control of access to
documents and scripts. Access can be controlled by user, by group, by
client host (domain) name, client IP address, or any combination of
these. You can also disable
<a href="#treenav">directory browsing and file retrieval</a> for 
parts of your web.

range 198.211.*.*, and <A HREF="AuthExamples/bydomexc/demodoc.html">
this one </A> can be accessed by any hosts except those in the IP
address range 198.211.*.*. Although it is possible to filter by host
name, we don't recommend it because it requires that the server do a
DNS reverse lookup (to convert the IP address to the host name) on
every request. This will noticably degrade the response time of the
server on all requests.

<h3>Combining Username/Password and Host/IP restrictions</H3>

New in WebSite 1.1 is the ability to apply username/password access
and IP/host filtering in an "AND" or "OR" mode. Previously, only the
"AND" mode was supported. With "OR", you can allow internal people
to access your web (using IP filtering to reject outsiders) without
needing usernames or passwords, while requiring outsiders to
authenticate via username. See the "Access Control" tab on the server's
property sheet.

The server supports a few additional special URLs that can be used to
perform some administrative tasks. These functions "do" something,
therefore in keeping with the HTTP protocol, they must be issued with
the <code>POST</code> method. Forms can issue <code>POST</code>s, and
they can have buttons, so you can make up an administration form that
contains the special function buttons you want.<P>

As shipped, the server is set up to protect these special URLs as well,
since they can affect the operation of the server. In order to
successfully use these functions, you must first authenticate yourself
as a member of the <code>Administrators</code> group. If you haven't yet
added yourself as a user in the WebServer realm, do so now. Then add
yourself to the Administrators group.<P>

If successful, these special functions return the HTTP <code>204 No
Response</code> result, so the browser stays on the current page (some
browsers may report "link leads nowhere". This is cosmetic, and is not a
server error!).
<P>

Now that you know the essentials, here are the buttons:

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~zero-ctrs">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Zero Statistics">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-acc ">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Access Log">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-err">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Error Log">
</FORM>
<P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/~cycle-both">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Cycle Both Logs">
</FORM>

If you cycled either of the logfiles, take a look in the
<code>logs</code> directory. You should see the cycled-out files with
extensions like <code>.001</code>.

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
That's it for the demo. If you got this far without problems, you have
also done a fairly thorough checkout of your server setup.

<H2>Overview of Visual Basic 4.0 Sources</H2>

The sample application uses the <CODE>CGI32.BAS</CODE> module that ships
with WebSite, and which provides all of the interface code needed to get
the CGI environment set up in VB globals. This module contains the 
<CODE>Sub Main</CODE> procedure. When <CODE>Sub Main</CODE> is finished
with the CGI interface tasks, it calls the application via <CODE>Sub
CGI_Main</CODE>, which is in the separate VB module that contains the
code for the sample application. The application returns to <CODE>Sub
Main </CODE> when it is finished.

<P><CODE>CGI32.BAS</CODE> also contains a global exception handler that will
catch all VB runtime exceptions, including user-defined errors. If 
an exception occurs, the exception handler in <CODE>CGI32.BAS</CODE>
rewinds the output file and inserts a fully formatted HTTP <CODE>
500 Server Error</CODE> response. Within the body of this response,
the exception handler puts the textual VB runtime error message. The
server then (transparently) returns this HTTP error message to the
browser, allowing the user to see exactly what happened. 

<P>Finally, note that WebSite <i>fully decodes all form fields</I>
before starting the Windows CGI program.

It is meant to illustrate these important techniques:

<UL>
<LI>Using HTML forms as a front-end to a relational database
<LI>Basic relational data access, addition, removal and updating using
Visual Basic Professional 4.0 
<LI>Data normalization, and forming many-to-many relations by using a
linking table
<LI>Using Access "queries" to keep complex SQL statements in the database
as precompiled, stored procedures
<LI>Using Access' referential integrity features to simplify removal of
objects which are referred-to by other objects
<LI>Exception handling techniques that send useful error messages back
to the browser instead of letting the CGI program fail silently,
causing the famous "500 Server Error"
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="eyeball.gif"> <B>The code has almost no comments in
it</B>. This is <i>intentional</i>. It is meant to be used in conjunction
with the O'Reilly book that is shipped with every copy of WebSite.

<P>The links below lead to the VB sources, and the Access relations,
tables and queries. The Access description pages show information
pictorially and in SQL source where appropriate.

<P>There are two aspects to this application:

<UL>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="db-top.html">Access database</A>, 
which includes tables, global relations,
and queries (stored SQL procedures)
<LI>The 
<A HREF="vb-top.html">Visual Basic CGI application</A>, 
which does all the work
</UL>

</B>Debra M. Kamps<P>
<P>
<B>Abstract<P>
</B><P>
</CENTER>Conduct and behavior disorders represent the single largest group of children with emotional disturbance (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1990).  Prominent home and school risk factors serve as<B> <U>major barriers</B></U> to the prevention of SED including: ineffective parenting skills, negative parent- and/or teacher-child interaction styles, ineffective or inappropriate curricula/instruction, poor classroom management, and negative responses from peers including rejection or counter-aggression.  These barriers provide a basis for designing a model of prevention for effective, immediate action that targets, strengthens, and maintains improvement.  Based on lessons leamed from longitudinal community-based research (e.g., Carta, Sainato, &amp; Atwater, 1990; Greenwood, 1991; Kamps, Barbetta, Leonard, and Delquadri, 1994; Kamps &amp; Tankersley, 1993) and a conceptual model that supports a multi-leveled prevention program, the proposed project outlines<B> <U>proactive home-school prevention</B></U> which directly targets &quot;protective&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; factors to increase social, behavioral, and academic competencies.  <P>
<P>
<B><U>The school-based component</B></U> includes: a) social skills groups including instruction in prosocial behaviors, training in problem solving, incidental teaching, and reinforcement procedures for generalization of skill usage, and b) peer tutoring in reading and comprehension skills.  <P>
<P>
<B><U>The home-based component</B></U> includes: a) parent child activities and monitoring schedules for increasing positive parent-child interaction and supervision; and parent-led play/recreation groups for reinforcement of prosocial skills.  <P>
<P>
<B><U>A third level prevention component</B></U> provides systematic functional assessment and analysis of environments to determine conditions maintaining resistant behaviors with consequent intervention for behavioral improvement; as well as liaison work with community-based agencies to facilitate family services.  The investigation includes three elementary school sites in an intensive quality-controlled program for 36 to 45 children, with a control group.  Expected outcomes include increased, positive adult and peer interactions, improved compliance and behaviors, increased engagement and learning, and improved social competence.  The impact of this research will be knowledge of effective processes and outcomes of a systematic prevention program designed to build positive, nurturing, and safe environments for children.<p>

<CENTER><B>A Longitudinal Study of Generalization and Maintenance in Integration Settings</B><P>
<B>for  Students with Autism</B><P>
Debra M. Kamps<P>
<P>
<B>ABSTRACT<P>
</CENTER></B><P>
The trend towards partial and full inclusion models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been steadily progressing over the past five years (Brown, Long, Udvari-Solner, Davis, VanDeventer, Ahlgren, Johnson, Gruenewald, &amp; Jorgensen, 1991; Forest, 1987; Sailor, Anderson, Halversen, Doering, Filler, &amp; Goetz, 1989).  Important contributions have been highly specialized programming to meet individual needs of students, implementation of collaborative planning and teaching formats, and the use of technical assistance and support staff.  While the recognition and value of integrated, heterogeneous classroom environments is growing, implementation is still quite variable, with the majority of efforts and support staff time devoted towards students with &quot;Milder&quot; disabilities.  For children with more challenging disabilities such as autism or other behavioral disorders, integration efforts are nonexistent or conducted on a much more limited basis, with great hesitancy on the part of regular and special education staff.  Inclusion in regular classroom activities and programs occurs only with considerable outside agency support (e.g., ongoing university consultation), initiation of due process, or at great expense to families (e.g., moving to a district with school support for partial inclusion, hiring private tutors/consultants).<P>
<P>
In spite of these obstacles, many strides have been made that support a continued move towards integration of students with moderate and severe behavioral and cognitive differences.  This current project is designed to continue our previous investigations of procedures for mainstreaming and integration of children with autism (Kamps &amp; Carta, 1989).  With two years of research and a third underway, a data base in support of specific strategies to facilitate academic and social integration activities is available with additional studies and manuscripts in progress.  Findings provide support for continued research and technical assistance to current and new sites and a strong foundation for building a school-wide model of implementation.<P>
<P>
Project objectives include: a) the longitudinal ecobehavioral analysis of existing integration programs for students with autism including identification of successful components and/or weaknesses; b) building upon these findings to carefully plan generalization studies to increase integration time and success; c) replication studies for effective generalization strategies (i.e., teacher-, peer-, and student-mediated) with follow-up; and d) pilot studies in middle schools including environmental assessments, integration, and generalization studies.  These goals have been designed to extend current integration technology; to expand the knowledge base to include generalization procedures; to investigate self-monitoring and continue documentation of peer-involved activities in integrated environments; to provide middle school demonstrations; to monitor program effects in the areas of academic, social, and behavioral competence for students with autism and their peers; and to disseminate findings to improve the quality of life for all students.

The JGCP was founded in 1964 as a collaboration between community residents and faculty of the University's Bureau of Child Research and, it has received continuous funding through competitive research and training grants from NICHHD, USDE, and NIH among others.  It may be the longest-lived, community-based, applied research center in the country.  JGCP currently has 10 sponsored grant projects including: 1 multi-site Early Childhood Research Institute, 6 research projects, 1 foundation supported service project, and 2 personnel preparation special projects.  Consistent with its mission to improve practice through research, demonstration, and training, these projects reflect the range of research, service, and training that has characterized JGCP over the years.  <B>    <P><P><I>     <U>Setting</I></U>:</B>  The JGCP is a research, training and service center located in a poverty community in Northeast Kansas City, KS.   JGCP has always been located off-campus, leasing space within the Northeast community.  Over its history, the Project has been located in the basement of a housing project community center, several churches, in the basement of a liquor store, and since 1986, it has leased space from local physicians adjacent to their professional offices and pharmacy.  The staff of 24 in 1986, has grown to 65 in 1996.  <P><P>	The JGCP is one of Kansas University's primary outreach sites to the citizens of the area, and the work directly addresses concerns of the urban communities within the State.  JGCP is an integral component of the Kansas Mental Retardation Research Center and the Kansas UAP.   JGCP also is a graduate training site for two Academic Departments:  The Department of Special Education in the School of Education and the Department of Human Development and Family Life in the College of Liberal Arts.  Presently, the faculty at JGCP advise 15 graduate students seeking degrees in these departments and 6 post-doctoral fellows.<P><P></BODY></HTML><CENTER><HR></CENTER><CENTER>Please send any comments to WebMaster<A HREF=mailto:reddy@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu> Nallu Reddy</A></CENTER><CENTER><HR><CENTER>Access our Director's Home Page<A HREF=charles.htm> Charles R.

<CENTER><B>History</B><P><P></CENTER>       The JGCP is the product of programs originally conceived in the mid 1960's during the Kennedy administration and continued during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty.  Citizens of Northeast Kansas City, Kansas joined with faculty members from the University of Kansas, Departments of Special Education, Health Science, Human Development and Family Life, and the Bureau of Child Research in order to address child development concerns within a low-income community (Hall, Schiefelbusch, Hoyt, &amp; Greenwood, 1989).  <P><P><B>Families living in deprived urban areas perpetuate a vicious cycle of poor child rearing practices and inadequate school adjustment usually expressed in the form of academic failures and behavior problems that lead to early school dropouts, delinquent behavior, early pregnancies and/or unstable families.  These new families are very soon added to the already staggering number of individuals supported by welfare programs, resulting in further drain on the community and involving poor prognosis for self-improvement (Bureau of Child Research, Planning Document, July, 17, 1964).</B><P><CENTER><P></CENTER>       The intentions of all participants in these agreements were to develop effective, efficient procedures to improve the developmental experiences and the academic and social achievements of children in this community by working through the natural routines of these children and their families and friends. <B><I> </B></I>This led to the establishment of a research center located in the community with a mission to create intervention designs and procedures and to assess their effectiveness (Hall, Schiefelbusch, Hoyt, &amp; Greenwood, 1989).  In 1996, these shared intentions of the community and the University are still in operation [see Special Issue of the Journal Education and Treatment of Children, 1989, <U>12</U>(4) devoted to the Juniper Gardens Children's Project]. <P><P>	Today, as in the 1960's, poverty and disability remain barriers to life improvement for too many area citizens.  Together, the community and the University have designed programs to intervene and improve the caregiving and special education received by children in this community (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).  The initial founders, and those that have since followed, were successful in securing long-term federal funding for a number of research, training, and service grants, all based in the community and conducted with the active participation of community residents.   The disproportionate number of minorities affected by poverty and its association with unemployment, illiteracy, under-education, and poor health remains of great interest today, and new national and local initiatives to improve urban economies, environments, education, and health (as reflected in the Title XX Empowerment Zone effort of the Clinton Administration) may be practically undertaken at JGCP.  <P><P>	Among several recent honors afforded the Project was the invitation to describe the history, contribution, and work of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project within a special issue of the journal, <U>Education and Treatment of Children</U> [1989, Vol. 12(4)], a synthesis of research published in the <U>American Psychologist</U> [1992, <U>47</U>, 1464-1474], and a monograph for the American Association for Mental Retardation that is currently in preparation.   <P><P>	Since its beginning, the project has concentrated on problems that local citizens (parents, teachers, community leaders) have defined as major concerns.  The fact that the JGCP has persisted successfully in the community is testament to the fact that it has produced outcomes meaningful to the community.  The effort has also been at the forefront and the cross-roads of major developments in the conceptual frameworks, procedures, and practices used in the fields of applied behavior analysis and special education.  Many of the early founders and participants at JGCP were pioneering (Hall, Hart, Risley, Whelan, Wolf) in that they demonstrated designs and practices that made measurable differences in the lives of children, particularly when parents and teachers were the intervenors in home, school, clinic, and community settings.  These demonstrations once unique, today are common place and they are reflected in many aspects of contemporary special education policy and practice including, for example: the Individual Education Plan and Individual Family Service Plans, functional assessment of challenging behavior, environmental assessment, peer-mediated instruction, behavior management/ intervention, mainstreaming, integration, and transition, among others.  Specifically, JGCP research efforts have produced the following outcomes among many others:<P><UL><LI>Procedures for increasing the availability and use of pediatric services for low-income families.<LI>Strategies for improving the effectiveness of early intervention for young children with special needs.<LI>Techniques for effective child behavior management.<LI>Procedures for accelerating the development of communication skills and first and second language acquisition among young inner-city area children.<LI>Teaching techniques for improving literacy and appropriate social behavior.<LI>Strategies for improving the effectiveness of special education and for integrating children with disabilities into general education classrooms.<LI>Procedures for assessing child, parent, and teacher performance in school, home, and community settings.<LI>Strategies for overcoming discrimination and achieving independence.<LI>Strategies for inservice training of school personnel and parents in effective practices.<LI>Strategies for promoting city development and community self-sufficiency.<P><P></BODY></HTML><CENTER><HR></CENTER>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Scientific and Human Impact of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	University faculty and community residents forged a partnership beginning in 1964 that established a research center located in the community (See Project History in Section 1).  Because of its mission to improve the academic and social achievements of children in the community, the 30 year research program of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project <U>has focused substantially on research on practice (teaching, parenting, and caregiving)</U>.  Research was conducted designed to improve the teaching, care, and services received by youth with disabilities within an urban, culturally diverse community in Kansas City, KS.  <P>
<P>
	Over the years, the research has been supported by 50 large and small project grants from federal and state agencies, and private foundations.  JGCP researchers have had five 5-year program project grants from the National Institute of Health and Human Development and an Early Childhood Research Institute from the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities, U.S. Department of Education.  Other smaller projects have ranged from field initiated research, technology research, outreach, leadership personnel preparation, and  personnel preparation special projects.  <P>
<P>
	These projects, and this work collectively, have crossed a number of special education categories and disciplines including: mental retardation, early childhood, learning disabilities, children at risk due to poverty and other environmental hazards (i.e., prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol), cultural diversity (i.e., limited English proficiency, multicultural special education), behavior disorders, and autism/developmental disabilities.  The impact of this work, past and present, can be seen in the scientific and professional literature of special education, education, and psychology, in personnel preparation, and in the practices and policies of special education. In the section that follows, we describe the scientific impact of the JGCP within five major areas:  <P>

<UL><LI>(a) Concept and theory, 
<LI>(b) Research methodology and assessment, 
<LI>(c) Ecology and context in intervention and treatment, 
<LI>(d) Engagement as a target for change, and 
<LI>(e) Research training and service.
</UL>
<CENTER><B><U>A. Concept and Theory in Special Education</B></U><P>
<P>
</CENTER>	<B>We contributed to the development of the behavioral approach to special and general education.</B><P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  The founding of the field of applied behavior analysis and its application in the 1960's to special education at the Kansas University were inextricably linked at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project because it was the site of many pioneering applications (see the review by Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).  The JGCP remains today a major research site for urban children and families at risk because of poverty and disabilities.  The earlier founders of applied behavior analysis: Baer, Risley, Wolf, Hall, Hart conducted research in the homes and schools in the area and demonstrated the beneficial effects of<U> token economy classrooms</U> (Wolf); <U>positive reinforcement and incidental teaching</U> strategies in preschools (Risley, Hart), and teachers' use of <U>social consequences</U> at the elementary level classrooms (Hall), among many others (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  One of the first comprehensive applications of applied behavior analysis in special education was the Responsive Teaching Model of R. Vance Hall and its extensions to consulting-teacher change models soon thereafter in Vermont  (H. McKenzie) and elsewhere around the country.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: The early research with applied behavior analysis at Juniper Gardens increasingly demonstrated that school principals, teachers, home visitors, and parents, working in the natural context of the classroom and the home, could make change in child performance given that specific procedures were applied and followed in specific ways (Hall, Schiefelbusch, Hoyt, &amp; Greenwood, 1989).  Previous intervention knowledge had largely supported treatment models only provided by highly trained experts in clinical settings.  This work at JGCP suggested the basis in principle and illustrated the feasibility of many contemporary approaches to special education intervention and treatment.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: The early research focused on the behavior of individuals in natural settings.  Methods of individual assessment and single-subject research design sensitive to interventions and to change in performance over time were developed, validated (Hall et al., 1989), and expanded to meet the increasing needs for practical, effective methods of intervention and treatment (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We contributed to the expansion of the behavioral approach in terms of the analysis of the environment (ecology) as well as behavior</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Work soon suggested that student performance could be influenced not only by the nature and frequency of consequences, but also the nature and frequency of &quot;opportunities to respond&quot;, those provided by the teacher, the materials, and the instructional environment.  This led to research on the effects of increasing response opportunities (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984) and to the development of ecobehavioral taxonomies for the assessment of classroom environments in ways that linked momentary instructional events to student behavior in functional ways (Greenwood, &amp; Carta, 1987; Greenwood, Schulte, Kohler, Dinwiddie, &amp; Carta, 1986).  This work led importantly to the &quot;ecobehavioral analysis&quot; of instruction (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Arreaga-Mayer, 1990; Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  Ecobehavioral analysis is currently a field within the applied analysis of behavior (e.g., Morris &amp; Midgley, 1990).  Ecobehavioral methodology provides a means of predicting individual behavior within highly specific situations and contexts (e.g., functional analysis; Greenwood, Carta, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Rager, 1991), as well as validating fidelity of treatment (e.g., Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1989b).  <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were extended and validated in research on the effectiveness of early childhood special education programs (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1985; Carta, Greenwood, &amp; Robinson, 1987; Carta, Sainato, &amp; Greenwood, 1988).  <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were developed to support research on the effects of mainstreaming (Greenwood, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Carta, 1994; Kamps, Greenwood, &amp; Leonard, 1991) and later inclusion (Sideridis, 1994).<P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were extended and validated in research on the effectiveness of bilingual special education programs (Arreaga-Mayer, Carta, &amp; Tapia, 1994; Arreaga-Mayer &amp; Greenwood, 1986).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Ecobehavioral taxonomies were also developed and validated for use in the home in research on the effects of caregiving on the behavioral development of children prenatally exposed to drugs and alcohol (Atwater, Montagna, Creighton, Williams, &amp; Hou, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<B>We reduced the gap between research and practice in special education</B>.<P>
	<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  An important concept was and remains the study of performance in the context of the natural setting.  This focused development on procedures, designs, and strategies for changing environmental factors and practices in order to change behavior (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1982).  Thus, the body of work at Juniper Gardens is correctly characterized as &quot;research on practice&quot;, including methods of instruction, parenting, care, and service.  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We learned to focus research on problems of importance to teachers working in local schools.  As a result, a number of favorable outcomes followed including: data on teacher priorities and expectations, acceptable, effective practices, increased participation and implementation, methods of importance to other teachers confronting similar problems, and methods of research increasingly capable of addressing issues of research on practice (Hall et al., 1989).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research validated procedures were produced in forms designed for replication and implementation by others, as well as publication in research journals.  Many of the procedures became techniques, demonstrations, and models employed in the research and practices of others.  For example, the Incidental Teaching Concept validated at JGCP by Hart and Risley has been the basis for many child-centered procedures used in the teaching of language in preschool settings (e.g., Kaiser and her group at Vanderbilt, for example).  The ClassWide Peer Tutoring Model has been replicated, adapted, and expanded by Heward, Heron and their colleagues at The Ohio State University; Maheady, Harper the their colleagues at SUNY Fredonia, NY; and the Fuchs and their colleagues at Peabody, Vanderbilt University, among others.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Methods of ecobehavioral assessment were packaged and developed for use by school psychologists using laptop computers (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, Terry, &amp; Delquadri, 1994) and disseminated to 35 sites across the country and Puerto Rico, and to 25 school psychology training programs for use in their preservice training programs.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We investigated and tested methods for identifying the effective practices of teachers and promoted their use by others in school improvement plans (Greenwood, Carta, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Rager, 1991; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Bulgren, 1993)<P>
<P>
	<B>We engaged in major discussions of contemporary issues in special education</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A major issue in early childhood education and early childhood special education has been the usefulness of a framework supported by some in early childhood education as, &quot;developmentally appropriate practice&quot; to early childhood special education.  Our group has sought to identify compatible points within each perspective as well as concerns unique to early childhood special education (Atwater, Carta, Schwartz, &amp; McConnell, 1993; Carta, Atwater, Schwartz, &amp; McConnell, 1993; Carta, Schwartz, Atwater &amp; McConnell, 1991). <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  We have participated in a discussion of the myths and realities of the effects of prenatal substance exposure on children and on special education for the past 7 years (Carta, 1993; Carta, Rinkel, &amp; Murphy, 1992).  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have participated in the discussions of mainstreaming and inclusion (Carta, 1993; 1994; Dugan et al., 1985; Greenwood, 1985; Greenwood, in press; Utley, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have participated in discussions of prevention, community service, education for youth with serious emotional disturbance (Kamps &amp; Nelson, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have engaged in discussions of the merits/limitations of alternative paradigms for rapidly improving the academic outcomes of children, such as behavioral, cognitive, and social-constructivist paradigms (Greenwood, in press)<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We contributed to the discussion of the construct of time and engagement in the forum provided by the National Commission on Time and Learning (Greenwood, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We have contributed to the discussion of the importance and relevance of multicultural/cross-cultural issues in special education (Utley, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We integrated recent advances in technology-based assessment within a special issue of Exceptional Children [1994, <U>61</U>(2)] and provided a synthesis of current developments.<P>
	<P>
<CENTER><B><U>B. Advances in Research Methodology and Assessment</B></U><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We have developed single-subject designs that show change over time as a result of intervention</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Several research designs have emerged at Juniper Gardens that are now part<P>
of the standard collection of single-subject research designs (Baer, Wolf, &amp; Risley, 1968).  For example, the changing criterion design (Hartmann &amp; Hall, 1976) is one such design widely used today, and it is described in all basic texts on single-subject design (e.g., Hersen &amp; Barlow, 1977).  This design has made extensive contributions to research concerning the education and treatment of persons with retardation (e.g., Rusch, Rose, &amp; Greenwood, 1988).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have developed naturalistic observational assessment instruments that support molar- and molecular-level analyses of natural patterns of interaction</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research on environment-behavior interaction has been supported by observational instruments that have assessed ecological as well as behavioral events in close temporal relationship (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Arreaga-Mayer, 1990).  This development has provided a molecular-level analysis of individual behavior where previously only a molar-level analysis was possible.  This advance has provided an important impetus and empirical support base for the investigation of environment-behavior transaction, and ecobehavioral analysis in particular (Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  The ecobehavioral instruments developed at the JGCP are in use by other investigators around the country (e.g. CISSAR: Cooper &amp; Speece, 1990, ESCAPE; Odom, Peterson, McConnell, &amp; Ostrosky, 1990).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example:</U>  We have increased the number and type of ecobehavioral strategies to other settings, populations, and problem conditions.  Work has been completed in the area of bilingual education and analysis of bilingual special education resulting in an ecobehavioral instrument with language features (e.g., ESCRIBE: Arreaga-Mayer, Carta, &amp; Tapia, 1994).  Work has also been completed incorporating digital audio-recording on notebook computers with ecobehavioral instrument taxonomies in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of environment, behavioral, and language sample recording (Walker, Hart, Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Hou, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have developed computer-based management and analytical strategies for handling large, complex data bases containing multi-measure, multi-content data</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Two longitudinal data bases have been created that contain observational and developmental outcome data that span a twelve-year period and represent thousands of units of information (e.g., Hart &amp; Risley, 1989; 1995; Kamps, Carta et al., 1989).  Software systems were developed beginning in 1982 to manage the accumulation of these data, enable access to it, and use of various analytical strategies.  One such strategy is the ecobehavioral process-product design (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1987; Greenwood, Delquadri, Stanley, Terry, &amp; Hall, 1985) which combines sequential analyses of molecular-level interaction with molar-level measures of engagement and change in developmental outcome (Greenwood, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Carta, 1994; Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  These strategies have been employed by Cooper and Speece at the University of Maryland, McConnell and Ysseldyke at the University of Minnesota, Kaiser and Odom at Vanderbilt University, and Goldstein at the University of Pittsburgh.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example:</U> A longitudinal data base has been developed by the Early Childhood Research Institute on Substance Abuse at Juniper Gardens that includes 270 children in three age cohorts (Birth, 18 mos., and 36 mos.) most of whom were prenatally exposed to alcohol or illicit drugs.  Ecobehavioral observation data collected in the homes and schools for these children have been compiled in data bases also containing demographic, developmental, play, and social indices (Carta, McConnell, McEvoy, &amp; Rokusek, 1992).  This ongoing project is examining the impact of prenatal exposure as one of multiple risk factors affecting the performance and developmental progress of these children (Carta, Sideridis, et al., 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A longitudinal study of the generalization and maintenance of the behavior of students with autism has incorporated validated ecobehavioral assessment in monitoring educational programs (Kamps, Greenwood, &amp; Leonard, 1991).  The current sample includes 40 children with autism served in integrated settings in a 5-year longitudinal study (Kamps, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have conducted, and have in progress, comprehensive, longitudinal studies of development now covering more than 12 years of life span across multiple settings (e.g., home, school)</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Results from a longitudinal, controlled field trial after ten years have revealed that at-risk elementary students who systematically increased their engagement through their teachers' use of Classwide Peer Tutoring, also significantly increased their performance on standardized tests of reading, arithmetic, spelling, and language compared to (a) control group students and to (b) a non-risk comparison group (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Greenwood, 1991a; 1991b).  By middle school, the group of students whose teachers had used Classwide Peer Tutoring had significantly fewer members who had received Special Education Placements and for those who were placed, their services were less restrictive (Greenwood &amp; Delquadri, 1995; Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, &amp; Walker, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Another ten-year line of research has been the longitudinal description of the development of language and social interaction in the home (Hart &amp; Risley, 1989; 1995) and subsequently in the elementary school (Walker, Carta, &amp; Hart, 1990).  In addition to revealing environmental processes of language development (e.g., Hart 1991), the predictive validity of the rate of spoken language at 36 months of age assessed in the home has been established in terms of standardized measures of IQ and vocabulary at kindergarten, first, second, and third grades (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, &amp; Carta, 1994).  <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>C.  Ecology and Context in Intervention and Treatment</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We used <U>Zone-Management</U> to make activities and interaction continuously available in the preschool</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: An early study that employed an intervention in the ecology of the preschool (LeLaurin &amp; Risley, 1972) demonstrated that through <U>zone management,</U> engagement and other aspects of personal behavior could be effectively changed and facilitated through specific arrangements of stimuli within the caregiving environment.  Environmental organization today, using zone and other techniques, is a widely used general strategy for preventing many serious problem behaviors and for facilitating engagement in the design of preschool, public school, and health care programs (e.g., Nordquist &amp; Twardosz, 1990).<P>
<P>
	<B>We used a <U>Survival Skill Intervention Package</U> to improve preschool students' transitions from one activity to another, participation in groups, and independent work in the preschool</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  In-classroom transitions can take an inordinate amount of time for young students with and without developmental disabilities.  A recent study of early intervention classrooms has shown that arrangements of schedules, staff, the room, tasks, and consequences can have a powerful impact on student performance (Carta, Atwater, Schwartz, &amp; Miller, 1990; Connell, Carta, &amp; Baer, 1993; Sainato, 1990).  One specific finding indicated that reducing transition time increased student engagement, which over several years, has been shown to be a protective factor with respect to placement into special education programs at kindergarten and first grade.<P>
<P>
	<B>We provided redesigned instructional environments in order to better support and maintain prosocial behaviors of children with disabilities.</B><P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>: Young children with behavioral risks need early intervention to increase positive interactions with parents, peers, and teachers in order to prevent serious emotional disturbance.  We provided training and programming to reduce serious aggression and other antisocial behaviors for over 700 Head Start, Kindergarten, and first grade children in their classrooms (Kamps, Ellis, Wyble, Mancina, &amp; Bednar, 1994; Kamps, Ellis, Mancina, &amp; Greene, in press).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We developed and tested inservice teacher training procedures and materials supporting minority issues and multicultural content in special education (Preston, Greenwood, et al., 1984; Utley, Delquadri, Tapia, &amp; Blesz, 1994).<P>
	<P>
	<B>In the context of inclusion, we demonstrated the importance of also incorporating individualized services and interventions to ensure student progress</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We demonstrated the benefits of <U>social skills groups</U> (Kamps, Leonard, Vernon, Dugan et al., 1992); <U>cooperative learning/tutoring </U>(Dugan, Kamps, Leonard et al., 1995; Kamps, Barbetta, Leonard, &amp; Delquadri, 1994; Kamps, Leonard, et al., in press); and <U>peer networks</U> (Garrison-Harrell, Kamps et al., 1994; Potucek, Gonzalez-Lopez, Kemmerer, Kravitz, &amp; Kamps, 1995) in improving the active the social engagement for students with autism included in the general education classroom. <P>
<P>
	<B>We used <U>Classwide Peer Tutoring</U> in order to increase the opportunities students have to make active responses to the curricula</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Rearranging reading, spelling and math instruction so that students tutor each other, rather than all listening to the teacher lecture, doubles the opportunities students have to respond to the material (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Greenwood, 1991a; Maheady &amp; Harper, 1987).  This work has been published in the <U>Journal of Educational Psychology</U>, <U>Exceptional Children</U>, <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Journal of Behavioral Education</U>, among others.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We are adapting CWPT to better support the academic and language learning of limited English speaking students (Arreaga-Mayer, 1995).<P>
<P>
	<B>We contributed to the understanding of quality/fidelity of treatment and how these variations in treatment moderate student outcomes</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  The use of checklists of intervention components as a means of assessing treatment fidelity have been helpful in documenting the effects of training and of monitoring implementation quality over time (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1989).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Studies were completed examining the functional effects of improving the quality of implementation of CWPT on student outcome, demonstrating that low quality implementation quality is a risk factor for lower outcome (Greenwood, Terry, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Finney, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<U>Examples</U>:  Studies of CWPT students who failed to make expected levels of progress were important to understanding the effects of program implementation and of improving the program over time (Greenwood, Dinwiddie et al., 1987; Greenwood, Finney et al., 1994).<P>
<P>
	<B>We rearranged the home environment in order to increase parent's teaching and to promote safety and prevent injury</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We developed methods of parent tutoring that were effective and could be maintained over time (Duvall, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1992; Walker &amp; Greenwood, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Both active (e.g., infant car seats) and passive injury prevention strategies (single occasion setting of home hot water heater thermostat at correct temperatures) have been investigated (Christophersen, 1989).  This work was first published in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U> and subsequently in <U>Pediatrics</U>,  <U>American Psychologist</U>, <U>American Journal of Diseases of Children</U>, and <U>Pediatric Clinics of North America</U>.  Observational procedures were also developed to assess dangerous behaviors in the home and methods used to decrease them  (e.g., Mathews, Friman, Barone, Ross, &amp; Christophersen, 1987).<P>
<P>
	<B>We arranged the pediatric clinic to promote improved compliance with medical regimens</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Patients were provided written instructions for the use of specific medication regimens and a system for reminding them about their appointments.  These procedures have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of studies and replications (e.g., Finney, Friman, Rappoff, &amp; Christophersen, 1985).  <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>D. Engagement as Target for Change</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We demonstrated the fundamental relationships between students' behavioral performance (engagement) and growth in developmental, academic, and social outcomes over time.</B><P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  An index of academic responding defined as engagement in writing, reading, and talk in the context of academic tasks and situations was shown to be a positive correlate of academic achievement (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984) and when increased via direct intervention based on ClassWide Peer Tutoring, it was shown to covary with significant growth in academic achievement (Greenwood, 1991; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989).  This form of academic engagement was also shown to mediate between instruction and achievement when compared to alternative models not mediated this way (Greenwood, Terry, Marquis, &amp; Walker, 1994).<P>
	<P>
<U>	<B></U>We demonstrated that students' <U>engagement in academic responding</U> can be increased by manipulating the quality and quantity of response opportunities during instruction</B><P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A tutor gives a tutee opportunities to respond that would not otherwise be available in most teacher-mediated instruction (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Maheady &amp; Harper, 1987).  In this work, the increased engagement in writing, reading aloud, and academic talk that resulted was functionally related to increases in measures of academic achievement and shown to be a protective factor with respect to special education placement in later grades (Greenwood, 1991b; Greenwood, Terry, et al., 1994).<P>
	<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Research has been completed on adaptations of ClassWide Peer Tutoring needed for use by students with mild retardation in both self-contained and integrated instructional settings (Mortweet, Perdomo-Rivera, Utley, Delquadri, &amp; Greenwood, 1994). <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We demonstrated that small group instruction including choral responding and student-to-student interaction improved the engaged behaviors of students with autism in public school classrooms (Kamps, Dugan, &amp; Leonard, 1994; Kamps, Leonard, Dugan, Boland, &amp; Greenwood, 1991; Kamps, Walker, McGrale, &amp; Rotholz, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that the productive language of preschoolers' could be increased if the teacher handled students' initiation requests by requiring (a) elaboration followed by (b) reinforcing consequences</B>. <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research with incidental teaching produced a major advance in our theoretical understanding of natural reinforcement processes (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995).  Results indicated that increases in elaboration were related to increases in the rate of language use.  As a technique, incidental teaching is used nationally and it is a basis of several related forms of language intervention and of preschool teaching methodology (e.g., milieu language teaching; Hemmeter &amp; Kaiser, 1990).  Reports of this work have appeared in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Education and Urban Society</U> among others.<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that parents could effectively engage their children in reading, writing, and spelling at home with measurable academic improvements at school</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Several studies investigated procedures that parents could use to work effectively with their children at home on subjects taught at school.  Parent tutoring was found to be highly effective with direct impact on achievement in school (Duvall, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1992; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Thurston &amp; Dasta, 1990).  Engagement at home was functionally related to gains in academic achievement at school.  This work has been published in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Remedial and Special Education</U>.<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that appropriate recreational behaviors could be established within an impoverished environment</B>.  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Recreational opportunities were created within the Housing Project community center focused on sports and games.  Students were taught specific games and procedures used to maintain their engagement for major portions of the day (e.g., Pierce &amp; Risley, 1974).  Engagement in recreational behaviors was functionally related to reductions in problem behaviors in the community center and in the neighborhood. <P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that the physical appearance of the inner-city neighborhood could be improved through engagement in physical care and maintenance activities</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A lawn care program was designed by community residents and Project investigators that involved random observational assessments in the community combined with group incentives for lawn production/maintenance (e.g., Christophersen, Doke, &amp; Risley, 1974).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  An anti-littering program was designed by community residents and Project investigators that involved random observational assessments in the community combined with group incentives for litter reduction (e.g., Chapman &amp; Risley, 1970).<P>
 <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>E. Impact on Research Training, Community Residents, and Service</B><P>
<B><P>
</CENTER>	We have supported and supervised master's and Ph.D. students research.<P>
<P>
	</B><U>Example</U>: 199 graduate students have received advanced degrees (99 doctoral, 100 master's, see Tables 1, and 2), and 1,502 regular and special education teachers have conducted research and/or completed aspects of their professional training at the Project (See Table 4 ).  30 graduate students are currently in training at the Project.<P>

<TD><B><I>Hello! Welcome to the AAR newsletter. Below you can read about
a technique for increasing AAR in your lessons and interpreting MS-CISSAR
observation data on students' academic responding. Read on, there is a
truck load of useful information!</I></B> 
<CENTER><P><B>Focus on Technique: </B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><U>Using Response Cards to Increase Student Participation</U></B></P></CENTER>

<P> A consistent finding of recent educational research is that student
academic achievement is related to opportunities to respond in the classroom.
Academic responses include; writing, reading aloud, or talking about academic
material. </P>

<P>One strategy for increasing the frequency of student responses, and
in turn improving academic achievement, is the use of response cards. </P>

<P>Response cards are cards or signs that are held up simultaneously by
all students to display their response to a question or problem presented
by the teacher. Not only do response cards allow every student to respond
to each question, but students who do not know the correct answer may learn
by watching how others respond. </P>

<P>Response cards allow for easy detection of correct responses of individual
students without relying on volunteers, which allows for only one student
to make a response to each question. </P>

<P>The use of response cards has also been tied to increased levels of
on-task behavior. Response cards can be used and adapted for a wide range
of curricular areas (i.e. social studies &amp; science lesson reviews and
vocabulary, math computation &amp; problem solving, spelling activities
&amp; phonological awareness activities).</P>

<P>There are two basic types of response cards.</P>

<P> 1. PREPRINTED CARDS: These response cards are prepared ahead of time
by the teacher. They might be yes/no, letters, numerals, colors, etc. The
students choose the card they wish to display from a personal set of cards.
These cards may be easier for the teacher to see, but they do limit responses
to recognition tasks and may not be appropriate for lessons with a large
number of different answers.</P>

<P> 2. WRITE-ON CARDS: These response cards are blank and students mark
or write their answers to each item directly on the cards or boards. The
cards are erased for the next question. Write-on cards allow for multiple
correct answers and more demanding recall responses. The cards may take
the form of individual chalk boards, individual white laminated board**,
or even laminated poster or tag board</P>

<P>. <B>Helpful Hints &amp; Suggestions</B></P>

<OL>
<LI> Model &amp; practice using response cards</LI>

<LI> Maintain a lively pace of presentation</LI>

<LI> Establish clear signals as to when students are to hold up or put
down their cards</LI>

<LI> Provide feedback based on majority responses</LI>

<LI> If many errors are presented, ask the question again later in the
sequence</LI>

<LI> Students learn from watching others, it is not &quot;cheating&quot;
to look at a peer's card</LI>

<LI> If doodling is a problem, allow a few moments at the end of the lesson
for drawing on the boards</LI>
</OL>

<P>** White laminated &quot;bathroom&quot; paneling can be found at builder
supply stores and can be cut into 9X12&quot; pieces. Dry erase pens can
then be used and chalk dust eliminated.</P>

<P> This bar graph reflects what might be considered <U>local norms</U>
based on 33 observations. In this case, the average percentage occurrences
were in order 45%, 40%, and 16% for academic responding, task management,
and inappropriate behavior. While these data may be normative, they do
not mean that they can't or shouldn't be improved. Improving academic responding
will lead to increased achievement.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>How to Interpret and Use EBASS Observation Report Data</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> <B>Student Behavior Patterns and Their Meaning</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> </P></CENTER>

<P>Educational research supports the finding that students who engage in
high percentages of academic responding, relatively lower task management,
and very much lower inappropriate behavior during instruction learn more
and they learn faster. In bar graph terms, this pattern is evident when
the academic response bar is taller than task management, and both of these
are taller than inappropriate behavior. <U>This pattern suggests a student
actively engaged in learning the subject matter and it is a legitimate
goal for your methods of instruction.</U></P>

<P> Alternative patterns, like this one, indicate low levels of academic
responding and of inappropriate behavior with a predominately high level
of task management. <U>This pattern suggests a well behaved student who
is only passively engaged in learning the subject matter.</U></P>

<P>Any pattern associated with <U>an inappropriate behavior level higher
than about 15% suggests a student with a classroom conduct problem and
low academic responding</U>. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>Reflection</B></P></CENTER>

<P>When you receive your own EBASS report of student behavior, compare
these patterns to those of your students, and reflect on what they suggest:</P>

<P> How does each student compare to the desired pattern described?</P>

<P> Do patterns vary with student ability or disability?</P>

<P> How many students compare favorably to the desired pattern?</P>

<P> In what primary activity did the observation occur, and what are the
methods you're using to promote engagement in academic responding?</P>

<P> What are the specific behaviors (writing, reading aloud, etc.) for
each student?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Implications </B></P></CENTER>

<P>The EBASS data you receive represents the range of performance during
instruction of your students. How can you act on these data to improve
the performance of individual students as well as class wide?</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Consider that all children can learn and that they learn best when taught
by reflective and responsive educators. All individuals, children and adults,
learn by doing; this is enhanced through increased opportunities to learn.
Consequently, reflective educators carefully assess their instruction via
reflections on pupil performance. Responsive educators <B><U>act</U></B>
on information gleaned from their professional reflections; they make informed
decisions and adjust instruction to enhance pupil progress (statement adapted
from the RARE Program, 1995).</P>

<P> In your classroom:</P>

<P>1. Are all students spending most of their time engaged in active academic
responses (i.e. writing, reading, talking about academics, asking, and
answering questions or as otherwise identified in their IEP)?</P>

<P>2. Is time used efficiently with a minimum amount lost in transition
between activities?</P>

<P>3. Are students' error rates known and kept to a minimum?</P>

<P>4. Do students spend most of their time engaged in successful, accurate
responses on tasks that are related to those on which they will actually
be tested?</P>

<P>5. Are students frequently monitored to determine if they are engaged
and performing correctly?</P>

<P>6. Are lessons structured and students taught to know what they are
to do when and why? </P>

<P>7. Are students frequently asked questions that test their knowledge
and comprehension?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Actions You Can Take</B></P></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI> Given these data, identify specific steps you can take to promote
the desired pattern of academic, task management, and inappropriate behaviors
and implement them. Evaluate their success based on your own observations
and share those that work with others. </LI>

<LI>Share these results with your team or pod members, generate a discussion
and a plan.</LI>

<LI> Look into methods you can easily use to increase academic response
opportunities.</LI>

<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND=cloth1a.jpg>

<CENTER><B>CEC Research Award</B><P>
<B>Juniper Gardens Children's Project,</B><P>
<B>Recipient</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
This year the Juniper Gardens Children's Project (JGCP) celebrates 30 years of successful activity improving the quality of services for students with disabilities. Juniper Gardens, a community-based program in an impoverished neighborhood, is devoted to improving the developmental outcomes of all children in the context of their homes and schools.<P>
<P>
The JGCP, a partnership originally forged in 1964 between Kansas University faculty and community residents, serves as one of the university's primary outreach sites to citizens in the area. It is an integral part of the Kansas Mental Retardation Research Center and the Kansas University Affiliated Program. The JGCP is also a training site for graduate students in two academic departments: the Department of Special Education and the Department of Human Development and Family Life. Together, the community and the university have designed intervention programs to improve the care provided to and special education received by children in the community and have documented their work so as to serve as a model for other settings.<P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, Juniper Gardens has benefited more than 42,500 people in the local community through direct or indirect participation in research and training. This figure includes more than 8,600 children served directly. Nearly 27,000 have been served indirectly as part of a classroom whose teacher was trained, a family whose parents were trained, or a clinic whose staff was trained. Plus, Juniper Gardens has taught parenting skills to more than 6,800 parents.<P>
<P>
Juniper Gardens has also had significant impact through its publications and presentations. Since 1978, staff have produced 645 publications, including books, book chapters, and 371 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Presentations given at local, national and international meetings in the last nine years total 243.<P>
<P>
In the words of one colleague, Juniper Gardens is an &quot;exemplary member of the special education research community. Its history is strong and robust, and its current efforts continue to lead the field. JGCP is the single best example we have of the mission and promise of special education research.&quot;<P>
<P>
Accepting the award on behalf of Juniper Gardens is Charles R. Greenwood.<P>
<P>
<B>The CEC Research Award </B>was established in 1989 to recognize individuals, groups of individuals, or institutions and agencies whose research has contributed to the body of knowledge about the education of exceptional children and youth, leading to the improvement of their education. The award was designed to reinforce the Council's commitment to research as an integral focus of exceptional education, acknowledge an influential body of research, encourage researchers to direct attention to raising the quality of research, and encourage application of research findings in instructional settings.<P>

</CENTER><P>
The Council for Exceptional Children recognizes the outstanding contributions of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project (JGCP) to improving the education, growth, and development of children with exceptionalities. Its rigorous research has significantly contributed to the body of knowledge and best practices regarding their development.<P>
<P>
For 30 years, the Juniper Gardens Children's Project has dedicated itself to improving the teaching, care, and services received by children and youth with and without disabilities within an urban, culturally diverse community in Kansas City, Kansas. Juniper Gardens is a research, training, and service center located in an impoverished community in Northeast Kansas City. Since its inception, the project has focused on problems that local citizens, including parents, teachers, and community leaders, have deemed major concerns. Among these concerns have been many challenges posed within special education including those related to early childhood, cultural diversity, behavioral disorders, learning disabilities, mental retardation, children at risk due to poverty and other environmental hazards, and developmental disabilities.<P>
<P>
Researchers at Juniper Gardens, under the exemplary leadership of R. Vance Hall initially and currently Charles R. Greenwood, have produced numerous outcomes of tremendous benefit to children with special needs, their teachers, their parents, and others who provide for their care. In the words of one colleague, &quot;the JGCP has made an unparalleled contribution to the education of children with special learning needs over the past 25 years &quot; JGCP's contributions include strategies for improving the effectiveness of early intervention; techniques for effective child behavior management; procedures for accelerating the development of communication skills and language acquisition among young inner-city children; strategies for improving the effectiveness of special education and for integrating children with disabilities into general education classrooms; procedures for assessing child, parent, and teacher performance in school, home, and community settings; and strategies for in-service training of school personnel and parents in effective practices.<P>
<P>
Also of great importance to the field of special education is the graduate and postdoctoral training that Juniper Gardens provides. Some of the &quot;best and brightest workers in special education&quot; are trained at Juniper Gardens.<P>
<P>
&quot;The JGCP has been a seminal force in producing best practices, tools, and critical knowledge for educating students with at-risk and disabling conditions in our field. It has been an inspiring beacon of competence, dedication, and the highest quality of research during its existence,&quot; proclaimed a colleague.<P>
<P>
The Council for Exceptional Children recognizes the many contributions of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project to improving the teaching, care, and services received by children with exceptionalities by presenting it with the 1996 Research Award.<P>

<HTML><TITLE>Scientific and Human Impact of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project</TITLE>
<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND=cloth1a.jpg>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Scientific and Human Impact of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	University faculty and community residents forged a partnership beginning in 1964 that established a research center located in the community (See Project History in Section 1).  Because of its mission to improve the academic and social achievements of children in the community, the 30 year research program of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project <U>has focused substantially on research on practice (teaching, parenting, and caregiving)</U>.  Research was conducted designed to improve the teaching, care, and services received by youth with disabilities within an urban, culturally diverse community in Kansas City, KS.  <P>
<P>
	Over the years, the research has been supported by 50 large and small project grants from federal and state agencies, and private foundations.  JGCP researchers have had five 5-year program project grants from the National Institute of Health and Human Development and an Early Childhood Research Institute from the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities, U.S. Department of Education.  Other smaller projects have ranged from field initiated research, technology research, outreach, leadership personnel preparation, and  personnel preparation special projects.  <P>
<P>
	These projects, and this work collectively, have crossed a number of special education categories and disciplines including: mental retardation, early childhood, learning disabilities, children at risk due to poverty and other environmental hazards (i.e., prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol), cultural diversity (i.e., limited English proficiency, multicultural special education), behavior disorders, and autism/developmental disabilities.  The impact of this work, past and present, can be seen in the scientific and professional literature of special education, education, and psychology, in personnel preparation, and in the practices and policies of special education. In the section that follows, we describe the scientific impact of the JGCP within five major areas:  <P>

<UL><LI>(a) Concept and theory, 
<LI>(b) Research methodology and assessment, 
<LI>(c) Ecology and context in intervention and treatment, 
<LI>(d) Engagement as a target for change, and 
<LI>(e) Research training and service.
</UL>
<CENTER><B><U>A. Concept and Theory in Special Education</B></U><P>
<P>
</CENTER>	<B>We contributed to the development of the behavioral approach to special and general education.</B><P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  The founding of the field of applied behavior analysis and its application in the 1960's to special education at the Kansas University were inextricably linked at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project because it was the site of many pioneering applications (see the review by Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).  The JGCP remains today a major research site for urban children and families at risk because of poverty and disabilities.  The earlier founders of applied behavior analysis: Baer, Risley, Wolf, Hall, Hart conducted research in the homes and schools in the area and demonstrated the beneficial effects of<U> token economy classrooms</U> (Wolf); <U>positive reinforcement and incidental teaching</U> strategies in preschools (Risley, Hart), and teachers' use of <U>social consequences</U> at the elementary level classrooms (Hall), among many others (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  One of the first comprehensive applications of applied behavior analysis in special education was the Responsive Teaching Model of R. Vance Hall and its extensions to consulting-teacher change models soon thereafter in Vermont  (H. McKenzie) and elsewhere around the country.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: The early research with applied behavior analysis at Juniper Gardens increasingly demonstrated that school principals, teachers, home visitors, and parents, working in the natural context of the classroom and the home, could make change in child performance given that specific procedures were applied and followed in specific ways (Hall, Schiefelbusch, Hoyt, &amp; Greenwood, 1989).  Previous intervention knowledge had largely supported treatment models only provided by highly trained experts in clinical settings.  This work at JGCP suggested the basis in principle and illustrated the feasibility of many contemporary approaches to special education intervention and treatment.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: The early research focused on the behavior of individuals in natural settings.  Methods of individual assessment and single-subject research design sensitive to interventions and to change in performance over time were developed, validated (Hall et al., 1989), and expanded to meet the increasing needs for practical, effective methods of intervention and treatment (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We contributed to the expansion of the behavioral approach in terms of the analysis of the environment (ecology) as well as behavior</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Work soon suggested that student performance could be influenced not only by the nature and frequency of consequences, but also the nature and frequency of &quot;opportunities to respond&quot;, those provided by the teacher, the materials, and the instructional environment.  This led to research on the effects of increasing response opportunities (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984) and to the development of ecobehavioral taxonomies for the assessment of classroom environments in ways that linked momentary instructional events to student behavior in functional ways (Greenwood, &amp; Carta, 1987; Greenwood, Schulte, Kohler, Dinwiddie, &amp; Carta, 1986).  This work led importantly to the &quot;ecobehavioral analysis&quot; of instruction (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Arreaga-Mayer, 1990; Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  Ecobehavioral analysis is currently a field within the applied analysis of behavior (e.g., Morris &amp; Midgley, 1990).  Ecobehavioral methodology provides a means of predicting individual behavior within highly specific situations and contexts (e.g., functional analysis; Greenwood, Carta, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Rager, 1991), as well as validating fidelity of treatment (e.g., Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1989b).  <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were extended and validated in research on the effectiveness of early childhood special education programs (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1985; Carta, Greenwood, &amp; Robinson, 1987; Carta, Sainato, &amp; Greenwood, 1988).  <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were developed to support research on the effects of mainstreaming (Greenwood, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Carta, 1994; Kamps, Greenwood, &amp; Leonard, 1991) and later inclusion (Sideridis, 1994).<P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Ecobehavioral taxonomies were extended and validated in research on the effectiveness of bilingual special education programs (Arreaga-Mayer, Carta, &amp; Tapia, 1994; Arreaga-Mayer &amp; Greenwood, 1986).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Ecobehavioral taxonomies were also developed and validated for use in the home in research on the effects of caregiving on the behavioral development of children prenatally exposed to drugs and alcohol (Atwater, Montagna, Creighton, Williams, &amp; Hou, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<B>We reduced the gap between research and practice in special education</B>.<P>
	<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  An important concept was and remains the study of performance in the context of the natural setting.  This focused development on procedures, designs, and strategies for changing environmental factors and practices in order to change behavior (Greenwood, Carta, et al., 1982).  Thus, the body of work at Juniper Gardens is correctly characterized as &quot;research on practice&quot;, including methods of instruction, parenting, care, and service.  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We learned to focus research on problems of importance to teachers working in local schools.  As a result, a number of favorable outcomes followed including: data on teacher priorities and expectations, acceptable, effective practices, increased participation and implementation, methods of importance to other teachers confronting similar problems, and methods of research increasingly capable of addressing issues of research on practice (Hall et al., 1989).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research validated procedures were produced in forms designed for replication and implementation by others, as well as publication in research journals.  Many of the procedures became techniques, demonstrations, and models employed in the research and practices of others.  For example, the Incidental Teaching Concept validated at JGCP by Hart and Risley has been the basis for many child-centered procedures used in the teaching of language in preschool settings (e.g., Kaiser and her group at Vanderbilt, for example).  The ClassWide Peer Tutoring Model has been replicated, adapted, and expanded by Heward, Heron and their colleagues at The Ohio State University; Maheady, Harper the their colleagues at SUNY Fredonia, NY; and the Fuchs and their colleagues at Peabody, Vanderbilt University, among others.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Methods of ecobehavioral assessment were packaged and developed for use by school psychologists using laptop computers (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, Terry, &amp; Delquadri, 1994) and disseminated to 35 sites across the country and Puerto Rico, and to 25 school psychology training programs for use in their preservice training programs.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We investigated and tested methods for identifying the effective practices of teachers and promoted their use by others in school improvement plans (Greenwood, Carta, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Rager, 1991; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Bulgren, 1993)<P>
<P>
	<B>We engaged in major discussions of contemporary issues in special education</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A major issue in early childhood education and early childhood special education has been the usefulness of a framework supported by some in early childhood education as, &quot;developmentally appropriate practice&quot; to early childhood special education.  Our group has sought to identify compatible points within each perspective as well as concerns unique to early childhood special education (Atwater, Carta, Schwartz, &amp; McConnell, 1993; Carta, Atwater, Schwartz, &amp; McConnell, 1993; Carta, Schwartz, Atwater &amp; McConnell, 1991). <P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  We have participated in a discussion of the myths and realities of the effects of prenatal substance exposure on children and on special education for the past 7 years (Carta, 1993; Carta, Rinkel, &amp; Murphy, 1992).  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have participated in the discussions of mainstreaming and inclusion (Carta, 1993; 1994; Dugan et al., 1985; Greenwood, 1985; Greenwood, in press; Utley, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have participated in discussions of prevention, community service, education for youth with serious emotional disturbance (Kamps &amp; Nelson, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We have engaged in discussions of the merits/limitations of alternative paradigms for rapidly improving the academic outcomes of children, such as behavioral, cognitive, and social-constructivist paradigms (Greenwood, in press)<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We contributed to the discussion of the construct of time and engagement in the forum provided by the National Commission on Time and Learning (Greenwood, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We have contributed to the discussion of the importance and relevance of multicultural/cross-cultural issues in special education (Utley, 1993).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We integrated recent advances in technology-based assessment within a special issue of Exceptional Children [1994, <U>61</U>(2)] and provided a synthesis of current developments.<P>

<CENTER><B><U>B. Advances in Research Methodology and Assessment</B></U><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We have developed single-subject designs that show change over time as a result of intervention</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Several research designs have emerged at Juniper Gardens that are now part<P>
of the standard collection of single-subject research designs (Baer, Wolf, &amp; Risley, 1968).  For example, the changing criterion design (Hartmann &amp; Hall, 1976) is one such design widely used today, and it is described in all basic texts on single-subject design (e.g., Hersen &amp; Barlow, 1977).  This design has made extensive contributions to research concerning the education and treatment of persons with retardation (e.g., Rusch, Rose, &amp; Greenwood, 1988).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have developed naturalistic observational assessment instruments that support molar- and molecular-level analyses of natural patterns of interaction</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research on environment-behavior interaction has been supported by observational instruments that have assessed ecological as well as behavioral events in close temporal relationship (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Arreaga-Mayer, 1990).  This development has provided a molecular-level analysis of individual behavior where previously only a molar-level analysis was possible.  This advance has provided an important impetus and empirical support base for the investigation of environment-behavior transaction, and ecobehavioral analysis in particular (Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  The ecobehavioral instruments developed at the JGCP are in use by other investigators around the country (e.g. CISSAR: Cooper &amp; Speece, 1990, ESCAPE; Odom, Peterson, McConnell, &amp; Ostrosky, 1990).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example:</U>  We have increased the number and type of ecobehavioral strategies to other settings, populations, and problem conditions.  Work has been completed in the area of bilingual education and analysis of bilingual special education resulting in an ecobehavioral instrument with language features (e.g., ESCRIBE: Arreaga-Mayer, Carta, &amp; Tapia, 1994).  Work has also been completed incorporating digital audio-recording on notebook computers with ecobehavioral instrument taxonomies in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of environment, behavioral, and language sample recording (Walker, Hart, Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Hou, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have developed computer-based management and analytical strategies for handling large, complex data bases containing multi-measure, multi-content data</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Two longitudinal data bases have been created that contain observational and developmental outcome data that span a twelve-year period and represent thousands of units of information (e.g., Hart &amp; Risley, 1989; 1995; Kamps, Carta et al., 1989).  Software systems were developed beginning in 1982 to manage the accumulation of these data, enable access to it, and use of various analytical strategies.  One such strategy is the ecobehavioral process-product design (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1987; Greenwood, Delquadri, Stanley, Terry, &amp; Hall, 1985) which combines sequential analyses of molecular-level interaction with molar-level measures of engagement and change in developmental outcome (Greenwood, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Carta, 1994; Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Atwater, 1991).  These strategies have been employed by Cooper and Speece at the University of Maryland, McConnell and Ysseldyke at the University of Minnesota, Kaiser and Odom at Vanderbilt University, and Goldstein at the University of Pittsburgh.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example:</U> A longitudinal data base has been developed by the Early Childhood Research Institute on Substance Abuse at Juniper Gardens that includes 270 children in three age cohorts (Birth, 18 mos., and 36 mos.) most of whom were prenatally exposed to alcohol or illicit drugs.  Ecobehavioral observation data collected in the homes and schools for these children have been compiled in data bases also containing demographic, developmental, play, and social indices (Carta, McConnell, McEvoy, &amp; Rokusek, 1992).  This ongoing project is examining the impact of prenatal exposure as one of multiple risk factors affecting the performance and developmental progress of these children (Carta, Sideridis, et al., 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A longitudinal study of the generalization and maintenance of the behavior of students with autism has incorporated validated ecobehavioral assessment in monitoring educational programs (Kamps, Greenwood, &amp; Leonard, 1991).  The current sample includes 40 children with autism served in integrated settings in a 5-year longitudinal study (Kamps, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We have conducted, and have in progress, comprehensive, longitudinal studies of development now covering more than 12 years of life span across multiple settings (e.g., home, school)</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Results from a longitudinal, controlled field trial after ten years have revealed that at-risk elementary students who systematically increased their engagement through their teachers' use of Classwide Peer Tutoring, also significantly increased their performance on standardized tests of reading, arithmetic, spelling, and language compared to (a) control group students and to (b) a non-risk comparison group (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Greenwood, 1991a; 1991b).  By middle school, the group of students whose teachers had used Classwide Peer Tutoring had significantly fewer members who had received Special Education Placements and for those who were placed, their services were less restrictive (Greenwood &amp; Delquadri, 1995; Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, &amp; Walker, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Another ten-year line of research has been the longitudinal description of the development of language and social interaction in the home (Hart &amp; Risley, 1989; 1995) and subsequently in the elementary school (Walker, Carta, &amp; Hart, 1990).  In addition to revealing environmental processes of language development (e.g., Hart 1991), the predictive validity of the rate of spoken language at 36 months of age assessed in the home has been established in terms of standardized measures of IQ and vocabulary at kindergarten, first, second, and third grades (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, &amp; Carta, 1994).  <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>C.  Ecology and Context in Intervention and Treatment</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We used <U>Zone-Management</U> to make activities and interaction continuously available in the preschool</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: An early study that employed an intervention in the ecology of the preschool (LeLaurin &amp; Risley, 1972) demonstrated that through <U>zone management,</U> engagement and other aspects of personal behavior could be effectively changed and facilitated through specific arrangements of stimuli within the caregiving environment.  Environmental organization today, using zone and other techniques, is a widely used general strategy for preventing many serious problem behaviors and for facilitating engagement in the design of preschool, public school, and health care programs (e.g., Nordquist &amp; Twardosz, 1990).<P>
<P>
	<B>We used a <U>Survival Skill Intervention Package</U> to improve preschool students' transitions from one activity to another, participation in groups, and independent work in the preschool</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  In-classroom transitions can take an inordinate amount of time for young students with and without developmental disabilities.  A recent study of early intervention classrooms has shown that arrangements of schedules, staff, the room, tasks, and consequences can have a powerful impact on student performance (Carta, Atwater, Schwartz, &amp; Miller, 1990; Connell, Carta, &amp; Baer, 1993; Sainato, 1990).  One specific finding indicated that reducing transition time increased student engagement, which over several years, has been shown to be a protective factor with respect to placement into special education programs at kindergarten and first grade.<P>
<P>
	<B>We provided redesigned instructional environments in order to better support and maintain prosocial behaviors of children with disabilities.</B><P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>: Young children with behavioral risks need early intervention to increase positive interactions with parents, peers, and teachers in order to prevent serious emotional disturbance.  We provided training and programming to reduce serious aggression and other antisocial behaviors for over 700 Head Start, Kindergarten, and first grade children in their classrooms (Kamps, Ellis, Wyble, Mancina, &amp; Bednar, 1994; Kamps, Ellis, Mancina, &amp; Greene, in press).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We developed and tested inservice teacher training procedures and materials supporting minority issues and multicultural content in special education (Preston, Greenwood, et al., 1984; Utley, Delquadri, Tapia, &amp; Blesz, 1994).<P>
	<P>
	<B>In the context of inclusion, we demonstrated the importance of also incorporating individualized services and interventions to ensure student progress</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We demonstrated the benefits of <U>social skills groups</U> (Kamps, Leonard, Vernon, Dugan et al., 1992); <U>cooperative learning/tutoring </U>(Dugan, Kamps, Leonard et al., 1995; Kamps, Barbetta, Leonard, &amp; Delquadri, 1994; Kamps, Leonard, et al., in press); and <U>peer networks</U> (Garrison-Harrell, Kamps et al., 1994; Potucek, Gonzalez-Lopez, Kemmerer, Kravitz, &amp; Kamps, 1995) in improving the active the social engagement for students with autism included in the general education classroom. <P>
<P>
	<B>We used <U>Classwide Peer Tutoring</U> in order to increase the opportunities students have to make active responses to the curricula</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Rearranging reading, spelling and math instruction so that students tutor each other, rather than all listening to the teacher lecture, doubles the opportunities students have to respond to the material (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Greenwood, 1991a; Maheady &amp; Harper, 1987).  This work has been published in the <U>Journal of Educational Psychology</U>, <U>Exceptional Children</U>, <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Journal of Behavioral Education</U>, among others.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We are adapting CWPT to better support the academic and language learning of limited English speaking students (Arreaga-Mayer, 1995).<P>
<P>
	<B>We contributed to the understanding of quality/fidelity of treatment and how these variations in treatment moderate student outcomes</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  The use of checklists of intervention components as a means of assessing treatment fidelity have been helpful in documenting the effects of training and of monitoring implementation quality over time (Carta &amp; Greenwood, 1989).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Studies were completed examining the functional effects of improving the quality of implementation of CWPT on student outcome, demonstrating that low quality implementation quality is a risk factor for lower outcome (Greenwood, Terry, Arreaga-Mayer, &amp; Finney, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<U>Examples</U>:  Studies of CWPT students who failed to make expected levels of progress were important to understanding the effects of program implementation and of improving the program over time (Greenwood, Dinwiddie et al., 1987; Greenwood, Finney et al., 1994).<P>
<P>
	<B>We rearranged the home environment in order to increase parent's teaching and to promote safety and prevent injury</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  We developed methods of parent tutoring that were effective and could be maintained over time (Duvall, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1992; Walker &amp; Greenwood, 1994).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Both active (e.g., infant car seats) and passive injury prevention strategies (single occasion setting of home hot water heater thermostat at correct temperatures) have been investigated (Christophersen, 1989).  This work was first published in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U> and subsequently in <U>Pediatrics</U>,  <U>American Psychologist</U>, <U>American Journal of Diseases of Children</U>, and <U>Pediatric Clinics of North America</U>.  Observational procedures were also developed to assess dangerous behaviors in the home and methods used to decrease them  (e.g., Mathews, Friman, Barone, Ross, &amp; Christophersen, 1987).<P>
<P>
	<B>We arranged the pediatric clinic to promote improved compliance with medical regimens</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: Patients were provided written instructions for the use of specific medication regimens and a system for reminding them about their appointments.  These procedures have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of studies and replications (e.g., Finney, Friman, Rappoff, &amp; Christophersen, 1985).  <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>D. Engagement as Target for Change</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
	<B>We demonstrated the fundamental relationships between students' behavioral performance (engagement) and growth in developmental, academic, and social outcomes over time.</B><P>
<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  An index of academic responding defined as engagement in writing, reading, and talk in the context of academic tasks and situations was shown to be a positive correlate of academic achievement (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984) and when increased via direct intervention based on ClassWide Peer Tutoring, it was shown to covary with significant growth in academic achievement (Greenwood, 1991; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989).  This form of academic engagement was also shown to mediate between instruction and achievement when compared to alternative models not mediated this way (Greenwood, Terry, Marquis, &amp; Walker, 1994).<P>
	<P>
<U>	<B></U>We demonstrated that students' <U>engagement in academic responding</U> can be increased by manipulating the quality and quantity of response opportunities during instruction</B><P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A tutor gives a tutee opportunities to respond that would not otherwise be available in most teacher-mediated instruction (Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Maheady &amp; Harper, 1987).  In this work, the increased engagement in writing, reading aloud, and academic talk that resulted was functionally related to increases in measures of academic achievement and shown to be a protective factor with respect to special education placement in later grades (Greenwood, 1991b; Greenwood, Terry, et al., 1994).<P>
	<P>
<U>	Example</U>:  Research has been completed on adaptations of ClassWide Peer Tutoring needed for use by students with mild retardation in both self-contained and integrated instructional settings (Mortweet, Perdomo-Rivera, Utley, Delquadri, &amp; Greenwood, 1994). <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>: We demonstrated that small group instruction including choral responding and student-to-student interaction improved the engaged behaviors of students with autism in public school classrooms (Kamps, Dugan, &amp; Leonard, 1994; Kamps, Leonard, Dugan, Boland, &amp; Greenwood, 1991; Kamps, Walker, McGrale, &amp; Rotholz, 1992).<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that the productive language of preschoolers' could be increased if the teacher handled students' initiation requests by requiring (a) elaboration followed by (b) reinforcing consequences</B>. <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Research with incidental teaching produced a major advance in our theoretical understanding of natural reinforcement processes (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995).  Results indicated that increases in elaboration were related to increases in the rate of language use.  As a technique, incidental teaching is used nationally and it is a basis of several related forms of language intervention and of preschool teaching methodology (e.g., milieu language teaching; Hemmeter &amp; Kaiser, 1990).  Reports of this work have appeared in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Education and Urban Society</U> among others.<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that parents could effectively engage their children in reading, writing, and spelling at home with measurable academic improvements at school</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Several studies investigated procedures that parents could use to work effectively with their children at home on subjects taught at school.  Parent tutoring was found to be highly effective with direct impact on achievement in school (Duvall, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1992; Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1984; Thurston &amp; Dasta, 1990).  Engagement at home was functionally related to gains in academic achievement at school.  This work has been published in the <U>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</U>, and <U>Remedial and Special Education</U>.<P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that appropriate recreational behaviors could be established within an impoverished environment</B>.  <P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  Recreational opportunities were created within the Housing Project community center focused on sports and games.  Students were taught specific games and procedures used to maintain their engagement for major portions of the day (e.g., Pierce &amp; Risley, 1974).  Engagement in recreational behaviors was functionally related to reductions in problem behaviors in the community center and in the neighborhood. <P>
<P>
	<B>We demonstrated that the physical appearance of the inner-city neighborhood could be improved through engagement in physical care and maintenance activities</B>.<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  A lawn care program was designed by community residents and Project investigators that involved random observational assessments in the community combined with group incentives for lawn production/maintenance (e.g., Christophersen, Doke, &amp; Risley, 1974).<P>
<P>
	<U>Example</U>:  An anti-littering program was designed by community residents and Project investigators that involved random observational assessments in the community combined with group incentives for litter reduction (e.g., Chapman &amp; Risley, 1970).<P>
 <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>E. Impact on Research Training, Community Residents, and Service</B><P>
<B><P>
</CENTER>	We have supported and supervised master's and Ph.D. students research.<P>
<P>
	</B><U>Example</U>: 199 graduate students have received advanced degrees (99 doctoral, 100 master's, see Tables 1, and 2), and 1,502 regular and special education teachers have conducted research and/or completed aspects of their professional training at the Project (See Table 4 ).  30 graduate students are currently in training at the Project.<P>

<P>
	CISSAR provides an observational assessment of the instructional ecology, teacher behavior and student behavior that typically occur in the regular education classroom setting.  This assessment provides a means of quantifying students' academic responding within the context of specific instructional variables and teacher behavior.<P>

<P>
	The MS-CISSAR code performs an ecobehavioral assessment similar to the CISSAR; however, MS-CISSAR is designed for use in both regular and special education settings.  MS-CISSAR provides an assessment that is sensitive to the environments and behaviors of students with special needs.<P>

<P>
	The ESCAPE code is an ecobehavioral observation instrument for evaluating the  instructional effectiveness of preschool programs.  Like the CISSAR and MS-CISSAR, it measures ecological, teacher, and student variables in close temporal relationship and it provides indices of student engagement, talk, and inappropriate behavior overall or conditional on specific ecological conditions.<P>

<P>
	Like the prior ecobehavioral observation systems, the ESCRIBE supports direct assessments of ecological, teacher, and student variables.  However, ESCRIBE is designed for the assessment of behavior and language within culturally and linguistically diverse classroom environments.  It provides a means for quantifying students' academic and linguistic responses within specific classroom contexts.<P>

<P>
	EBASS is software system in which the CISSAR, MS-CISSAR, and ESCAPE  instruments are available for use by practitioner's (e.g., school psychologists) on notebook computers.  The system is designed primarily for school psychologists.  EBASS supports training in the instruments, instrument selection including instrument down-sizing, data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation.<P>

<P>
	PICCOLI is a computerized version of the earlier Hart and Risley code.  With this system ecological, social interaction, and language sampling of children 6-36 months of age are integrated on a notebook computer with digital audio recording capabilities.  Thus, parent-child social interaction and contemporaneous language sampling may be more accurately and efficiently recorded.<P>

<P>
<P>
	CIRCLE is an ecobehavioral observation system designed for use with very young children and their caregivers.  The instruments provide indices of caregiver, and child behavior in the context of specific environmental conditions.  CIRCLE 1 is designed for use with infants.  CIRCLE 2 is designed for children who are toddlers and older.<P>

<CENTER><h2>Abstract</h2><P>
</CENTER><P>
The purpose of this project was to investigate the efficacy of Expert Systems approaches to consultant-mediated instructional intervention with students with LD.  Consultant-mediated interventions are a widely used vehicle for individualizing inservice teacher training and student service delivery within special education settings (i.e., Paine, Bellamy, &amp; Wilcox, 1984).  To date, consultant-mediated interventions have been supported by knowledge of the general principles of behavior and intervention procedures consisting of manuals, materials, objective, and highly structured activities (i.e., Walker, Hops, &amp; Greenwood, 1984).<P>
<P>
Within a programmatic research plan encompassing 4 interrelated studies over a five-year period, an Expert System program for consultant-mediated intervention was developed, validated, and tested.  A total sample of 192 LD students, 94 special education teachers, and 64 special education consultants participated during the project.  <U>The general design of the project will consist of two components,</U> (b) <U>treatment efficacy and validation when used to establish classroom-based interventions</U>.  The designs used across these two components and four studies ranged from blind comparisons of human vs. computer generated judgments and recommendations concerning intervention procedures, to single-subject studies of the establishment of classroom interventions, to experimental-control group studies of classroom interventions established within field settings.  Assessment of the effects the program focused on process and outcome measures of student, teacher, and consultant performance.  At the , academic achievement and classroom behavior measures were assessed.  At the <U>teacher level</U>, intervention implementation were assessed using behavioral checklists and direct observation measures.  At the <U>consultant level</U>, program knowledge measures of interactions with Expert System and the classroom teacher were obtained.  The publications from this project were the following:<P>

<P>
Abstract<P>
</CENTER>	For the past 12 years, we have engaged in a program of research designed to improve the literacy of children in inner-city schools who are poor, culturally diverse, and who have mild disabilities.  The net product of this research has been the <I><U>Classwide Peer Tutoring</U> </I>program or CWPT (Delquadri, Greenwood, Whorton, Carta, &amp; Hall, 1986; Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Hall, 1988).  This program has been the object of more than 25 experimental evaluations generated by researchers at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project or by others who have replicated or adapted the procedures for class-wide and school-wide models.  <U>This body of work has shown that students at-risk and with mild disabilities acquire literacy skills at a faster rate, retain more of what they learn, and make greater advances in social competence when using CWPT compared to conventional instructional methods</U>.  <P>
<P>
	Emerging from this work have been several new knowledge bases that serve this application including: (a) data on instructional effectiveness that includes a 12-year experimental-longitudinal study, (b) the classroom-based CWPT program, (c) a school-wide adoption and administrative model, and (d) a technology-based expert system (the CWPT GURU) for assessing and improving the fidelity of implementation.  Taken together, this comprehensive knowledge base of research, technology, training, and practice represents a major asset in our effort to promote the literacy of culturally diverse children with disabilities.  Unfortunately, however, the current teacher training materials and approaches used with CWPT are currently outdated (based on manuals and color slides), and technologically obsolete.<P>
<P>
	The <U>general hypothesis</U> addressed in this application is that the often unyielding barriers that prevent large-scale, high-quality, sustained implementation of effective practices may be overcome by improving personnel preparation's links to technology.  <B>Thus, the <U>aim</U> of this project is to<U> develop, field test, and disseminate</U> an innovative approach to CWPT training using multimedia technology.</B>  In this project, we propose to integrate existing CWPT research and practice knowledge (manuals, books, published research, video, teachers previously trained) into a multimedia software system.  Within a three-year design including development, field testing, and dissemination strands, a CWPT Learning management System (CWPT-LMS) will be produced.  The intended subject population for the system are general and special education teachers and administrative staff in elementary, Chapter 1 schools who serve children who are at risk, culturally diverse, and with mild disabilities (LD, BD, EMR, DD, and ADHD) who are included within the general education program.  Due to the self-instructional nature of multimedia programs, this project has implications for both preservice and inservice teacher training formats.<P>
<P>
	This project addresses at least six national priorities in the education of children with disabilities: illiteracy, education goals 2000, inclusion, performance-based assessment, computer technology, and reduction of the lag between research and practice. The <I><U>benefits for potential CWPT users</U> </I>will be in terms of improvements in the quality and efficiency of the training system, and thus, CWPT's wider-scale use in the classroom and expected benefits to literacy.  The <I><U>benefits for others</U> </I>will be the knowledge and lessons learned concerning the demonstration of the broader notion of how technology may be linked to existing effective practices in ways that reduce barriers, improve the quality of training, and promote effectiveness, utilization, acceptability, and teacher support.<p>

<P>
Abstract <P>
</CENTER>	Improving services and outcomes for children with disabilities relies on input from a systematic body of research knowledge.  Unfortunately, this knowledge finds its way into practice only sporadically and oftentimes after inordinately long delays (Gersten, Woodward, &amp; Morvant, 1992; Malouf &amp; Schiller, 1995).  Part of this problem is due to the limited nature of the communications/interactions that occur between researchers and school practitioners.  As a result, researchers are often unaware of classroom contextual factors that may affect teachers' abilities to implement research knowledge.  In addition, teachers oftentimes lack access to research information that has specific applicability to the students in their particular classrooms.  Finally, when teachers do receive research information about a potentially useful practice, opportunities to receive adequate input on their quality of implementation are often lacking.  Clearly, research is needed to improve the manner in which research knowledge is generated and translated into manageable teaching strategies so that sustained, meaningful changes occur in practice that result in improved outcomes for students.<P>
 	For the past 30 years, the applicant has pursued lines of research designed to improve the practices of special and regular education teachers and of parents in inner-city communities and has established a strong record of translating research findings into practice.  The approach is designed to establish and maintain sustained research-practice relationships between researchers and practitioners.<B>  </B>The evidence of the effectiveness for this approach is the extensive record of published research findings and products in current practice.  While well-defined and frequently used, the model in its totality has yet to be formally investigated and replicated by others.  Building on this record, lessons learned, and existing relationships with local schools, we propose a formal study of the model implemented in practice settings. <B> <U>The objectives of the project are to: (a) articulate the model and its components, (b) implement the model in two school buildings, (c) assess the effects of the model on practice, research, and student outcomes before, during, and following its application, (d) produce a &quot;blueprint of the model&quot; and evaluate its use by others in a replication site, and (e) disseminate the &quot;blueprint&quot; nationally</U>.</B>  The model employs a number of components that help overcome traditional barriers and that positively increase the likelihood that research-validated practices will be used by teachers.  These <B><U>components</B></U> are: <B><U>partnership, collaboration, consultation, and professional development</B></U>.  <P>
	Participants in the project will be the 975 students (195 with disabilities), their parents, 36 teachers and administrative staff of three school buildings in three school districts, and 10 researchers.  Two inner-city elementary school buildings (local research sites) within the Kansas City Bi-State (KS/MO) Enhanced Enterprise Community will participate as local sites.  Many children within this community come from areas of concentrated poverty (35+% in poverty), and come from backgrounds of ethnic and linguistic diversity, single parent families, and disability.  Using a multiple baseline design across schools and a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) measurement model, functional relationships between use of the model and changes in implementation of practices, instructional processes, and products/outcomes on students with and without disabilities will be examined.  Additional participants will be the staff and students of a third, out-of-state replication school that will serve as an independent replication site for the model prior to national dissemination.<P>
	In addition to the direct benefits to participants, the project will result in new knowledge in the form of empirical and qualitative findings concerning the model, its components, processes, products, and outcomes.  This knowledge will be published in the professional literature and used in preservice teacher training.  This knowledge will also be represented in a &quot;blueprint&quot; of training, materials, media, and technology for replication in local schools.  The blueprint will be made available through traditional dissemination channels (e.g., National Centers, Teachers' Unions) and more recent channels based on telecommunications technology.<P>

Abstract<P>
</CENTER>Large scale improvements in the literacy of children with disabilities will require input from a systematic body of knowledge based on research, practice, and technology.   Unfortunately, barriers to this improvement are our limited knowledge of: (a) what works best?, (b) how it can be systematically delivered by personnel within local schools?, and (c) the best roles to be played by technology.   A synthesis of the literature on literacy, technology, and change in practice suggests strongly that advances in literacy will not be achieved until knowledge of effective instruction is translated into acceptable teaching strategies that can be sustained in local schools.  Only then, will meaningful changes occur in classroom practice needed to improve literacy outcomes for students on a large scale.<P>
<P>
For the past 12 years, we have engaged in a program of research designed to improve the literacy of children in inner-city schools who have mild disabilities, are poor, and who are culturally diverse.  This research has addressed the issue of  what works best (effective components), how it can be applied widely within local schools (administrative model), and the role of technology (communication, training, and implementation quality information).  The net product of this research has been the <I><U>Classwide Peer Tutoring</U> </I>program or CWPT (Delquadri, Greenwood, Whorton, Carta, &amp; Hall, 1986; Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, &amp; Hall, 1988).  This program has been the object of more than 35 experimental evaluations.  <U>This body of work has shown that students at-risk and with mild disabilities acquire literacy skills at a faster rate, retain more of what they learn, and make greater advances in social competence when using CWPT compared to conventional instructional methods</U>.  <P>
<P>
Building on this knowledge, lessons learned, and existing relationships with local schools, we propose to conduct research on the effects and benefits of integrating existing CWPT research knowledge and products in a <U>CWPT Learning Management System<I></U> </I>through: <U>Local area network (LAN) technology </U>(to link and manage information), <U>educational media</U> (to guide application and training), and <U>materials</U> (to support the peer-mediated curriculum).<B>  </B>Within a three-year design, a CWPT Learning management prototype will be investigated in terms of its effects on multiple indices of process, product, and satisfaction when implemented an elementary school building (<I>N </I>= 13 teachers and 325 students [65 with disabilities: LD, BD, EMR, DD, and ADHD]).<P>
<P>
This project addresses at least six national priorities in the education of children with disabilities: illiteracy, education goals 2000, inclusion, performance-based assessment, technology, and reduction of the lag between research and practice.  The impact of this project will be broad because it builds on investments made in prior research by integrating current research knowledge and effective practice components within the context of a<I> </I><U>CWPT Learning Management System and LAN communications</U>.  The <I><U>benefits for CWPT users</U> (actual and potential) </I>will be in terms of improvements in the quality and efficiency of the system, and thus, its wide-scale use and expected benefits to literacy within an inner-city setting were such demonstration is so very much needed.  The <I><U>benefits for others </I></U>will be the knowledge and lessons learned concerning the system's development, validation, and utilization.  This work, as compared to research focused strictly on technology, provides a needed demonstration of how technology may be linked to existing effective practices in ways that reduce barriers and that promote effectiveness, utilization, acceptability, teacher change, and broad impact.<P>

Charles R. Greenwood and Dale Walker<P>
With Contributions by: Carmen Arreaga-Mayer, Jane Atwater, Debra Kamps, Barbara Terry, Cheryl Utley, and Dale Walker<P>
</CENTER><P>
<CENTER>ABSTRACT <P>
</CENTER> <P>
<B><U>The purpose of this project is to reduce the shortage in minority- and nonminority-group research<I> </I>leaders in special education with expertise in minority issues</U>.</B>  Research training will focus on research knowledge and skill concerning appropriate, effective practices for minority and non-minority students with disabilities within urban school settings.  The assistance requested will provide financial support for up to 16 selected special education professionals to complete a one- or two-year post-doctoral fellowship.  These professionals will be recent doctoral degree recipients, University faculty members, professional researchers, or LEA, SEA, or Federal agency staff, whose professional activities have a direct and clear line of impact upon the educational programs of minority children.  Thus, the project will serve expressed national personnel preparation needs, including: (a) addressing shortages, and enhancing quality by updating doctoral level professionals in recent innovations in research knowledge, methods, technologies, and skills, (b) preparation of professionals to conduct research concerning minority-group children, and (c) preparation of professionals who train teachers or related personnel who serve minority children with disabilities.<P>
  <P>
Selected applicants will receive leadership experiences at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project in Kansas City, Kansas.  The Project is an affiliate of the University of Kansas, Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies, the Kansas Mental Retardation Research Center, the Department of Special Education, and the Department of Human Development and Family Life.  Building on methods developed in three previous Leadership Training Projects, each post-doctoral fellow will design an individualized program of study, selecting from among all available competency domains and skills, to acquire higher-level research skills and experiences; those known to characterize research leaders.  <P>
<P>
Compared to earlier programs, this application has been <U>improved </U>and <U>upgraded</U> in several areas including: t<U>he current portfolio of research projects at Juniper Gardens</U> that provide the broader context for this leadership program; <U>improvements in the traditional competencies and offerings</U> that cross-cut conditions of disability, minority and linguistic issues, life span conditions, and settings including: early childhood special education, students with special needs, students with mild-moderate disabilities; <U>addition of a new competency domain</U> (Research to Practice); <U>integration of the Goals 2000</U>; and <U>a larger, more diverse mentoring research faculty</U>.  Competency domains and skills that build on the past program include: <B>(1) Current Research Topics and Culturally/Linguistically Diverse Students </B>influencing special education research and practice, <B>(2) effective practices with Diverse Students</B>, <B>(3) environmental assessment and analysis, (4) research designs</B> appropriate to the analysis of growth/change in performance, <B>(5) technology and computer applications</B>, <B>(6) research communications</B>, and <B>(7) experiences conducting research</B>.  Joining these domains is: <B>(8)</B> <B>bridging the gap between research to practice </B>because of its increasing relevance to research and implications for the improvement of special services.<P>
<P>
This program represents a substantial impact on the number and quality of special education research leaders and the result of their work on the field's knowledge base.<B>  <U>Number of trainees</U>:</B> Since 1983, 30 post-doctoral fellows have completed work in this leadership program.  The assistance requested in this application will continue this trend, adding up to 16 more to the field by 2000. <B> <U>Impact on Others</U>:</B> Conservative estimates are that each Fellow on average <U>directly impacts 816 other persons</U> (e.g., graduate students, teachers, parents, other researchers, policy makers) each year after completing the program.  <B><U>Impact on the Knowledge Base of Special Education</B></U>:  Program data indicate that on average each Fellow produces 13 scholarly products (e.g., grants, peer reviewed publications, etc.) each year following the program and that their works are cited in the work of others at least twice per year.  <B><U>Quality of the program</B></U>: The quality of the program is reflected in the <U>number of graduate fellows with research careers</U> (at all levels: investigators, administrators, mentors, service, and policy) and <U>evaluations of the program by fellows and third party consumers</U>.<P>

<P>
</CENTER><P>
<P>
Project SLIDE is a model composed of assessment practices and instructional strategies for enhancing the independent functioning and success of young children with disabilities in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade classrooms.  The centerpiece of the model is a method of identifying  and promoting the specific competencies that young children need to maximize their success in their current or future educational settings.  Project SLIDE's strategies for teaching children these competencies have been validated in longitudinal field-tests that demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing children's future needs for special education services.<P>
<P>
The model begins with a careful assessment of children's level of preparedness for their next educational environment.  This assessment information is used to identify interventions that will enhance the child's independent functioning in the new environment.  This set of information becomes the basis for interagency collaboration between preschool and kindergarten settings or between special education and regular preschool settings.  It also provides the parent with knowledge about the child relative to various classroom settings to allow for more informed decision-making about placement and programming.  <P>
<P>
Teachers have the opportunity to learn strategies for teaching children three sets of skills found to be particularly important for children moving from early childhood to elementary classrooms.  These skill components include:  making within-classroom transitions, participating in group instruction, and completing tasks with a minimum of teacher direction.  Each of these can be taught within any existing program model and does not require the teacher to make significant changes in the existing curriculum. <P>
Project SLIDE staff would like to work with interested school districts or other local education agencies that are interested in participating in any of the following activities:<P>

<UL><LI>participating in a trainer-of-trainers model for teachers leading to the implementation of effective intervention strategies that enhance the independent functioning of young children with disabilities in regular classroom settings.
<LI>employing systematic strategies to assess behavioral expectations and developmental appropriateness of kindergarten and first grade classrooms
<LI>using practical strategies for building collaborative relationships among various members of the instructional team (e.g., between teachers and parents; sending teachers and receiving teachers etc.)
<LI>convening  focus groups of teachers, administrators, and parents to tailor the components of the Project SLIDE model to fit the site's unique aspects
</UL>
<P>
<B>In order to be eligible to participate, a site should have the following:</B><P>

<UL><LI>a staff of preschool, kindergarten, or first grade teachers who want to improve the independent functioning of young children in their classrooms.
<LI>administrative support for allowing teachers to learn to implement the model, carry out the model and permit the regular collection of measures to document the quality and the outcomes derived from the model.
<LI>an on-site person who is willing to learn the model and function as the trainer and regular provider of feedback and support to teachers who are implementing the model.
<LI>be willing to carry out focus groups of parents, administrators, and potential implementers of the model who will all provide feedback regarding the ways in which the model should be tailored to fit the children, families, and unique aspects of the site.
<LI>at least 6 preschool and/or kindergarten teachers who represent both special and regular education who are interested in being trained in the model, assisting in tailoring it to meet their needs, implementing at least one component of the model for at least 5 months,  receiving feedback on quality of model implementation, and participating in evaluation of the effects of the model on students.  Training typically takes between 8-10 contact hours to learn all aspects of the model.
</UL><B>Participating sites will receive the following:</B>

<UL><LI>training for one or more staff persons to become teacher trainers in the model
<LI>on-site assistance by Project SLIDE staff in conducting focus groups, providing training and feedback to teachers, and conducting evaluation of students during implementation of the model and for at least one year following implementation
<LI>on-site technical assistance for trainers and teachers at least once per year during involvement in the project
<LI>Project SLIDE teachers' manuals and record forms and evaluation materials for all participating teachers and trainers; as well as one set of Project SLIDE videotapes and training materials for each trainer at the site; and a set of multimedia training software for each site as it becomes available
<LI>honorarium for trainer-of-trainers

<CENTER>Promoting Literacy Through Ecobehavioral Assessment And ClassWide Peer Tutoring</B><P>
<B>For Racial\Ethnic Limited-English Proficient  Minority Students With Disabilities</B><P>
<P>
Carmen Arreaga-Mayer,  Charles R. Greenwood,  &amp; Cheryl Utley<P>
</CENTER><P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>ABSTRACT</b><P>
</CENTER><P>
A frequently debated, controversial and critical issue in the educational assessment of racial/ethnic limited-English proficient (LEP) minority and majority students with disabilities, particularly those reared in poverty, is the use of fair/nondiscriminatory valid assessment procedures linked to effective instructional practices used in regular and special education classes.  Furthermore, valid assessment procedures must focus on the &quot;functional characteristics&quot; of racial/ethnic LEP minority and majority students with disabilities when they are mainstreamed and integrated in regular education classrooms.  One valid assessment model is ecobehavioral assessment and an example of its role is the development and the validation of ClassWide Peer Tutoring at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project.  While ecobehavioral assessment and CWPT have been well validated with at-risk, learning disabled, and normal-achieving children and implemented in regular education instructional programs, they have had only limited application to instructional improvement for racial\ethnic LEP students with or without disabilities.  Thus, there is a need to investigate ecobehavioral assessment and the effectiveness of CWPT with this population of students.<P>
<P>
The purpose of this project is to investigate and validate instructional practices that maximize the literacy and academic achievement gains of racial/ethnic LEP minority and majority students with disabilities in self-contained, resource, and regular education settings.  The focus of this project is to utilize ecobehavioral assessment and analysis procedures as a research tool for (a) identifying procedures associated with effectiveness criteria, and (b) evaluating CWPT as an intervention for LEP students with or without disabilities.<P>
<P>
The research involves five studies.   <U><B>Study 1</U></B> utilizes ecobehavioral assessment procedures to measure the classroom environment (e.g., use of activities, materials, language of material and instructional grouping) to determine ways to naturally facilitate literacy and academic progress (e.g., reading, spelling, language and math achievement) in mainstream regular and special education classrooms.  This study examines the relationships between ecobehavioral data and scores on curriculum-based assessments, and standardized achievement.  Study 1 employs a process-product design using descriptive and correlational methods to determine the relationships between students' academic responding, oral language responding, and scores on curriculum- based assessments and standardized achievement tests.   <U><B>Studies 2--5</U></B> investigate CWPT as an instructional procedure for use by racial\ethnic LEP minority students with and without disabilities.  Analyses reveal the extent of improvement in students' academic performance and language usage during reading, language, spelling and math instruction (i.e., literacy), and related levels of academic performance on curriculum based assessments and standardized achievement tests.  Collectively, these five studies identify, test, and validate the effective components for teaching reading, language, spelling and math (i.e., literacy) to racial\ethnic LEP minority and majority students with and without disabilities.<P>
<P>
The benefits of this work are:  new knowledge concerning the ecobehavioral features of instruction, systematic replication, adaptation of CWPT to serve the needs of a new population, and the translation of research to practice.  The results will be disseminated to teachers and students in the metropolitan Kansas area, reported to professionals and teacher-trainers at state and national conventions, and submitted for publication in professional journals.<P>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>EBASS Distribution Diskettes (Version 3.0, two 3.5&quot; Floppy Disks at 720KB's each).  These diskettes contain the computer program components of the EBASS.  The Data Disk contains the EBASS data collection and analysis programs and various observation files for use in initial training and in later observational data collection.  The Tutorial Disk contains exercises and training activities that help the new user learn each of the 3 observational instruments contained in the system.  The tutorial disk also contains programs used for observer calibration and reliability.<P><P><I>EBASS</I> Technical Manual (Readme First!)  This item contains a detailed description of how to install the software and launch the EBASS program.  Covered here are topics related to making backup copies, configuring the program to operate in the operating system of your choice (e.g., Windows), and solving common problems.  <P><P><I>EBASS </I>Practitioner's Manual provides the information necessary for learning, understanding, and implementing EBASS observations.  Covered here are topics in ecobehavioral assessment theory, illustrations of assessment types, learning to use the system to calibration standards, instruments and their taxonomies, data analyses, file management, and exporting data for data base building and other statistical analyses. <TR>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Site License (permission to make up to 20 copies for use on 20 computers).  For those users intending to equip a group of observers with EBASS, the site license permits multiple copies of the Data and Tutorial Program disks to be made for use within a single school district or other departmental/organizational unit.<TR>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The CISSAR Video (25 Minutes)  This video provides an introduction to the CISSAR observation instrument taxonomy.  CISSAR is designed for use in general education classrooms at the elementary level (1-6).  The video is a visual introduction to the ecological, teacher, and student events in the CISSAR instrument within EBASS. <TR>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The MS-CISSAR Video (36 Minutes)  This video provides an introduction to the MS-CISSAR observation instrument taxonomy.  MS-CISSAR is designed for use in general, special, and integrated education classrooms at the elementary level (K-12).  The video provides a visual introduction to the ecological, teacher, and student events in the MS-CISSAR instrument within EBASS.<TR>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The ESCAPE Video (37 Minutes)  This video provides an introduction to the ESCAPE observation instrument taxonomy.  ESCAPE is designed for use in preschool/kindergarten classrooms in general and special education settings.  The video is a visual introduction to the ecological, teacher, and student events in the ESCAPE instrument within EBASS.<TR>

<TH  ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Calibration/Interobserver Reliability  These video tapes provide a test of the user's calibration/reliability against standards set by the authors.  Observers learning the system, record the video tapes using the data entry program as a last step certifying them as trained and ready for data collection.  The computer then evaluates the agreement between the observer's record and that of the authors, providing feedback on overall agreement as well as item by item disagreement.<TR><P>

It is meant to serve as a guide to where people with disabilities can go to receive help with particular needs (emotional, mental, physical, scholastic, personal).<p>While each of the programs in this directory is a part of the Lawrence community or the University of Kansas, the services provided are generally available to students and non-students alike.  Some of the programs on campus are limited to KU students, faculty or staff, but, by and large, most programs are open to the entire Lawrence community, and, in some instances, to people outside Douglas County.<p>A word of caution: while we have tried to be thorough in compiling this directory, one should not assume that it is comprehensive.  Programs come and go very quickly, and what is accurate about a program one day may not be the next.

Federal funds to construct the KU-UAP came from the Mental Retardation Facilities and Construction Act of 1963.  The Kansas UAP is one of the original members of the UAP network.  The construction application for the three-setting Kansas UAP was approved in 1969 and construction was completed in 1972.  Formal dedication ceremonies were held at all three sites June 14, 1972.<p>The program was designed to train 300 graduate students each year who are pursuing degrees in child development, clinical neurology, education, hearing and speech, music therapy, nursing, pediatrics, psychiatry, psychology, recreation, social work, special education, vocational rehabilitation and occupational therapy.  The original KU-UAP was set up to provide diagnostic and treatment facilities for 1,000 mentally retarded children each year.  <p>The construction program included facilities at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) in Kansas City, Parsons State Hospital and Training Center (PSHTC) at Parsons, and added two floors to the research wing of Haworth Hall on the University of Kansas campus in Lawrence.  The construction agreement included a provision that restricted the building to mental retardation activities for twenty years.  Since the original building was constructed another building, the Robert Dole Human Development Center, has been constructed and now houses a part of the Lawrence KU-UAP while some of the former clinical space has been remodeled and is used for other activities.  On the whole; however, the Haworth Wing and the Dole Center remain dedicated to life span programs for persons with disabilities, and the work in the buildings reflects the long-term University commitment to research with developmental disabilities.  At KUMC most of the KU-UAP program has moved into the Children's Development Unit.  At Parsons the KU-UAP space has been used almost exclusively for KU-UAP activities since it was constructed.  <p>For nearly a quarter of a century the KU-UAP has provided services to improve the lives of persons with disabilities who live in metropolitan and rural eastern Kansas.  A major contribution of the KU-UAP has been to train leaders in education, service and research to help all Kansans live as freely and independently as possible.  Students from a range of academic disciplines gain knowledge and skills in interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving associated with handicapping conditions.  The KU-UAP disseminates products to further the education, training and independence of persons with disabilities and students preparing for careers in human services.	<p>Exemplary services are provided in the Kansas City area, in the college community of Lawrence and in rural southeastern Kansas.  These services improve the lives of persons with disabilities living outside institutions.  The KU-UAP fosters parent involvement and contributes to a spirit of scientific inquiry and the union of clinical and applied research in high priority areas of critical human problems.<p>The KU-UAP provides a technical assistance system to develop, demonstrate and disseminate program models to foster the prevention of developmental disabilities, to intervene in developmental problems and support more independent and unrestricted lifestyles for persons with disabilities.<p>The work is supported by a KU-UAP tradition of cooperation with community service delivery systems in health, education, rehabilitation, social service and mental health, and with long-term involvement by businesses and university students.  Interactions with State and local agencies and organizations support creative implementation of legislation and foster standards for service programs for persons who have developmental disabilities.<p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / June 27, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><title>KU-UAP Goals</title><LINK rev=made href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu"></HEAD><BODY bgcolor=ffffff text=000000 link=113750 alink=888811 vlink=371150><center><h3><a href="http://www.ukans.edu/">University of Kansas </a>/<a href="uap.htm"> University Affiliated Program</a></h3><h2>KU-UAP Mission &amp; Goals</h2></center><HR><h3>Why was the KU-UAP Created?</h3>Early in 1963, President Kennedy asked the Congress to cooperate with him in combating mental retardation.  Drawing on the findings of the 1962 President's Panel on Mental Retardation and other efforts within his administration to design and propose progressive programs for mentally retarded persons, Kennedy told Congress that &quot;. . . care of the mentally retarded has traditionally been isolated from centers of medical and nursing education . . . it is particularly important to develop facilities which increase the role of highly qualified universities in the improvement and provision of services and the training of specialized personnel.&quot;  Kennedy saw a solution to part of the problem and directed that &quot;clinical and teaching facilities will provide superior care for the retarded and will also augment teaching and training facilities for specialists in mental retardation, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and speech and other therapists.&quot;<p>A network of university affiliated facilities was proposed to provide:<p><ol><li>Interdisciplinary training for personnel concerned with developmental disabilities.<li>Exemplary services for developmentally disabled individuals.<li>Technical assistance to state agencies and other entities.<li>Dissemination of applied research findings.</ol><p>The timing was excellent for the Kansas program.  In July 1966, the Kansas Comprehensive State Planning Committee on Mental Retardation had published its final report.  The report was based on a two-year study which included the activities of 18 subcommittees and an advisory committee of 19 members appointed by the governor.  The committee approved and pledged support to the unique, multi-interdisciplinary aspects of the affiliation which had been developed by the University of Kansas, the University of Kansas Medical Center and Parsons State Hospital and Training Center.  This allowed the State and University to move together to create the KU-UAP.<h3>What Is the Mission of the KU-UAP?</h3>Community outreach, clinical evaluations, diagnoses, program models and teaching materials are among the services extended to the citizens of Kansas as the KU-UAP develops alternatives to institutional care for persons with developmental disabilities.  The KU-UAP helps families of persons with disabilities define their needs, find resources, and plan and evaluate services on a cost-performance basis.  The KU-UAP also provides in-service training to service providers.  KU-UAP applied research activities in Lawrence, Parsons and Kansas City include model programs to serve persons with disabilities and their families.  Educational and behavioral training programs assist in developing individual talents that support more rewarding lifestyles.  <h3>Goals of the KU-UAP</h3><ol><li>To provide students with interdisciplinary opportunities to become skillful in working with persons with mental retardation and other handicapping conditions.<li>To provide services and training to persons with disabilities.<li>To foster a spirit of scientific inquiry and conduct applied research in problems that affect the lives of persons with disabilities.<li>To develop model programs to demonstrate ways to prevent disabilities, to intervene where possible to lessen the impact of disabilities and to help persons with disabilities live as independently as possible.<li>To collaborate with other state agencies to determine training needs and to provide training for community personnel where needed.<li>To promote the coordination of health, educational, rehabilitation, social service and mental health delivery systems, and to encourage training opportunities for students in those systems.<li>To support and extend community prevention, intervention and habilitation programs for persons who have disabilities.<li>To participate with state and local agencies and professional organizations to encourage legislation and standards to improve prevention, intervention and habilitation programs for persons with disabilities.<li>To train future leaders in teaching, service and research.<li>To encourage greater university investments in community activities for persons with disabilities.</ol><p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / June 27, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><title>KU-UAP Functions</title><LINK rev=made href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu"></HEAD><BODY bgcolor=ffffff text=000000 link=113750 alink=888811 vlink=371150><center><h3><a href="http://www.ukans.edu/">University of Kansas </a>/<a href="uap.htm"> University Affiliated Program</a></h3><h2>KU-UAP Functions</h2></center><HR><h3>Training</h3>Clinical training is a natural partner of research in developmental problems.  The KU-UAP supports interdisciplinary training to university students at undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels.  In-service training is provided for persons already working in habilitation programs for persons with disabilities.  The KU-UAP promotes the development of community services and training for parents and others concerned with the needs of persons with disabilities.  The interdisciplinary training that takes places in the KU-UAP refers to both the teaching of a process of service delivery and a method of teaching.  Students participate in clinical activities that provide knowledge and skills while at the same time learning to become part of the interdisciplinary service delivery team with a shared identity, common goals and an understanding of the priorities of the interdisciplinary group in providing the most effective services to persons with disabilities and their families.<h3>Service</h3>Services are provided in university and community settings and involve interdisciplinary student trainees, professionals, service providers, families and others.  Exemplary services support the independence, productivity, integration and human rights of persons with developmental disabilities and are scheduled at times and in places consistent with routine community activities, and in ways that interact with and involve community members, agencies and organizations.  Exemplary services demonstrate independence, community integration, and productivity in ways that are economical, that are accepted by various academic disciplines and that are beneficial to persons who are developmentally disabled.<h3>Research</h3>The KU-UAP provides a substantial underpinning for research on numerous issues associated with KU-UAP goals, and the KU-UAP receives benefits from program modifications made as a result of research on the effectiveness of KU-UAP activities.  The interdisciplinary nature of the KU-UAP provides opportunities to study the causes of developmental disabilities and to work toward their amelioration and elimination.  Advances brought by research have enhanced our understanding of problems that confront persons with disabilities and have led to the development of better early diagnostic procedures and effective intervention techniques.  The proximity of the Kansas Mental Retardation Research Center to the KU-UAP encourages collaboration between KU-UAP and MRRC staff to develop better assessment techniques, to provide research-based education about prevention, to develop intervention materials and to provide information about self-injurious behavior and behavior management.  These efforts improve social acceptance of disabling conditions and provide families with research-based information about a range of issues from supported employment to psychopharmacology and mental retardation.<h3>Database</h3>The KU-UAP is part of a national network of University Affiliated Programs gathering and reporting data about their activities on a regular basis and in a consistent format.  The KU-UAP database is supported by the Life Span Institute <a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/lsi/cauhp.htm">Computer Applications Unit</a>.  Database coordinators are located at the major KU-UAP sites and they gather information to provide statistics on: number of trainees; the amount of community-based training; technical assistance provided; the number of clients served; the breakdown of where clients were served and who the clients were; sources of funding; dissemination activities and other data that give statistical pictures of the KU-UAP and national UAP program and its influence in improving the lives of persons with disabilities.<h3>Outreach: Technical Assistance and Dissemination</h3>KU-UAP outreach activities reflect the most current and effective training in community settings.  As more and more persons with disabilities are integrated in community settings it becomes more important that outreach programs of the KU-UAP be based on the most recent developments in supported living and other independent living concepts.  This means that the KU staff strives to help direct care workers and case managers.  Such training is conducted in traditional ways through classrooms and workshops, but a major expansion in outreach is planned through such technological developments as telecommunications and interactive video systems.<p>An important part of the mission of the KU-UAP is to provide technical assistance in program development and implementing model programs.  Closely associated is a publication and dissemination program to produce and distribute materials for education and training for students, parents, teachers, paraprofessionals and professionals working to improve the lives of persons with developmental disabilities.  The purpose of technical assistance is to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities by improving the environment in which they live through models, prototypes, techniques and strategies to help them gain access to independent living arrangements, employment opportunities and social interactions.  	By gathering information and disseminating products and techniques the KU-UAP increases the independence, productivity, and integration into the community of persons with developmental disabilities.  Dissemination includes the presentation of program and service information, training models, research findings, policy conclusions and advocacy recommendations for persons with disabilities themselves, their families, trainers, teachers and policy makers.<p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / June 27, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

In addition to the central office of the Life Span Institute, and the University Affiliated Program, the Dole Center houses three academic departments with research and clinical faculty involved in life span issues of human development:<p><ul><li>Human Development and Family Life (HDFL)<li><a href="http://www.sped.ukans.edu/spedadmin/welcome.html">Special Education</a> (SPED)<li><a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/splh/splhome.htm">Speech-Language-Hearing</a> (SPLH)</ul>The radio-television sequence of the <a href="http://www.ukans.edu/~jschool/">William Allen White School of Journalism</a> is also located in the building.<p><li><strong><a href="uapl.htm">Lawrence</a></strong> (KU Main Campus)<p>In Lawrence the KU-UAP originally was designed as a children's clinical unit by adding two floors to a wing on Haworth Hall.  The two floors include a day training program for young children with disabilities and their parents, a nursery and play area, individual training and counseling rooms, an observation area, offices and workrooms and an area for a mental retardation psychology clinic.  The space also includes an education clinic, a language clinic, an occupational therapy clinic, an administrative suite for the clinic coordinator and technical and secretarial staff, and an area for special projects related to mental retardation.  Other clinics and classrooms affiliated with the KU-UAP are located in the Robert Dole Human Development Center.  In addition, the KU-UAP is affiliated with two community programs for adults in the Lawrence area: Full Citizenship, Inc., and Community Living Opportunities, Inc.<p><li><strong><a href="uapkc.htm">Kansas City</a></strong> (KU Medical Center)<p>The largest of the three-setting KU-UAP is the KUMC facility.  The building was designed to house a mental retardation clinical training unit, including seminar facilities for students and professionals.  Children served in the facility come from the surrounding metropolitan area, from outlying areas of Kansas, and from the Children's Development Unit (CDU).  Although most KU-UAP activities take place in the CDU and in community projects and programs, the Kansas City UAP has access to other facilities that include interdisciplinary diagnostic areas to completely evaluate the condition of each entering client, with laboratory units for cytogenetics, electrodiagnosis, orthopedic surgery, metabolic studies, pediatrics, neurology, physical medicine, psychiatry, social work, nursing and education.<p><li><strong><a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/lsi/p/kuaphp.htm">Parsons</a></strong><p>The University Affiliated Program at Parsons is in a separate building that includes office space and a media production facility in a single-story configuration.  Similar to the KUMC facility, the Parsons site was intended to provide complete diagnostic facilities for eastern Kansas children as well as training for students entering the profession as clinicians or researchers.  The KU-UAP building includes a 20-bed hospital wing operated by the State hospital, psychological and educational diagnostic laboratories, space for nursing education, and a large studio for audiovisual activities related to research and clinical training.  The KU-UAP audiovisual facility includes a sound stage, a microcomputer center, television production space, videotape editing rooms, darkrooms and administrative and work space for the audiovisual staff.<p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / September 11, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

The KU-UAP project development procedure is kept as simple as possible for the convenience of users.  The Lawrence Administrator works with investigators to prepare budgets, to satisfy State and Federal guidelines that apply to the application being processed, to respond to University submission requirements and to follow through with the physical preparation of the application.  <h3>Administration</h3>The KU-UAP director's staff includes sixteen persons with different specialties who provide services that lend cohesion to the University Affiliated Program.  Under the supervision of the KU-UAP Administration Coordinator, staff accountants and bookkeepers are responsible for accounting and reporting to insure that State and Federal guidelines are followed, that funds are disbursed according to regulations, and that KU-UAP resources are up-to-date and are used effectively and efficiently.  A word-processing pool prepares grant applications, progress reports, books, journal articles, correspondence, University reports and other text for internal consumption, University consumption and for reports to Federal agencies.  An executive secretary and various assistants handle telephone traffic, mail, University communications, the reception of visitors, and provide information in response to public inquiries about the KU-UAP.  <a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/lsi/comhp.htm"><h3>Communications</h3></a>The KU-UAP maintains a staff of professional video production personnel, including production technicians, sound engineers and graphic artists, to support research and clinical training activities.  The KU-UAP has available within the organization, or has access to, the technical and artistic talent and equipment necessary to produce professional videotape programs and printed publications for internal and external distribution.  Media services facilities are located in the KU-UAP building in Parsons and in the Dole Human Development Center in Lawrence.  The videotape production facility is at Parsons and comprises a sound studio, production staff and equipment.  The media and communications program provides quality production in almost all existing media formats, for scientific as well as public information.  <a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/lsi/cauhp.htm"><h3>Computer Applications</h3></a>Although each major setting and satellite setting of the KU-UAP has microcomputers with local support staff, the Life Span Institute operates a central computing facility, the Computer Applications Unit (CAU), in Lawrence to which the KU-UAP has direct access.  Services provided by the CAU include database support, computer programming, network support, hardware and software support, and purchasing help.  This staff provides services for all settings.  The CAU operates a local area network with Internet access and mail gateway.   Although most sites have direct Internet connections, dial-in access is also supported.<p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / June 27, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

Over the past few years, the concept of school-linked services integration has gained widespread acceptance as a strategy for linking families to the broad and often fragmented and confusing array of services that they need within the school and community.  While a great deal of information exists about the impact of these efforts on children and their families, as yet, little is known about the impact of school-linked services on individual children with disabilities and their families.</td></tr></table></center><hr><h3>Related Links:</h3><ul><li><a href="wgsp.htm">UAP Work Group on Social Policy</a><li><a href="prc.htm">Community Policy Research Center</a><li><a href="ipl.htm">Interdisciplinary Policy Leadership Training Program</a></ul><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / July 11, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

A third participating community college, Haskell Indian Nations University, serves a student population of Native American Indians and Native Alaskans.  This program is especially designed to equip students seeking careers in child development or early childhood education with an extraordinarily diverse set of competencies that enable them to contribute effectively to prevention efforts in high-impact poverty areas. <p>The program includes coursework and supervised field experience through the resources of four academic departments at the University of Kansas:  <ul><li>Curriculum and Instruction<li><a href="http://www.sped.ukans.edu/spedadmin/welcome.html">Special Education</a><li>Counseling Psychology<li>Human Development and Family Life</ul><img src="gateway2.gif" align=right height=216 width=146 vspace=10>Mentors, funded by the project and who are themselves representative of economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, are placed at the participating sites.  High school students are supported at the site by membership in a "Future Early Childhood Professionals" club and by special summer field experiences and seminars conducted at the University.  At the community college level, interested students are recruited from the Child Development Associate (CDA) program at the colleges.  These students receive stipends at the community college and full scholarships at KU to pursue the final three years of a BA or BSE degree at KU in conjunction with the specialized early childhood training curriculum.  <p>A mentor at KU assists students in the program, links them with student tutors when necessary, and supervises their field experiences in inner-city child development and early childhood educational settings.  All students in the program sign an agreement to accept employment for at least three years after graduation in high-poverty-area settings that have a disproportionately high enrollment of young children who are likely to be members of ethnic minorities.  <p><hr><center><font size=-2><i><a href="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~neptune/">Shawna Rosen</a> / <a href="mailto:s-rosen@ukans.edu">s-rosen@ukans.edu</a> / June 27, 1996<br></i></font></center></BODY></HTML>

No two children are exactly alike, and each child is constantly changing through a variety of interactions with other adults and children and with the social and physical environment. <a href="prc.htm">The Center for the Study of Family, Neighborhood and Community Policy</a> believes that in order to improve the health outcomes and optimize the wellness of all children, a network of community child health and wellness systems should be created which:<p><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Ensures the access of 65 million children and youth to a comprehensive and localized primary health and wellness care infrastructure	<LI>Supports needed changes in parent, child and adolescent behavior	<LI>Improves the environments which surround children and their families  by empowering wellness-oriented communities and by reinvesting the resources expended for care in such communities; and</UL><p><hr><H3>Guiding Principles</H3>Several important principles have guided the design of the proposed network of community child health and wellness systems. These include:<p><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>A community system should ensure ready access for every child to an equitable system of care and support designed to improve child health outcomes and ensure child wellness;	<LI>Such a community system should be designed and managed by wellness-oriented communities that own, control and are accountable for its outcomes;	<LI>Experience dictates that each community system should use a flexible, capacity-based approach to organizing its response to different types of child health and wellness needs;	<LI>Children and their families should be free to choose among care providers;	<LI>The network of community systems should be supported by a unitary, equitable and stable financing mechanism;	<LI>Cost containment should be accomplished through an overall budget cap and the periodic negotiation of fee schedules at the local level between a single payer and a wide range of care providers.</UL>Key elements of the new network which we envision are: (1) community child health and wellness systems managed by broad-based community partnerships; (2) local child development and wellness consortia; (3) state child development and wellness agencies; and (4) a National Child Health and Wellness Board which administers two trust funds dedicated to supporting child health and wellness. Chart 1 provides an overview of the new network which we envision.<p><hr><H3>Community Partnerships and Systems</H3>The mission of each community partnership is to ensure a more wellness-oriented community for all of its children. To be successful, ownership and control of the overall enterprise must be shared by all sectors of the community and by the various social, economic and service systems  (e.g., schools, clubs, businesses) that influence the community environment. Community systems will address simultaneously both the comprehensive needs of individual children and their families and the cross-cutting social and environmental factors that affect their physical, intellectual, emotional and social development and wellness (e.g., the prevention of accidental injuries). Each community partnership will have the responsibility and the power to: <p><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Define needs and set community child health and wellness priorities;	<LI>Manage the needed human, material and economic resources;	<LI>Provide health and wellness information to children and their families;	<LI>Ensure universal access to clinical preventive services (e.g, disease prevention) and needed care and treatment;	<LI>Oversee health maintenance services for children with chronic conditions;	<LI>Address complex health and wellness problems through flexible and locally acceptable methods for influencing behavior.</UL>Community partnership will receive a global budget payment each year earmarked for family wellness care and for prevention-oriented activities targeted on children and families who live in the service areas of the community partnership. Community partnerships will play an active, ongoing role in priority-setting and in the implementation of those capacities within the community system that are focused on prevention and related environmental determinants of child health and wellness. <p><center><TABLE border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><td><center><font size=+2><b>Chart 1</b></font></center></td></TR><TR><TD>Every community child health and wellness system will be organized around 12 core child wellness capacities derived from the over 170 objectives established by Healthy People 2000 for mothers, infants, children and youth:</TD></TR><TR><td><table><tr>	<TD valign=top>	<ul>	<LI>Disease prevention	<LI>Prescription drugs and devices	<LI>Primary health, mental health care and dental care	<LI>Temporary care of sick children	<LI>Food and nutrition	<LI>Family support	</ul>    </TD>	<TD valign=top>	<ul>	<LI>Safety and accident prevention	<LI>Health and developmental screening	<LI>Prevention of high-risk adolescent behavior	<LI>Hospital or in-patient care	<LI>Emergency shelter	<LI>Environmental health and wellness	</ul>	</TD>	</tr></table></td></TR></TABLE></center><p>In designing individual community systems, community partnerships will rely on existing channels of health and wellness influence within the community. Chart 2 illustrates how a particular community might elect to organize its core child health and wellness capacities. Many community partnerships will also choose to add additional child wellness capacity areas which bear directly on improved health and wellness outcomes within those communities (e.g., parental literacy, high quality child care).<p><hr><H3>Local Consortia</H3>Local Child Health and Wellness Consortia (local consortia) will be organized by and be designed to serve from five to ten community partnerships. They will be comprised of representatives of  member community partnerships, elected government officials, and other major stakeholders in child health and wellness. The central mission of local consortia will be to assist member community partnerships carry out their overall mission. <P>Free choice of individual care providers is an important feature of the community system which we have developed. A central responsibility of each local consortium will be to receive a global budget payment each year on behalf of a group of community partnerships. This earmarked payment will be more than sufficient to meet the individual care needs of all children residing in the service areas of the community partnerships which form the local consortium. Each consortium  will act as a single payer and will negotiate rates periodically with child service and care providers (e.g., health care professionals) in the geographic region served by the consortium. Within this process,  providers will be given a strong voice in determining the payment methodology and levels.<p><center><TABLE border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><td><center><font size=+2><b>Chart 2</b></font></center></td></TR><TR>	<TD>Other responsibilities of local consortia include setting regional child health and wellness goals, negotiating health provider payment rates and linking community partnerships to other health-related governmental units at the local and state levels.</TD></TR><TR><TH>State Child Health and Wellness Agencies</TH></TR><TR>	<TD>Within the overall child health and wellness network, State Child Health and Wellness Agencies will carry out three major functions: <UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Certify to the National Child Health and Wellness Board that local consortia and community partnerships meet applicable governance requirements and are operating equitably and fairly	<LI>Support capacity-building at the local and community levels with respect to community systems, community partnerships and local consortia	<LI>Monitor the activities of local consortia and community partnerships to ensure equity and fairness within the design and operation of every community system for all children</UL></TD></TR></TABLE></center><p><H3>National Child Health and Wellness Board and Related Trust Funds</H3>A National Child Health and Wellness Board will oversee the planning, financing and evaluation of the national network. Its primary responsibilities will include establishing  national child health and wellness objectives, evaluating the performance of community partnerships and local consortia and overseeing the ongoing operation of the two child and wellness earmarked trust funds. Once cost and expenditure patterns for each community have been established, the national board will set annual expenditure targets (or global budgets) for each local consortium. These targets will be adjusted periodically based on changes in demography and actual expenditures. <p>Within the national financing system, incentives and rewards for cost-saving will be linked to improved performance on child health and wellness outcomes. Thus,  a local consortia that can show excellent child health and wellness outcomes will have every incentive to avoid excess expenditures. In contrast, a local consortia which can demonstrate little or no improvements in such outcomes would have no incentive to avoid expenditures that are necessary for improved child health and wellness.<p><hr><H3>Overall Costs and Financing</H3>The average 1995 per child cost of providing the individual child health care services was approximately $1,500. For purposes of financing the model that we are proposing, we further assume that a global budget level for 1995 level equal to $1,000 per child would be sufficient to fund the other child wellness and prevention-oriented components of community systems. Based on these assumptions, we estimate that the overall per child costs for FY 1995 of the network of community health and wellness systems which we have described would have been approximately $2,500. If our approach were to be implemented on a national basis, the annual revenues needed to fully finance the network for FY 1995 would have been $162.5 billion (i.e., $2,500 per child X  65,000,000 children).<p>The proposed financing approach combines a redistribution of $42.5 billion of existing expenditures with the creation of a new, dedicated Federal payroll tax and related trust funds. Specifically, an additional $120 billion in annual funding for a new structure of early care and education programs could be obtained through the creation of a new, free-standing Child Health and Wellness payroll tax. In order to produce $120 billion through a new separate and uncapped  payroll tax, employer and employee payroll contributions would each be set at from 2.0 to 2.25%. The payroll tax approach is  familiar, highly efficient and certain. By its nature the payroll tax structure is automatically adjusted for inflation and avoids the generational/political problem of taxing unearned as well as earned income.<p><hr><h3>Current Expenditures and Outcomes</h3>Consistent with changes in public policy over the last three decades, government has assumed an increasing responsibility for financing and administering a large number of programs, operated both by public and private agencies, which are designed to improve the health and wellness of children. Financing for these programs is currently provided through a large number of separate, chiefly categorical, structures operated both by public and private agencies. Several of these programs use public funds to finance, directly or indirectly, services provided by non-public agencies. In 1990, total annual expenditures for maternal and child health services exceeded $145 billion. Approximately $43 billion or 30% was funded by government directly. The balance came from expenditures by individ-uals for out of pocket payments ($25 billion) and from individuals and employers for health insurance ($77 billion). In the same year, total annual public expenditures for child food and nutrition services exceeded $15 billion and total annual public expenditures for child welfare and family support services exceeded $20 billion.<p>Despite these massive public investments, serious negative health outcomes have been reported for large groups of American children, particularly the almost 25% of American children living in poverty. Key measures of child health indicate that, in the 1980s, the United States lost ground in every major area of health and wellness (e.g., rates of preventable disease, accidental injury and child abuse and neglect). Children living in low-income families are also at a much higher risk of having undiagnosed and untreated health problems. In America today, the link between poverty and poor child health and wellness outcomes is overwhelming.<p><hr><h3>What's Wrong?</h3>	Our review of the current programs, expenditure levels and financing structures related to child health and wellness strongly suggests that five major factors have contributed to the overall ineffectiveness of current efforts. <UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>The failure of current program structures to focus on the community nature of the primary causes of most of the problems that affect child health and wellness	<LI>The categorical nature of most programs which leads to: (1) the ineligibility of large numbers of children with severe service needs; (2) extraordinary equity problems on eligibility thresholds; (3) punishment rather reward for program success; and (4) decreased opportunities for families to solve all or most of their own problems without need for ongoing government intervention	<LI>The employer-based system of private health insurance where the ability to obtain health insurance and the extent of that coverage is almost totally dependent on employers	<LI>The absence of a community-based primary care infrastructure for child health care and other childrens services	<LI>Disincentives in the design of service environments, including the hours and days of service, access to child care, and the physical inaccessibility of facilities</UL><p><hr><h3>Impact of Proposed Approach</h3>The impact of the network of child health and wellness systems which we envision will have a profound and positive impact on the larger array of services and supports which directly affect children and their families. Community-based child health and wellness partnerships could form the nucleus of an expanded community-based network of children's services and family supports that also includes early care and education, elementary and secondary education, and transition from school to higher education and/or employment. These expanded networks would be able to work diligently to assist families to take full advantage of the range of social and economic opportunities that are made available within the community. They would also be able to improve family  self-sufficiency and to reinvigorate the informal community-based systems which have traditionally formed the first line of support for families in crisis or under stress.<p>The proposed approach would result in the dramatic expansion of client base for child health and wellness professionals. The stable and dedicated funding structure would provide much needed financial security. While the use of global budget cap might cause concerns, the fact that the local financing structure incorporates strong participation by health professionals in designing payment methods and levels such allay most fears. The elimination of current managed care controls will be seen as a major step forward by most care professionals.<p>The impact of the proposed approach on businesses would also be positive. Most businesses would actually pay less under the payroll tax than they currently do for employee dependent health care under private insurance plans. The creation of a community capacity for sick-child care is another attractive feature. Finally, the proposed approach answers the two most serious objections which have been proposed by small business to universal coverage. Small businesses will pay the same rate (i.e., payroll tax rate) as other businesses and will be relieved of all administrative burden in arranging coverage.<p><hr><h3>Next Step: A Social Marketing Strategy</h3>Social marketing is a process for creating a receptive and ultimately supportive climate for a proposed system reform of this magnitude. The development of a social marketing strategy involves a series of sequential and interrelated stages, including listening and analyzing; planning, pre-testing and implementing a strategy; monitoring and, as neces-sary, restructuring the strategy. The first stage in development involves exploring the proposed approach with a variety of different audiences to analyze and understand the nature of their responses to the overall strategy and important components. An important goal of this process would be to identify those aspects of the proposed approach which are most readily and least readily understandable, those which elicit immediate support or opposition, and those which give rise to particular concerns or fears. This information is crucial to the later stages of the process, particularly as the social marketing strategy is structured and particular strategic objectives and corollary marketing approaches are developed.<p><hr><p><center>Copyright 1996.

This three year outreach project is designed to support the dissemination and
replication of the CAPPS (Comprehensive-model of Appropriate Preschool Practices
and Services) model components.  These components reflect the products of three
earlier EEPCD model development projects and has evolved over a period of 11
years.  The resulting CAPPS model consists of five replicable, interacting
components:  1) Family Involvement; 2) Assessment and Goal Setting; 3) Active
Learning Procedures; 4) Transition Planning; and 5) Least Restrictive Environment
Service Delivery Planning.  Each of these components has been developed and
demonstrated to be effective through previous demonstration projects; and each is
supported by print and video materials that will allow it to be adopted and
replicated by other early childhood programs.  These five components are
available as discrete modules for outreach dissemination and training, allowing
participating outreach sites to prioritize adoption of only those specific
component(s) that best match the self-identified needs of that program.<P>

This project addresses a national need to prepare personnel to provide vision
screening and evaluation services to infants and toddlers with disabilities, with
special emphasis on the training needs of personnel in rural areas.  Training
materials will be designed for nurses, early childhood educators, and others
involved in providing vision services to infants and toddlers with disabilities
or who are considered at risk for developmental disabilities.  These training
materials consist of a multi-media package of six modules, including:  a)
professionally produced and narrated videotapes; b) a summary booklet,
highlighting the principle concepts and procedures of the modules; c) a set of
practicum activities; d) a set of overhead transparency masters which can be used
by a facilitator to lead group discussion; and e) a Facilitator's guide that
provides guidelines for conducting training programs using these materials in a
workshop or telecommunication format.  Through extensive field testing
activities, direct training will be provided to approximately 100 personnel from
target audiences during the 3-year duration of the project.  Following the
completion of this project, the training materials will be available nationally
through either commercial sources or our University distribution system.<P>

Project TaCTICS is designed to meet two critical needs in Kansas, the need for
inservice training for infant and toddler specialists and the need for the
development of replicable curriculum and training materials.  The training
content and subsequent materials consist of six replicable, interacting modules
that include print materials, team activities, resources for additional
information and follow-up implementation activities.  The modules are:  Teamwork,
Communication Development, Communication Assessment, Community Collaboration,
Communication Intervention, and Augmentative Systems.  Training occurs over eight
months and includes two, three-day workshops, conference calls, onsite
visitations and, where possible, ITV seminars.  Teams of family members,
communication specialists, and community service providers are selected annually
in collaboration with KDHE.<P>

<UL><LI>Project FACETS Abstract<P>
This three year project is designed to support the dissemination and replication
of the five interacting model components of the FACETS model.  These components
have been packaged into modules which are based on "how to" information for the
provision of family-guided early intervention services to children, birth to
three, and their families.  These components reflect model services that have
been demonstrated and validated through an earlier EEPCD demonstration project. 
The resulting FACETS model consists of five replicable components:  1) Public
Awareness/Child Find; 2) Family-guided Service Coordination; 3) Family-guided
IFSP Development; 4) Family-guided Activity Based Intervention; and 5)
Family-guided Transition Planning.  The modules are supported by print and video
materials that will allow it to be adopted and replicated by other early
intervention programs.  For outreach training, each participating outreach site
will prioritize those modules that best match the self-identified needs of their
program.<P>

The development of least restrictive environment (LRE) options for children with
disabilities by local education agencies (LEAs) has been mandated resulting in
pressure being placed on educators to develop model service delivery programs and
options.  Head Start has a long and successful history of providing quality
programs for preschool children including children with disabilities.  However,
oftentimes the children served in Head Start programs have only had mild or
moderate disabilities.  LEAs and families require new options for serving all
children in least restrictive environments.  This project proposes to further
develop materials and strategies for support of children with severe disabilities
in Head Start programs.  This project will provide on-site training, follow-up,
and technical assistance to Head Start programs in southeast Kansas to support
the integration of children with severe disabilities.  Three levels of training
will be addressed.  These include state level needs identified by RAP, local
needs identified by Head Start disabilities coordinator, and individual needs
based on classroom staff needs related to specific children with disabilities. 
Collaborative efforts by the Kansas UAP, Region VII RAP, and local Head Start
program will insure the development of materials and support systems to meet the
goals of the project.<P>

This project is designed to meet the continuing need for a comprehensive
statewide inservice training and technical assistance system for early childhood
special education professionals, paraprofessionals, related services
professionals and parents of children with disabilities in the State of Kansas.
The project will continue, expand and enhance the inservice training and
technical assistance opportunities by providing and supporting collaborative
training and technical assistance activities on a comprehensive statewide basis.
The project will provide training and technical assistance to preschool programs
in the State, for children with disabilities.  Additionally, parents and staff of
agencies collaborating with those preschool programs will be afforded
opportunities to be involved with training and technical assistance activities.
Inservice needs will be addressed at three levels of training - state, regional,
and individual.  This will be accomplished through a needs assessment for the
identification of the statewide priorities, regional needs, and for
implementation of technical assistance services developed in concert with
Individual Development Plans of professionals.<P>

The project's goals will be completed through activities such as the summer
institute, dissemination of information through a newsletter, provision of
inservice training, provision of agency and individual technical assistance,
development of new teacher and technical assistance packets for practitioners in
the field, management of the identification of exemplary practices in the state,
and support the continued development of a profile of services in the state. 
Finally, this program will continue to support and utilize existing structures
and opportunities for staff development currently occuring throughout the state
through collaborative linkages with other agencies, programs, organizations, and
projects in the field of Early Childhood Education.<P>

This three year project is designed to meet the need in Southeast Kansas for
provision of ECSE services within the least restrictive environment (LRE) through
the development of family-guided, community-based early childhood service
options.  This program will assure collaboration between the current Part H (SEK
Birth to Three Program), Part B providers (ANW and Tri-County Special Education
Cooperatives and Fort Scott - a QPA pilot school), an educational service center
(Southeast Kansas Education Service Center), an institution of higher education
(Kansas University Affiliated Program at Parsons) and community-based regular
education providers (e.g., Head Start, Parents as Teachers) across a six-county
area.  Through the development of family-guided transition procedures that
promote shared decision making, family/professional partnerships, and options for
community placements and service delivery, it is anticipated that significant
restructuring of preschool services will result.  To accomplish the proposed
collaboration, critical issues identified in the reauthorization, will be
targeted and include:  a) the use of an IFSP/IEP for the delivery of services to
children with identified disabilities ages 3 to 5 years; b) the development of
flexible transition procedures as the child moves from Part H services to Part B
programs; and c) the identification of policies and procedures to assure the
content and intent of the law is met during transition.<P>

This resource and referral project is designed to meet the needs of a rural,
sparsely populated area by the continuation and further expansion of a child care
resource and referral center.  Until this Resource and Referral Center was
established in 1992, southeast Kansas in general, and Labette and Cherokee
counties specifically, did not have a central point of contact for families in
need of daycare services.  This Resource and Referral Center employs a
state-of-the-art computer managed data based system designed to match and link
families with daycare providers, based on specific needs identified by the
family.  The center through an extensive public awareness program also
coordinates its services with state and community agencies, the general public,
and other service providers to create a cost efficient and effective program to
enable families to identify daycare opportunities.  The staff works closely with
the public health departments, SRS offices, and educational programs to make this
no cost service available to low income families and families of children with
disabilities.  This center will also continue the expansion and development of a
professional network for daycare providers through the publication of a quarterly
newsletter and the development of a resource center designed for the production
of play and interactive materials for child care programs and the lending of
equipment and materials.<P>

The purpose of this project is to investigate communication skill development of
nonverbal individuals with severe mental retardation who show some level of
intentional communicative behavior (such as pointing), but who do not talk, sign,
or use a communication board.  Three areas of behavior thought to relate to early
language development are being studied.  These are:  a) communication behaviors
(including type of gesture used, what the communicative act was intended to mean,
and how that act fit into the ongoing interaction); b) cognitive behaviors
(including simple problem solving, knowledge of the functional/conventional use
of common objects); and c) symbolic behaviors (including the understanding of
pictures and gestures as representatives for objects and actions in the real
world).  The current funding cycle for this project supports several specific
studies.  These studies include a survey of the communication abilities of over
200 Kansas children and adults with severe mental retardation; and a follow-up
study in which researchers directly assessed the communication and related
cognitive/symbolic abilities of approximately 80 of these individuals. 
Additionally, laboratory studies conducted within this project are examining
specific parameters of the communication repair and symbolization abilities of
smaller samples of subjects with severe mental retardation and varying forms of
expressive communication.<P>

The specific aims of the present project are:  1) to investigate the conditions
that affect the development and demonstration of stimulus classes; 2) to
investigate the structure and stability of stimulus classes over time and the
conditions that affect that structure and stability; 3) to investigate the use or
generality of stimulus classes across a variety of language and nonlanguage
tasks; and 4) to study the differences in class development, structure and
stability among people with mental retardation and people who are not.<P>

This project investigates relational learning in subjects with mental
retardation.  Such learning is essential to independent human functioning.  A
hierarchy of three relational discrimination skills will be studied:  arbitrary
matching, arbitrary matching learning set, and emergent arbitrary stimulus (i.e.,
Sidman equivalence).  The first aim is to study arbitrary matching and arbitrary
matching learning set in subjects who are initially unable to acquire arbitrary
relations without highly structured teaching procedures.  The studies will
follow-up on findings that procedures designed to facilitate acquisition of
arbitrary matching by training skill components can be adapted to promote rapid
trial-and-error learning.  This extension of the learning set outcome to
relational discrimination will extend the generality of an important set of
observations that have been made to date primarily with simple discrimination. 
Subjects with varying degrees of retardation will be include to extend earlier
research that indicated a relation between level of retardation and learning set
formation.  The second aim is to investigate "emergent" matching performances in
subjects with low mental ages (MA).  The emergent performances investigated will
be those identified by Sidman and Tail (1982) as indicating that arbitrary
matching relations are relations of meaning, or equivalence relations.  It is
unlikely that many subjects will initially not show these capacities.  The
studies will test the prediction of relational frames theory that the provision
of a history of trained symmetric and transitive performances will be sufficient
to produce emergent symmetry and transitivity.  Such emergent performances have
been considered an integral part of linguistic and symbolic behavior.  Little is
known about the mechanisms of their development, however, perhaps because they
occur so readily in normally developing humans.  The studies are expected to
contribute to an understanding of retardation and its remediation.<P>

The purpose of this project is to investigate the effects of changes in curricula
and teaching strategies that are typically made by special education teachers on
the behavior of students who are severely/multiply handicapped.  Project staff
observe and collect data on the behavior of students and teachers in two
classrooms located at the Research Center.  The teachers and project staff then
discuss the data and decide changes in teaching procedures that may improve
students' academic performance as well as reduce behaviors that interfere with
learning.  Possible changes in teaching procedures include variable such as
curriculum content, lesson format, lesson length, group size, the types of cues
or prompts used, and the consequences for responding or not responding.  Changes
in procedures are then coordinated so that the effect of each change can be
observed without interference from other variables.<P>

The purpose of this project is to implement a consumer-responsive statewide
program of technology-related assistance for Kansans with disabilities.  Through
the leadership of the Kansas University Affiliated Program at Parsons, the
program will enhance and expand assistive technology services throughout the
state by emphasizing consumer participation in all phases of the project and by
increasing cooperation and sharing of resources and responsibilities between
public and private agencies and organizations which provide services related to
assistive technology.<P>

Consumers have identified goals in the areas of service delivery, funding and
access to assistive devices, training and technical assistance, and public
awareness.  The service delivery goal has two objectives:  1) the development and
implementation of a centralized information and referral system; and 2) the
development of six Regional Assistive Technology Centers that can provide
exemplary services related to assessment, acquisition and maintenance of devices,
advocacy, peer counseling, training, information, referral and follow-up.  The
Consumer Committee selected the T. M. Murrell Assistive Technology Center at the
Capper Foundation, Topeka, KS, as the agency responsible for developing and
maintaining the statewide Assistive Technology Information and Referral Center. 
The workscope of the Regional Centers will be determined during the fall of 1993
and requests for proposals will be sent to agencies and organizations across the
state.<P>

Through the funding and access goal the project will develop the capacity of
agencies and private providers to assist in financing assistive technology
devices and services.  The Kansas Association of Centers for Independent Living
has received a subcontract from the project for establishing a funding Task
Force, completing a policy and barrier analysis, reviewing existing funding
avenues used in other states, and establishing innovative funding options for
purchasing equipment for persons with disabilities.<P>

To increase access to assistive technology devices the consumers strongly
recommend that a statewide loan bank be established to allow individuals to try
devices before purchasing them and to borrow equipment during emergencies or
while completing funding arrangements to purchase equipment.  The Consumer
Committee recommended that Occupational Center of Central, Kansas, Salina, KS,
receive the subcontract to develop and implement the statewide Assistive Device
Loan Bank and a related Consumer/User Network.<P>

Most of the project's training and technical assistance activities will be
focused on preparing individuals in each region to develop and implement training
activities tailored to meet the needs of their region.  The project will conduct
an annual assistive technology training institute for the regional center staff,
board members and other interested people.  The regional centers will provide
ongoing training and follow-up activities for people with disabilities, their
families and representatives.  Families Together, Inc., Topeka, KS, was selected
to coordinate an annual statewide conference to "show case" assistive technology
in Kansas and to focus statewide attention on the issues and concerns of
consumers regarding assistive technology devices and services.<P>

Through the project's public awareness activities information about assistive
technology devices and their effectiveness at increasing independence of people
with disabilities will be directed toward:  consumers, their families, and
representatives; public agencies and private entities who are in a position to
facilitate the acquisition and use of assistive technology devices and services;
individuals who make policies and regulations which affect availability of
assistive technology; and the members of the business community.<P>

This project proposes to increase awareness of the value and feasibility of the
application on nontraditional community-based living strategies for all Kansans
with disabilities.  This will be accomplished through the development of Living
in Kansas . . . Experiences of Kansans with Disabilities, a 30-40 page
publication highlighting the strengths and contributions of Kansans with
disabilities along with the innovative strategies and resources that provide
community support.<P>

Living in Kansas . . . Experiences of Kansans with Disabilities will be developed
with persons with disabilities, their families, and those individuals who support
them.  2,000 copies of this publication will be distributed to Kansas consumers,
policy-makers, and service providers.  An evaluation of the publication's impact
will be made.<P>

This project proposes to identify and analyze student and ecological setting
variables that serve to facilitate or hinder transition of students with severe
behavior disorders into general/less restrictive educational settings.  To
identify these variables project staff will conduct a series of studies that
investigate the setting events critical to the transition process.  First, the
school records of approximately 200 students (14-21 years old) enrolled in
regular and special education classes will be reviewed to identify their current
placements and obtain demographic information and other permanent record data
thought to be related to successful transition.  Semi-structured interviews will
be conducted with a smaller sample (100) of these students and their special and
regular education teachers and parents to obtain additional current information
regarding their educational status, teacher, student, and parent perceptions of
barriers to transition, and the social networks of students.  Next, 50 of these
students will be followed over the remaining years of the grant to document
changes in their educational placements and variables associated with their
transitions.  Finally, a more comprehensive study involving a sample of these
students is proposed which will measure a variety of student, teacher, and
educational setting variables.  The relationship of these variables to students'
educational placement and teacher-related adjustment will be analyzed.  The
proposed research will provide a data base to guide future transition research,
begin the process of identifying the variables that influence the outcomes of the
transition process, and identify the influence of personal and ecological factors
in the transition of these students.<P>

This project will utilize full inclusion innovative models and best practices to
improve and expand opportunities for placement of students with severe
disabilities including those with dual sensory impairments in neighborhood
regular education classrooms.  Target participants include inservice
professionals in regular and special education, parents, and related service
personnel who are engaged in or planning for the full inclusion into the regular
education classroom in a neighborhood school, students with severe disabilities,
including those with dual sensory impairments.  Specifically, the goals of the
proposed project include the development, implementation, validation, and
dissemination of an inservice training approach and a set of multi-media training
materials that support professionals engaged in developing full inclusion
efforts.  The training modules will focus on development of the knowledge and
skills necessary to implement educational programs which have the following full
inclusion process elements:  1) support for a student placement in neighborhood
school regular classroom; 2) dual ownership (regular and special education) of
students regardless of academic and adaptive functioning; 3) increased
opportunities for integration and social interactions with nondisabled peers; 4)
collaboration and cooperation among parents, regular, special, and related
service personnel; 5) infusion of regular and special education methodologies;
and 6) increased independent functioning and greater acceptance and appreciation
of the individual within the community.<P>

Project TaCTICS is designed to meet two critical needs in Kansas, the need for
inservice training for infant and toddler specialists and the need for the
development of replicable curriculum and training materials.  The training
content and subsequent materials consist of six replicable, interacting modules
that include print materials, team activities, resources for additional
information and follow-up implementation activities.  The modules are:  Teamwork,
Communication Development, Communication Assessment, Community Collaboration,
Communication Intervention, and Augmentative Systems.  Training occurs over eight
months and includes two, three-day workshops, conference calls, onsite
visitations and, where possible, ITV seminars.  Teams of family members,
communication specialists, and community service providers are selected annually
in collaboration with KDHE.<P>

The general classroom management strategies often used by teachers in classrooms
for children with severe behavior disorders may be used to increase or decrease
the course of interactions between teachers and children.  We will conduct a
series of studies in the first year and a half of the project to study this
potential.  Based on the results of this project, a series of educational modules
will be developed to train teachers through an inservice program, "The use of
classroom strategies to enhance the positive interactions between students and
teachers."<P>

Children with severe behavior disorders (SBD) may engage in inappropriate
behavior to delay, escape or avoid the aversiveness of academic instruction and
teachers may avoid interacting with or instructing children who have high rates
of disturbing behavior.  The purpose of this project is to identify potential
aversive stimuli that can occur within instructional interactions between
students with SBD and their teachers.  Curriculum-based measurement procedures
will be employed to assess the appropriateness of academic materials used in
classrooms for students with SBD.  Direct observation and experimental studies
will be conducted to identify student escape and avoidance motivated behavior
associated with academic materials and teacher-student interactions, as well as
teacher escape and avoidance motivated behavior.<P>

<h3>ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR KANSANS PROJECT (ATK)</h3>
<ul>
<li> Purpose:  The Assistive Technology for Kansans Project helps  find ways to
help persons with disabilities live and work as independently as possible through
assistive devices.  The Assistive Technology for Kansans Project helps citizens of all
ages (and with any type disability) make a difference in how they live and work.

    Assistive technology makes things easier for people without disabilities.  For people
with disabilities, assistive technology makes things possible.  Assistive technology can
be anything that helps improve daily living and working capabilities of people of all
ages (and with any type of disability) at play, at home, at work and in school.  Assistive
devices include braille printers, computer-based communication systems, electronic
page turners, power wheelchairs, talking books, talking calculators, telephone devices
for persons with hearing impairments, plus hundreds of other devices large and small,
simple and complicated.  Assistive technology can be as simple as a door opener or
special handles for knives and forks, or as complex as a computer that understands
human voice commands.<p>  
  
<h4>Who uses Assistive Technology</h4>
     Older Kansans in every community use simple technology to open doors and
turn on lights, to perform household and gardening tasks, to dress and prepare food
without depending on someone else, and to visit friends and relatives on their own. 
Assistive Technology helps older Kansans remain self-sufficient.  A working-age
person who has a disability may need work-technology to improve the work
environment or to make a work place more accessible.  A cordless telephone, computer
head mouse, or extension device can help a person with a disability perform otherwise
difficult or impossible tasks.  A child with a disability who is near school age  might
benefit from adapted writing devices or a communication system.  Even infants and
toddlers can benefit from switch-adapted toys so they learn from new play
opportunities.<p>

     The Assistive Technology for Kansans Project includes an information and
referral system to disseminate information and provide assistance for persons who can
use assistive devices to help them live more independently.   The Assistive Technology for Kansas Project will also help find
ways for persons with disabilities finance the purchase of assistive devices though a
component associated with the Kansas Association of Centers for Independent Living
in Topeka.  The Occupational Center of Central Kansas in Salina has a subcontract to
operate a statewide assistive technology equipment loan bank. <p>

     Part of the project will include making more Kansans aware of assistive devices
and how to get them.  Information will be prepared for families, public agencies,
individuals and businessmen to inform them of the project and what assistive
technology might do for them.<p>

     The Assistive Technology for Kansans Project includes five regional technology
access sites across the state.  These sites provide information about devices and services,
connect technology users in the area, and assist technology users in obtaining funding.   <p>

     To reach the access site in your area:
Call 1-800-KAN-DO-IT (1-800-526-3648). Money 
was set aside to establish five regional access sites.  The money was seed money to get
the sites in operation.  The regional access sites represent the special interests of persons
with disabilities in the region to be served, regardless of age, the nature of their
disabilities or the level of their income.  Each regional access site has an advisory board. 
Majority membership on the boards are individuals with disabilities or members of
their families.  Each regional access maintains consistent hours in a place convenient to
the public.  Each site is linked by computer with other components of the Assistive
Technology for Kansans project.  The regional access sites respond to requests for
services within 24 hours.  Data are kept to document that the site is helping improve
the lives of persons with disabilities.  Information from the sites is available in
accessible formats, Braille, audiotapes, and large print.  At least one person from each site attends a week-long
summer training session on assistive technology somewhere in the state.  Staff at the
regional access sites make local presentations to inform the public and potential
technology users about the project and the services provided.<p>

<H3>R3 Assistive Technology Skills Training for Consumers with Psychiatric Disabilities. </H3>
<p>In this project, the goal is to design an assistive technology intervention for use by ILCs and programs and consumers that will combine psychiatric rehabilitation techniques with the concepts and philosophy of independent living.  The intervention will incorporate state-of-the-art, computer-generated assistive technology now being used in psychiatric rehabilitation.  This intervention will be designed through consultation with experts from the field of psychiatric rehabilitation, as well as extensive input from consumer consultants.  It will be field-tested with consumers, and the results of this test will be used to modify the proposed intervention package.</p>

<H3>R1 IL Needs Assessment for Underserved Populations.</H3>
<P>This project is to: 1) develop an effective means of identifying needs individuals with disabilities from underserved populations, and 2) identify these priority needs. The RTC/IL used the Consumer Concerns Report Method (CCRM) which rates the importance of and satisfaction with key needs or issues.  This method substantially involves consumer participation throughout the process.  Three conferences (one each for mental retardation, head injury, and psychiatric disability) were conducted in which the issues from the CCRM were discussed in detail.  The results were used by the consumers to make an impact on their services through improved advocacy, and by the RTC/IL to disseminate needs information and set priorities for future projects.
<h4>ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS</h4>
<P>Three conference reports and a summary are now available. Three monographs on underserved populations and independent living will be available in March 1996.

<H3>R2 Consumer Control Adoption.</H3>
<p>Consumer control is viewed by the field of independent living as the heart of independent living, because it is the critical component that gives an individual the personal authority to manage their own destiny.  However, consumer control is not widely used in services to underserved populations.  It is restricted because of beliefs that individuals with certain disabilities cannot make good decisions or that the service agency might become liable if an individual makes the wrong decision.</p>
<p>The RTC/IL had previously developed a self-contained consumer control training package that was designed to enable consumers to control decisions that affected them and also examine their lives and develop new independent living plans.  Consumers were an integral part of the project and were involved in content validation, project direction, acting for video training tapes, and final testing.  The goal of the project is to use content which is valid and develop additional accommodations so that the pack
age can be used effectively by underserved populations.</p>

<H3>R4 Service Accommodation for Consumers with Cognitive and Intellectual Disabilities.</H3>
<p>For ILC staff to effectively expand the range of consumers that they serve to include people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities often requires new service delivery strategies and interpersonal communication skills.  This project, designed to identify service accommodation techniques for serving people with cognitive disabilities, will be conducted in two parts.  First, project staff will conduct an evaluation of an innovative program designed to provide independent living services to individuals with traumatic head injuries through a process of consumer controlled case management.  One of the most promising innovative designs that will be used involves the Kansas Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid Waiver program that is one of several national Medicaid pilot projects. Secondly, a separate consumer survey and series of focus groups will be used to identify problem solving strategies or accommodations that can be used by ILC and program staff to provide effective services to individuals with head injuries.  This information and information obtained from the Medicaid wavier evaluation will be used to develop an intervention package for IL services.</p>

<H3>R5 Effective Outreach for Underserved Populations.</H3>
<p>R5 is designed to deal with the overall problem of outreach to underserved and culturally diverse populations, and it is not scheduled to start until Year 4.  However, a pilot project has been designed that will enhance R5 by identifying culturally sensitive and effective outreach strategies for Mexican American and Latino populations.  It will also provide a common method for identifying effective outreach strategies for other populations.  Mexican American and Latino RTC/IL staff have become increasingly aware of issues facing their culture.  As a result, they designed a pilot project to: 1) identify how to reach Mexican Americans and Latino consumers with information about independent living services; 2) how to effectively involve them in service provision; and 3) how to provide ongoing involvement and services.  This pilot project will involve consumers and staff from the Latino population who will guide the project.</p>

<H3>R6  Facilitating Effective Meeting Skills for Underserved IL Populations. </H3>

<p>This project is designed to provide an empirical analysis of the effects of board training specifically designed for underserved ILC populations, with initial attention on people with traumatic brain injury.  The project hypothesis is that, with training, consumers from underserved populations will increase their skills and effectiveness in advocating for and setting ILC policy.  This training will be accomplished through Leadership Development Training which consists of:  1) effective meeting skill training, and 2) learning to recruit and maintain natural supports, assistance, and guidance from facilitators such as mentors.  It is anticipated that with this training package, consumers from typically underserved populations can become directly involved in influencing policy through involvement with committees and boards, which will result in improved outcomes for themselves and their peers.</p>

<H3>R8 Accommodations for Training Consumers with Head Injuries to Set Goals and Achieve Them.</H3>
<p>Persons with acquired head injuries (HI) con often find themselves at a disadvantage in the goal setting process. Historically, service providers rather than the consumers, have played a large role in the goal-setting  process.  This may prove to be a deterrent for the consumer to have "ownership" in the selected goal.  This research project is developing methods for consumers with head injuries to have maximum input into their goal-setting process.  This project will be directed towards VR clients with acquired head injuries and their counselors.  It is anticipated that the consumers with HI will develop better goal setting skills as a result of the training program.  Furthermore, the consumers will be able to use these skills to develop and reach new IL and vocational goals.</p>

<H3>R9 Understanding Psychiatric Disabilitiy and Reducing Stigma.</H3> 

<p>The stigma attached to psychiatric disabilities arises from fear of the unknown.  This fear is reinforced by many myths and general public misconceptions that surround people with psychiatric disabilities and distance them from the mainstream of society; myths about danger, unpredictability, and self-induced symptoms.  Those who become mentally ill are permanently labeled by their illness, shunned by others, and hampered in finding suitable
employment and decent housing.  As has been found with other disabilities, a less stigmatizing and more accepting environment will increase relative functioning and quality of life for people with mental illness.  To increase understanding and reduce stigma, it is important to begin by accessing the people who are most likely to encounter people with psychiatric disabilities in their daily work and to educate them about the potential symptoms, as well as causes, course, and treatment, of mental illness.  T
hrough knowledge and understanding, false beliefs and stereotypes may be challenged and dispelled.  The aim of this project is to foster more amenable social, work, and living climates for people with psychiatric disabilities by creating, testing, and disseminating training programs and
ancillary materials geared toward the staff of independent living centers and uniformed public servants such as police officers, public transportation operators, fire fighters, and emergency medical technicians.  For example, plans to produce a series of professionally-produced public service announcements (PSAs) are now underway.  These PSAs will then become the focus of the above-mentioned training project.  In addition, based on the results from the third consumer conference, an empowerment package will
 be produced that will assist consumers (or other interested parties) in informing media personnel about negative stereotypes and positive portrayals of people with psychiatric
disabilities.</p>

<H3>R10 Refinement of the Consumer Concerns Report Method for Assessing Priority Needs of Underserved and Culturally Diverse Populations.</H3>
<p>One of the major challenges of providing services to underserved populations is that of identifying their unique needs.  The purpose of this proposed project is to develop an effective and functional needs assessment process that is easy to use and is consumer centered.  The Concerns Report Method has been found to be an effective tool for assessing consumer concerns, identifying community problems, setting community priorities, and developing consensus for community action.  The Concerns Report Method was used to identify the unique needs of underserved populations in our previous R1 project.  This project was successful; however, we found that underserved and culturally diverse consumers have concerns that extend beyond the issues in the original Concerns Report Method.</p>
<h4>ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS</h4>
<P>A  valid and reliable method of assessing the independent living service needs of the three primary underserved and culturally diverse populations.
<P>A  product for statewide independent living councils, independent living centers and programs, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and Rehabilitation Services Administration planners to design services for underserved and culturally diverse populations.
<P>The involvement of consumer-empowered teams to explore issues, design options, develop products, and evaluate the relevance and usefulness of those products for underserved and culturally diverse populations.

<P>This research and training project focuses on advocacy and the art of letter writing.  ILCs were surveyed to find what advocacy issues personally concerned consumers.  The RTC/IL also asked the ILCs to provide the research staff and a consumer team with exemplar advocacy letters that resolved personal advocacy issues.  Research staff, IL service providers, and consumers did an analysis of what is an effective letter format for an advocacy letter.  As a result, a training manual was developed.  It contains a step-by-step process of formatting the letter, pertinent advocacy issues, and an appendix on disability rights and contacts for more information.  This pilot manual has been reviewed by advocates with disabilities and the project was empirically tested with consumers.  From the information of the research results and the advocates, the book is currently being refined.</h4>

<h3>Information Seeking Skills.</h3>

<P>The objective of this project is to develop and test training materials that consumers can use to become aware of personal disability concerns ; and how to find, organize, and use the acquired information from service providers to benefit the consumer's needs. Consumers and service providers will serve as consultants to identify content areas and suitable instructional formats.

<p><B>The Research and Training Center on Independent Living (RTC/IL) was 
established in 1980 through a grant from the National Institute on 
Disabilities and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR).</B>

<p><B>The RTC/IL Mission:  To enable people with disabilities to control 
their lives and live independently through product research and development 
that facilitates the work of independent living centers (ILCs), consumer 
organizations, and policy makers.  Consumer empowered teams determine the 
need and provide input for research and development over the course of each 
project. The Center expanded its services in 1993 
to "underserved" populations - groups of people with disabilities 
whose independent living needs are not being addressed.  
Outreach to underserved populations is a priority.</B>

<P><B>These groups include:

<ul> 
<li>People with chronic psychiatric disabilities 
<li>People with acquired brain injury 
<li>People with cognitive and intellectual disabilities 
<li>People from culturally diverse backgrounds with disabilities
</B></ul>

<H3>Participatory Action Research</H3>
<p><b>	Consumers are actively involved in various research and training 
projects through consumer empowered teams.  In the teams, consumers play 
key roles in identifying needs, developing innovative interventions, 
ensuring product relevance and utility, and dissemination.</b></p>

<H3><BLINK><img src="green.gif"> <a href=rog1.htm> Research 
Projects</a></BLINK></H3> <p><b>Research projects address issues such as 
reducing myths and stigma about disability; board training skills; 
community education about disability; prevention of secondary conditions 
resulting from disability; consumer control for underserved populations; 
and effective outreach. </b></p>

<H3><BLINK><img src="red.gif"><a href=tog1.htm> Training Projects</a></BLINK></H3>

<p><b>The RTC/IL believes strongly in applying the findings of its research 
in ways that will be of maximum benefit to people with disabilities.  For 
example, results of accessible parking studies have been used to encourage 
state legislatures in Kansas, Minnesota, New York, and other states to 
enact tougher accessible parking enforcement laws. </b></p>

<H3>Training and Technical Assistance</H3>

<p><b>Training and technical assistance are regularly provided to many of 
the 450 independent living centers in the United States. 161 service 
programs have been developed. More than 4,000 service providers have been 
trained. <EM>The RTC/IL currently offers training and technical assistance in consumer control, advocacy, concerns report method, board training for persons with cognitive 
disabilities.</EM> More than 750,000 copies of research, training, and informational 
materials have been disseminated.   The Center's most widely disseminated 
product is <a href="write.htm"><I>Guidelines for Reporting and Writing about People with

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>RTC/IL For Underserved Populations: New Product List</H1>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Building Consumer Consensus on Independent Living (R164)</H3>

<P>Youngbauer, J. (1995). Proceedings of the Tenth Annual International
Conference on Technology and Disability. Los Angeles, CA: California State
University Northridge - Center on Disabilities. [$1.35 + $1.00] Recent
surveys show that less than 5% of consumers with mental retardation, brain
injury, and psychiatric disabilities access services from Independent Living
Centers (Jones, Petty, Boles, &amp; Mathews, 1988). The Concerns Report
was used with each underserved population to identify concerns, rank needs,
and set action agendas to build ILC capacity. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>New Models For Inclusion of Individuals With Mental Retardation
Within Research and University Affiliated Programs. (R162)</H3>

<P>Budde, James. University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS: RTC/IL for Underserved
Populations. [$3.30 + $1.50] This paper is a first in that it provides
a comprehensive text that begins with philosophies and current views and
then goes on to provide procedures for effectively including consumers
with mental retardation. Strengths and weaknesses of various inclusion
models are discussed and the RTC/IL Consumer Empowered Team Model is presented
along with various member roles. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Model Policy: Board of Directors Working at the Policy
Level. (R166) </H3>

<P>Budde, James.University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS: RTC/IL for Underserved
Populations. [$1.35 + $1.00] The purpose of this model policy is to provide
a sample document that can be used by any agency with a board of directors
that sets policy that will be used to build and direct centers that serve
consumers. The document provides a sample policy and then continues on
to explain the policy in more detail. Practical examples are also provided.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Concerns Report</H3>

<H3>1. Needs Conference For Underserved Consumers With Mental Retardation.(M45C)</H3>

<P>Younbauer, J. G., &amp; Budde, J. (1994) (The Research and Training
Center on Independent Living, Rep. No. 1). Lawrence, KS: University of
Kansas, Schiefelbusch Life Span Institute. [ $3.50 + $1.50] In order to
determine the independent living needs of people with mental retardation
and to determine how best to identify the needs of that population, a consensus
conference was held in Lawrence, KS. Consumer-consultants (N=26) from throughout
the state of Kansas who are receiving services from county mental retardation
centers, state vocational rehabilitation services, or other community agencies
and could serve as consumer-consultants (aka key informants) were invited
to participate. The consumer-consultants were paid a consulting fee and
they and their assistant's travel expenses were reimbursed.</P>

<P>The Concerns Report Method (CRM) was used by the consumer-consultants
to: (1) identify key independent living issues, (2) rate their satisfaction
with their community's response to those issues, and (3) determine the
feasibility of using the CRM to identify the needs of underserved populations.
A focus panel of consumer-consultants reviewed the CRM index and CRM survey
found that of the 47 items, 28 were not considered important, 11 were viewed
as community strenghts, and 8 were identified as needs. In additon to identifying
community strengths and specifying needs, the consumer-consultants discussed
options, and proposed possible solutions to implemment in their communities.
</P>

<P>The consumer-consultants were also asked to prioritize the priorities
of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities
(1993 Teleconference) and state their own concerns. Simultaneously in another
room, service staff, assistants, and family members of the consumer-consultants
were also asked to prioritize these same priorities and state their views.
Similar issues were found among the President's Committee, consumer-consultants,
and service providers and family members. However, differences were found
in the assignment of priorities to those same issues across groups. This
discrepancy in rankings across advocates at the policy level, service providers
and family, and consumers merits further study of how these needs might
be viewed, reconciled, and addressed.</P>

<P>While the results suggest that the CRM was an apropriate instrument
and that consumers could participate effectively with some support, simplifying
the rating scales and re-wording some questions to be more relevant to
consumers with mental retardation are warranted. Because persons from all
sectors in society may have a disability, and the presence of one disability
does not preclude the presence of others, questions about services or needs
must be inclusive of all persons, particularly those from underserved populations
and culturally diverse backgrounds.</P>

<P>Topics suggested for further research include personal relationships
and marriage because as independent living opportunities become more available
and more persons with mental retardation live independently, issues of
sexuality, marriage, and family relations will become key concerns.</P>

<H3>2. Needs Conference for Underserved Consumers with Traumatic Brain
Injury. (M45B)</H3>

<P>Needs Conference for Underserved Consumers with Traumatic Brain Injry.
Younbauer, J. G., Williams, J., &amp; Mathews, R. M. (1994) (The Research
and Training Center on Independent Living, Rep. No. 2). Lawrence, KS: University
of Kansas, Schiefelbusch Life Span Institute. [ $3.50 + $1.50] The Concerns
Report Method was used with consumers with brain injuries to identify independent
living concerns, rank needs, and develop action agendas. The Concerns Report
Method was followed and new items relevant to brain injury were added to
the concerns report index (database) and a book written and edited by brain
injury survivors was started to dispel misunderstanding and mythology about
brain injury, but from a humorous perspective. </P>

<H3>3. Needs Conference for Underserved Consumers with Psychiatric Disabilities.</H3>

<P>Snyder, J., Temple, L., Youngbauer, J. G., O'Neil, T. &amp; Cromwell,
R. (1995). (Research and Training Center on Independent Living, Rep. No.

<BODY>
<P>I am very interested in conducting applied behavioral community research on socially significant issues that people with disabilities face in their daily lives.  This consumer- involved research and applicable training focuses on environmental change and personal skills enhancement to promote independence and increase overall quality of life for people with disabilities.</P>  
<p>
<UL>
<LH>My research interests are in the following areas:</LH>
<LI>prevention and management of secondary conditions;</LI>
<LI>teaching people with disabilities to self-advocate for community change regarding their disability concerns;</LI>
<LI>teaching people with acquired head injuries to set personal goals to increase their independence;</LI>
<LI>and, in general....applied community behavior analysis.</LI>
</UL>
</p>
<p>While I serve as part of the management team for the Research and Training Center on Independent Living, I also serve as the Director, and Faculty Advisor of the Research Group on Rehabilitation and Independent Living (RGRIL).  The RGRIL team consists of doctoral students who have been admitted to the University of Kansas for an advanced degree in Developmental Psychology with a research emphasis in the area of rehabilitation and independent living.

<H3>T1 Consumer Control Training for Underserved Populations.</H3>
<p>Consumer control is the heart of independent living which enables consumers to pursue their goals and make
decisions about their future.  A consumer control training package was developed and tested by the RTC/IL.  It is now being disseminated.  However, it has not been modified for use with underserved populations.

The purpose of this project is to provide training based on the R2 Consumer Control Adoption project after it is completed.  Once the accommodations are developed, or modifications made, for the self-contained consumer control training package, this training project will be used to disseminate knowledge through various methods. These methods include scheduled training of trainers, technical assistance, conference workshops and
presentations, and academic training.</p>

<H3>T2  Assistive Technology for  with Psychiatric Disabilities:  Training ILC and Program Staff.</H3>
<p>A considerable body of research has demonstrated that people with severe and persistent mental illness experience deficits in their ability to attend to and process information.  Attempts to remediate these deficits often results not only in improved attention to and processing of information, but often lead to improvements in social, cognitive, and behavioral realms as well.  ILC staff could benefit from training in techniques developed
and designed to improve consumers' attention and cognitive processing of information.  Training in these areas will lead to improvement in consumers' ability to live independently and gain maximum benefit from IL services. Specifically, this training package will assist IL centers in implementing the assistive technology intervention designed in R3 - Assistive Technology Skills Training for Consumers with Psychiatric Disabilities.  Participants in the
training will be educated concerning the nature of attention and information processing deficits in people with psychiatric disabilities and how these deficits affect consumers' ability to benefit from IL services.</p>

<H3>T9 Training for Understanding Psychiatric Disabilities and Reducing Stigma.</H3>

<p>Public servants such as police officers, fire fighters and emergency medical technicians, and helpers such as staff of ILC's may encounter persons with severe mental illness.  With additional education, these workers can acquire concepts and skills that may help them cope with and understand the plight of persons with psychiatric disabilities. Increased understanding and acceptance of mental illness by professional helpers is important in furthering the independent living goals of individuals with psychiatric disabilities.  The purpose of this project is to provide training for both ILC and program staff and uniformed public servants that will reduce stigma by challenging the myths and misconceptions about mental illness. Specifically, this training package will assist ILC and programs in implementing the intervention designed in R9 - Understanding Psychiatric Disability and Stigma Reduction. Objectives of the project include providing education and training regarding psychiatric disabilities, associated behaviors, and cognitive differences, as well as ways to interact helpfully with people with psychiatric disabilities who need assistance.  This training will revolve around the videotaped public service announcements to be developed and tested in Project R9.  In addition, a consumer  empowerment package will be produced that will provide consumers with the necessary information and materials to alert media personnel to negative and stereotypic portrayals of people with psychiatric disabilities.</p>

<H3>MD1 Underserved Populations and Independent Living Monographs.</H3>

<p>The goal of this project is to provide state-of-the-art information about the three primary underserved populations (i.e., mental retardation, head injury, and psychiatric
disability).  Three monographs are being produced and each uses a format that includes:  1) the problem from the consumers' perspective; 2) common definitions and diagnosis; 3) state and federal funding agencies; 4) common problems; and 5) innovative approaches to providing independent living services.  Each monograph will be produced in professional quality softcover book form, NIDRR will be referenced for their funding and leadership and consumer consultants will be acknowledged for their contributions.  The monographs will be widely disseminated by providing complimentary copies through announcements of
availability, and the<U>RTC/IL Catolog</U>  of products.</p>

<H3>MD3 Geodemographic Mapping of Disability Prevalence in Culturally Diverse Populations.</H3>

<p>In the most recent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, each state has 
been instructed to create a statewide independent living council for 
planning and identifying progress toward improving independent living and 
rehabilitation services. To make informed decisions, these state councils 
need current and accurate information about disability prevalence within 
their state.  States have been further mandated to insure that their IL 
services are provided to people with disabilities from all cultural and 
ethnic backgrounds.  Much of this information is currently available by 
analyzing information from United States census data.  This project is 
designed to summarize census data on disability and ethnicity.  County 
level summary information will be prepared for each state, each RSA 
designated federal region, and on a national level.  Data will be 
summarized for the entire population of people with disabilities and 
separately by ethnic groups.  This information will provide statewide IL 
councils with county by county prevalence data in both tabular form 
(i.e., readable by computer spreadsheet programs) and geodemographic maps.

<H3>MD4 Myth-Understanding Head Injury.</H3>

<p>The purpose of MD4 is to collect stories from consumers to develop an anthology of consumer folklore that can be used to promote a positive understanding of individuals with a head injury.  Consumers and their loved ones will be integrally involved as authors, interviewers, and editors.  This information will be integrated into a book that provides: 1) a
real life perspective on common events that follow a head injury (e.g., awakening in a hospital, adapting to physical and cognitive challenges, being cared for by medical staff or family members, and having others assume or presume to make for you); 2) a real life/experiential definition of head injury with comparisons to accepted definitions; and 3) humorous, but successful, examples of how consumers with head injury live independently.  The book will be produced in a professional quality format for use by ILCs, consumers, and consumer organizations.  In addition, the information will be used to plan and develop other, more direct, public information products.  This will include scripts for public service
announcements, brochures, and scripts for consumers to make presentations to various community groups.</p>

<h1><center>Katherine Froehlich, M.A., Research Assistant
for the Research and Training Center on Independent Living for
Underserved Populations (RTC/IL)</center></h1>
<p>
Ms. Froehlich received her BA in Psychology and
 American Literature at the George Washington 
University in Washington, DC.  After receiving
 her undergraduate degree, Ms. Froehlich spent
 a year focusing on health issues of persons
 with disabilities at the National Center 
for Medical Rehabilitation Research in the
 National Institute for Child Health and 
Human Development at the National Institutes
 of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  Ms. 
Froehlich left this position in order to 
obtain a graduate degree in the Department
 of Human Development and Family Life at the
 University of Kansas.  Since that time, she
 has received a MA in Developmental and Child 
Psychology from KU and continues working toward 
fulfilling requirements of the doctoral program.  
</p>
<p>
Ms. Froehlich's research interests are to
 increase the independence of persons with
 disabilities.  She has joined the Research
 Group on Rehabilitation and Independent Living
 (RGRIL) to enhance her understanding and
 practice of the research skills needed to be
 most effective in addressing the issues facing
 persons living with disabilities.  Since
 arriving at KU, Ms. Froehlich has become
 actively involved as a graduate research 
assistant at the Research and Training Center
 on Independent Living for Underserved 
Populations.  This has allowed Ms. Froehlich
 to work on many exciting projects which 
include:   developing and testing of a 
training manual for individuals who experience
 cognitive disabilities to become effective
 members of working groups, task forces, or
 community boards;  developing and
 disseminating materials to prevent secondary
 conditions; determining effective outreach
 practices of Independent Living Centers in 
contacting traditionally unserved and 
underserved populations; developing a 
training manual to include youth with 
disabilities as volunteers in community
 service agencies; and developing and
 assessing outcomes of a survey that looks at
 the experiences of spouses of persons with
 spinal cord injury and the positive factors
 that make these relationships successful.
  Ms. Froehlich hopes to soon expand her
 research endeavors to include initiatives
 in health promotion for people with 
disabilities.

<h1><center>Richard T. Gutierrez, Graduate Research Assistant, 
Research and Training Center on Independent Living on 
Underserved Populations (RTC/IL)</center></h1>
<p>I'm a graduate student of Human Development at the University of Kansas focusing on community development and disability studies. While working at the Research and Training Center on Independent Living and working with RGRIL my goal is to develop an expertise that not only helps builds inclusive communities but in the process empowers people with disabilities to control their own lives. Currently my work involves working with brain injured consumers learning to serve on community boards and studying the effects of a volunteer enforced handicapped parking program in a major city. I'm also involved in health promotion studies to prevent secondary disabilities, as well as working on projects to help professionals better outreach and deliver services to culturally diverse populations. I am keenly interested in participant action research and the potential it may offer science for developing more socially valid models of training and service delivery to persons with disabilities, particularly Hispanic and Latinos populations. While many in the disability movement know that opportunities and rights must be sought and fought for daily, many Hispanic and Latinos have limited opportunities and don't always know their rights or are timid about engaging authority and exercising their rights. I come from a migrant farmworker background and know the level of disconnect affecting many people living with limited economic and educational resources or little social support or guidance to foster success.  Therefore, my interests in advocacy are rooted in my ethnicity, disability and a commitment to service. From a professional development level, I am interested in the role ILCs play in the quality of life of people with disabilities; community health promotion efforts and service integration; sociol policy formation; and the development, implementation and evaluation of program interventions. The RTC/IL and RGRIL offers a unique setting for studying applied and academic goals and gaining very valuable  experience.

<p>
PERSONAL BIODATA FOR DOT NARY.
My  BA in English Literature/Creative Writing is from Rhode Island College and, among other work, I have spent the last nine years doing  peer counseling, systems advocacy and program direction at several ILCs in upstate New York.  Projects in which I have been involved include facilitation of a role-play group in which ILC consumers educated the community regarding disability issues; and development of a program to provide independent living services to residents of public housing developments on site.  I co-founded and co-chaired the Health Care Reform Subcommittee of  the Association of  Independent Living Centers in New York (AILCNY) and I have also done community outreach for a  of adults with cerebral palsy and aging at SUNY Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY.
My research interests focus on the broad range of health issues of people with disabilities--including health promotion; prevention of secondary conditions;  barriers to accessing health care services; aging and disability; health care reform from a disability perspective; and health issues of women with disabilities.  Presently, I am involved in several projects with the RGRIL--including the secondary condition booklet series; an interactive computer program on secondary conditions for people with SCI; and a computerized goal-setting program for people with TBI.  My goal is to acquire excellent research skills in order to design and test behavioral interventions, possibly in a  public health framework, that will address barriers to optimal health that prevent many people with disabilities from achieving their full potential and enjoying a high quality of life.

<h1><center>Julie Steward, M.S. Project Coordinator and Research Assistant for the Research and Training Center on Independent Living for Underserved Populations  (RTC/IL)
</center>
</h1>

<p>Julie Steward is a doctoral student in the Developmental and Child Psychology Program at the University of Kansas.  She came into this program with a BS degree in Psychology and an MS degree in Rehabilitation Counseling that was earned while attending Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas.  Her Research interests involve mitigating influences that inhibit individuals' abilities to live independently.  These have primarily involved studying correlates of secondary conditions of disability (such as joint problems, chronic fatigue, pressure sores, and sleep disturbances) and developing intervention resources that will contribute to an intervention program to be implemented within Independent Living Centers.  Ms. Steward has had the opportunity to work with a couple of grant funded projects that concern secondary conditions and is currently serving as a research assistant and Project Coordinator for one of these grants.  She hopes to continue to contribute to the secondary conditions research studies at the University of Kansas.  In addition, Ms. Steward experiences a form of muscular dystrophy and is well acquainted with disability from a personal standpoint and has demonstrated advocacy skills.  Ms. Steward's most recent advocacy project involved a systematic approach to obtain accessible transportation combining the Social Security PASS program and Vocational Rehabilitation services to equip her minivan with a Digi-Drive II joystick control system.

<h3>RALPH L. SMITH CENTER (SMITH)</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Purpose:  To provide interdisciplinary research facilities
 in at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, KS.<p>

<li>	Location: 39th at Rainbow, Kansas City, KS 66160-7336<p>

<li>	Director: Paul Cheney, Ph.D.<p>

<li>	Contact: Chris Lawrence<p>

<li>     FAX:  (913) 5885677<p>
</ul>
	The Ralph L. Smith Research Center at KUMC is in two buildings
 on the KUMC campus.  These buildings are part of the MRRC and KUAP
 components of the LSI.  The two adjacent buildings were constructed
 in 1972 and dedicated to research on mental retardation and developmental
 disabilities.  One features laboratories and animal care facilities
 designed and equipped to support biological research.  This building
 is a six-story structure occupied by MRRC investigators, with some space
 shared in common use.  The second of the dedicated buildings is a
 three-story structure designed and equipped to support behavioral and
 hearing research.<p>  

     These buildings contain modern, attractive research space and provide
 an environment highly conducive to interaction among the scientists they
 house.  Twenty-three MRRC scientists have laboratory space in these
 buildings.  Multi-user facilities include walk-in coolers and freezers,
 histology and tissue processing laboratory, tissue culture laboratories,
 animal care unit, conference rooms and computer facility.  Major equipment
 resources cover a large range of high cost units such as radioactivity
 counters, high/ultra speed centrifuges, microtomes, ultratomes, and
 microcomputers.

<title>Doctoral Program in Child Language</title>
<h1>Doctoral Program in Child Language</h1>

The University of Kansas offers a specialized Ph. D. in Child Language focusing on the interdisciplinary academic preparation and research training of child-language specialists.  The faculty represent a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of language acquisition, social and environmental influences on language acquisition, and the identification and remediation of atypical patterns of language acquisition.  Students in Child Language have available to them a rich variety of research tools and data-bases.  They draw upon well-established research facilities and field sites in pursuing their own research.  Seminars in child language, a weekly Proseminar, workshops on special issues in language acquisition and intervention, and research practica are regularly offered by university faculty and visiting scholars.  Students study four areas:
<ul>
<li>Core theoretical and experimental work on language acquisition
<li>Relevant methods and theories in linguistics and psycholinguistics
<li>Theoretical perspectives on developmental psychology
<li>The nature of disordered language development and methods and techniques for language intervention.
</ul>
<p>

The faculty of the Child Language Doctoral Program is drawn from the departments of Human Development and Family Life, Linguistics, Psychology, and Speech-Language-Hearing:  Sciences and Disorders.  Additional instructional, research, and clinical experiences are provided by the Institute for Life Span Studies.  Research sites and practica are provided by the Institute for Life Span Studies, the Language Acquisition Preschool, and the clinical and research facilities of the Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic.     In addition to research assistantships provided by grants to individual faculty members and Self, Honors, and Dissertation Fellowships provided by the Graduate School,  students in Child Language are also eligible for traineeships in <a:href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/clang/dcd.htm">Language Impairments</a> across the Life Span provided by the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders and in Early Childhood <a href="http://www.lsi.ukans.edu/clang/edux.htm">Language Intervention<a> provided by the U.

<title>Children's Project</title>


<h3>JUNIPER GARDENS CHILDREN'S PROJECT</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Purpose:  To conduct professional research within
 a community environment over a range of problems associated
 with developmental disabilties and children from inner city environments.<p>

<li>	Location:  1614 Washington Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66012<p>

<li>	Director:  Charles R. Greenwood, Ph.D.<p>

<li>	Contact:  Betty Smith<p>

<li>	Telephone:  (913) 621 1712<p>
<li>    FAX: (913) 371 8522<p>

</ul>
	The JGCP was started in 1964 and has maintained a continuous
 program of research related to poverty and its effects on children
 in innercity Kansas City, Kansas.  The project investigators conduct
 research on the risks associated with poverty and develops interventions
 commensurate to these risks.  The project has grown over the years from
 a small, community-based research project housed in the basement of a
 liquor store to an environment that includes several community sites,
 multiple projects, and multiple investigators.  The project has been
 cited by the President's Committee on Mental Retardation as a successful
 example of a university program operating in a community environment. 
 Current projects include a multi-university, multi-disciplinary study of
 substance abuse.<p>

<H1>Attachments in Pegasus Mail</H1>
<HR>
<P>Because of lack of definitions and adherence to standards in the world of mail exchange, problems sometimes arise when receiving attachments from other mail systems.  For example, attachments are frequently folded into the e-mail message itself and show up as gibberish characters at the end of the message.  Under this circumstance, you may or may not be informed that the message has an attachment.  Pegasus can usually manage to get the file that has been sent if you know what to try.
</P>

<P>WINDOWS P-MAIL DETACHMENT</P>
<P>Having the message open, click on the READER menu.  Choose SPECIAL, then UUDECODE MESSAGE.  Give Pegasus a file name and location in which to save the extracted message.
</P>
<P>DOS P-MAIL DETACHMENT</P>

<P>In the folder browser (e.g., be in your Main folder) highlight the message.  Do not open it.  Choose the OTHER option and then UUDECODE.  Give Pegasus a file name and location in which to save the extracted message.

	The mission of the Kansas MRRC is to foster research on mental
 retardation and developmental disabilities.  The research includes
 both behavioral and biomedical investigations.  A primary goal of
 the Kansas MRRC is to be a catalyst for overcoming barriers in establishing
 multidisciplinary research on problems of mental retardation
 and developmental disabilities.  The Kansas MRRC is funded primarily
 by a long-term grant from the National Institute of Child Health and
 Human Development.  The central office of the Kansas MRRC provides
 extensive administrative support to funded projects, technical support
 services and program development services to current investigators and
 to new investigators submitting grant applications and undertaking
 research in human disabilities.<p>

E-Mail schroede@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu<P> 
<B>Year MRRC was first funded</B>: 1967<P>
<B>University Affiliation</B>:  University of Kansas<P>
<B>Number of Investigators</B>:  63<P>

	<B>Core Activities</B><P>

	Research and training in the MRRC is carried on under four thematic areas:<P>
	<UL type=circle>
<LI>THEME 1: <A HREF="mrrcth1.htm"> Language, Communication Disorders and Cognition in Mental Retardation</A>
<LI>THEME 2: <A HREF="mrrcth2.htm"> Risk, Intervention and Treatment in Mental Retardation</A>
<LI>THEME 3: <A HREF="mrrcth3.htm"> Neurobiology of Mental Retardation</A>
<LI>THEME 4: <A HREF="mrrcth4.htm"> Cellular and Molecular Biology of Mental Retardation</A>
</UL>

<B>Funding </B><P>

	The  The Kansas Mental Retardation Research Center receives $6 million for 40 projects from external funding from federal and private resources.  Federal resources include: The National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Education, and U.S. Army.  Foundations sources includes the Childrens Televeision Workshop.<P>

<B>Project Activities</B><P>

	1.	Research into the causes and prevention of destructive behavior.  Destructive behavior, i.e. aggression and self-injury, is a serious problem for 150,000 - 200,000 persons with severe developmental disabilities.  It is expensive and time-consuming to treat, and it may cause serious physical injury or death.  Behavioral researchers at the Kansas MRRC have developed precise methods for identifying stimuli that lead to destructive behavior and techniques to alter these stimuli.  Animal researchers on this project have also identified biological risk factors that affect neuro-transmitters in the brain and cause destructive behavior.  Furthermore, research shows that specific types of behavioral training can selectively alter key neurockemical functions and help recovery from neuronal damage related to destructive behavior.<P>
	2.     Research on skills crucial for development of communication among people with mental retardation.  Kansas MRRC researchers have found that some crucial skills are: 1) the rate at which children add new words to the expressive vocabulary they use in their natural home settings; 2) mastery of distal gestures; 3) understanding the concept of equivalence; 4) ability to instruct oneself; 5) social skills necessary for positive interpersonal relationships.  Other Kansas researchers are working on genetic influences related to speech- language impairments in children.  A third area is language changes during aging.  The University of Kansas MRRC is a national leader in research on speech, language, and communication.<P>
	3.	Research into the neurobiology of memory.  Kansas MRRC scientists have cloned the NMDA receptor.  This receptor is a cell surface molecule that may play a key role in learning, memory, and mental retardation.  The cell is also implicated in neurodegeneration and stroke-related brain cell death.  If these results are replicated, they would present a break-through in our understanding one of the core deficits of people with mental retardation.<P>
	4.	Cellular and molecular biology of early development.  It has been estimated by the National Center for Health Statistics that more than 250,000 infants are born in this country each year with abnormalities incurred during fetal development.  A large portion of these abnormalities may be due to disruptions of the normal sequence of events that occur during early fetal development.  For example, cerebral palsy, traditionally accepted as a consequence of a faulty delivery at birth, is now known to result from disorders that occur much earlier.  Similarly, Down Syndrome is though to be related to development of a faulty ovum prior to fertilization.  From its inception, the Kansas MRRC has conducted investigations into the multitude of factors that impinge upon a high quality pregnancy, and has developed techniques in molecular and cellular biology, and immunology to address these specific problems in development.<P>

	<TITLE>Language, Commun. Disorders &Cognition in Mental Retardation </TITLE>


<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP  SRC="MRLOGO.GIF"> </CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>THEME 1:  LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION DISORDERS AND COGNITION
	IN MENTAL RETARDATION</H2></CENTER>

<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>

	
	The ability to communicate is a source of empowerment for humans.  At the same time, it is well known that individuals with mental retardation are very likely to have limited communication skills.  This limitation touches all aspects of their lives, from their earliest social experiences with their caretakers, to their academic experiences in school, and to their opportunities for independent living as adults.  If individuals with mental retardation are to be prepared for lives of adult independence, we must understand the nature of communication limitations and impairments, and how to intervene in these deficits.<P>

	Funded investigation of language impairments of individuals with mental retardation has been underway continuously at the Kansas MRDDRC for more than thirty years.  The first Program Project on this topic was funded in 1963 (P01 HD00870, Language of the Mentally Retarded).  Over the next 18 years, this project supported the application of behavior analysis research technology to a wide range of issues associated with language development in persons with mental retardation, including:  the acquisition of generative language classes; procedures for audiologic assessment of difficult-to-test persons; procedures for effective articulation therapy for individuals previously excluded from speech therapy; and, of course, effective procedures for facilitating language acquisition by persons with mental retardation, involving highly structured, as well as more naturalistic or incidental strategies.

<CENTER><H2>THEME 2:  RISK, INTERVENTION, AND PREVENTION 
IN MENTAL RETARDATION </H2></CENTER>


<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>

	Most children classified as mentally retarded or learning disabled are not described by clearly identifiable syndromes, nor do their developmental disabilities have known etiologies.  Further, many are not diagnosed until well into their preschool or early elementary school years.  Early identification of marker characteristics that predispose children to retardation and disability permit environmental intervention to reduce or prevent eventual developmental delay.  For some children, the primary factors that produce retardation and developmental delay can be found in their environments, those not sufficiently facilitative of normal progress.  For still other children, the interaction of organismically-based variables and environmental  variables also result in retarded or seriously delayed development.  These variables, organismic and environmental, that contribute to retardation and delay are termed "risk factors" in development.  Research to identify and to control (intervene, mitigate, and prevent) risk factors and the adverse outcomes of mental retardation are the aims of this theme.  <P>

<CENTER><H2>THEME 3:  NEUROBIOLOGY OF MENTAL RETARDATION </H2></CENTER>


<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>

	The Neurobiology of Mental Retardation theme covers work in two areas (subthemes) that are particularly high in relevance to mental retardation and developmental disabilities:  1) Neurodevelopment and Plasticity, and 2) Mechanisms of Brain Damage.  In addition, we hope to build a new area of emphasis within this theme focusing on motor function of the brain and impairments of motor function associated with MR/DD.<P>

	Work within our Center addresses several aspects of neurodevelopment and plasticity as detailed for specific projects in the pages to follow.  Our research program draws upon a range of methodologies from molecular genetics (Fechtel and Osterbur) to neurophysiological studies in infants (Karrer).  The projects address several major issues in the field of neurodevelopment and plasticity including:<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Trophic factors in axon guidance, synapse formation and maintenance (Werle, Smith)
	<LI>Effects of sensory deprivation on development of neuronal circuits (Berman)
	<LI>Genetic regulation of neuronal development (Fechtel, Osterbur)
	<LI>Molecular mechanism of neural tube defects (Fechtel, Osterbur)
	<LI>Developmental neuronal plasticity following injury (Smith)
	<LI>Functional integration of transplanted neuronal tissue (Radel)
	<LI>Dopamine receptors in schizophrenia (Levant)
	<LI>Timing and extent of infant cognitive processes (Karrer)
</UL>
	The second major Neurobiology subtheme focuses on "Neurochemical Mechanisms of Brain Damage". Major issues in the brain injury field being addressed by this research group include:
<UL>
	<LI>Identification of mechanisms of neuronal death following deafferentation (Durham)
	<LI>Role of ROS in neuronal injury from seizures (Pazdernik, Samson)
	<LI>Mechanisms of intracellular Ca++ regulation and role in Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome 	(M. Michaelis)
	<LI>Neurotoxic mechanisms in globoid cell leukodystrophy (LeVine)
	<LI>Role of ROS in myelin damage associated with multiple scerlosis (LeVine)
	<LI>Neurotoxicity and the role of NMDA receptors and free radicals (E. Michaelis
	<LI>Oxidative stress in disruption of neuronal Ca2+ regulation (M. Michaelis)

<CENTER><H2>THEME 4:  CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF EARLY DEVELOPMENT </H2></CENTER>


<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>


	The interaction of a sperm with an egg marks the dividing line between life and death.  If this interaction is successful, fertilization occurs.  The synchronized development of the fertilized egg (embryo) and differentiation of the uterus to the receptive state are essential to the process of implantation, the process by which first physical and physiological contacts between the embryo and the mother are established.  This process leads to placentation and establishment of pregnancy.  The events from the time of fertilization to the term during pregnancy is a potentially risky journey.  Any disturbance during this journey can result in abnormal fetal development and the birth of a child with developmental disabilities.

	From its inception, the Early Development Team scientists in our center set as a major goal to examine early events in development to build a knowledge base of strategies for the prevention of mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.  They have been addressing the multitude of factors that may impinge upon the stability of a pregnancy by using state-of-the art techniques in molecular and cellular biology as well as immunology.  It has been known for some time that abnormal development of gametes, or immunologic and/or endocrinologic imbalances during early embryo development, are important determinants for developmental disabilities.  However, unraveling the mechanisms involved has proved to be an exciting challenge.

Cochlear transduction processes convert sound into neurologic events.  Many of these processes are disrupted as a result of hearing loss.  A clinical assessment procedure which quantifies these transduction processes will be important for identifying and describing the hearing losses associated with mental retardation.  A more complete description of hearing loss will lead to new improvements in remediation strategies.<P>

The results from this investigation should play a valuable role in characterizing the language learning capabilities of children with developmental language learning impairments.  Most children with mental retardation have delays in the acquisition of speech and language.  A subset of these children, most notably many of those with Down Syndrome, have deficits in language learning that are greater than what can be anticipated by their cognitive, motor, or sensory disabilities.  In the view of an increasingly large number of investigators, these children have specific language impairments.  Recent research (Fey, Long, & Cleave, 1994) has shown that children who fall in the borderline range of intelligence (based on a nonverbal intelligence test) have grammatical systems that are not unlike those of children with nonverbal intelligence scores falling no more than one standard deviation below the mean.  Furthermore, these children responded to a program of grammar facilitation in a manner not unlike the children with average or above-average intelligence.  Similar investigations have been carried out by other investigators with children who are mentally retarded with similar results.  Therefore, in the broadest sense, our current NIDCD-funded research program is designed to help us to learn whether there are qualitative differences in the speech and language development of typical children, children with conventionally defined specific language impairments, and children with more pervasive developmental delays.  Identifying the similarities and differences between the linguistic problems of children in these groups will help us to better understand the nature of specific and non-specific language impairments in a number of different clinical populations and also will be useful in the study of language as a part of or as distinct from other forms of human cognition.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>

The relationship of this project to mental retardation and developmental disorders is of potential importance in understanding communication disorders.  The primary focus of this project is to investigate mechanisms of directional hearing that depend upon binaural disparities and monaural spectral cues.  Psychophysical and physiological studies suggest that much of the neural representation of the auditory environment has a directional component.  In depth studies of directional mechanisms in the auditory system provide insights into 'normal' auditory processes.  Once the normal mechanisms of representation have been described, it will be possible to explore the effects of sensory deprivation and enrichment of the functional development of the auditory system.  The proposal does not include objectives related to development, but this is an area that will be explored in the future.  A better understanding of the plasticity of developmental processes in the auditory system could provide cues regarding communication disorders, and possible therapeutic strategies.<P>

This research will provide valuable data regarding the nature and occurrence of elderspeak, a simplified speech register targeted at older adults,  and empirically test the hypothesis that elderspeak facilitates older adults' comprehension. It will distinguish among speech accommodations triggered by (negative) stereotypes of older adults as cognitively impaired and those triggered by the perceived communication needs of older adults.  It will systematically evaluate alone and in combination whether specific speech parameters actually enhance communication with older adults.  Consequently, it will be possible to devise teaching models or other interventions for medical personnel, service providers, and other caregivers in order to enhance older adults' comprehension during conversational interactions.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>

A fundamental question in gerontology is whether impairments seen in old age result from an accelerated loss of abilities across the life span or a diminished capacity present in youth.  The Nuns Study was originally designed by Dr. David Snowdon, now of the University of Kentucky, to investigate the hypothesis that cognitive disabilities in old age are largely explained by diminished mental capacity present at youth.  He also hypothesized that diminished mental capacity in youth is reflected decades later in a reduced brain reserve (i.e., lower weight of brain, smaller number of large neurons, and a lower density of synapses).  This reduced brain reserve is the hypothesized mechanism linking early life cognitive ability to late life cognitive disabilities such as Alzheimers disease.<P>

Specification of the morphosyntactic limitations of children with SLI can lead to the development of more accurate ways of identifying children with language impairments.  These new clinical assessment tools will have considerable significance for the identification and description of the language impairments of individuals with mental retardation. Such information is essential to the development of effective intervention plans.<P>

The proposed research will directly involve children and youth with severe mental retardation in both descriptive and experimental intervention studies.  The results of these studies will contribute to our knowledge base regarding the development of symbolic language abilities by individuals with severe mental retardation.  These studies will also produce data about the efficacy of a replicable set of treatment procedures, and the subject characteristics and treatment variables associated with success of these procedures in helping individuals with severe mental retardation develop symbolic communication abilities.<P>

Severity of retardation is highly correlated with the severity of language or communication deficits.  Classes play pivotal roles in communication, both in affecting whether communication is likely to occur and the ease with which it occurs.  Class sharing by listener and speaker is one important factor affecting how positive a relationship is or may become.  Class sharing refers to the overlap in the composition of classes of referents.  Classes are completely shared when, for example, the class of "things to do in one's free time" for one person is identical to that of another.  Long-term positive relationships are often based on sharing of this class.  A partially shared class could be "things to eat for dinner" when one speaker is a vegetarian and the other is not.  Partially shared classes often set the occasion for discussion or negotiation.  Unshared classes, such as "things women should wear in public" in discussions between persons of differing religious beliefs, may lead to arguments and even hostility.  Thus, size and content of our classes have considerable relevance for the effortfulness and effectiveness of our communication.  If certain classes are useful to communication and other classes are not useful or impede communication, then it is imperative that we know how to insure that certain classes develop while being able to insure that certain other classes do not develop.  The current proposal is directed toward determining how to insure that classes that we want to develop are developed quickly and reliably, and how to insure that classes we do not want to develop do not occur.  The current research focuses principally on equivalence classes among arbitrary stimuli because language involves many such classes.  <P>

The result of this research may be a reasonably brief and practical teaching program that gives people with mental retardation a new, generalized skill at the kind of self-instruction that renders an entire class of otherwise and previously insoluble visual-matching problems soluble, and easily generalizable to a wide variety of settings.  If so, that will justify the development of analogous teaching programs to develop similarly generalized self-instructional skills aimed at somewhat different abilities. If they too can be made that effective, then their joint application to people with retardation may result in an accumulation of improved cognitive skills.  If the target abilities are chosen carefully, their integration may represent a substantial advance in cognitive ability for its students - an advance that may be expanded further and further toward the independent problem-solving of people without retardation.<P>

An understanding of positive relationships between people and how to produce positive relationships has enormous theoretical and applied significance.  What a positive relationship is, and even whether it can be clearly defined, are matters of considerable debate.  Nevertheless, understanding ways to enhance positive relationships between people offers the possibility of substantially enhancing people's communicative abilities, improving family and other interactions, achieving more effective teaching, and reducing a variety of aberrant behaviors.  These issues are particularly critical for people with mental retardation because they have greater difficulties in these areas.<P>

It is estimated that as many as 8 to 10 million people world wide and 1 million people in the United States are infected with HIV-1.  It is projected that this level may increase 10 times into the 21st century.  Over 300,000 cases of AIDS have been reported world wide with half of them coming from North America.  In the United States, the AIDS case rate is 12.6 per 100,000 population (Blattner, 1991).  It is now clear that HIV not only produces a severe immune deficiency with associated opportunistic infections but it also infects the brain and leads to debilitating dementia in about 60% of those infected.  Neuronal injury from HIV is not limited to adults.  Pediatric AIDS has emerged as a major clinical problem in children.  These children are usually infected at birth and suffer serious neuro-developmental impairment as a result of HIV infection.  The most common sighs of HIV related disease in children are developmental delay, cognitive impairment, poor brain growth and corticospinal tract signs.<P>
The broad objective of this project is to develop a more complete understanding of HIV neuropathogenesis using SIV infection in rhesus macaques as a model.  SIV infection in rhesus monkeys is currently the best animal model of HIV infection in humans.  SIV disease in monkeys manifests in all the same ways as HIV in humans.  Information obtained from this work should contribute to the development of more effective therapeutic methods.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
The present project seeks to investigate measures of early attention that have been shown to be sensitive predictors of intellectual function in later childhood.  By further refining these measures, we may be able to successfully screen individuals for retardation very early in life.  Furthermore, by further understanding the processes that underlie the sensitivity of these measures to later intellectual function, we will gain insight into the biobehavioral bases of the development of such function, as well as be able to design interventions that directly access such function through those underlying processes.<P>

It is expected that infants with possible mental retardation will be placed in non-maternal care prior to evaluation.  Because non-maternal care is considered a risk factor in development, this project will provide important information about the possible adverse effects of non-maternal care on the development of typically developing infants.  This information will ultimately result in better understanding of the caregiving needs of families with infants with retardation.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Alcoholism is a serious condition that leads to abnormal fetal development and mental retardation.  Glutamate and calcium are involved in many of the actions of alcohol on the brain during embryogenesis and fetal development.  In particular, fetal exposure in utero to alcohol consumed by the mother leads to abnormal migration of neurons in various brain regions and to the appearance of varying degrees of mental retardation or learning disabilities in the children that suffer from fetal alcohol effects.  Our laboratories were the first to study and identify two potentially very important targets for the effects of ethanol, the glutamate receptor system in neuronal membranes and the calcium transport carriers, the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system.  In tact receptor systems are needed to receive signal that regulate neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, and intact Ca2+ transport systems are required for normal responses of neurons during migration and synaptogenesis.<P>

Pediatric AIDS.  This project has the potential for revealing mechanisms to protect the nervous system from the ravages of HIV and the severe disability it causes to children.  It is estimated that as many as 8 to 10 million people world wide and 1 million people in the United States are infected with HIV 1.  It is projected that this level may increase 10 times into the 21st century.  Over 300,000 cases of AIDS have been reported world wide with half of them coming from North America.  In the United States, the AIDS case rate is 12.6 per 100,000 population (Blattner, 1991).  It is now clear that HIV not only produces a severe immune deficiency with associated opportunistic infections but it also infects the brain and leads to debilitating dementia in about 60% of those infected.  Neuronal injury from HIV is not limited to adults.  Pediatric AIDS has emerged as a major clinical problem in children.  These children are usually infected at birth and suffer serious neuro developmental impairment as a result of HIV infection.  The most common signs of HIV related disease in children are developmental delay, cognitive impairment, poor brain growth and corticospinal tract signs.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Many individuals with severe or profound retardation engage in some form of stereotypy.  Stereotypy, or repetitious and apparently nonfunctional behavior (Baumeister & Forehand, 1971; LaGrow & Repp, 1984), is estimated to occur in approximately one-third (Dura, Mulick, & Rasnake, 1987) to two-thirds (Berkson & Davenport, 1962; Kaufman & Levitt, 1965) of all institutionalized persons with severe retardation.  Subsequent reductions in the census of many institutions, through community placement of higher functioning individuals, may make these proportions under reflect the situation today.  Stereotyped behavior may take a variety of forms including body rocking, spinning of self, waving or flapping the hands or arms, running and hopping, complex finger movements, clapping, manipulation of objects, tapping or slapping themselves or objects, mouthing, and repetitive verbal behavior (LaGrow & Repp, 1984).  Self injury, such as eye poking, body hitting, and lip biting also may be stereotypic (Carr, 1977).<P>  
	Stereotypic behavior may constitute a major portion of some individual's repertoires.  Repp and Barton (1980) reported that observations of stereotypy ranged as high as 47% of the time and Tippet (1994) reports that some individuals were engaged in stereotypy above 90% of the time during waking hours.  While most forms of stereotypy may not have the immediate destructive effects as some forms of self-injury or aggression, clearly stereotypy can interfere with acquisition of new skills, performance of important routines, and acceptance of the individual by persons without disability, particularly when it constitutes such a high proportion of the individual's behavior.  Thus, stereotyped behavior merits serious attention by those who would promote integration and independence among persons with severe and profound retardation.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
CAB is a major barrier to community placement of institutionalized persons with retardation.  Indeed, their CAB probably will keep them institutionalized, despite effective programming of other community-living skills (Intagliata & Willer, 1982).  CAB is difficult to eliminate.  It is often targeted by applied researchers; that has produced a multitude of treatment programs, most of which either punish CAB or reinforce its alternatives (cf. reviews by Pace, Iwata, Edwards, & McGosh, 1986; Iwata, 1987).  Punishments have ranged from reprimands (e.g., O'Leary, Kaufman, Kass, & Drabman, 1970), time-out (e.g., Baer, Rowbury, & Baer, 1973; Foxx & Shapiro, 1978), overcorrection (e.g., Foxx & Azrin, 1973; Matson & Stevens, 1977), to physical punishment (e.g., Dorsey, Iwata, Ong, & McSween, 1980; Lovaas & Simmons, 1969).  Reinforcement alternatives have strengthened behavior presumably incompatible with CAB (cf. Bostow & Bailey, 1969; Deitz & Repp, 1974; Ragain & Ansom, 1976).  Probably the most successful treatment of CAB has been to first determine its function through testing in analog situations (Functional Analysis) and let that analysis direct treatment (e.g., Carr & Durand, 1985; Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, & Richman, 1982).  Almost all these treatments reduce CAB, but that reduction rarely is complete, durable, or approximately generalized beyond the treatment setting, especially if its functions are not determined in the natural setting.  In particular, punishment often creates resistance by the punished person; that resistance will often be seen as yet another form of CAB to be punished in turn.  Thus demands for other solutions have arisen, often in the name of ethics and public policy (e.g., Turnbull, 1986).  <P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Twenty six to 50% of individuals with mental retardation receive a psychotropic drug to reduce aberrant behaviors.  Research has shown wide variability in the effectiveness of psychotropic drugs in reducing aberrant behavior, and has provided little information on the behavioral selectivity when reductions are obtained.  This research is directly relevant to mental retardation as it studies the side effects of psychotropic drugs prescribed to individuals with retardation.  Objective, quantifiable information on the behavioral selectivity of drug therapy for chronic aberrant behavior is important to clinical decision making.  With knowledge of cognitive side effects, the dose and class of drug may be selected to optimize adaptive behavior while reducing aberrant behavior to acceptable levels.  A second reason to evaluate behavioral selectivity is to advance scientific knowledge of drug mechanisms and of the causes of the aberrant behavior.  The clinical efficacy of a drug class is often used to test neurochemical hypotheses on the cause of the aberrant behavior.  The interpretation of such a test depends critically on the behavioral selectivity of the effect of the drug trial.<P>

The proposed studies should not only be useful in estimating which drugs currently used to reduce the frequencies of aberrant behaviors in persons with retardation are effective in doing so at doses that do not impair learning (i.e., have behavioral selectivity as aberrant behavior antagonists), and the extent to which different causes (e.g., microencephaly, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, multifactorially inherited disorders) of the retardation affect such behavioral selectivity, but also provide support for the effectiveness of novel behavioral therapies in reversing the magnitude of retardation and the risk that aberrant behavior will be manifested.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Maternal diabetes is a major cause for fetal loss, congenital abnormalities and the appearance of neurological and learning dysfunctions in the newborn and young child. The severity of mental dysfunction is directly related to the control of diabetes in the mother, being noted most frequently in mothers who have had repeated episodes of acetonuria. The development of a monitoring system will provide significant protection against  wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels and may eventually be coupled to a pump system leading to an artificial pancreas.<P>

The placenta regulates passage to some detree of drugs, nutrients, hormones, and other substances between the maternal and fetal compartments, and has a significant endocrine function in pregnancy.  Alterations in these processes can lead to disturbances in the fetal compartment which may subsequently result in growth and developmental problems.  This study aims to established an <I>In Vitro</I> placental barrier model that can provide insights on the cellular mechanisms through which drugs of abuse interact with the placental barrier and influence delivery substances into the fetal compartment.  Such a model also has potential for testing and developing new therapeutic strategies to control and limit fetal compartment exposre to drugs of abuse, toxins, and bacterial and viral vectors.<P>

This project is not only relevant to general issues concerning the organization and function of the brain and descending systems in the control of movement, but it also has direct relevance to issues concerning recovery of motor function following brain injury.  An important source of motor disability related to developmental brain injury is cerebral palsy. Each year 10,000 individuals are born with cerebral palsy, and nationwide, cerebral palsy affects more than 700,000 people (American Occupational Therapy Association).  Skillful movements are an important component of our daily activities and the loss of such movements represents a serious impairment for individuals with movement disabilities.  The work in this project will provide a foundation for understanding mechanisms underlying recovery of motor function in primates following brain injury.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Neuronal cell death in the central nervous system (CNS) likely plays a major role in the etiology of mental retardation.  Because neurons are post-mitotic, CNS neurons that die cannot be replaced by activation of a "stem cell" population.  Therefore, preventing cell death is the most effective method for ameliorating the damage caused by death of neurons that subserve specific functions.  In this proposal we will be studying the specific cellular events that occur during cell death in the CNS, with the long-term goal of preventing cell death by interrupting those deleterious events.  Enhancing our ability to prevent neuronal cell death will very likely result in a major decrease in the the incidence of mental retardation.  In addition, it has long been known that the developing nervous system is more susceptible to damage resulting from abberent sensory input than the adult.  We will be investigating specific factors underlying those age differences, which should allow us to predict what factors are important for normal brain development in humans.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Neural tube defects contribute greatly to fetal loss, stillbirth, and physical and mental handicapping conditions.  These defects are known to have genetic and environmental risk factors that manifest during the early stages of development as primary neural lesions and result in the failure of the neural tube to close, among other significant developmental defects.  Using a Drosophila model system, we study a set of genes that are essential for the correct partitioning of ectodermal cells into the neural and epidermal lineages.  We believe that the acquisition of improper cell fates within the developing vertebrate embryo may be a causal factor in the etiology of neural tube defects and are conducting a study in Drosophila to identify and characterize genetic loci that play a crucial role in this process.  The homeobox genes of Drosophila  are conserved and expanded to four gene clusters in vertebrates and their role of specifying positional information has been conserved but rather than determining the fate of the entire body plan, as is found in the fly, these genes exert a more limited role in specification of the nervous system, limb  generation, etc. in vertebrates.  This dramatic conservation throughout animal evolution argues strongly for determining the molecular basis of neural development in simple animal models and then investigating those mechanisms that are conserved in higher animals.  To date, multiple homologues of Notch and Delta have been identified in mouse, rat, Xenopus, and humans and the demonstration that their role in cell fate specification has also been conserved has been shown in the mouse.  We are testing this neural developmental paradigm in new project prompted by our recognition of the similarities between the Drosophila neurogenic mutants and the pathologies associated with human neural tube defects

This project is relevant to mental retardation research because neuroleptic drugs are one of the primary treatment modalities for mentally retarded individuals.  Often the drugs are prescribed chronically for indefinitely long periods of time. Consequently, adverse side effects emerging after days, months or years of treatment are a very serious problem in this population. In addition, the quantitative behavioral assessment technologies developed with rats in this project have considerable promise for application in mentally retarded populations where drug side effects may often be confused with the symptoms targeted for treatment.<P>

The study of cognitive development of infants that develop various levels of mental retardation (i.e., the Down syndrome infant) is crucial to the design of effective early intervention strategies.  The present studies of brain electrical activity will contribute to our understanding of the functional development of cortical systems involved in infant information processing and cognition.  The information obtained will specifically add to the understanding of the neurobehavioral processes underlying the cognitive development of Down syndrome infants. <P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Although considerable research has been done that has presented many reasons for slowness, there is still no accepted explanation of slowness or the characteristics of motor control in the mentally retarded, and particularly DS. Similarly, while the brain's MRP are widely accepted to be related to the initiation of voluntary movement there is little understanding of how the characteristics of the MRP are related to characteristics of normal or pathological movement.  This laboratory has been trying to understand both of these problems with the assumption that the study of the MRP during the acquisition and control of voluntary movement in the mentally retarded will provide specific understanding of the neural basis of motor preparation characteristics of the retarded individual with DS.  The information obtained will contribute to the conceptualization of training interventions as well as recreational resources for the DS and retarded individual.  Thus, the information will allow more precise design of interventions for impaired performance leading to improved employment and recreational possibilities.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Considerable evidence supports the classification of schizophrenia as a developmental disorder. Genetic, prenatal and perinatal factors have been linked with the development of schizophrenia. Certain neurobehavioral abnormalities have been found to be associated with infants and children at high risk for developing schizophrenia. Additional predictive factors, such as attentional deficits and linguistic deficits are detected in this group in adolescence. Although, the typical onset of schizophrenia symptoms in early adulthood suggests as association of this disorder with the maturation of the central nervous system, childhood-onset schizophrenia (onset before age 14) is also observed in some individuals. This project examines the role of the recently cloned D3 dopamine receptor in the effects of antipsychotic drugs and the suitability of this receptor as a therapeutic target. These studies should provide insight into the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs and the underlying pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Seizures and the consequent neuronal damage are a common pathology associated with various syndromes that lead to mental retardation.  Although the mechanisms for the initiation of the seizures are probably quite diverse, there are some common pathways that lead to neuronal damage following such episodes of seizures.  One of these common pathways involves the release of glutamate from pre-synaptic terminals, the activation of glutamate receptors post-synaptically, the strong depolarization of neurons and the entry of Ca2+ into the neurons, the activation of various enzymes, the formation of arachidonate and the reactive oxygen species, and the oxidative modification of proteins, DNA, and lipids.  This cascade of events may play a very crucial role in the neurodegenerative process associated with seizures.  The research being performed under the sponsorship of this grant is focused on the characterization of the key receptor proteins involved in the initiation of these responses and the possible protection from the formation of free radicals.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
An increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to occur under a number of conditions that may be involved in the pathogenesis of mental retardation, e.g., seizures, hypoxia, ischemia, head trauma, etc.  These pathological events lead to oxidative stress in the brain, a condition in which free radical production exceeds the antioxidant defense mechanisms present in the tissue.  The excess free radicals then attack various lipids and proteins in nerve cell membranes, leading to a reduction in the ability of neurons to regulate free intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent cell death.  Although the relationship between oxidative stress and disruption of intracellular Ca2+ regulation has been demonstrated in many systems, the molecular events leading from production of excess ROS to loss of Ca2+ are not yet understood.  The studies to be caried out in this project are designed to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress actually brings about free radical-induced modifications to neuronal membrane proteins involved in Ca2+ transport into and out of the cells.  Although much of the work deals with the possibility that brain aging is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative modifications to Ca2+ transporting proteins, the very fundamental biochemical studies of the cellular effects of various types of oxidative stresses will have implications for any pathological changes induced in neurons by ROS.  The identification of Ca2+ regulating proteins that are targets for oxidative modifications will provide important basic information about how nerve cells are injured or actually lost under conditions such as seizures, and all too common problem in individuals with developmental disabilities or mental retardation.

These studies center around investigations of neural plasticity during development and the impact such changes have on function.  They are directed at questions relating to the dynamic interactions among neurons which occur during development and after maturity, and how these interactions may be influenced.  An understanding of these issues is fundamental to the study of neurobiology as it relates to mental retardation, and for guiding the application of both preventative and ameliorative interventions.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
While there exist many potential causes of mental retardation, it is clear that injury or malformation of certain neural pathways can be an important factor.  In addition to the deficiency caused directly by the loss of appropriate neural input, it has recently become clear that neuronal populations not directly damaged can undergo dramatic changes in their phenotypic features.  Such changes have the potential to further exacerbate the deficit, or, to facilitate recovery.<P>
	The studies in the present project use structural, neurochemical and functional measures to evaluate a novel and dramatic form of neuroplasticity in which parasympathetic neurons, which are normally inhibitory to smooth muscle contraction, become excitatory in the absence of the normal excitatory input, the sympathetic nerves.  We believe that this system constitutes a useful model for potential changes in central nervous pathways because, i) the basis for this plasticity involves interactions between multiple populations of nerves, as would be expected to occur in the CNS, ii) the nerves and their transmitters are similar to CNS neurons, and iii) unlike the CNS, we are able to directly and specifically manipulate individual populations of neurons and assess a straightforward outcome measure, muscle contraction.<P>
	An understanding of  how function of an intact neuronal population is affected by the loss of other neuronal populations in our model system will provide insight into similar changes that may occur in the CNS neuronal deficits associated with mental retardation, and may elucidate mechanisms that serve to facilitate recovery from CNS impairment.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Central nervous system  injury or malformation are strongly implicated in the etiology of mental retardation.  In both cases therapy and recovery are likely to rely on the formation of new or regenerate pathways to provide appropriate neural input to denervated structures; this requires the presence of cells that will serve to provide guidance cues to insure that the axons achieve the proper trajectory.  Several recent studies provide evidence that guidance cells do exist in the mouse developing  CNS, and that these cells are, in fact, intermediate (or transient) targets.  While the existence of intermediate targets is now generally accepted, very little is know about the nature of these cells or their relationships to the nerves they guide.<P>
	We have developed a model system in which we can induce the formation of a new and atypical sympathetic pathway and study its formation in the postnatal rat.  We believe that this system may provide important general information on the relationship of intermediate target cells in axonal guidance, because the phenotypic features of both the neurons, the pathway cells and their targets are well characterized and can be easily manipulated.  We anticipate that this system will provide important information that can be readily extrapolated to the human CNS to define which features of the intermediate target cells provide the critical cues, and whether the expression of the appropriate phenotype can be induced in the mature organism.

This project addresses mechanisms by which synapses are formed, maintained and eliminated in the central and peripheral nervous system. Synaptogenesis involves complex interactions among neuron, its postsynaptic target, and the matrix of extracellular materials surrounding these entities. Previous work indicates that agrin, a molecule released by the presynaptic neuron, coordinates several important events in synaptogenesis, including the aggregation of neurotransmitter receptors and degradative enzymes on the postsynaptic target membrane, and the formation of specialized postsynaptic apparatus within the target cell. Thus, agrin appears to be critical in the formation of functional synapses, their maintenance, and the elimination of inappropriate synapses that normally occur during development. This project will use the frog neuromuscular junction as a model for elucidating the role of agrin in synaptic dynamics. These studies will provide new and important information on how synaptic connections are formed and maintained and are highly relevant to mental retardation as abnormalities in synaptogenesis during development will certainly result in cognitive impairment, anomalies in agrin production or distribution could directly result in mental retardation.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder that results in death by two years.  The primary site of pathology is myelin in the central nervous system.  This disease results in motor and sensory losses.  This disease is very closely related to mental retardation due to its profound effect on the normal development of the brain in affected individuals.

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>
Abnormalities in the synthesis and processing of a family of proteins in the brain known as 'amyloid precursor proteins' or APP's are associated with the neurodegenerative changes which occur in Alzheimer's Disease (AD).  The amyloid plaque lesions characteristic of AD brain contain large quantities of peptide fragments derived from the larger APP's. These peptide fragments, referred to collectively as Ab peptides, are known to have very toxic effects on neurons in in vitro assay systems.  For this reason the Ab peptides have been implicated by many investigators in the neurodegenerative changes occurring in AD dementia and in the cognitive dysfunction in another condition in which these Ab peptides are produced in excess, namely trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome.  Brain samples from victims of Down's Syndrome who live into adulthood show both of the neuropathological lesions which are hallmarks of AD brain, i. e., the amyloid plaques and 'neurofibrillary tangles' indicative of degenerating neurons and neuritic processes.  These observations suggest that some common neurodegenerative processes are taking place in both disorders.<P>
	The assertion of a relationship between neurodegeneration and Ab peptides in AD and in Down's syndrome is further supported by the fact that, in the human genome, the gene which codes for the APP family is located on the mid-portion of the long arm of chromosome 21.  This is precisely the chromosome that segregates inappropriately in Down's syndrome/trisomy 21 leading to an extra copy of the genes contained in this abnormal fragment of the chromosome.  Consequently, since the APP gene is located within this fragment,  individuals with this disorder have an in increased dosage of the APP gene and thus overproduce the APP proteins. The multiple Ab peptide fragments which are thought to play a role in neurodegeneration are likewise overproduced in these individuals.  Thus fundamental neurobiological studies designed to probe the mechanisms underlying the toxic actions the Ab peptides have on nerve cells are likely to provide new insights into the cellular events associated with the loss of nerve cells occurring in conditions in which the protein is overexpressed such as Down's syndrome/trisomy 21.<P> 
	The goal of the studies in this project is to determine whether the activity of an important Ca2+-regulating protein in neuronal plasma membranes is affected by the presence of the Ab peptides.  Substantial evidence from many other laboratories indicates that the disruption of the cellular regulation of intraneuronal Ca2+ homeostasis plays a role in the neurotoxic actions of Ab, though it is not known which of the several neuronal Ca2+- regulating systems is sensitive to the presence of these peptides.  We are using a primary neuronal cell culture system to determine whether the very important neuronal 
Na+/Ca2+   exchanger system is affected by exposure of the cells to Ab peptides under various conditions.  Information derived from this series of studies will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Ab-induced neurotoxicity regardless of whether the abnormal or excess Ab is due to AD or to overexpression of this protein as occurs in Down's syndrome/trisomy 21.<P>
	The studies in this project fit into the Neurobiology of Mental Retardation Theme within the MRDDRC since the work deals with basic mechanisms of amyloid neurotoxicity and has relevance for the neuropathology observed in Down's syndrome.

Metal ions play important roles in embryonic and fetal development.  Cadmium, a toxic environmental pollutant, exerts embryotoxic and teratogenic effects on the developing embryo, and conversely, deficiencies of zinc, an essential metal, leads to abnormal development and limits reproductive success.  Since metallothionein is likely to play a pivotal role in metal ion metabolism, understanding the regulation and proving the functions of these proteins are important in the context of mental retardation and developmental disabilities.<P>

After synthesis in the nucleus many mRNAs become concentrated at specific sites in the cytoplasm, leading to subsequent localization of their protein products.  Numerous examples of this phenomenon have been recognized in recent years and it is now apparent that mRNA localization plays an important role in this function and differentiation of many cell types including neurons, oligondendrocytes and other cells of the vertebrate brain and nervous system.  We are using Drosophila oogenesis as a model system for studying mechanisms of mRNA localization.  Recent studies indicate that similar factors, e.g., microtubules and microtuble motors, mediate mRNA localization in vertebrate and invertebrates, and thus, it is likely that an understanding of mRNA localization in Drosophila will provide insight into the mechanisms of mRNA localization in higher animals.<P>

The above research projects are aimed at promoting progress in the control and prevention of abnormal development and birth defects, as well as development of new methods of fertility regulation.  It has been estimated by the National Center for Health Statistics that more than 200,000 infants are born each year in this country with abnormalities incurred during embryonic development.  An additional 50,000 newborns suffer from markedly low birth weight, which in many cases result in death or disabilities in later life.  A large portion of these abnormalities may well be due to a disruption in the normal sequence of embryonic and uterine interactions during pregnancy and understanding these interactions is an essential step toward the prevention of abnormalities in early development.<P>

Failure of uterine cells to produce appropriate levels of growth factors might well increase the risk of developmental abnormalities in the embryo.  There is, in fact, evidence that TNF has major influences on cells in the anterior pituitary.  Thus, TNF is one of the factors whose synthesis during embryonic life may well be of the greatest importance to normal development of brain.<P>

The uterus is a complex cellular environment that is continuously targeted by ovarian hormones. Specific responses of the targeted cells are required for normal pregnancy, particularly as regards the quality and range of the growth and factors produced following hormonal stimulation. When uterine-derived growth and differentiation factors are either excessively elevated or reduced, both placentas and embryos are abnormal. These types of abnormalities are strongly associated with interuterine growth retardation (IUGR) and preeclampsia, both of which lead to poor prognostic outcome for the embryos.<P>

Proper development of the placenta is required for fetal growth. For example, small placentas are associated with the pathological condition called "intrauterine growth retardation" (IUGR). In abnormalities that include but are not limited to mental retardation. In later life, the small placenta/small baby syndrome leads to major diseases, particularly of the circulatory system. The HLA genes are expressed in a developmentally predictable manner in the placenta. While it is not yet known what specific roles(s) of each of these genes might be, it is highly likely that expression is related to placental maturation and function.<P>

The above project focuses on the role of ascorbic acid in fetal development and the extent that extremely low or extremely high intakes may impair development of the skeleton and other collagen- containing tissues of the fetus or impair overall fetal development.  Dangers exist if the mother consumes an inadequate amount of ascorbic acid during pregnancy or if she self-prescribes pharmacological doses of the vitamin.  The above research is aimed at understanding the range of safe versus unsafe intakes of ascorbic acid on the fetus, both during in utero development and potential conditioning in utero that may negatively impact growth and development after birth.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>

As organizers of the cytoplasmic protein polymers, microtubules, centrosomes are directly or indirectly involved in numerous cell processes including cell replication, cell migration, inflammation, establishment and maintenance of cell shape, organelle traffic, and secretion. Specifically, centrosomes perform two basic functions:  1) they serve as nucleation sites for microtubules, and 2) they replicate themselves.  Since we know very little of centrosome composition, we understand even less about the mechanisms of nucleation and replication.  Since centrosome function is vital to many basic cell processes, failure of function could lead to numerous developmental abnormalities, including mental retardation.<P>

The placenta provides the physiological interface between mother and fetus and is critically involved in controlling the environment directing the development of the fetus.  Trophoblast cells, the parenchymal cells of the placenta, form the framework of the gestational conduit that delivers resources to the fetus.  Disruptions in the development of trophoblast cells result in retardation in the growth and maturation of the fetus.<P>

The onset of spermatogenesis and the ability of the testis to produce mature sperm capable of fertilization is an obvious hallmark of normal development in animals and humans.  We are studying enzymes pivotal to the regulation of normal sperm motility.  As probes are developed, the temporal appearance and mechanism of action of these proteins in relation to normal males is to be established.<P>

We are attempting to further elucidate factors regulating ovarian function.  The fact that abnormal oocytes may be ovulated leads to increased changes that these defective ova will be fertilized, resulting in developmental abnormalities.  Our studies attempt to elucidate basic mechanisms controlling follicular development and ovulation to understand how abnormal ova are released.  Thus, these basic studies in reproductive biology are related to the quality of the resulting offspring.<P>

<H3>Relevance to Mental Retardation</H3>

The objective of this project is to better understand the normal function and age related changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis - particularly the feedback loops by which prolactin stimulates hypothalamic dopamine neurons and dopamine, in turn, inhibits prolactin secretion.  The goal of this research is to determine if chronic elevated levels of prolactin injures dopamine neurons.  The relevance of this project to mental retardation stems from it focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the actions of prolactin and dopamine.  Subjects with congenital brain malformations and mental retardation frequently have abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary axis function including abnormal basal levels of prolactin secretion and abnormal responses to TRH injection (Kawano and Miyao, 1982; Laron and Galatzer, 1985).  This project might also be relevant to understanding aspects of Rett Syndrome, a progressive disorder in females commencing in infancy and characterized by autistic behavior, gait ataxia, stereotyped movements, seizures and mental retardation.  The pathophysiology of this condition is not understood but one hypothesis is that it is associated with a central dopamine system disorder.  For example, Jellinger et al. (1988) reported decreased prolactin and growth hormone in the pituitary and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase in the hypothalamus.  Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis. Prolactin and beta-endorphin also show abnormal responses to drug challenge in subjects with Rett Syndrome (Facchinetti, et al., 1996) again suggesting an impairment in the dopamine system.  Dopamine system abnormalities have also been implicated as a mechanism underlying self injurous behavior in people with mental retardation.  All of these studies serve to emphasize the potential importance of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the dopamine system and this research project, to understanding abnormal brain development and mental retardation.

Our research generally involves an analysis of the role of proinflammatory cytokines in normal and abnormal pregnancy. Our operating hypothesis is that factors that perturb endocrine-regulated intrauterine cytokine production will negatively influence fetal development.  Examples are obligate intracellular parasites, such as viruses and toxoplasma, drugs and alcohol, heavy metals and endotoxin.  In some cases, the result is abortion; in others it is fetal malformations.  The model that we are using at present to evaluate this hypothesis is endotoxin-induced abortions.<P>

comprehension, and develop strategies to minimize the impact of
such changes.  She has extended this research to examine how
dementia affects older adults' language.  The current focus of
her research is on evaluating the effectiveness of speech in
enhancing older adults' comprehension and retention of
linguistic information.  As a supplement to Dr. Kemper's funding
from the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Virgil Adams has
received funding to investigate speech accommodations by and to
minority elders.</p></h4>

</h4><p>In conjunction with colleagues at the University of Kentucky,
Dr. Kemper is also investigating predictors of cognitive
function and physical function in late life among a population
of nuns, members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame.  The goal
of this research is to determine whether early life abilities,
as reflected in autobiographies written by the nuns as young
women, affect functioning in late life.</p></h4>

</h4><p>Dr. Mary Lee Hummert is principal investigator of a five-year
grant from the National Institute on Aging to study stereotypes
of the elderly and communication.  This research is designed to
identify the nature of stereotypes of the elderly found in
different age groups, including elders themselves, as well as
the ways in which stereotypes are related to communication
styles used with older adults.  A particular focus of the
research is on identifying behavioral, physical, and
environmental cues that trigger negative stereotyping of elders
and patronizing forms of speech.</p></h4>

</UL>The first extensive and cooperative KU program to conduct research and
provide research-based service programs for persons with disabilities began in
the mid 1950's when KU and Parsons State Hospital and Training Center were
awarded a Federal research grant to study the communications problems of children
with mental retardation. It was an experimental environment where a group of
about a dozen teen-age girls with severe mental retardation lived together in an
intense training environment where they learned vocational and social skills to
prepare them for life outside the institution. Further collaborative projects
between the University and Parsons came in the form of a large Federally funded
program that has lasted over twenty-five years and produced a huge volume of
training information and research-based programs that contribute to independent
living for persons with disabilities. The Parsons Research Center and the Kansas
University Affiliated Program at Parsons are stable and productive components of
the LSI, and the site of nationally recognized behavioral and biological research
in both institutional and community programs.  Today, the research focus of the
program is language and language development, stimulus class, and intervention
strategies for abberant behavior.  Training, technical assistance, outreach, and
dissemination activities continue in the areas of early childhood, assistive
technology, inclusion in the community and schools, and support of exemplary
services.

<h4><p>The design, delivery, and utilization of health and support
services for the elderly are the focus of several current
studies by Center faculty.</p></h4>

<h4><p>Dr. Rhonda Montgomery is conducting a three-year study, funded
by the National Institute of Mental Health, to learn more about
how and why family members who care for impaired elders use
respite services (e.g., home health aids and adult day care
centers).  Although respite care is a widely advocated support
service for these families, the experience of providers across
the country has been that many respite services go unused by
people for whom they were designed.  Data are being collected
for this project from over 500 families regarding their need for
services, their perceptions of the quality and utility of
services, and their use of services.</p></h4>


<h4><p>Factors affecting service utilization and client satisfaction
with support services are also the focus of a second study being
conducted by Dr. Montgomery and her team of researchers.  This
second study is an evaluation of a 15-state service
demonstration for Alzheimer's families that is  funded by the
Health Resources Services Administration.  Data regarding
quality of service delivery are being collected from over 3,000
participants in this three-year demonstration. Special attention
is being given to diversity in cultural values and expectations.</p></h4>

<h4><p>Dr. Lynn Osterkamp completed a research fellowship from the
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research,
during which she conducted a national study of best practices in
community-based volunteer home repair programs.  As part of this
project, she has prepared a guidebook that describes what makes
programs successful and community characteristics that
contributed to success.</p></h4>

<h4><p>This year, Dr. Deborah Altus was also awarded a research
fellowship from NIDRR to study accessibility issues in consumer
cooperatives, including housing cooperatives for older adults. 
This project will result in a guidebook listing model programs
for improving accessibility of consumer cooperatives.</p></h4>

<h4><p>The Gerontology Center coordinates an interdisciplinary Graduate
Concentration in Gerontology for students enrolled in any
master's or doctoral degree program at the University.  The
program supplements professional training by providing a
foundation of basic research on aging and a multi-disciplinary
perspective on the issues and problems of aging.  The
concentration prepares students to apply their specialized
knowledge of the social, psychological, demographic, and
biomedical aspects of aging.</p></h4>

<h4><p>Students admitted to the Graduate Concentration in Gerontology
are required to complete 15 hours of course work, including a
three-hour gerontology proseminar, six to nine hours of core
gerontology courses, and at least three hours of gerontology
electives.  Completion of a gerontology-related research
practicum or field placement is also required.  Successful
completion of  the concentration is indicated on the student's
university transcript and students receive a certificate
attesting to their successful completion of a coordinated
program in aging.  This past year, 7 students completed the
Concentration in Gerontology.  Faculty members affiliated with
the Gerontology Center also teach a variety of undergraduate
courses on aging.</p></h4>

<h4><p>In addition, Dr. Kemper directs an NIA-funded Research Training
Program in Communication and Aging.  The Communication and Aging
Program supports three pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral
students training in gerontology, psycholinguistics,
communication studies, and speech pathology.  Trainees pursue a
program of coursework, research participation, workshops, and
tutorials under the supervision of faculty members from a
variety of academic departments including Psychology,
Communication Studies, and Speech-Language-Hearing.</p></h4>

<title>CRITC</title>
<h3>CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON THE INFLUENCES OF TELEVISION ON CHILDREN (CRITC)</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Purpose:  CRITC is a research center devoted to conducting studies of how children interact with television, the activity that occupies more of their waking hours than any other.  CRITC goals are to add to scientific knowledge about children's development and to find ways to use the medium to teach children and enrich their lives.

<li>	Location:  4084 Dole Human Development Center

<li>	Director:  John C. Wright and Aletha C. Huston

<li>	Contact:  John C. Wright

<li>	Telephone:  (913) 864 4646      FAX:  (913) 864 5202
</ul>
	The Center for Research on the Influences of Television on children 
(CRITC) is a unit within the Department of Human Development.  
CRITC was founded in 1978 by its co-directors, John C. Wright and 
Aletha C. Huston.  Research in CRITC has led to the publication of more 
than a hundred scientific and scholarly articles and book chapters.  
Several thousand children and families have participated in research at CRITC.
ore than $2.5 million have been awarded to CRITC in grants and contracts from 
government agencies and private foundations.  Investigations have concerned 
how animation and sound effects influence attention, comprehension, aggression 
and social behavior.  Studies have demonstrated that what children watch is 
more important than how much they watch.  Another study is examining how 
auditory and visual production features of instructional television can best 
be used to demonstrate the logic of physical laws and to present science and 
math concepts by using visualization more than words and symbols.<p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B>
Integrating Family-Centered Policies Into Generic Services</B></H1><P>
Family service systems, both generic and disability specific, should mandate and facilitate the
process and goal of family empowerment.  This policy analysis will assess the degree to which
state legislation authorizing services to families of children with disabilities incorporates national
quality indicators of family empowerment. Beach Center researchers will evaluate the family
policies of four states (Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Wisconsin) and publish reports
that recommend statutory reforms that are family-centered and empowering.<P>

<B><I>RTD 10 project director:</I></B>  Amy Buchele-Ash<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
         a. What are a state's family policies, both generic and disability related, as reflected in their
statutes?<P>
         b. To what degree do the policies conform to the national indicators of family
             empowerment?<P>
         c. What are the characteristics of model family empowerment legislation authorizing generic
            services?<P>
         d. How do state generic family policies interact with federal mandates to accommodate
            individuals with disabilities?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> This project is a legal analysis of state policies that concern families and children,
particularly families who have children with disabilities.  A literature review was conducted to
determine characteristics of family-centered legislation (22 specific criteria were identified).
Project staff  evaluate the state statutory schemes by comparing the content of the statutes with
the criteria.  Evaluations are reviewed by the other staff members to ensure consistent
interpretations. Reports on the state policies are then drafted and circulated among PAR
committee members and stakeholders within the state.  Feedback from committee
members/stakeholders is incorporated and final reports are published.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> Research on this project began in October 1993.  A preliminary report on North
Carolina policies has been issued and the final version will be published in February. 
Evaluations of the Kansas and Nebraska statutes have been completed and both reports are in the
process of being written.  Wisconsin statutes are currently under evaluation.  All reports are
scheduled to be completed by September 1996.<P>

<B><I>Findings:</I></B> At this point, 22 characteristics of family-centered legislation have been identified. In
all four states, project staff are reviewing policies concerned with mental health and retardation
services for children, commitment, guardianship, special needs adoption, family support and
preservation, juvenile or youth services, and child abuse and neglect. Since written evaluations
have not yet been completed for three of the states, it would be premature to state generally any
findings regarding the degree to which state statutes are consistent with the criteria for family-
centered policies or to identify future directions for research. It is anticipated that these
evaluations will be useful to families, policy makers and service providers in creating state
programs that are more responsive to the needs of families, particularly families who have
children with disabilities.<P>

<TITLE>Beach Adolescents & Medical Tech</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8">

<H1 ALIGN=center><B>Transitioning Adolescents 
Supported by Medical Technology</B></H1><P>

Nearly 17,000 adolescents supported by medical technology require daily medical care and
routine use of a medical device such as a ventilator, tracheotomy, gastrostomy, or dialysis to
compensate for the loss of a life-sustaining body function.  This project will (a) systematically
investigate transition planning issues for adolescents/young adults, their families, and providers,
and (b) propose service delivery models to facilitate the transition process.  In general, the study
will analyze factors that affect the transition process with respect to health care issues, life
planning, and supportive and restrictive policies and practices.<P>

<I><B>
RTD 1,2 project directors:</B></I>
  Rebecca Moberly and Mary Morningstar<P>

<I><B>Research questions:</B></I><P>
         a. What health care services are covered before transition?  What are the sources of funding? 
              What are the service gaps?<P>
         b. What is the impact of technology support on life planning decision making?<P>
         c. What policies and practices in educational institutions are supportive?  What are
restrictive?<P>
         d. What roles do people in the adolescent's life play as the adolescent moves on to adulthood?<P>

<I><B>Methodology.</B></I> This research project's initial plan was to use two distinct methods of inquiry. 
First, a process study using qualitative methodology has been implemented and is based upon
telephone interviews with approximately six adolescents and their families from each of the three
technology groups identified for study (ventilators, gastrostomy/enteral feeding, dialysis).  Each
of the six individuals and family members will be interviewed three times at six-month intervals
to obtain longitudinal data over different stages in the transition process.  The second study is a
proposed retrospective one that will examine young adults who have made the transition to adult
services.  In this quantitative survey, two questionnaires will be developed, one from the
perspectives of the young adults and one from the perspectives of the parents.  <P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> The process of identifying study participants from each of the three technology
groups has been much more lengthy than anticipated as there is no national registry for any of the
groups.  In particular, it has been very difficult to obtain sample participants who use
hemodialysis.  At the present time, there have not been any adolescents/young adults who use
hemodialysis that have agreed to participate in the study.  The participants for the process study
for the other two technology groups (ventilators and gastrostomy feeding) have been identified. 
Adequate numbers of participants for the retrospective study have not been identified for any of
the three technology groups. In the process study, six participants from the ventilator technology
group have been interviewed in a first round of telephone interviews.  Four participants from
thegastrostomy group have also participated in the first round of interviews. These transcripts are
being analyzed prior to the second round of interviews.  To a large extent,  the types of questions
to be asked of the young adults and family members during the second and third interviews will
be based upon the data emerging from the first round interviews. However, additional research
issues that will be addressed include: <P> (a) What have been the experiences of families and young
adults regarding the coping strategies used during the transition process? <P> (b)  What experiences
have families and young adults had that have empowered them? <P> (c) What experiences have
families and young adults had that are barriers? The research team is currently working on
gathering a large enough sample size for the quantitative study. <P> 

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> It is still too early in the analysis process to indicate or discuss research findings.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> Future research direction will depend on whether a large enough sample size can
be identified for the retrospective study.  However, the future research direction for the process
study will include an expansion of potential participants to include students, families, educators,
and adult agency personnel.  In addition, this study will explore issues surrounding
empowerment and self-determination for students and families who use medical technology.  <P>

<title>Beach Transition Planning</title> 
 <h3>Involving Students With Disabilities in Transition Planning</h3><hr> 
Research has shown that the active involvement of students with disabilities in
educational planning is either passive or nonexistent.  In fact, the lack of student
involvement and self-advocacy may be one of the most important reasons for poor
post-school outcomes.  Using student focus groups, this project is designed to gain
insight into student perspectives regarding their transition from school to adult
life.<p>
Research Questions:<p>
  <ol><i><li> What methods of planning and services do students with disabilities
view most helpful in assisting them to achieve an inclusive and valued adult life?
<li> What are current practices and experiences of students with disabilities related
to transition planning?
<li> What do students perceive is necessary to achieve their desired vision for their
future?</ol></i><hr>

<TITLE>Beach MEASUREMENT FAMILY-CENTERED</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8">
<H1 ALIGN=center><B>Developing Standards and Measurements 
for Family-Centered Practice</B></H1><P>
Numerous studies and reports calling for reform of child care-giving systems recommend
interagency service coordination, integration, and more family centeredness in each program. 
This project's purpose is to (a) define the term family-centered clearly and specifically to guide
evaluation of child and family services across agency settings and service systems; (b) develop a
reliable, valid measurement scale that can be used in research and program evaluation and to
improve the level of family centeredness in services; and (c) provide training and consultation to
service agencies interested in improving the level of family centeredness; and (d) conduct
research that explores the relationship between the level of family centeredness and
family/service outcomes.<P>

<I><B>RTD 3 project director:</B></I>  Chris Petr<P>

<I><B>Research questions:</B></I>
<P>
     a. How is family-centered service delivery defined?  What are its central characteristics?<P>
     b. How may family-centered service delivery be measured and evaluated within particular
         service delivery systems?<P>
     c. What is the relationship between the degree of family centeredness of a service and
well-         being outcomes of children and families?<P> 
     d. What characteristics of service delivery affect the families' evaluation of how family-
         centered particular service providers are?<P>

<B><I>Methodology. </I></B>The authors conducted an extensive review of family-centered literature in various
disciplines and reviewed over 130 references. Based on this review, the researchers developed a
definition of family-centered service delivery that could be used across settings and disciplines
and that was approved by a participatory action research committee. Next, items for the scale
were identified and reviewed by six focus groups and the PAR committee. A field test of the
preliminary 32-item scale was conducted; results accounted for various revisions. A 1,700-
household mail survey of the preliminary rating scale was conducted to assess  the reliability and
validity of the scale. In data analysis, internal consistency of scale items was assessed using
Cronbach's alpha coefficient.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> The Beach Center published a comprehensive literature review and conceptualization 
in 1995.  A national validation study was completed, and the Beach Center published the Family-
Centered Behavior Scale (FCBS) with a User's Manual in fall 1995.  Conducting research
exploring the relationship between the level of family centeredness and child/family/service
outcomes is considered the last phase of the project, so no firm results have yet been achieved. 
The groundwork has been laid for exploring research opportunities through the technical
assistance contacts and through sales of the FCBS and User's Manual.  In late February and
March, staff will follow up with all agencies that have purchased the manual to explore
possibilities for more formal research.<P>

<title>Beach Challenging Behavior </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor='#ffffe8'>
<h1 align=center><b>
Responding to Challenging Behavior:
 The Family Connection</b></h1><p>
A consortium of the RRTC on Positive Behavioral Support headquartered at University of
Oregon, the Kansas University Affiliated Program at Lawrence, and the Beach Center, The
Family Connection translates research results for the RRTC on Positive Behavioral Support into
family-friendly materials.  This strategy (a) provides the most current, research-based
information to families and practitioners so they can help decrease challenging behavior and (b)
informs researchers about families' priority needs.<p>

<b><i>RTD 17 project director:</i></b> Ann Turnbull<p>

<b><i>Research questions:</i></b><p>
       a. What are family perspectives of the current challenges and successful approaches for   
            individuals with mental retardation who experience problem behavior?<p>
       b. What are family perspectives of the current challenges and successful approaches for     
           families of individuals who experience problem behavior?<p>
       c. What are family preferences for relevant information regarding challenging behavior?<p>
       d. What are family perspectives on inclusive lifestyle issues for individuals with challenging 
            behavior?<p>

<b><i>Methodology.</i></b> This research project has used two forms of qualitative methodology.  The first
study (which answered the first four research questions listed above) used telephone interviews
with 17 families, each of whom had a member with mental retardation and challenging behavior. 
The interviews extended over five months with each interview lasting, on the average, 70
minutes. <p>

<b><i>Implementation.</i></b> In the sample, the process of identifying participants for the first study was
facilitated by the contacts afforded by various Parent to Parent organizations and leaders
throughout the country.  Procedures followed in the first study follow those laid out by Strauss in
Basics of Qualitative Research.  The initial interviews used the research questions as a general
guide, but respondents were encouraged to address issues most important to them.  As interviews
were completed, the research team continually met to discuss emerging themes and categories,
which were used as general probes as appropriate.  <p>

<b><i>Findings.</i></b> The first study yielded the following results:  1)  families' definition of challenging
behavior included not only "dangerous" but also "difficult" behaviors;  2)  constancy of demand
was families' biggest concern; 3) families' and others' fear and worry  about the possibility of
problem behavior (as opposed to behavior that was actually observed) can significantly influence
how the individual with problem behavior is regarded; 4) current challenges regarding
challenging behavior on the individual; 5) current challenges regarding the impact of challenging
behavior on families; 6) scant and tenuous inclusive life-style supports for individuals with
challenging behaviors and families. <p>

<b><i>Implications.</i></b> The first study has provided direction for future research.  First, research needs to
be done to gain a more cogent and comprehensive understanding of families', service providers',
and friends' perceptions about dangerous and difficult behavior.  Second, the impact of these
perceptions on families and others' stress levels needs to be studied.  Third, what types of
supports and services are most effective in relieving the mental anguish associated with these 
perceptions needs to be studied. Fourth, what it takes to establish reliable alliances with
communities needs to be studied so some of the burden can be lifted from the backs of families. 
Fifth, knowing more about why behaviors occur needs to be communicated to families and
service providers. Their reliable and preferred modes of receiving information need to be
determined.<p>

Determining the Efficacy of One-to-One 
Parent to Parent Support</b></h1><p>
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Parent to Parent programs
that provide emotional and informational support to parents of children who have special needs. 
A consortium parent/researcher team in a separate study is collecting data from 540 parents in
five states to measure the impact of one-to-one support in which a trained veteran parent is
matched to a parent newly referred to the program.  Using the data from the consortium study,
Beach Center researchers will investigate the long-term effectiveness of Parent to Parent program
support for not only the referred parents but also the family member with special needs and the
veteran parents.  Data collected from 300 parents in Kansas will be used.<P>

        Parent program and parents who do not participate in a Parent to Parent program?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> Two related sets of studies are being undertaken in this project. One set will
consider only the parents who participate in Parent to Parent and who have received a minimum
of four contacts with a matched veteran parent.  These studies will look primarily at changes over
time with respect to the specified variables. This set of studies will also compare parents who
become veteran parents with those parents who remain as referred parents. The second set of
studies will compare a group of Parent to Parent participants with a group of parents who choose
not to participate in Parent to Parent. All parents will receive a set of questionnaires every six
months to measure changes in the level of empowerment, acceptance of the disability, and social
support.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B>  This study was begun in October 1993 and will continue until September
1998.  Currently , 115 parents in Kansas are participating in the study and are returning
questionnaires every six months.  <P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> These studies are still underway, and thus findings are not yet reportable.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> The results of this longitudinal study of parents who participate in Parent to Parent
programs will provide information on the impact of the Parent to Parent experience over time on
parents' emotional and informational needs.  While the field-initiated study of Parent to Parent
examines the efficacy of the Parent to Parent experience by collecting data on several measures
of emotional well-being from parents who are and are not involved as referred parents, this study
will provide quantitative and qualitative data to answer the questions about the long-term effects,
both emotionally and informationally, of the Parent to Parent experience for parents, as well as
any differences in effects that may exist for referred parents and veteran parents.  The impact of
the Parent to Parent experiences on the awareness and utilization of family supports for the
family and services for the child with a disability will also be determined.  This combination of
data will provide a more comprehensive determination of the efficacy of Parent to Parent for
participating parents and the child with a disability.<P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B>
Understanding Statewide Parent to Parent Programs</B></H1><P>
Twenty-three states have statewide Parent to Parent programs. This study will collect and
analyze information about statewide Parent to Parent programs to determine (a) organizational
characteristics; (b) services provided to local programs and to families; (c) utilization of a
computerized database for matching parents; and (d) relationship of the statewide Parent to
Parent program to local programs, the Parent Training and Information Center, Part H initiatives
(birth through age two services as stipulated in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act),
and state activities related to transition from education to vocational rehabilitation services. The
resulting information should be particularly useful to parents and/or professionals who are
interested in developing a statewide Parent to Parent program in their state. Statewide Parent to
Parent program directors and local Parent to Parent program coordinators in states with a state-
wide program will be surveyed to learn more about statewide Parent to Parent programs.<P>

<B><I>RTD 14 project director:</I></B> Betsy Santelli<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
         a. What are the organizational characteristics of statewide Parent to Parent programs?<P>
         b. What services are provided?  What is the level of satisfaction with the services?  How
             might the services be improved?<P>
         c. How are statewide Parent to Parent programs using computerized databases for matching
            parents locally, statewide, and nationally, and for sharing information about disabilities
            and resources?<P>
         d. What is the relationship of the statewide Parent to Parent program to other programs?<P>
         e. What are the perceptions of local Parent to Parent program coordinators?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B>  Participants in the study include directors of existing statewide Parent to Parent
programs and coordinators of local Parent to Parent programs in the states that have a statewide
Parent to Parent program.  During Phase 1 of the study directors of statewide programs respond
to a survey containing questions about (a) the organization and services provided by the
statewide program, (b) the use of a computerized database for matching and information and
referral, and (c) the relationships between the statewide program and other statewide efforts. 
During Phase 2, coordinators of local Parent to Parent programs respond to a survey with
questions about their perceptions of the (a) organization and services provided by the statewide
program,  (b) the use of a computerized database for matching and information and referral, and
(c) the relationships between the statewide program and other statewide efforts.   The results will
be analyzed by computer.  Focus groups and individual interviews with staff and coordinators
from at least three statewide programs will provide qualitative data to enhance the quantitative
data.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> The study is occurring in two different phases:  Phase 1, the survey of statewide
Parent to Parent programs, is underway, with statewide Parent to Parent program directors
currently returning survey protocols to the Beach Center.  Phase 2 of the survey will begin in
September 1997.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> The study is currently gathering data, and thus findings are not yet reportable.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> The results of this study will provide descriptive information about the
administrative characteristics and the program components of statewide Parent to Parent
programs and the perspectives of the local programs receiving services from statewide programs. 
Information about (a) the developmental history of statewide programs, (b) sources of funding,
(c) staffing patterns, (d) budgets, (e) relationships with local programs and other state efforts on
behalf of families, and (f) the supports and services offered to local programs and parents will be
provided both quantitatively and qualitatively from the surveys and focus groups and individual
interviews with program staff.  These results will be useful to states that already have a statewide
program because they share information on best practices in other states.  The survey information
will also be useful to states that do not have a statewide program because they will identify the
characteristics of operational statewide programs.  The enhanced visibility of statewide Parent to
Parent programs that will result from the study may mean that additional states begin to develop
statewide Parent to Parent programs, thus making the Parent to Parent experience more widely
available to families nationwide.<P>

Examining Fathers' Relationships and Their Perceptions of
Those Relationships</B></H1><P>
This study's purpose is to examine the activities and interaction time of fathers and their children
who have or do not have a disability. The study is also investigating the fathers' perceptions of
their relationships with their children and will examine the effect of the father's self-perception
on his perception of his child's skills. Information gained will assist service delivery programs to
understand the special role of fathers and that "family-centered" is not synonymous with
"mother-centered."<P>

<B><I>RTD 11 project director:</I></B>  Vicki Turbiville<P>

<B><i>Research questions:</I></B><P>
     a. Do fathers who have children with a disability view their parenting skills the same way
as      fathers of children who do not?<P>
     b. Do fathers of children who have disabilities spend more time doing child care than do
         fathers of children without disabilities?<P>
     c. What are the other things fathers of children who have disabilities do with their
children?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> This quantitative study collected information from 84 Kansas fathers of children
with and without mental retardation between the ages of 5 and 9. Special education
cooperatives/programs and elementary school programs were selected using a stratified random
selection procedure. These agencies then sent letters of invitation to the fathers in their programs.
Data was collected three times from fathers during the study.  Parametric and non-parametric
data analysis was made because of the data's characteristics.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> This study was begun in October 1993 and completed in August 1994. 
Approximately 20% of the fathers receiving invitations to participate did so.  Nearly 90% of
those agreeing to participate returned all three data sets.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> Findings in general support other recent findings that fathers of children with and
without disabilities (mental retardation) are more similar than different. They perceive
themselves similarly as fathers; they spend similar amounts of time in child care (more time, but
not a statistically significant amount), and that time spent in child care is not related to the speech
and language skills of their child.  Another finding suggested by the research is that fathers tend
not to follow the suggestions made by educators for home activities and that other suggestions
need to be made if fathers are going to be included.  It also appears that fathers spend a great deal
of time watching television with their children;  activities might be suggested that could be
completed as a part of this time fathers and children spend together.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> Fathers are recognized as participating similarly in the lives of their children
whether those children have disabilities or not. Since the routines of fathers are different than
those of mothers, service providers need to use different approaches when including both parents. 
Including both parents will help families build on their strengths and increase the sense of
competence in the family. Implications for the research community:  Fathers are often not
included in the research sample because of the difficulty obtaining responses from them.  This
study confirms that as an issue but also suggests that there are fathers out there who are
interested and very willing to participate if we can determine a better way to reach them. Fathers
are interacting with their children but not in the same way as mothers.  Providers need to think
about the interaction of fathers and children and provide information and support to fathers
consistent with these existing interactions. Policy makers need to recognize the important role
played by fathers of children with and without disabilities and review policies to insure that
agency and system policies do not set up barriers to fathers interactions with their children and to
their interactions with services designed to assist them with their children. <P>

<title> Beach Family Centered Service - Fathers </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffe8">
<h1 align=center><b>
Evaluating Family-Centered Service Provision to Fathers of
Children in Early Childhood Programs</b></h1><p>
Literature indicates that the father's view of the child who has a disability sets the tone for the
attitude of the family as a whole. Researchers and service providers, however, have often ignored
fathers because of the difficulty of arranging for their participation and the professional's lack of
training to work with fathers. Most "family" research is based on mothers' responses.  The
purpose of this study is to identify the program options being provided for fathers and other male
family members and to examine the responsiveness of these options to the priorities and concerns
of these men.  The study will compare the preferences of mothers, service providers, fathers, and
other male family members regarding these program options.<p>

<b><i>RTD 12 project director:</I></B> Vicki Turbiville<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
     a.   What are the approaches currently being used in children's programs for the
          participation of       fathers or other male family members?<P>
     b.   What are fathers' and other male family members' preferences for participation in
          these     programs? Are these preferences different depending on the family
          structures and whether the male is the biological or adoptive father, older family
          member, older boyfriend living in the   household, or male family member not
          residing in the household?  Do fathers' preferences vary depending upon their
          employment status?<P>
     c.   How do these responses compare with those predicted by the children's mothers?<P>
     d.   How do these responses compare with those predicted by the service providers?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> This quantitative study is about halfway through the course of the project.  This
project will develop a survey, based on input from fathers and service providers, to determine the
strategies being used by Head Start, Part H, Part B, and community day care programs to include
fathers and other male family members. The surveys will be developed from information gained
through a series of telephone conference calls/focus groups regarding the strategies being used,
the barriers and the facilitators to the inclusion of fathers.  Providers from the four child
education/care models in six states, California, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Maryland, and New
Mexico, have participated in the initial conference calls.  Fathers from these same programs will
also be invited to participate in similar calls. Once the survey is developed, it will be sent to a
representative sample of these four child education/care programs in these six states.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> This project was begun formally in spring 1995 and continues to date.  
However, the funding of initiatives to include fathers in Head Start ended, making fewer
programs available for the sample.  It was decided to include other programs for children in the
age range to obtain a broader view of program efforts to include fathers.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> Some very preliminary findings suggested by our work to date include:
     Programs have more success including fathers when they specifically consider how the
     interests and priorities of fathers can be addressed in each aspect of the program including
     parent meetings, initial enrollments, assessments, and other routine program components.
     Women's attitudes and behavior, including those of women staff and the children's
     mothers, appear to be major factors in whether fathers are included or not.
     Program variables such as evening and weekend hours, child care during meetings, and
     transportation appear not to be strong factors in fathers' participation. 
     One other suggested result of our work is the apparent wide variation in providers'
     expectations for fathers.  It was very difficult to locate Part B programs that appeared to
     include fathers or to be particularly "family-centered." Most usually our requests were
     referred to specific family organizations rather than to school-based programs.  Head
     Start programs were somewhat varied in their responses.  They have been required to
     involve parents and did not seem to feel that any one program was doing a better job than
     others; they were all doing it. Their involvement is again primarily with mothers, though
     they have had initiatives to include fathers, so many had made some effort.  Part H
     programs, with their "family-centered" philosophies, often did not know of programs that
     were particularly strong in including fathers but were able to identify programs with
     stronger family-centered practices. The community-based, non-disability-based programs
     were rather surprised that we were asking the question.  They seemed to assume that the
     fathers were going to be there as much as the mothers.  Their interactions were often
     around the pick-up and delivery of the children.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> The study is in early stages and implications and directions for future research
seem premature.<P>

<TITLE>Beach ENHANCING FAMILY SUPPORT FOR TRANSITION</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8">

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Enhancing Family Support for Transition</B></H1><P>
For most, a family member's transition from adolescence to adulthood is a stressful time.  For
families of individuals with disabilities, these stresses may be different and more intense.  This
study will identify and analyze the priority issues in transition to adulthood for Hispanic parents
and siblings of adolescents and young adults with disabilities, what they perceive to foster
successful transition for the family member, and what methods of support would be most
effective and efficient during the transitional period.<P>

<B><I>RTD 4 project director:</I></B>  Martha Blue-Banning<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
         a. What are the hopes and visions of family members and professionals regarding the future
             for Hispanic adolescents/young adults with disabilities?<P>
         b. What are the factors that foster or impede the achievement of these hopes and visions?<P>
         c. How do Hispanic family members and professionals who provide support to these families
             perceive the responsiveness of Group Action Planning, a family-centered support service
             delivery model, to Hispanic families of adolescents/young adults with disabilities?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> This study employs focus group interviews to obtain a descriptive understanding
of the support needs and issues facing Hispanic families of transition-age individuals with
disabilities.  Adult family members of Hispanic adolescents/young adults (ages 8-26) with
developmental disabilities and professionals who provide support services to Hispanic families
of adolescents/young adults with developmental disabilities participated in focus groups to share
their perspectives on the family-centered support model called Group Action Planning and on
issues related to transition from adolescence to adulthood of individuals with disabilities.  Family
member participants are defined as Hispanic parents (biological, adoptive, or foster), persons
serving in a parental role as guardian, or adult family members who have a significant role in the
life of the family member with a disability.  Family members who identified their country of
ancestry as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, or South America were considered to
meet the criterion of Hispanic ethnicity for participation in this study.  Four data collection sites,
El Paso, Texas; Bakersfield, California; Garden City, Kansas; and Hartford, Connecticut, were
chosen to ensure representation of the two dominant Hispanic subgroups, Mexican and Puerto
Rican, because they have had the longest presence of Hispanic-origin subgroups in the U.S. and
currently represent 75% of the U.S. Hispanic population. Prior to focus groups, participants
attended a two-hour workshop on Group Action Planning. The workshop was facilitated by a
researcher who was also the parent of a child with a disability. A workshop format was selected
because it is particularly amenable to the creation of an adult learning environment essential to
enhancing participant understanding of Group Action Planning concepts.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> All materials related to the study were translated into Spanish.  Focus groups
have been completed at the four research sites.  Nine focus groups with 39 Hispanic family
members and 22 professionals were conducted and audiotaped; transcription of the audiotapes
has been completed.  The project staff is currently working on data analysis.  Transcript coding is
complete; the process of data reduction and synthesis is underway.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> Project staff are currently completing data analysis.  Preliminary findings concerning
family member and professional participants' visions and expectations for the future include:
<UL>
    <LI>     Families expressed the desire of meaningful employment for their son or daughter so that their
         children are working in the "real" world and not in artificially created jobs.
     <LI>    Sometimes families could more clearly articulate what they didn't want in terms of future
         employment for their son or daughter. 
    <LI>     A theme pervasive for both families and professionals was that the individual with a disability
         have the opportunity to express preferences and to have those preferences respected.  
    <LI>     Many professionals expressed a vision that included flexible support services for families.

Empowering Parents of Children With Disabilities</B></H1><P>
Empowerment describes the process by which people gain mastery over important aspects of
their lives and environments.  This study will conduct basic research and empirical validation of
an existing model of empowerment for parents who have children with disabilities. It will
provide information that will be useful in helping parents understand effective advocacy skills
and policy change implications based on characteristics of empowered parents.<p>
                                     
<B><I>RTD 5 project director:</I></B>  Theresa Jones<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
         a. What are the factors that influence levels of parent
empowerment within each
             empowerment component (perceptions of capability,
knowledge and resources, and
             behaviors)?<P>
         b. What patterns are found in empowerment at the three
different levels or contexts of
             family, service system, and community politics?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> The study is longitudinal and is investigating how
parental empowerment changes over time as a function of
participating in programs with implicit or explicit goals of
empowering families.  Three hundred and fifty parents in
approximately 65 family support programs in Alaska,
California, and Wisconsin are completing surveys about the
program the parent participates in, the parent's attitudes, skills,
behaviors, and social support once a year for two years. 
Additionally, we conducted interviews with service providers in
each of the programs, and each provider completed a program
questionnaire.<P>   

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> Approximately 90% of the parent data for this
longitudinal study has been collected; 350 parents participated
in the first round of data collection and 275 parents have
completed the second round of surveys to date. Interviews have
been completed with all 65 family support programs that are
participating in the project. Program questionnaires have been
completed by 50 of the 65 programs during the second round of
data collection. Descriptive statistical analyses have been
conducted on both the parent and program data. Reports of the
descriptive statistics have been sent to each of the programs
participating in the study.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> States differ in the types of services and family-
centered orientation.  To date, we have not related these
differences to family outcomes.  Program responsiveness, sense
of community within a program, critical knowledge of the
service system, and reliable alliances of the parent are positively
related to parental empowerment. <P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> The results of this study provide an empirical
foundation for the action-oriented research the Beach Center
conducts. The Beach Center seeks to empower families, and this
study provides data to examine the components of motivation
and resources in the existing conceptual model. The results will
be used to revise existing quality indicators for family service
systems. A collaborative effort is underway among the Beach
Center and other family research organizations to develop a set
of quality indicators for family service systems.  The results will
be compared to existing indicators, and recommendations will
be made to modify indicators that do not support an
empowerment perspective. Once the processes that underlie the
empowerment process are more fully understood, it will be
possible to develop research-validated models of family
advocacy. <P>

Empowering Adolescents With and Without Disabilities</B></H1><P>
This empirical study will investigate psychological empowerment across academic, social, and
organizational contexts. From that information, we will generalize a model of empowerment
using a series of measures that assess the theoretical indicators of empowerment. In addition to
developing a measure of psychological empowerment that can be used in disability research, this
study will provide understanding of factors that influence psychological empowerment. Elements
of psychological empowerment include perceived control over events, feelings of competence in
a particular context, participation in organizations, and the necessary skills to succeed in a
particular context. <P>

<B><I>RTD 7 project director:</I></B>  Theresa Jones<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
         a. What are the underlying constructs of intrapersonal, interactional, and behavioral
             empowerment that together indicate a general level of adolescent empowerment?<P>
         b. What are the differences between adolescents without disabilities and adolescents with
             sensory and physical disabilities, as well as between males and females?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> Two samples of parents (N=176 and N=135) from family support programs in
three states participated in this study.  These family support programs provide a variety of
services and information to parents of children with disabilities.  The average age of the parent
respondents was 39.93 (SD=7.67). Twenty-six fathers (9 %) and 275 mothers (88%) responded
to the questionnaires. The majority of parents in the study were biological parents of the child
with a disability (N= 270), while fewer were adoptive or foster parents  (N=23) or grandparents
(N=8). The pool of respondents was relatively homogenous with respect to ethnicity and income
level: 89.1% were white, 3.9% Hispanic, 3.6% Black, 2.0% Asian, and 1.3% Native American. 
Parents' incomes were diverse, ranging from less than $15,000 to over $75,000 per year. The
ages of their children with a disability ranged from 3 months to 21 years (M=8.88, SD= 4.9). 
Male children comprised 64.1% (N=193), while female children made up 35.9% (N=108) of the
parents' children. Most children had multiple diagnoses, such as mental retardation, cerebral
palsy, hearing or vision impairments, or developmental delays.  Approximately half of the
children had disabilities that were mild or moderate, while the other half had disabilities that
parents rated as  severe to very severe. A field study design was employed to investigate
psychometric properties of the Psychological Empowerment Scale (PES). Parents were given a
set of questionnaires to complete. The questionnaires included the PES and another measure of
empowerment, measures of program responsiveness and parent satisfaction, two social support
measures, and several checklists. They were asked to complete the questionnaire as part of a
larger longitudinal study.  Regarding scale construction, the PES is based on an earlier version
(Jones, 1994) and revised to be more appropriate for assessing  psychological empowerment in
parents of children with disabilities. The revised scale consisted of 60 items and four subscales
that assessed parents' attitudes of control and competence, critical skills and knowledge, and
formal and informal participatory behaviors.  The first subscale, attitudes of control and
competence, reflects parents' perceptions of their control and competence in dealing with life
situations. The second subscale, critical skills and knowledge, reflects parents' skills associated
with successfully negotiating or dealing with the contexts in their lives. The items themselves
reflect parents' assessment of their personal skill level in dealing with their contexts, such as the
community or the service system. The third and fourth subscales, formal and informal
participatory behaviors, were hypothesized to consist of two related behavioral scales, informal
participation and social support, and participation in formal organizations and activities.
Preliminary validity evidence of the PES was obtained through independent item ratings. Five
independent raters assigned each of the 60 items to three categories:  attitudes of control,
participatory behaviors, and skills. The kappa coefficient for agreement among raters ranged
from .65 to .83 on the subscales with an overall kappa of .80.  Five items were rewritten for
clarity.  Parents also completed  the Family Empowerment Scale (Koren, et al., 1992), the
Reliable Alliance Scale (Singer, 1994), the Social Provisions Scale (Cutrona & Russell, 1987),
the Psychological Sense of Community Scale (Glynn, 1981), the Parent Satisfaction Survey
(Project Dakota, 1986), and checklists of the services they received and the number of
individuals within the program who supplied them with social support.    <P>

<B><I>Implementation.</B></I> All data have been collected for this study.  We are in the process of analyzing
the second sample of data and disseminating the scale for research use.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> Psychometric analyses of the PES indicate that important aspects of psychological
empowerment can be measured reliably and validly for parents of a child with a disability.  As
one strand of efforts to clearly define and measure psychological empowerment and its
outcomes, this preliminary work with the PES raises important issues.<P>

<B><I>Implications.</I></B> Although the PES demonstrated a four-dimensional structure, more research is
needed to determine whether these dimensions underlie a single construct of psychological
empowerment.  <P>

<TITLE>Beach CHILDREN'S FRIENDSHIPS</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR='#FFFFE8'>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Helping Parents Facilitate Children's Friendships</B></H1><P>
To identify specific catalysts for successful friendships between children and youths with mental
retardation and autism and people who do not have disabilities, we have gathered information
from children and youths, family members, and service providers to identify factors that have
most contributed to that success.  The ways that parents can facilitate friendships will be a
particular focus of this study.  Information on successful practices will be used to develop
materials for families and service providers so that best practices can be replicated in many
different situations.<P>

<B><I>RTD 6 project director:</I></B> Ann Turnbull<P>

<B><I>Research questions:</I></B><P>
     a. In which situations do children develop or maintain friendships?<P>
     b. What do children/parents do to develop friendships?<P>
     c. What do children/parents do to impede friendships?<P>
     d. What do children do to give and receive support to each other in each of the five
         relationship domains?<P>
     e. What do children/parents do to achieve greater friendship depth?<P>
     f. What are the preferences of children/parents in expanding friendships?<P>
     g. What are the most preferred and effective roles of parents in facilitating friendships?<P>

<B><I>Methodology.</I></B> Individual and group interviews have been conducted with 10 children with
disabilities who have successful friendships, at least one of their friends, and the parents and
teachers of both students. Systematic content analysis of transcripts is currently being conducted
to identify key themes, issues, and recommendations. The Ethnograph software computer
program is being used to organize the qualitative data.<P>

<B><I>Implementation.</I></B> Interviews were conducted in El Paso, Texas; Bakersfield, California; Garden
City, Kansas; and Hartford, Connecticut.  These locations provided access to Hispanic children
and families of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent.  All interviews have been transcribed, and
data analysis is approximately one-third completed. The content analysis will identify the key
themes, issues, and recommendations that are similar across the 10 friendships between a child
with and without a disability; however, the striking diversity across these 10 friendships is a
dominant feature of the data.  In order to adequately capture this diversity, we have prepared case
studies focusing on the unique aspects of each friendship. With families, individuals with
disabilities, and service providers as the target audience, those case studies have been prepared in
story form as a booklet that will be widely disseminated.<P>

<B><I>Findings.</I></B> Content analysis is not yet complete.<P>  

<B><I>Implications.</I></B>We anticipate that the findings will be used by families and service providers in
facilitating friendships of children with and without disabilities.  In the future we hope to expand
this research from a focus on Hispanic families to the inclusion of families from a variety of
racial/ethnic groups.<P>

<title>Beach Child Abuse and Neglect </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor='#ffffe8'>
<h1 align=center><b>
Establishing and Implementing a National Consensus on a
Research and Training Agenda on Child Abuse and Neglect
of Children Who Have a Disability</b></h1><p>
This project, a partnership between the Beach Center and the Erikson Institute for Advanced
Study in Child Development, developed a national agenda for research, training, and
dissemination related to the abuse and neglect of young children who have a disability. This
agenda emerged from a national working conference held November 1994 in Arlington, VA. In
Phase Two, the Beach Center and the Erikson Institute will implement components of the agenda
consistent with their resources and priorities. Funding for this implementation is sought through
a collaborative effort.<p>

<b><i>RTD 15 project directors:</i></b>  Rud Turnbull and Vicki Turbiville<p>

<b><i>Research questions:</i></b><p>
     a. What are the critical issues for research, training, service coordination, and policy in
child               abuse and neglect involving young children with a disability?<p>
     b. How do critical issues differ in urban environments and small town or rural
environments?<p>
     c. How do critical issues differ for the five different communities of interest?<p>
     d. What is a priority agenda for research, training, service coordination, and policy
         formulation related to young children with a disability?<p>

<b><i>Methodology.</i></b> The first method used in this project was a set of focus groups of stakeholders of
the child protective system.  These stakeholders included service providers for children between
birth and 8 years of age, forensic personnel, policy makers, foster parents, natural parents, and
researchers.  The second method used to address the research questions was the convening of
experts in the fields from across the nation for a symposium on the abuse and neglect of children
who have disabilities. <p>

<b><i>Implementation.</i></b> The summary of the National Symposium was prepared by the Beach Center
with collaboration primarily with the Erikson Institute and published by National Center for
Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) in the fall of 1995.  A copy of these recommendations is
available from NCCAN.  <p>

<b><i>Findings.</i></b> The major recommendations from the National Symposium include the following:
<ul>
    <li>     Promote awareness with and by existing organizations and service systems.
 <li>        Support awareness from the federal, state, and local levels through existing programs across
         disciplines.
  <li>       Increase significantly all efforts to prevent and reduce the incidence of abuse and neglect.
  <li>       Use an ecological approach to understand, prevent, and reduce maltreatment.
  <li>       Provide universal prevention efforts through public health initiatives.
  <li>       Collaborate across all professions to increase service effectiveness.
   <li>      Base all prevention and intervention programs on best practices, including ongoing
         evaluation.
 <li>        Train professionals on the multiple issues regarding children with disabilities who have been
         abused and neglected.
 <li>        Train professionals in strategies to reduce redundancies and ineffectiveness of nonintegrated
         agency intervention.
 <li>        Train for cultural competence in prevention and intervention efforts.
         Increase the capacity of families to withstand stressors contributing to the abuse and neglect
         of children.
  <li>       Promote inclusion.
  <li>       Listen to and respect the informed preferences and priorities of children.
   <li>      Adopt a uniform child protection statute.
  <li>       Enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act and existing laws relating to abuse, neglect, and
         disability.
  <li>       Reauthorize laws concerning families, children, and disability.
   <li>      Refine laws.
</ul>
<b><i>Implications.</i></b> Findings from the focus groups confirm much that has been written about abuse
and neglect of children in general.  Of special concern is the lack of information available to
service providers regarding children who have disabilities and who have been maltreated.   <p>

<title>Beach Center Description</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"></BODY>
<h1>Beach Center</h1><img alt"" src="rainbow.gif">
<p><dd><b>Purpose:</b>  The Beach Center provides parent training, professional and
emotional support, education and training materials to assist families who 
have members with disabilities and to influence national policy regarding the 
welfare of all persons with developmental disabilities.</p>

<p><dd><b>Location:</b>  The Beach Center is located in the Haworth Wing of the Robert
Dole Human Development Center 3111 Haworth, University of Kansas, Lawrence,
KS 66045.</p>

<p><dd><b>Directors:</B>  <a href="ann.htm"> Ann P. Turnbull</a> 
and 
<a href="rud.htm">H.Rutherford Turnbull III</a> 

<p>Telephone: (913)-864-7600<br>
Fax:    (913)-864-7605<BR>
</p>
     
<p><dd>The Beach Center on Families and Disabilities is funded by the University of
Kansas, private donations, and the National Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) to serve as a Rehabilitation Research and Training
Center.</p>
     
<p><dd>We connect our research, training, and dissemination activities to 
the theme of FAMILY EMPOWERMENT, which we do by:<ul>
<li>Motivating families to have great expectations for their children and to
take an active role in finding and getting appropriate services
<li>Supporting families to have the resources an skills they and their children
need 
<li>Building a society that responds to the needs of the family and its
children</ul></p>

<p><h3>Beach Center Research</h3></p>

<p><dd>Each of our research projects supports and strengthens the motivation,
resources, and skills that families who have children with special needs already have
and helps communities respond better to these families.  Our research is both
scientifically rigorous and sensitive to families.  We involve the users of our research
(families, individuals with disabilities, service providers, researchers and trainers, and
policy makers) in all research phases.  This participatory research begins with
decisions about what should be researched and ends with sharing research results in
truly useful ways.  Each of our projects has 8-10 advisors actively involved in
planning, working, and sharing research results.</p>

<P><h3>Dissemination and Training: Making Our Research Useful</h3></p>

<p><dd>We share our research results with our major constituency groups and others
through:<ol>
     <li>Our doctoral program, the only doctoral program in the United States that
focuses on family studies and disability, which launches graduates into teaching and
leadership positions.
     <li>Training service personnel in our graduate courses in several disciplines at the
University of Kansas and through our text books for use in universities across the
country (e.g., Families, Professionals, and Exceptionality: A Special Partnership;  Free
Appropriate Public Education: Law and Education of Children With Disabilities;
Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's School).
     <li>Training packages that consist of workshops, presentations, and
co-sponsorship of eight national conferences in the areas of Parent to Parent, child
abuse and neglect, inclusion, empowerment, and disability issues in Hispanic
families.
     <li>Technical assistance, consultation, collaboration, and networking with
interested individuals and organizations.</ol></p>
<p><h3>Beach Center Products</h3></P>

<p><dd>Products resulting from our research are knowledge-based and family-friendly. 
Our staff develops journal articles, book chapters, books, training manuals, magazine
articles, video/audio tapes, resource directories, anthologies, newsletter articles, a
Beach Center newsletter, and a variety of other informational formats.</p>

<h2><b> Informing Tomorrow's Leaders</b></h2>
<IMG SRC="RAINBOW.GIF"></CENTER><P>
<P><DD>     A new <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>
survey published March 27 ranked the
University of Kansas' special
education program number one in the
country!<P>
<P><DD>       (Beach center staff teaches
graduate level course in Special
Education, Law and Family-
Professional Collaboration. And, the
Beach Center doctoral program on
Family Studies and Disability--the
only one of its kind in the U.S.--
recently was refunded for another four
years.) <p>
<P><DD>      One reason the department  receives
accolade is that it is consistently on
the technology forefront. For instance,
this summer it is offering the class
<i>Assessing and Analyzing Behavior
State Among Students With Profound
and Severe Disabilities</i> on <b>CD ROM.</b>
<P><DD>      Students study independently with a
multimedia package consisting of a
Macintosh computer, compact disc
player, manual, and other printed
materials. <p>

<h4><b>Innovative Textbook</h4></b><P>

<P><DD>      Another exciting informational
advance from the Special Education
Department comes via the Beach
Center in a new special education
introductory textbook that presents
learning materials in a fresh style.<P>

<P><DD>  Beach staffers Martha Blue-
Banning, Mary Morningstar, Mike
Ruef, and Vicki Turbivlle all previous
special education teachers, teamed
with Ann Turnbull (who started her
career teaching special education
classes in LaGrange, Georgia), Rud
Turnbull, Marilyn Shank, and Dorothy
Leal to write Exceptional Lives:
Special Education in Today's
Schools.<p> 
<P><DD>   Wrote the authors, "We believe,
first and foremost, that the very great
majority of students with disabilities
can receive an appropriate education
in general education programs, if those
programs and classrooms are designed
to provide individualized instruction.
<P><DD>      "This means that two essential
techniquss of inclusion are the
supplementay services andsupport as
specificed by IDEA and the eagerness
and capacities of all educators, general
and special alike, to individuzlise for
and socially connect with all students."<p>
<P><DD>      In this text published by
Merril/Prentice-Hall, personal
portrayals of real students and families
merge with extensive review of current
theory, research, and practice.<P>
<P><DD>      Each chapter highlights vignettes of
real people, definitions, evaluation
procedures, professional issues, and
program options. Twelve chapters
target  specific conditions and
exceptionalities, including coverage of
autism and traumatic brain injury.<p>
<P><DD> <b>"I was continually impressed with
the authors' ability to convey complex
information in a very readable
manner," </b>said reviewer Robert Ristow,
St. Ambrose University.  <p>
<P><DD>      Accompanying the text are an
instructor's manual, tests,
transparencies, student study guides,
and two videos <B>Regular Lives</B> narrated
by Martin Sheen and <B>Facing
Inclusion Together Through
Collaboration and Co-Teaching.</B><p>

<P><DD> <i>Exceptional Lives</i> is available from

line services, and research and
training centers. Topics includes
adjustment, early intervention,
employment, permanency planning,
recreation, advocacy, fund raising,
school, siblings, technology, and
many more.<p>
<P><DD>      We sent <i>Resources</i> out for review
and were delighted when an Arizona
Parent Training Information Center
sent in its recommendations AND a
copy of its <b><i>1995 Looking for Family-
Friendly: Selected Resources for
Families of Children With Disabilities,
Ages 0-5.</i></b> (To obtain this 68-page
resource, call 602-468-3001.) 
<P><DD>      To order <b>Resources for Families
and Professionals,</b> see the 
listing of 
<a href="http://WWW.LSI.UKANS.EDU/BEACH/bprods.htm">
Beach Center products.</a><p>
<P><DD>      Database storage and information
retrieval has made information so
much easier to find. The problem is
knowing where the databases are. In
the disability field, several databases
stand out.<p> 
<P><DD> <b>National Rehabilitation
Information Center and
ABLEDATA Database of Assistive
Technology </b>(800-346-2742) receives
4,500 information requests monthly.
The most requested information is on
products and devices, followed by
disability organizations, and funding
opportunities. <p>
<P><DD>      This service lists more than 20,000
products and you can call its electronic
bulletins board to search the database,
get messages, or download fact sheets.
Computer dial 301-589-3563. The
database is also available on CD
ROM. NARIC has also updated its
Directory of National Information
Sources on Disabilities ($15), which
includes more than 700 organizaitons,
100+ resource direcotires, and 42
databases. <p>
<P><DD>      If you want information on
parenting a child with special needs,
education rights, and general disability
information, then <b>National
Information Center for Children
and Youth With Disabilities</b>
(NICHCY) (800-695-0285 ) is the
place to go.  <p>         
<P><DD>      NICHCY said it is fielding more
questions about inclusion and
community  this past year, and its
most requested publications are
attention deficit disorders materials.<p> 
<P><DD>      Call or E-mail<B><A HREF="MAILTO:NICHCY@capcon.net"> NICHCY</A></B>
for a list of free publications or answers to
specific questions. <p>
<P><DD>    <b>  ERIC Clearinghouse on
Disabilities and Gifted Education</b>
(ERIC)(703-620-3660, 800-328-
0272; <i><A HREF="MAILTO:ERICEC@INET.ED.GOV">ERICE@inet.ed.gov</a></i>).<p>
distributes information on  disabilities
and gifted education.<p>
<P><DD>      "People reach us in a variety of
ways," said an ERIC representative.
"Within the last two years, we have
been receiving about 300-400 E-mail
requests via the Internet. Attention
deficit disorder materials are our most
requested materials and people are
interested in technology.  Gifted
education is always hot seller."<p> 
<P><DD>      Recently, ERIC asked the Beach
Center to distribute ADD materials
developed from an OSERS grant.<p>
<P><DD>      "After speaking with educators and
parents who wanted information and
guidance on educating children with
ADD, we found that they looked to
organizations like yours for answers,"
wrote Ellen Schiller, Chief, Directed
Research Branch.<p>
<P><DD>      Therefore, the Beach Center is
distributing <b>Facing the Challenges of
ADD: A Kit for Parents and
Educators</b> containing the booklets:<p>
<b>
     Beyond the Myths<p>
     Adding Up the Facts<p>
     What Parents Should Know<p>
     What Teachers Should Know<p>
     101 Ways to Help Children With
     ADD Learn<p>
     Resource Directory<p> </b>
and two videos (one narrated by
celebrity Rita Moreno) on ADD.<BR>

     
The cost for the kit is $12.00, the
price of printing and postage. <p>

</h3>
<h1>Find Disability Information</h1>

<P><dd>There is a lot of disability information--if you know the right place to 
look. In print about 55 disability newspapers, 70 magazines, and over 5,000
newsletters cover disability-related topics. To find out about these
publications, see <b><i>Guide to Disability and Rehabilitation Periodicals</i></b>
(NARIC, 8455 Colesville Rd., #935, Silver Spring, MD 20910, 800-346-2742,
<a href="mailto:naric@capaccess.org">naric@capaccess.org</a> 
.); <b><i>Americas Teleability Media</i></b> (Teleability Media, Box 
1488, Colum bia, MO 65205, which also lists about 40 broadcast programs); 
or ask specific organizations for their publications.</p> 

<p><dd>One magazine covering families and disabilities that stands out is 
<i><b>Exceptional Parent</b></i>, (800-247-8080) which has the section Parent Search and
Parent Respond for parents to contact each other for information, support,
and other needs. A time-proven program that also uses mutual parent support
is <b>Parent to Parent</b> where veteran parents of children with disabilities 
offer emotional and informational support to rookie parents in one-to-one 
matches. For information about a program in your area, contact the Parent 
to Parent Project, Beach Center, (913-864-7600).</p> 

<dd>For those who have children with special health care needs or rare 
disorders, the <b>National Parent to Parent Support and Information System</b>
(Box 907, Blue Ridge, GA 30513, 800-651-1151) does parent matches--on a 
national level--as does <b>Mothers United for Moral Support</b> (150 Custer Ct., 
Green Bay, WI 54301, 414-336-5333). Another matching program is <b>Friends 
Health Connect</b>, which links people who have the same health prob lems with 
a healing partner (Box 114, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, 800-483-7437).</p>

<p><dd>Related to these services are <b>Parent Training and Information Centers 
(PTIs)</b>, which offer support to parents regarding health and education 
needs of children with disabilities. Some have specialized assistance, such 
as in clusion (PEAK Parent Center,6055 Lehman Drive, #101, Colorado Springs,
CO 80918, 719-531-9400); assistive technology (Parents Lets Unite for 
Kids, 1500 N. 30th, Billings, MT 59101,406-657-2055); or early childhood 
(Pilot Parent Parents, 2150 E. Highland, #105, Phoenix, AZ 85016, 
602-468-3001). To find out more about the over 70 PTIs in the 50 states, 
Palau, and Puerto Rico, contact <b>Federation for Children With Special 
Needs</b> (95 Berkeley St., #104, Boston, MA 02116, 617- 482-2915).</p>

<dd><b>Libraries</b> are, of course, an invaluable infor mation source. To find 
disability information in your local library, look in the card catalog un 
der the subject you are interested in or ask the reference librarian. You 
may also find informa tion in an encyclopedia of associations; <i><b>Readers 
Periodical Guide</b></i>, a listing of magazine articles; or through a computerized 
magazine article search (for example, InfoTrac). Univer sity and medical 
libraries also have CD-ROM resources, such as MedLine, PsychLit, and others,
 which have academic journal informa tion. For full text articles, try 
FirstSearch and UNCOVER, which contain articles published since 1988 from 
17,000 journals.</p>

<p><dd>Many libraries now have computers carry ing the <b>Internet</b>. Type in your 
desired topic, and within seconds, a listing of information sources is 
available. (For those with home computers, families are finding <b>on-line mailing
lists</b>, where people trade information on a specific topic, helpful. One of 
the most popular is <a href="http://wonder.mit. edu/ok/list-welcome.html"><i>Our Kids</i></a>).</p>

<p><dd>If you cant find what you want, ask the librarian for an interlibrary loan 
search (free use of books from other libraries in your state.) You can also 
suggest books for your library to buy. Resource directories, such as the 
inex pensive Directory of <i><b>National Information Sources on Disabilities</b></I> that 
includes more than 1,000 organizations, resource directories, and databases 
(NARIC, 800-346-2742) or <i><b>The Self-Help Sourcebook</b></i> (St. Charles-Riverside 
Medical Center, 25 Pocono Rd., Denville, NJ 07834, 201-625-9565) that has 
information on over 700 different support organizations are good choices. 
You also might recommend publications sold by <b>book stores</b> (many of which 
have disability sections) or organizations.</P> 

<dd>Various publishers, too, distribute books on disability. Two publishers of 
special note are <b>Woodbine House</b> (800-843-7323), which has parent guides on 
specific disabilities, The Special Needs Reading List: An Annotated Guide 
to the Best Publications for Parents and Professionals, as well as other 
relevant products. <b>Paul H. Brookes Publishing</b> (800-638-3775) offers 
selections in early intervention, community integration, sexuality, and 
aging written by leading innovators in the developmental dis abilities 
field.</p>

<dd><b>Local, state, and national organizations</b>, including clearinghouses, 
volunteer and professional programs, independent living centers, 
governmental agencies (such as each states Developmental Disabilities 
Council or special education department) also are important resources. 
<b>Federal agencies</b> have a wealth of information.</p> 
<h2>Try:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research</b> funds 
300 programs, including rehabil itation research and training centers
studying different disability aspects, such as substance abuse, personal 
assistant services, supported employment, specific disabilities, and more.
(National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, Office of 
Special Educa tion and Rehabilitation, U. S. Dept. of Education, 400 
Maryland Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20202, 202-205-9151.)</p>

<p><li><b>University Affiliated Programs for Persons With Developmental Disabilities</b>
 (over 50 programs) offer information, evaluation, technical assistance,
 etc. (8630 Fenton St., #410, Silver Spring, MD 20910, 301-588-8252).</p> 

<p><li><b>National Organization for Rare Disorders</b> researches diseases, tracks 
legislation, and has chapters through out the U.S. (NORD, Box 8923, 
New Fairfield, CT 06812, 203-746-6518, 800-999-6673, 
http://www.NORD-RDB.com/com /`orphan)</p>

<p><li><b>National Health Information Center</b> refers callers to nonprofit and

<title>How To </title>
</head><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFe8"><IMG SRC="btiny.jpg"align=right><h3>Beach Center How To:<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1>How To Use Group Parent Power to Make Things Happen</h1>

<p><dd>Have you ever heard "There just isn't enough money" when you ask for a 
service for your child. Or "Be patient." Then there's "Be realistic-- your 
child has limitations." And the ""That's how we've always done things."</p> 

<p><dd>Don't get mad. Redirect that energy to fight for your child. You can
get a lot done by yourself to get services for your child. You can get so 
much more, though, working with fellow parents and others to improve your 
child's life and get what that child is entitled to under the law.</p>
	
</p><dd>According to <i>How to Organize an Effective Parent/Advocacy Group 
and Move Bureaucracies</i>, (a fantastic book published by Family Resource 
Center on Disabilities, 312-939- 3513), your group needs to:</p>

<li>Plan and select goals</li>
<li>Identify potential members</li>
<li>Plan group activities</li>
<li>List tasks to be accomplished</li>
<li>Delegate duties</li>
<li>Follow-up</li>

<p>Let's build on those basic group steps.</p>

<h3><b>Plan Goals</b></h3>

<p><dd>What would you like to happen in your community? More inclusion of 
children with disabilities in public schools? Increased training of school 
personnel? Transition services for those finishing high school? Improved 
accessibility? Employment opportunities? More parent participation in your 
child's educational program?</P> 	

<P><DD>Have everyone in your group tell what he or she needs most. Don't stop 
there. Then have everyone imagine an ideal life for his or her child and 
what it would take to get that ideal life. Add those to the list, too!</p>

<h3><b>Identify Potential Members</b></h3>

<p><dd>Ask your child's teacher, counselor, or  school principal for the 
names of other parents with special needs children. When you ask those 
people, tell them to ask their family and friends to be involved. Ask your 
doctor, social services, or a related organization for names. A good place 
to start is your state's Parent to Parent program: Call the Beach Center on 
Families and Disability (913-864-7606 or 864-7600) for information on one 
in your state.</p> 

<h3><b>Plan Group Activities and List Tasks to Be Accomplished</b></h3>

<p><dd>Every group is different and will have its own plans. One tip is to 
concentrate on one or two activities at first: Don't try changing everything 
at once. Techniques that groups have used include public information 
campaigns, public rallies, boycotts, mail campaigns, public hearings, and 
other actions.</p>

<p><dd><i>A note on strategy: Napoleon Bonaparte had a victory record still 
studied today. His strategies- -how he thought and acted--were simple: He 
learned as much about the enemy as possible so he could think like the enemy. 
He knew his own army's strengths and weaknesses. He was more concerned with 
winning the war, not every skirmish. He drilled and practiced his troops to 
perfection. He was able to change his strategy when a situation changed. 
Each one of these strategies will help your group succeed.</i></p>

<h3><b>Delegate Duties</b></h3>

<p><dd>Give everyone a job. That makes them feel needed and takes the work 
load off the two or three people who tend to end up doing everything. Think 
back-ups, too. People may say they are going to do something, but not do it, 
so have reinforcements ready.</p>

<h3><b>Follow Up </b></h3>

<p><dd>Figure out what you want and go for it. Sweat the small stuff but 
don't let your group get bogged down by paper trails, personalities, and 
hesitancy. Ask each other and the people you want to impact "when" an 
action is going to be done, not "if."</p>

<title>How To Better Cope With a Family Member's Disability</title>
</head><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFe8"><IMG SRC="btiny.jpg"align=right><h3>Beach Center How To:<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1>Better Cope With a Family Member's Disability</h1>

<p><dd>Perceptions are the ways we view things in our lives. Changing the
way you think about a challenging event may help you feel better about that
event. It may even give you additional strength to make improvements in your
family's life. Research has shown a link between perceptions and successful
functioning. Basically, four types of perceptions can make you feel better
and improve your family's functioning.</P>

<p><b>1. The view that your child's special needs exist because of some
specific cause or reason.</B> This is called causal attribution. For instance,
you may feel your child's disability is the result of something you did
(or did not do). Or what a health care professional did (or did not do).
Or that genetics, a special purpose, or even fate caused the disability.</P>

<center><table Cellpadding=2>
<td align=center><p><i>God has his reasons and never gives you a<br>
burden too heavy to carry.</i></p></td>
<tr>
<td align=center><i><p>Well, it's not my fault. It's something that is<br>
passed down through the family. Others<br>
before me have dealt with this, so can I.<br><p><i></td>
<tr>
<td align=center><i><P>Now that I know what my child's diagnosis is,<br>
I can move forward and do what needs to be
done.</p></i></td>
</table></center>

<p><dd>Identifying a cause makes people feel more in control of their
situation. That control gives them strength. (Do you think your child's
disability is the result of some cause? If so, what? Does that make you feel
better in any way?)</P>

<p><b>2. The view that you can control some things that happen in the life of
your child with special needs.</b> This is called mastery. If you think you
can do something, you have a far better chance of doing just that than the
person with no confidence.</P>

<dd><p>You can gain a sense of greater control by gathering as much information
as possible. You may have heard the phrase "Information is power." There is
truth in that old saying.</p> 

<dd><p>Some people may join a parent advocacy group to make sure their child is
fully included in daily school or renovate their house for their child with
special needs. Taking direct action makes people feel better about their 
life.</p>

<center><table cellpadding 2>
<td align=left><i>I didn't just sit there singing the blues.<br>
I went down to my local library and <br> 
went through all their stuff. They even <br>
ordered some books for me. Then I talked<br>
with other doctors and compared what they <br>
said to my books. I wrote letters to my <br>
legislators when therewas a bill going to be<br>
passed that I didn't like. I even joined the<br>
advisory board of my child's early<br>
intervention program. Sitting around isn't <br>
going to help my child or me.<br>
</I></td></table></center>

<p><dd>(What have you actually done for your child with special needs? Did
that make you feel better? Is there something else you can do for your
child?)</p>
  
<p><b>3. The view that your situation--when compared with that of another
individual--is better than that of the person you compared yourself with.</b> This is called social 
comparison. Some parents compare themselves with other parents who seem to 
be handling their lives well. In doing so, these parents get encouraged by 
the good job they see. ("If they can do it, well, so can I.") Then again, 
parents may compare themselves with others who are doing about the same.
("At least we are not alone.")</p> 

<p><dd>If parents compare themselves with people whose lives seem more
difficult, they may actually feel fortunate about a situation that had
previously seemed difficult. Along this same line, people often say about
their own lives: "It could have been worse." This view makes them more
accepting of life circumstances.</p>

<p><dd>(Do you ever compare yourself with somebody else who has a child
with special needs who is coping very well? What do you think makes that 
person cope with the situation better? How about your child?: Could that 
child's condition be worse than it is today? If so, aren't you glad that it 
isn't?)</p>

<p><b>4. The view that your child with special needs contributes in a good way
to your family and others.</b> This is called positive contributions. Have you
ever seen someone look at you in pity when that person notices your child 
for the first time? Or heard someone say, "I'm sorry," when you tell them 
about your child? When people react that way it is because they think a 
child with a disability is a burden; they see only the negative, not 
the good.</p>
 
<p><dd>But, your child may have taught your family patience, brought your 
family together, enlightened the family with a new perspective--a number 
of contributions. Your child, too, may have a beautiful singing voice, 
cheerful attitude, brilliant mind, or a host of other impressive talents or 
characteristics.</p> 

<p><DD>(How has your child changed your family for the better? What is one 
positive trait your child has? Would your family be better or worse off if 
your child was not with you?)</P>

<title>How To Learn About Laws That Impact Your Family's Life</title>

<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1><b>Learn About Laws That Impact Your Family's Life</b></h1>
<h3><b>How Laws Are Made</b></h3>
<ol>
<li><p>A bill is written, then makes its way through legislative process.<br> 
There are three types of bills.<br> 
<br>
Legislators can:<br>
<dd>a. Create a bill ("new bill")<br>
<dd>b. Extend an existing law that is ending("reauthorization bill")<br>
<dd>c. Set aside money to fund a program("appropriations bill")<br></p>

<Li><p>A member of the legislative body introduces and sponsors the bill and 
encourages others to support it, too.</p>

<li><p>A subcommittee studies a bill. Hearings are heard on the bill. Changes 
are made. A bill can be killed during this process.</p>

<li><p>Legislators debate the bill, then pass or defeat it in vote.</p>

<li><p>The bill goes to a conference committee where different political 
parties revise the bill while compromising.</p>

<li><p>The bill is signed into law, or vetoed. If vetoed, it can still be 
passed if enough legislative members vote for it.</p>
</ol>

<p><dd>As you can see, there are many steps where a bill can be defeated or 
changed. That is why you must know what is happening at all times to make 
your voice known.</p><br>
  
<h3><b>To get a copy of a federal law or bill, contact:</b></h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The Congressional Status Office<br>
202-225-1772<br></p></li></ul>

<p><dd>Each state has similar offices that you can contact for information.</p>

<h3><b>Know the Law</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>1950: Title XIV of the Social Security Act sets up a federal public 
assistance program for people with disabilities ("Aid to Disabled")</p></li>

<li><p>1965: Social Security Amendments (P.L. 89- 97) creates 
Medicaid/Medicare that pays for health services for people who are poor, old,
or have disabilities</p></li>

<li><p>1971: The Intermediate Care Facilities Programs let public institutions
get federal money if they provide "active treatment," a law that encourages 
many states to rely on institutional settings for people with disabilities
</p></li>

<li><p>1973: Rehabilitation Act of 1973 expands rehabilitation programs and
includes Section 504 that sets up civil rights protection under federally-
funded programs for people with disabilities</p><li>

<li><p>1975: Education for All Handicapped Children Act (P.L. 94-142) 
guarantees rights of children with disabilities to a free, appropriate public 
education and gives money to states for special education services. This act 
was modified and became the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act in 
1990.</p></li>

<li><p>1975: Title XX of the Social Security Act supports services that help 
people be self- sufficient and not need institutional care. Changed to the 
Social Services Block grant in 1981.</p></li>

<li><p>1986: Education for All Handicapped Children Amendments (P.L. 99-457,
Part H) provide federal support for infant, toddler, and preschool-age 
children's services.</p></li> 

<li><p>1988: Fair Housing Amendments Act protects against discrimination on 
basis of disability.</p></li>

<li><p>1990: The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) (P.L. 101-336) 
guarantees equal opportunity for people with disabilities in employment, 
public accommodations, trans- portation, state and local government 
services, and telecommunications.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><dd>These are just a few legislative landmarks.  An excellent source for 
information on special education law is <i>Free Appropriate Public Education:

<title>How To Tell People What You Want</title>
</head><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFe8"><IMG SRC="btiny.jpg"align=right><h3>Beach Center How To:<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1>Tell People What You Want</h1>

<p><dd>Advocacy means to make a change that will benefit some person, group,
or thing. This change may be correcting a wrong, improving a system, 
creating a new law, or whatever needs to be done. An advocacy effort can 
be a letter, phone call, letter to the editor, petition, protest 
demonstration, boycott, lawsuit, or other action. Stuffing letters for a 
campaign, sharing experi ences with other families,  or helping others by 
baby sitting while they work for change are all advocacy.</p> 

<p><dd>Often, your family member with a disability is unable to advocate for
his or her self. That means you must do if for him or her.  Some efforts 
will be easy; but, in honesty, more will be uphill battles without a clear 
beginning or end. When you think you are done, often you will find another 
effort is needed.</P>

<p><dd>A crucial part of advocacy is telling people what you want. Being 
assertive will help you accomplish your advocacy goal. This means you must stand up 
for the rights you are fighting for. To do that you must be direct, honest, 
and give clear expression of your feelings. Steer away from confrontation 
("start a fight") comments, name calling,  defensiveness, or blaming. Be 
businesslike and keep your cool to show that  you are confident and in 
control. State what needs to be said without being apologetic. Show an 
understanding of the other's situation, but keep on course.</P>

<p><dd>Part of effective communication is to really listen to what others 
say. When you show that you respect the person and are willing to learn, 
your efforts will create a more positive environ ment. Listening, too, will 
help you concentrate on the discussion, which is helpful when emo tions are 
running high. A good communication aid is to rephrase what the other person 
said. That keeps that person and you clear on what was actually said.</p>

<h3><b>Winning Communication</b></h3>

<p>1. Identify what you want. What is the problem or goal?  What changes are
needed?</p> 

<p>2. Get the facts that you need to obtain your goal. First, find the 
person you need to talk with to make changes. If change relates to the law, 
for instance, find state legislators' names and ad dresses  in the blue 
pages of your local tele phone book or ask the reference librarian at your 
local public library. If you only know the agency, organization, or school, 
find out the chain of command so that  you talk with the person in charge of 
decision making. Document all facts you will need in advance (people's com 
ments, costs, school/medical records, policies, research information, 
others' experiences). Keep copies of all written communication. Also, list 
advocacy effort expenses.</p>  

<p>3. Get a notebook for recording whom you talked with, what they said, and
when and where they said it. This keeps information clear for you and will 
give your future communications more accountability. Take that notebook with 
you on appointments. It is especially helpful when someone says something 
negative. When negative or threatening comments are made, immediately start 
writing. When the person is finished, read back what you wrote and ask if 
it is correct. When you do this, you will have made the other person know 
that he or she must make responsible comments and let the person know you 
are serious.</p> 

<p>4. Ask others for help before you have your first contact. For instance, 
you might ask a parent or school staff member for information. Good places 
to start are organizations related to your family member's disability and 
the parent to parent support programs that exist in every state. You can 
find out your rights by contacting the state and U.S. Office of Education, 
your local Department of Human Services, members of Congress, state 
legislators, local League of Women Voters, local United Way public affairs 
department, or a lawyer (who in most cases is not necessary to help win your 
case, but can give you good information.) If you know influential people, 
ask them if you can use their names in support when you state your situation. 
Find out if anyone else in your area has a common advo cacy interest. If you
work together, you will have more strength and can support each other.</p>

<p>5. Decide an action plan. Know what you want to say. Figure out a brief, 
powerful way to say it. Give evidence to support each point.  Be as clear as 
possible to get  your message across. This is not the time for lengthy 
discussions or letters with many pages. Determine in advance the point of 
view the other person will express and be prepared with a counter argument. 
("There is no money: Money can be  repriortized--legally mandated programs 
must come first." "You must be patient: I have already waited___. ")</P>

<p>6. Before you call or meet in person the individ ual with the authority 
to make changes, rehearse what you are going to say. See whether  your 
message is clear. Get rid of distracting com ments. If you are writing a 
letter, consider your first effort a rough draft. Ask people for com ments. 
When you send the letter, make sure it is legible without any distracting 
typographical errors.</p> 

<p>7. If you think you are getting shuffled from one person to the next, 
stop the run-around. If you are at an office in person, ask the name and 
contact details of the person who is the author ity. Write the information 
down, and call that person right there on the spot to arrange an appointment. 
Do the same thing if you are talking to someone on the phone. Keep 
demanding the person who is accountable and put everything in writing.</p> 

<p>8. Follow up your call, visit, or meeting and ask what has been done 
about the situation discussed.</p>  

<p>9. Evaluate whether  your effort was successful. If so, monitor progress.  
Thank anyone who helped you. Besides showing your appreciation, you are 
helping ensure they will be more willing to help you or others the next 
time. If your effort was not successful, try to figure out why not. See if 
any next steps are possible.</p>

<title>How To Start Group Action Planning</title>
</head><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFe8"><IMG SRC="btiny.jpg"align=right><h3>Beach Center How To:<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1>Start Group Action Planning</h1>

<p><dd>Group Action Planning (GAP) is a dynamic way for people with a 
disability and their families to make dreams come true using allies with the 
knowledge, support, and commitment to get things done. Like Robert Kennedy, 
GAP prefers to see the world as it has never been seen, to ask "why not?," 
and to make positive changes for the person with a disability.</p>
<p>GAP meetings may be every week, month, or whenever. They can meet several 
times a year for  years on end. Then again, they can meet infrequently and 
still be a success. GAP also can work for people of any age or disability.</p> 

<h3><b>1. Invite Support</b></h3>

<p><dd>You can't do it alone. You know that. Start your group with your 
family, then look to your extended family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, 
people in your community--any person who has helped, supported, or 
appreciated your family in the past. Write those names down. Think about 
what your child does now. (Write down with whom the child does these things.) 
Think of what you would like your child to do. (Get those names, too.)</p> 

<center><table>
<td align=left><li><p><dd>Before you ask anyone, determine the place to<br>
<dd>have meetings. Ideally, this would be in someone's<br>
<dd>home because you want a casual setting to<br>
<dd>put people at ease. If  this is not possible, use a<br>
<dd>restaurant, community building, or other <br>
<dd>accessible, comfortable place. Come up with a<br>
<dd>good day and  time. Then invite people.<br></p></li></td>

<tr>

<td align = left><li><p><dd> Explain to potential members what GAP is, why<br>
<dd> they would be a welcome addition, and that they do<br>
<dd> not have to make a definite commitment to the<br>
<dd> group. You only want them to experience the GAP<br>
<dd> meeting.<br></p></td>

<tr>

<td align=left><li><p><dd>Before you have an actual meeting, choose a<br>
<dd>facilitator  to steer the meetings. This person should<br>
<dd>listen well, connect well with people, and<br>
<dd>make others  feel valued. His or her job will be to<br>
<dd>set a comfortable discussion pace, maintain a<br>
<dd>positive tone, keep comments relevant, identify key<br>
<dd>points, summarize discussions, and assign tasks if<br>
<dd>needed.<br></p></td>
</table></i></center>	

<h3><b>2. Create Connections</b></h3>

<p><dd>At your first meeting (and in those to come) make sure people are 
acquainted with each other and know how valuable their support is. To 
encourage connection:</p>

<table><ul><b><font size=3>
<li>Leave ample time before and after the meeting for members to visit</li>
<li>Offer food</Li>
<li>Be alert to each other's special days and recognize those days</font></li>
</b></ul></table>

<p><dd>Every member benefits from meetings. Obviously, the family receives 
support, encouragement, and guidance; but so do other GAP members, besides 
getting a sense of accomplishment seeing positive developments and improving 
their own problem-solving skills. Members also create new relationships and 
find out that GAP, offers mutual support for all.</p> 

<h3><b>3. Share Great Expectations</b></h3>

<p><dd>Think big. Everyone needs to have a dream for their future. However, 
too often, people with disabilities and their families are not encouraged to 
have a vision of the best their life can be. When you think of ideal 
scenarios, think of job, home, friends, recreation, or whatever you like. 
This vision is the overall goal for planning. Once the vision is decided, 
figure out ways to make it happen. These great expectations are not etched 
in stone. They are fluid images of what is possible. Think "what if" and 
"why not." Push the limits of possibility.</p> 

<p><dd>Recognize that expectations will change. Outlandish dreams at first 
may seem like no big deal after time. Little dreams may grow and change into 
something no one would ever have thought. The unfolding of expectations is 
an exciting, dynamic process.</p> 

<h3><b>4. Solving Problems</b></h3>

<p><dd>Problems are really questions. Brainstorming is the easy process in 
GAP used to problem solve--that is--answer questions. The facilitator begins 
the process by asking the group to solve a specific problem with as many 
ways possible in a set time. The ground rules are simple:</p>

<b><li><p>All participants and ideas hold equal weight.</p></li>

<li><p>Quantity, not quality of ideas, is the goal.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone may speak often.</p></li>

<li><p>Building on another's idea is encouraged.</p></li>

<li><p>Negative and critical remarks are discouraged.</p></li></b>

<p><dd>After you have several ideas, examine the list and pick the best. To 
do this, discard impractical or impossible ideas. Decide the top three best 
ideas (which you may get by combining other ideas). Discuss their 
possibilities and problems, then pick the strongest.</p>

<p><dd>Find out what needs to be done to accomplish the idea, then split 
tasks among group members. It is a lot easier to have 12 people do one task 
than one person do 12 tasks! Isn't it?</P>

<h3>5. Celebrate Success</h3>

<p><dd>You don't have to solve problems at every meeting. You need a 
get-together every once in a while for pure enjoyment. Consider watching a 
sporting event, having a backyard cookout, or whatever you can do to have 
fun and feel positive about the group's successes. Have food and drink and 
let members know how much their support is appreciated.</p>   

<p>Does GAP sound like something that might work for you? If you want to 
know more about GAP, contact the Beach Center on Families and Disability at 
3111 Haworth, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kan. 66045 (913-864-7600) for

<title>How To Encourage Friendships for Children With a Disability</title>
</head><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFe8"><IMG SRC="btiny.jpg"align=right><h3>Beach Center How To:<p>
<center><img src="rainbow.gif"></center><BR>

</h3>
<h1>Encourage Friendships for Children With a Disability</h1>
<p><dd>Research shows that friendships give people with disabilities social, 
emotional, and practical supports and integrate them into community life. 
People with disabilities also bring their own gifts, such as acceptance, 
spontaneity, trust, simple enjoyment of life's pleasures, honesty, and 
several other contributions to their friends.</p> 

<p><dd>To facilitate friendships, you must be open to friendship development,
flexible, and perse vering. Orient toward the child's strengths and allow 
the child to make his or her own choices, because the ability to make 
respected choices develops independence.</p>
 
<p><dd>With younger children, you might have to teach the child how to 
interact with his or her peers in play. You will also need to educate peers.
Start by discussing the child's disability with playmates. Ask for questions. 
This en courages tolerance and understanding of indi vidual differences. If 
the child has a communi cation disability, tell playmates ways to commu 
nicate with the child with a disability.</P>
 
<P><DD>Studies indicate that group size influences social play of children 
with disabilities. Two or three children play better with a child with a 
disability than larger groups. Another tip is to vary the children in the 
group. More sophisticated children will be role models and have better 
communication skills. Less sophisticated children allow the child with a 
disability to exhibit more leadership and problem solving. Play activity 
also factors in connections. Some toys (balls or board games) promote play 
with other children. Toys (such as books or  cray ons) encourage solitary 
play. Organize materi als to promote interaction and have them in a defined 
area with sufficient space to play. Barbara Wolfe, University of 
Wisconsin-Eau Claire, who gives workshops on fostering young children's 
friendships, suggests games that allow children with disabilities to help 
children interact.</P>

<p><dd>For instance, Shoe Mix-Up, where children take off one shoe and close 
their eyes, while an adult hides the shoes and then tells children to search 
for the missing shoe, is one such game. If the child with a disability is 
unable to physically get his or her shoe, a peer will gladly help look for 
the missing shoe.</p>

<p><dd>With older children, research shows that peer tutoring, cooperative 
learning, disability- awareness training help children with and with out 
disabilities to socialize, play, and just hang out. Successful strategies 
are:</p>

<p><b>1. One-to-one matching.</b> Here, in a formal volunteer program (such 
as Best Buddies, Nat ural Ties), a similar-aged peer, often as an aca demic 
course requirement, is matched with a similar-aged peer who has a disability. 
Many long-lasting friendships emerge from these matches.</p> 

<p><b>2. Existing or formal networks.</b> In the McGill Action Planning 
System (MAPS), the child and family are asked to look closely at their 
environment and plan for a better life by examining the child's current 
relationships and coming up with ways to expand and improve those connections. 
A related method is Group Ac tion Planning, which brings together family, 
friends, and community members to regularly problem solve for and with the 
child with a disability. For those who have few or no rela tionships, Circle 
of Friends is a method where peers are invited to make a commitment to a 
child with a disability. Often, this is done in the school setting and can 
be part of an existing or new club. Promoted to students as an extra 
curricular activity, this "friendship club" should allow members to choose 
the relationship they want to develop and make sure the child with a 
disability is regarded as a peer at all times.</p>

<p><b>3. Community activities.</b> Many places in the community actively 
encourage people with disabilities to participate in their programs. These 
include the Young Men's Christian Asso ciation (YMCA), Boy and Girl Scouts 
of Amer ica, 4-H (which offers more than just agricul tural offerings), park 
and recreation programs, community theater groups, and volunteer 
organizations.</p> 

<p><b>4. Consciousness raising advocacy.</b> This approach where one person or a 
group goes into the community to discuss disability issues often leads to 
friendships.</P> 

<h3><b>Winning Strategies</b></h3>

<li><dd>Find opportunities to bring children together. A key trait of 
friendship is close proximity and<BR>
<dd>frequent opportunities to socialize.

<li><dd>Highlight the child's strengths and gifts.

<li><dd>Have the physical environment accessible to the child with a 
disability.

<li><dd>Encourage independence. Follow the childs lead.

<li><dd>Collaborate with general education teachers.

<li><dd>Present information on disabilities to others to promote 
understanding.

<li><dd>Teach social skills. Talk to your child about how to make and 
keep friends.

<li><dd>Expect people to accept the child.

<li><dd>Have the child attend the neighborhood school.

<li><dd>While planning the childs school goals, include community 
activities and developing<BR>
<dd>relationships.
 
<li><dd>Give the child time to spend with friends.
 
<li><dd>Invite community members to participate in your familys life.

<li><dd>Prepare the child to answer questions that others typically ask, 
such as Why do you use a<BR>
<dd>hearing aid?

<li><dd>Consider how the child can make the best pos sible first impression 
in terms of clothes, hair<BR>
<dd>style, or greetings.

<li><dd>If the child has communication difficulties, offer meaningful 
comments to emphasize his or her<BR>
<dd>similarities to other children.

<li><dd>Be open to different types of relationships.

<li><dd>Encourage the child to make friends with others  who have empathy--
who can stand in the<BR>
<dd>shoes of another.

<li><dd>Get information on Circle of Friends, Group Action Planning, or 
other person-centered future<br>
<dd>planning approaches.

<li><dd>Realize that true friendship needs some basis for exchange 
(reciprocity).

<h3><b>How You Say It</b></h3> 
     Finding your exact audience--those
who want and need your information--
is a true challenge.  Said Daphne
Larkin, former disability columnist for
<i>Parents</i> magazine, "Take the esoteric
and make it of interest to the general
public. The general media is not
interested in specific disability pieces.
It has to be part of broad piece." <p>
     That may be true for the general
media, but a parent who has a child
with a specific disability wants
specific information. <p>
     So, often when sending out one
message, you have to "translate" it  for
various audiences. <p>
   <b>  The Research and Training Center
on Spinal Cord Injuries</b>, for example,
has a fact sheet on locating informa
tion on spinal cord injury. One version
is for individuals with spinal cord
injury and their care givers, the other
for rehabilitation professionals.<p> 
     Louise Bower, National Conference
of State Legislatures, wants
information to the point. <p>
     Forget the methodology, she said.
Bower wants to know what is the
problem, what was learned, and
"Numbers, numbers, and more
numbers." <p>

     Audiences seem to want brief
information. Said one legislator to the
Beach Center, "I used to want
information limited to one page of
paper. Front and back. Now, half a
page tops is all I want. And hold the
jargon. Give it to me in straight talk."<p>
     Said Kathy McGinley, the Arc, "It's
this KISS rule of writing that works:
Kept Simple, Informative, Sexy, and
Slick." <p>
     In the last issue of <i>Families and
Disability,</i> we introduced our new fact
sheets. We applied our own KISS
formula and response to those 50 cent
fact sheets has been heartening. Our
three newest are:<p>
<ul>
<li>     How to Collaborate With the
     Family in Individualized
     Education Planning

<li>    Reduce Abuse and Neglect of
     Children With Disabilities

<li>    Encourage Friendships
     Between Children With and
     Without Disabilities
</ul>
     

We also have developed a general fact
sheet called <b>"Friends."</b> It gives tips for
children on making friends with
highlighted reference to  children with
disabilities. (We currently have a
research study on  how Hispanic
parents can help their children with
disabilities make friends.) <p>
     Easily understood by young readers,
this fact sheet will also be featured in
Free Stuff for Kids, published by
Meadowbrook Press to reach a greater
audience. This book has hundreds of
free offers for kids to send away for. 
School Library Journal calls this
book "an educational tool in disguise."<p>
     Just one more form of information
translation!<p>

<h5> How you say it becomes
especially relevant when dealing
with minority populations.
Illiteracy, said Egerton Foster,
Parents of Watts, a Parent
Training Information Center,
presents a major barrier to
information reception. The
solution, Foster said, is to staff
grass roots organizations with
people "who have been there" and
use videotapes and television
networks. (The Research and
Training Center on Native
American produces mostly videos,
in English and with a dual sound
tact for tribal language) for its
audience. Another communication
pitfall is language translation. AT
& T sends out communications to
30 different cultures in 20
different languages, including
Polish, and the West African
Dialect Twi. Those numbers get
higher because each population
has its own dialect. Spanish
leaders have told us that the
Spanish language has  20 dialects.
After carefully testing a one-page
Beach product with many
Spanish-speaking groups, we
thought we finally had it right.
Four months later, a group in
South America told us 20 word
choices lacked the preferred
nuances!</h5>

<h4><p>In collaboration with colleagues at Wayne State University, Dr.
Rhonda Montgomery is conducting a four-year longitudinal study
that will focus on cultural differences in the use of nursing
homes.  Past research and anecdotal evidence from providers
suggests that Black and Hispanic elders tend to use fewer formal
services.  Building upon previous work in service utilization
and factors affecting nursing home placement, this study focuses
on the effects of cultural and role expectations on use of
support services and, ultimately, nursing home placement of
impaired elders.  Over 400 families in the Detroit area are
participating in this study funded by the National Institute on
Aging.  Dr. Rob John also received a grant from the National
Institute on Aging to study the long-term care of
community-residing Navajo elders.  Dr. John subsequently
accepted a faculty appointment at the University of North Texas
and will complete this project in Denton, Texas.</p></h4>

<h4>The University of Kansas Gerontology Center was established by
the Kansas Board of Regents in 1977.  The Center is located in
the fully accessible, Dole Human Development Center.  Its
mission is to engage in research, education, and service in the
field of aging.</h4>



<h2>To fulfill its mission, the Center has three primary goals:</h2>
<h4>
<ul>
<li>to promote and conduct applied and basic research on issues of aging
<li>to develop and administer a multidisciplinary program of education for students, practitioners, and researchers in the field of aging
<li>to assist in the development and evaluation of programs and policies addressing the needs of elders.
</ul>
</h4>
<h4><p>	As a unit within the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span
Studies, the Gerontology Center has access to a broad array of
research support, accounting, and technical services.  Many of
the faculty affiliated with the Center also maintain an
appointment in an academic department or professional school
within the University.  Current affiliations include the
Departments of Sociology, Psychology, Human Development, Music
Therapy, Anthropology, Communications Studies, Health Education,
and Biological Sciences as well as the Schools of Business, Law,
and Social Welfare.  In addition, the Gerontology Center shares
support staff with the Research and Training Center on
Independent Living and is affiliated with the Center on Aging at
the University of Kansas Medical Center.></p>

<p>	The Gerontology Center has continued to expand its research
program and strengthen its education and service activities.  In
the past year, the Center completed two funded projects,
received continuation funding for three on-going projects, and
initiated 15 new externally funded projects.  In addition, for
the second consecutive year a member of the Center's staff was
awarded a fellowship from the National Institute on Disability
and Rehabilitation Research.  Another member of the Center's
staff, Susan Kemper, received the Balfour Jeffrey Award for
Excellence in Research in Humanities and Social Sciences.   In
1994, the Gerontology Center attracted nearly one million
dollars in external funding, an 11% increase over the previous
year.  The Center was successful in obtaining 7.2 dollars of
external funding for every dollar allocated to the Center
through the Board of Regents.  Thus, the Center has had another
extremely successful year in leveraging its core funding.</p></h4>

<h2>Functions of the Gerontology Center</h2>

<h4>The primary activities of the Gerontology Center include research, education, and community service.</h4>

<h2>Research and Program Development Activities</h2>

<h4>Through its research program, the Center promotes, supports, and
conducts applied and basic research concerning the aging
process.  While the Center is interested in all areas of aging,
it has a special interest in the social and behavioral sciences.
 A particular focus is on public policies and studies of
long-term health care and housing alternatives, communication
and aging, service utilization, and aging among minority
populations.</h4>

<h4><p>Dr. Rhonda Montgomery is the principal investigator of a
three-state study of nursing home programs and units that
provide special care for people with Alzheimer's Disease.  The
goal of this study is to carefully describe and measure care
practices and the care environment in 100 nursing homes and
assess their impact on the well-being and functioning of persons
with Alzheimer's Disease.  This four-year project is funded by
the National Institute on Aging as a part of a consortium of ten
national studies.  As a supplement to this study, Dr. Betty
Horton has received funding to investigate the utilization of
support systems by older adults with developmental disabilities
who reside in intermediate care facilities for the mentally
retarded.</p></h4>

<h4><p>Center staff are also engaged in research on community-based
housing alternatives to nursing facility care.  In recent years,
there has been an increase in the development of senior housing
options that fall along the continuum of care between
independent living and nursing facility care.  However, the
policies, practices, and regulatory procedures that govern this
programs vary enormously from state to state.  Dr. Mark Mathews
and Stephanie Mathews are co-investigators on a grant from the
Alzheimer's Association to conduct a legal and policy analysis
of assisted living statues and regulations in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia.  This descriptive review will result
in a computerized database of information that providers,
policy-makers, and researchers can use to help in the
development of assisted living policies, practices, regulations,
and research.</P></h4>

<h4><p>Currently, most long-term care is provided by family members. 
However, even willing family members often find themselves
unable to continue care when a relative needs daily assistance
with basic activities of living.  Drs. Mark Mathews and Deborah
Altus are co-investigators on a study, funded by the National
Institute on Aging, to evaluate an innovative alternative to
nursing facility placement.  The "Homecare Suite" is a fully
accessible, modular, accessory apartment that can be temporarily
connected to the home of a primary caregiver.   In the first
year of funding, in-depth interviews with five families who used
the Suite were conducted.  In addition, a survey of human
service professionals and family caregivers was conducted to
obtain their opinions on the Homecare Suite concept.</p></h4>

<title> Statewide P2P </title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FF8000" LINK="#008000" VLINK="#8080FF">
<h1 align=center><b>Statewide Parent to Parent</b></h1><p>
     Twenty-three states have statewide Parent to Parent programs, in addition to their local
programs. Statewide programs provide training and technical assistance to the local programs in many
different ways and make it possible for parents to be matched statewide. According to Beach Center
research, statewide programs appear to contribute to the number of local programs, which means that
Parent to Parent services are available to more families. <p>  
     One of the more established statewide programs--Parent to Parent of Georgia--in its early years
trained all veteran parents and provided technical assistance to new programs. <p>
     Now, while the central office in Atlanta still coordinates more than 30 local programs,
two regional satellite offices have been established to work more closely with local programs.
(Atlanta still remains the point of contact with referrals made to appropriate regional or local
programs.)<p>
     "We do what we call a double match," said Cathy Spraetz, execu-tive director of the
Georgia program. Whenever we can, we put someone in touch with two parents--a person in
their community and another parent whose child has the same disability. A statewide  database
helps us make matches. The toll-free number helped, too. Parents didn't have to think twice
about giving us a call for support. <p>
     "The other thing we did was identify money to reimburse our parents for long-distance
telephone expenses if we matched them outside their local calling area. That's been a great
resource. We've been doing that since 1987; we've never had any kind of abuse of the system.
In fact, last year we added a place on the reimbursement request form for parents to donate
telephone costs as in-kind support. Many parents have done just that.<p>
     Vermont and New Hampshire are organized similarly to the Georgia statewide program
with admin-istrative support, training and technical assistance, and matching all performed out
of the state office, and a common brochure and newsletter used by local programs.  <p>
     Several states, including North Carolina, Florida, Washington, New Mexico, Iowa, and
Virginia, have less centralization, but coordinate to varying degrees local programs.<p> 
     Arizona and California have yet another style of statewide organization. In Arizona, two
large Parent to Parent programs, which started at the same time as local programs, provide
technical assistance and a training manual to local programs throughout the state. Tucson
concentrates on the Tucson area, while Pilot Parent Partnerships in Phoenix  covers the
rest.     "Outreach is one major advantage of decentralization," said Nancy Morgan, Pilot Parent
Partnerships. "It could not be done well  from Phoenix. <p>
     "Rural areas and agencies know their own communities best. We cannot dictate their
best practices. To meet the need of training, we provide training to our most experienced pilot
parents.<p> 
     "They are four hours closer than we are and can provide training to other parents more
efficiently. That gives us more continuity. "<p>

Because so many parents are interested in learning more about the establishment and operation of a
statewide Parent to Parent network, the Beach Center has been conducting surveys of statewide Parent
to parent programs to learn more about their efforts. We are looking at their funding, organizing, training,
public relations, matching, use of computerized databases, collaborative efforts, and other components.
Data and a manual on developing a statewide Parent to Parent program will be available in 1997. For
those who want to know more,  the 1996 International Parent to Parent Conference will have an all-day
presentation moderated by  Beach Center staff on "Everything You Wanted to Know About Statewide
Parent-Parent Programs, But Didn't Have to Ask," featuring more than a dozen statewide directors. The
Beach Center will also be publishing information on this topic in the future.<p>

<h1 align=center><b>Parent to Parent Support</b></h1><p>
<img src="rainbow.gif"><P>
</center>
<p><dd>     Hundreds of active Parent to Parent programs provide emotional and information support to
parents by matching a veteran parent who has "been there" to a parent newly referred to the
program. Major program components include screening and training veteran parents, making
one-to-one matches between veteran and newly referred parents, and providing follow-up
support to each match. Many programs also offer  activities such as group meetings for
education and support, sibling activities, resource libraries, social events, and training opportu
nities for professionals.  <p> 
                          
<h2><b>History</b></h2><p>
<p><dd>      From the start, parents have had the lead role in Parent to Parent program development.
The first known Parent to Parent program in the U.S.  was founded by Fran Porter, a parent,
who collaborated with Shirley Dean, a social worker, in 1971 and petitioned the Greater Omaha
Arc (formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens) in Omaha, Nebraska, to set up a program
in which parents of children with disabilities could share information and emotional support
through a one-to-one match.<p> 
<p><dd>      In 1974, Patty McGill Smith, now executive director of the National Parent Network on
Disabilities and the mother of seven children, including one with a disability, heard about a job
opening at Pilot Parents."I thought it was a little part-time job that was going to take just a bit of
time and I could earn a little money. So I applied for the position. We had 20 couples at the time
who were trained Pilot Parents. We had the complete system of services just sitting there wait
ing to be activated. It was just a wonder to be able to put into place what had been the dream of
those planners. It never slowed down once the whole time I was there, and I was there five
years."<p>
<p><dd>      Shortly after Smith came on board, Pilot Parents received a regional developmental disability
grant covering the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri to establish Parent to Parent
programs. Within two years, those four states had 33 programs, and parents were calling from
all over the U.S. for information on setting up a Parent to Parent program in their area.<p>

<h2><b>Previous research</b></h2><p>
<p><dd>      Parent to Parent programs have been providing support to parents for 25 years. But it wasn't
until the Beach Center on Families and Disability analyzed data from its national survey of
program administrators, veteran parents, and referred parents in 1992 that anyone knew the
number of programs, their structure, services offered, budgets, and the answers to a host of
other questions.  This information has proven useful to those wanting to start a Parent to Parent
program and for established programs.<p>

<h2><b>Beach findings</b></h2><p>
<p><dd>      From the survey, the Beach Center learned that there are over 500 active programs serving
an estimated 35,000 parents across every region of the country. These programs range from
those serving just a few parents to very large ones serving several hundred families (with the
average program serving 13-25 referred parents at a time). Some programs have no annual
budget, (over half operate with less than $5,000) while a few have $100,000+ budgets. Slightly
fewer than half of the programs have a paid coordinator, and all veteran parents are volunteer. <p>
<p><dd>      Most programs are cross-disability. Of referred parents, 85% have a child with special needs
younger than 12, although increasing numbers of veteran Parent to Parent programs match
families with adolescents and young adults. Early intervention legislation, too, has influenced
matches, with more families connecting to programs in the early months following their child's
birth.<p> 

<h2><b>Project director comment</b></h2><p>
<p><dd>      Said Betsy Santelli, Beach Center Parent to Parent project director, "We came to understand
that Parent to Parent programs vary on the continuum of one-to-one support. <p>
<p><dd>      "Some programs follow the original Pilot Parent model initiated by Fran Porter, Shirley Dean,
and Patty Smith precisely, carefully making one-to-one matches between trained veteran
parents and newly referred parents. <p>
<p><dd>      "The progress of each match is followed, and ongoing support is available to the veteran
parents as they pilot the referred parents. In other programs, matches happen more informally,
and training for the support parents may not be a formal program component.     <p>
<p><dd>      "Yet in all programs, parents connect one-to-one to other parents to share emotional and
informa-tional support."<p>

<h2><b>Current Research</b></h2><p>
<p><dd>      Parents and professionals have said for years that Parent to Parent supports are valuable.
But no scientific data had ever been collected on the effectiveness of these programs. "The
need for hard data on the efficacy of Parent to Parent is enormous," said Nancy DiVenere,
director of Parent to Parent of Vermont. "We know this process is one of the most powerful
forms of support that we can provide for families of children with disabilities. We know that
when parents are strengthened, their children are strengthened." <p>
<p><dd>      Because parents and program directors wanted research on the value of Parent to Parent, a
group of parents and researcher met together in 1992 to plan the study. This consortium
submitted a grant to  the National  Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR)
to conduct a national efficacy study. NIDRR granted the funding for a 3-year study that began in
July of 1993. Dr. George Singer, University of California-Santa Barbara, directs the project that
involves parents and researchers in Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont, and
New Hampshire. <p>
<p><dd>      While the final data have not been analyzed, preliminary data suggest that for parents of
younger or more recently diagnosed children, one-to-one Parent to Parent support significantly
increased the sense of having a reliable ally and being able to cope. This support also led to a
reduction in the amount of stress these parents felt. Parents of older children reported that the
support helped them get their emotional and informational needs met. For all parents in the
study, satisfaction with Parent to Parent support increased with the number of contacts 
received from the supporting parent.<p>

<b><i>Iliana Hernandez, Parent to Parent
Hispanic, Miami, Florida</i></b><p>
<p><dd>      I don't look Hispanic, but I am 100%,
born in Cuba, of Spanish descent. In 1986,
I helped found Parent of Parent of Miami.
My first attempt inviting parents to a
Spanish-speaking meeting was a translated
flyer. Guess what happened? <p>
<p><dd>      Nobody showed up. That's when I said,
"Well, if I want to start helping my people, I
have to know my people." <p>
<p><dd>      I started researching and educating
myself, and interviewing families from
different countries. A few months later, I
invited them to a support group, and it was
packed. We needed more than language.
We needed cultural understanding.<p> 
<p><dd>      For instance, something I realized is the
impact of the grandmother. There is nothing
more powerful in a Hispanic family than the
grandmother. That old lady is the one who
sets the rules of the house. Another thing
that works well with Hispanic families is
one-to-one support.  We work more
effectively on a personal basis. We hate
papers. Parents tell me, "I don't want to
read it. I want you to tell me what you have
for me. I want you to tell me that you trust
me, that you are going to do something for
me."<p>
<p><dd>      My best strategy to reach Hispanic
families is the radio. Guess why? Because
grandmothers listen to the radios. Mothers
that work in factories listen to radios. <p>
<p><dd>      Once a year, I talk on the Spanish radio
stations in Miami about our services. From
the callers, fifty percent of the listeners
were grandmothers who will tell their family
and friends. In my culture, we use  word of
mouth a lot. <p>
<p><dd>      We also acculturate materials. 
For example, we make our support notices
in Spanish personal. It's like if you have this
problem, you need to come to help your
child, rather than come to a "support group
meeting" at the hospital.<p>
<p><dd>      Fathers, they ask me a lot how  to get
Hispanic fathers involved. Use their energy
and abilities. Tell them you need to fix
something and they will come. Once there,
invite them to be part of the meeting.<p> 
<p><dd>      I also work a lot with migrant workers. I
take my husband to migrant camps and
train parents. I have to take my husband,
because if I  address a Mexican worker, it's
not going to work. Typically, men pay more
attention to other men. <p>

<b><i>Ruth Tracy, Arizona, Pilot Parent
Partnership, Ganado, Arizona</i></b><p>
<p><dd>      I got involved in the Navajo Parent to
Parent as a single parent. Of my five
children, I have four daughters and an 11-
year-old son who was born with Down
syndrome. My husband left after our son
was a year and two months because of the
disability, the shock. I brought in grand-
parents outside the extended family to
come in to help that year.  I used other fam-
ily, too. We are at least four clans. I couldn't
use my parents because they were in
shock.<p> 
<p><dd>      My family related the disability back to
my long walks, since there has never been
anyone in our family tree who had given
birth to a child with a disability.<p>
<p><dd>      What we do at the Navajo Parent to
Parent, we do real slow. We don't think in
calendars. <p>
<p><dd>      Our cycles are according to the
conservation of the universe and the earth
and the seasons, and so we put these into
our grant applications.<p> 
<p><dd>      How we work is through the Navajo
nuclear family and the grandparents and
the siblings of that parent. Disability is a
shock to all of them. Usually the nuclear
family members come up and are real
supportive of each other. <p>
<p><dd>      The way I make contact is one-to-one.
Now it is just starting, where they want
groups or gatherings.    There are  certain
teachings and sharing of information.
Sometimes you do this mainly with women
and then do it with the men. <p>
<p><dd>      Then when you get together, even if
there are just two of you, you are sharing
your whole self. You also go through
prayers or bless the mountains within the
season.<p>
<p><dd>      That's how we do it, and it's real slow.
When you go to a parent, she or he will not
make any decisions the first time you
contact them.<p> 
<p><dd>      You meet their basic needs first, and
then you help to get resources and link
them to services. <p>

<dd>      However, as soon as the doctor read the sonogram, she said: "Go to the hospital immediately.
One twin has almost no amniotic fluid. It's twin-to-twin transfusion."<p>
     <dd> Overnight, the Squires family changed dramatically. Confined to a hospital bed for the remainder
of her pregnancy, Sara gave birth to Abigail and Kimberly nine weeks prematurely. Seventeen months
later, doctors formally diagnosed Kimberly with cerebral palsy. <p>
<dd>      Sara did not know where to turn. Then a social worker gave Sara a brochure about Families Together, 
the Kansas Parent Training Center. <p>
<dd>      Said Sara, " I did not know anything about CP [cerebral palsy], the disability world, or anything.
I was very naive. I called, and found myself talking with another parent. I did not have to say a whole lot.
She knew exactly where I was coming from. She knew the exact resources I needed."<p>
<dd>      Sara and Lyle started going to parent training workshops offered by Families Together, and soon
<dd>      Sara became a trainer, then a full-time staff member. A year later, Families Together established
a statewide Parent to Parent program; Sara became the program's first statewide coordinator.<p>
<dd>      Not long after, the opportunity arose for Sara to be part of the consortium team of parents and re-

searchers conducting a national survey to determine the effectiveness of Parent to Parent. <p>
<dd>      "I had been bitten by the research bug. I was the one at meetings asking, 'How do you do that?' I
was the parent, the non-researcher, and I wanted to know.'"<p>
<dd>      Presently, Sara works at the Beach Center as a research assistant. Her average day consists of
monitoring the progress of the research, answering phone calls from people interested in starting Parent
to Parent programs, and responding to parents, asking "I have a child with such and such. Where do I
go?" Sara usually points them to their local Parent to Parent program, because she's a believer.<p>
<dd>      "The very nature of Parent to Parent is people going above and beyond. Parent to Parent
programs do wonderful things day in, day out.<p> 
<dd>      "I heard about this one mom traveling by herself across the U. S. Her car conked out in rural Ne-

braska. She  called the local Parent to Parent program. The program coordinator called a mechanic, put
her up for the night--the whole 40 yards--then hooked her up with assistance the rest of her trip!"<p>
<dd>      The Squires (Lyle, 45, Sara, 43, Courtney, 18, Joel, 12, Abigail and Kimberly, 5) continue to
benefit from their local Parent to Parent program. <p>
<dd>      "We use matches when Kimberly is in transitional times or, for instance, with power mobility. I
was matched with three other parents who gave me ideas and input. Then I have had matches around
financial issues: We always seem to fall through the cracks, and there just are financial realities that
come with having a child with a disability. <p>
<dd>      "Leg braces--every six months. Power wheelchair. Eyeglasses. And, of course, there are lots of
tests and that long line of specialists. Our Parent to Parent network helps us make sure we get what we
should be getting."<p>

<center>
<h1 align=center><b>Best Support Practices<p>
Pierson Award.</b></h1>
<img src="rainbow.gif">
</center>

<p><dd>  To learn more about best practices in Parent to Parent programs, Beach Center staff
asked programs to share their ideas in 1991. Two years later, over one hundred programs had responded.
The result was A Treasury of Best Practices, a source book with listings in program development, special
family issues, strategy implementation, program-developed materials, and contact information. The
Beach Center continues to compile ideas. In fact, this year, the Beach Center initiated the Pierson Award
that honors and celebrates excellence in Parent to Parent programs. Funds for the Pierson Award come
from the James McDonald Fowler Fund, established by Sherleigh G. Pierson at the Kansas University
Endowment Association  in memory of Jamie, who was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy in a time
when family-centered approaches were not widely available. <p>
<p><dd>      The award will be presented at the International Parent to Parent Conference held every two
years. Descriptive information about each nominated program is included in the Pierson Award
Directory, available at the International Parent to Parent Conference and through the Beach Center.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Training medical students.</b> Parent to Parent of Vermont not only provides training for veteran parents,
but also provides training for preservice medical students, nurses, speech language pathologists, physical
therapists, and early interventionists preparing to work in the disability field. In partnership with the
University of Vermont, it established a four-part seminar required of all medical students. Third-year
medical students visit families whose children have a chronic illness or disability, listening and learning
from the perspective of families about the kinds of lessons that cannot be taught in a clinic or classroom.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Expense reimbursement.</b> For easier recruiting of prospective veteran parents, Pilot Parent Partnerships
in Phoenix, AZ, reimburses veteran parents for mileage and telephone costs on behalf of the referred
parents.<p> 

<p><dd> <b>Diverse populations.</b> To meet the needs of its Tacoma, WA, population, Pierce County Parent to Parent
has set up informal sharing groups for Asians (Cambodian, Laotian, and Korean), military families, and
fathers.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Greeting cards.</b> As a promotion and fund raiser, TRENDS in Holland, MI, has holiday greeting cards
featuring art work done by children with Down syndrome.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Retreat.</b> Family Support Network of North Carolina holds a beach retreat once a year for its
coordinators. "It is a wonderful weekend. We go to the beach. Nobody ever believes the work we get
done," said Lynn Blanchard.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Response options.</b> When new parents are referred to Down Syndrome Society of Rhode Island, DSSRI
responds within 24 hours by presenting parents with the options of meeting a veteran DSSRI member or
receiving the New Parent Package in the mail. New parents are also given a free one-year membership to
DSSRI, which includes newsletter subscriptions.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Puppet show.</b> FACE (Friends for Aid, Correction, and Education of Craniofacial Disorders), Sarasota,
FL, produces an award-winning puppet show about individual differences and prejudice. The show  is
presented to elementary students.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Break time.</b> In Portsmouth, NH, the Parent to Parent coordinator has worked with area hotels and
restaurants for "Respitality" outings, which give local families time off from their responsibilities.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Peer program.</b> Parent to Parent Walla Walla /Columbia, WA, collaborates with the school district in
Children Helping Children, a peer mentor program that assists children with disabilities in accessing
community recreation activities.<p>

<title> Parents Say </title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFffe8">
<h1 align=center><b>What Parents Say About Parent to
Parent</b></h1><p>
<center>
<img src="rainbow.gif"><P>
</center>
<p><dd> <b>A parent writes:</b> Our support parents have been terrific! After our daughter was diagnosed with a major
heart defect that would require open heart surgery, we were given the number for a couple who had a two
year-old who had gone through the same surgery. Our support parents came down to see her in the
hospital, called us a lot, sent letters, etc. The dad even gave blood for our daughter's surgery. They live
two hours away but that hasn't been an obstacle. I hope everyone can have such a great experience with
their Parent to Parent programs.<p>

<p><dd> <b>The gift lives on:</b> At the birth of my severely disabled son, I instinctively felt the need to speak with a
mother exactly like me. I didn't know this support was available. I couldn't ask for the help I needed. I
truly believe in peer support, Parent to Parent support, and it has been my pleasure to be involved as a
volunteer in this field for the last seven years. The sense of really being helpful to families in crisis is
very gratifying and has led to great personal growth. My son is deceased and although I can no longer
care for  him, his life and pain he suffered are somehow justified through my helping others. <p>

<p><dd> <b>Seeing the light:</b> Our group was the foundation for our attitude and acceptance of our new life situation.
The parents and children helped us to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and the light that Kelsey
brings to our lives. Total acceptance of her has allowed her to be all that she can be, and she is a
beautiful, worthy person. She has brought a new dimension of love to our lives, and our parent group has
helped us to open our hearts to her. <p>

<p><dd> <b>A word of advice:</b> Ours is an informal program and the phone is used a lot to discuss problems or to
relay good information between families. You have to be there either physically or by phone when the
new parent needs someone to talk to. Listening is very important. Offering optimism is equally
important. I have found that taking my own child to the new parents can make them feel better--they see
a child capable of playing, seeing, hearing, etc.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Sharing hope:</b> When our son was born three years ago, my husband and I were shocked and devastated.
We called our Parent to Parent program, which supplied us with invaluable information, as well as send-
ing us a support couple to talk with. It was important for us to meet with a couple--not just a mother--
since my husband takes as much responsibility for caring for our children as I do. The couple sent to us
were such warm, optimistic, "normal" people, they gave us hope. About a year later, my husband and I
were trained to be support parents. The office has many requests for
visits from both fathers and mothers. My husband was one of very few men willing to go through formal
training. I have also found that support for non-English-speaking families is hard to come by. It has been
satisfying to serve the Spanish-speaking community.<p>

<p><dd> <b>Making needs known:</b> I was so afraid that our son wouldn't make it through those first few days, and
that I would never have a chance to hold him close to my heart. I didn't see how I possibly could with all
of the tubes and machines all around. The nurses on the unit were always so busy keeping these babies
alive that I didn't dare ask if I could simply  hold my son. Yet my arms ached. To have the veteran parent
practically insist that I make my own needs known to the NICU staff was exactly the gentle push that I
needed. And holding was exactly what we all three needed to get us through those first few days. <p>

<p><dd> <b>Valuable perspective in decision making.</b> I found the support from the veteran parent  extremely useful 
when I needed to make a difficult decision. Because she had also had to make this same decision, her
perspective was much more helpful than that of others who had not. She shared many of her own family
experiences with Ritalin, and in fact I even had a chance to talk with her son about how the Ritalin had
been for him. Their collective wisdom was just what I needed to make my own decision with confidence.<p>

<html><head><title>One Family's Story</title></head>
<body bgcolor = ffffe8>
<center><h3><b>One Dad Who Makes a Difference</b></h3></center>
<i>Bob Dale, Portageville, Missouri, is an active advocate for children with disabilities. The following are
excerpts from the chapter "Creating Answers" in 
<a href = "news215.htm">"Uncommon Fathers: Reflection on 
Raising a Child With a Disability."</a></i><p>
<b>Smile of beauty.</b> In February of 1990 my daughter Jessica, was a happy, healthy seven-month-old,
pulling up and walking along the edge of the sofa, smiling a smile so bright and beautiful that
angels were envious.<p>
     Today Jessica lies virtually motionless on her back--deaf, blind, and paralyzed, but still
smiling that angelic smile and displaying the nature of the unimpaired beauty that was born to us.
[Jessica had spinal meningitis.]<p>

<b>     A good cry.</b> Most fathers are told to do the same thing I was: <p>
 Be strong for your family.<p>
Sometimes I don't feel very strong. Someitmes I'm tired and want all of it to go away.<p>
 Sometimes I
cry. I let my two boys know they can cry, too.<p>
 Sometimes we cry together.<p>

<b>Taking a break.</b> How do you take care of Jessica, and Zachary, and Devon and Robbie and
yourself without blowing a gasket? <p>Over the years we have devised an answer: We escape!<p> I
arrange for help with Jessica from whatever resources are available and plan a time to do some-

thing with the rest of the family. I think the operative word here is plan.<p>

<b>     Appreciation of today. </b>How  do I characterize my relationship with Jessica?<p> I don't know.<p> 
     You need to realize that Jesse is not expected to live much past the age of twelve or thirteen,
so every moment with her is a precious gift; a point in time to be savored.<p> Every smile is a prayer
answered. Every time I stroke her cheek I feel a sense of wonder and appreciation that she is here,
with me now. <p>

<b>     Life directions.</b> Because of Jessica, I have increased my awareness of people with
disabilities.<p> I have become educated in many areas of policy and law, and I have attended over fifty
I.E.P. meetings, other than hers, to help other kids get the most out of their education. Because of
her I have met hundreds of parents, and talked at length with them about the challenges they face
raising their child with special needs. <p> I have lobbied our state legislature for Jessica, and together 
with hundreds of other parents, helped to effect positive change in the state of Missouri.<p> Because of
Jessica I have helped to raise the level of awareness on  to the part of state officials and educators.
All because of a little four-year-old girl. <p>

<H1>Windows CGI Test Program Usage</H1>
<A HREF = "/wsdocs/32demo/index.html#wincgi">Return to Self-Test</A>
<HR>
The CGI test program is a Visual Basic 4 (32-bit) application that
returns dynamically generated documents which report on various aspects
of the CGI interface. It also serves as an example of using the Visual
Basic CGI interface that is included with WebSite.<P>

To generate a particular report, add
"extra path information" to the URL. The test program interprets
this as a "selector" for the report and returns the selected
report. The valid selectors are:<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>CGI</B>
<DD>Reports the values of the variables as passed by the
server to the CGI program.

<DT><B>Headers</B>
<DD>Reports the MIME Accept: types and any "extra" headers that were
received from your browser.

<DT><B>Form</B>
<DD>Use this on a URL that is the target for a Mosaic form. It reports the
keywords and fully decoded contents of each of your form's fields.

<DT><B>Transparent</B>
<DD>This causes a short document to be returned directly from the Visual
Basic program to your browser, without interpretation by the server. This
is an illustration of the server's "transparent return" feature.

<DT><B>Empty - no extra path</B>
<DD>Causes this document to be returned by sending a one-line response from
the test program to the server that consists of "Location: /cgitest32.html". In
other words, a URL with "cgitest32.exe" as the target gives usage information.
</DL>

<H2>Examples:</H2>

<PRE><A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI?Query+Info+Here">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI?Query+Info+Here</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Headers">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Headers</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Transparent">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Transparent</A>
</PRE>

If your browser supports forms, you should see a form below. Fill it out and choose
the Submit button. The form's ACTION option is:

<PRE>ACTION="/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Form"</PRE>

The "search on" field supports multiple selections. Try it and see
how the server handles decoding it.

Here is the form:

     A few years ago, Dr. Vicki Turbiville was attending a class on collaboration between
families and service providers. The sole male there said he would rather talk with mothers
about their children than fathers. <p>
     Turbiville remembered thinking at the time that if male teachers don't want to talk with
fathers, then fathers must really be out of the information loop. This thought set in motion
a line of research centering around the priorities and preferences of fathers with children
who have disabilities and how  service providers respond to fathers.<p>
     Throughout the studies, Turbiville has been advised by a number of fathers who have
children with disabilities. "I'm obviously not a father," Turbiville said. "So to be sure that
what we do and what we learn is accurate and appropriate, I need feedback from those
who are fathers." <p>
     Routinely talking with fathers around the country, Turbiville has developed questions to
be answered by her research, conducted studies, and reported the findings.<p>

<center><h3><b>Research findings</b></h3></center>

     In her study, Turbiville found that fathers of children with and without disabilities
spend about the same amount of time with their children. 
While fathers whose children have disabilities reported spending a bit more time doing
child care, Turbi-ville said that the difference in the time they spent and time spent by
fathers whose children did not have disabilities was statistically  insignificant.<p>
     "I was glad to find that the results confirmed my hypothesis," Turbi-ville said.
"There have been sug-gestions that fathers of children who have disabilities are not as
involved with their children. My study found that not to be the case.<p>
     "The big piece was that both groups of fathers perceive themselves as equally good
parents. They feel equally competent."<p>
     Eighty-six fathers in Kansas provided the study information. About half of these
fathers had children who have mental retardation.<p> 
     Other findings included:<p>
<ul>
<li>     Fathers reported that they watch a lot of television with their children.
<li>     Fathers of children who had a disability reported spending more time at home than
     did fathers whose children did not have disabilities. 
<li>     Fathers of children who had disabilities were more inclined to hold their children
     and engage in nonverbal interaction (e.g., tick-ling) than were fathers of children
     who did not have a disability.

<title> Beach Center Fact Sheet</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffe8>
<i><h5>How To:</h5></i><hr>
<center><h2><b>Involve Fathers More With Their Children With Special Needs</b></h2></center>
  Mothers are typically viewed as overseeing their children's education and
development, while fathers are thought to be less involved. There are good reasons
for this often true perception. However, better reasons exist to change it and to use
the commonly untapped resource of fathers when working with a family that has a
child with a disability. <p>
  Unfortunately, there isn't much research on fathers and even less on fathers who
have children with disabilities to guide the way.<p> 
  What is known is that fathers of children with disabilities think of themselves as
pretty much the same as fathers of children without disabilities. They both spend
about the same amount of time caring for their children and generally take on the
role of playmate rather than care giver. <p>
  As strong influences on the child and family unit, fathers affect their children's
cognitive, personal-social, and sex-role identification development.<p> 
  Children who have positive relationships with their fathers tend to have higher
achievement, motivation, cognitive competence, and better social skills.<p> 
  Fathers who view their children with disabilities positively also encourage
mothers in their child care activities. <p>
  Factors that influence a father's relationship with his child include the parents'
employment, their personal and cultural characteristics, and the child's traits
(including temperament and gender). <p>
  Service providers should value the participation of fathers and other male
family members. They should also recognize that every male in a child's life has
strengths and these strengths play a major role in family functioning. <p>
  Therefore, personally invite fathers and male family members to take part in all
aspects of service provision. Focus first on providing information to fathers, then
work on relationship building.<p>
  The following research knowledge can be used to encourage father-child
relationships and increase inclusion of fathers and other male family members in
programs.<p>
<ol>
<li> While fathers of children without disabilities spend more time with their
children out of the home in such activities as going to church, cleaning the garage,
or grocery shopping together, fathers with children who have disabilities tend to
interact with their children in the home. Often, this is because a father finds
routine activities less disruptive to the child and family. And the child's disability
might make leaving the home difficult. The father also may be uncomfortable with
public scrutiny of his highly visible child. Therefore, some fathers may be more
comfortable with activities that they can do at home within the home routine.

<li> Fathers tend not to follow activities suggested by educators. When
recommending activities, find out the father's particular present activities and
preferences. Build on these.

<li> Television watching, fathers report, is how they spend a great deal of time with
their children. Collaborate with fathers to identify strategies to increase child
interaction during television watching (e.g., lap sitting, questions about program
content).

<li> Fathers like problem solving. Focus on activities for fathers that incorporate
problem solving with their children, such as toy or transportation adaptation.

<li> Fathers' play differs from mothers' play, which typically is more educational in
nature. Fathers' play (often in shorter sessions) tends to be more physical,
spontaneous, and unpredictable. If planning father-oriented games and activities,
take note of the play difference.

<li> Fathers tend to engage in fewer verbal activities with their children than do
mothers. This can be exacerbated if their child has a disability because the father is
rarely taught how to communicate with his child who has a disability. Not
surprisingly, fathers report that they view the development of communication
skills with their children as a high priority. This may be particularly true for
fathers who have children with disabilities. Fathers suggest that they need
information on interpreting non-verbal cues of their infants and toddlers. 
<p>  Service providers should make sure that fathers have the opportunity to be
included in the family-centered services provided to children with disabilities and
their families. As with all family-centered practices, the mother and father can best
decide how to include the father.

with a disability, contact the Beach Center on Families and Disability at 3111

<center><h3><b>Current research</b></h3></center>
     Turbiville and Beach research assistants Terese Maier and Gard-ner Umbarger are

     Said Umbarger, a former special education teacher, "I like working on this project,
being a father myself. I appreciate the difficulties fathers face dealing with service
providers and general perceptions about male competency to deal with children."<p> 
     Currently, information is being sought from programs in early intervention,

<html><head><title>Dads Feel Left Out</title></head>
<body bgcolor = ffffe8>
<center><h3><b>Dads Feel Left Out</b></h3></center>
     Fathers often report that they feel like second-class citizens when dealing with
service providers. "One time I was trying to say that I felt like less than a parent when I
was dealing with service providers," said one dad. "But the words ran together and I ended
up saying 'I felt less apparent to service providers,' and that was true, too." <p>
     According to James May, Project Director, National Fathers' Network, Bellevue,
WA, their reasons for this are many.<p>
<b>     Service delivery schedules.</b> For one, professional services tend to be offered during
the day when many fathers are at their place of employ-ment. This typically results in
mothers, even employed mothers, becoming  the "experts" on the child. This situation can
leave fathers out of the information loop.<p>
<b>     Gender differences.</b> When a father does meet with service providers or attend a
program for couples, generally he will be surrounded by women, which may make him
uncomfortable.      Discomfort may arise from the providers' way of sharing infor-
mation, or it could be that fathers have needs that female service providers aren't
responding to adequately.<p>
     Said one dad, "A lot of the providers seem to be women. When they run into us,
well, we have a different set of feelings. We have frustrations that they may not be familiar
with. Sometimes they say things we don't appreciate." <p>
<b>     Self-expression difficulties.</b> Wrote another dad on the Internet, "It seems to me we
guys are less likely to share our feelings, do it rather badly when we do, and are more likely
to be blasted. When we talk feeling like the world is on our shoulders--this is not a discount
on moms who feel the same way--it is a feeling, not a rational statement of fact. I am told
that many fathers become overwhelmed and bail out of marriages when handicapped children
 enter the picture. Those of us who are working to stick it out need as much nurturing
(not more) as our spouses." <p>
     The difficulty in self-expression this father refers to makes it tough for service
providers to communicate with fathers. Service providers who encourage fathers to discuss
their feelings may find fathers unre-sponsive to this approach preferred by mothers.<p>
<b>     Child interaction differences.</b> Another fact that service providers need to recognize
is that fathers differ in expression from mothers. They also interact differ-ently with their
child, which may influence a provider's suggested activities and recommendations. <p>
     For instance, one father said he felt most useful to his 7-year-old son with multiple
disabilities when he made practical devices (e.g., drawing board to hold paper and
markers) to make his son's life easier.<p> 
     Another father of a young daughter with rare chromosome deletion said that his
wife was good at working with their daughter, but he was best at playing. His daughter
liked him to get down on his hands and knees and chase her.<p> 
     Or when she is in the bathtub and calls "a-dee-dee-dee," her word for "Daddy," he
replies,"I hear you in there,"which makes her laugh. This play benefits the child as it en-
courages exploration as well as increasing the child's self-esteem.<p>
     Making adaptive devices, play, and verbal interaction are ways that fathers prefer
to spend time with their children. If services are tailored to fit these preferences, then
fathers will be more likely to get involved.<p>
<b>     Inadvertent discouragement. </b>And, if fathers do get involved, service providers can
capitalize on that interest, rather than discourage it un- intentionally.  
Imagine what this  St. Louis father felt when he was called a "father hen" by service
providers, because he wanted to participate in his child's Individualized Education Pro-

gram (IEP) development. <p>
     Not only was it implied that he was over protective, but use of "mother hen" implied
that he was playing  an inappropriate role.<p> 
     His experience was similar to that of  Bob Dale, who said (see 
<a href = "news22.htm">One Dad Who Makes a
Difference):</a>  <i>"Once, after answering a social worker's questions, I was thanked for my
cooperation and informed that the worker would check my answers with my wife for
accuracy.<p> "I found this very curious, especially since the questions dealt with my work
record and employ-ment history. It would be easy to step aside and let my wife take charge
of these activities. After all, stepping aside was the message sent loudly and clearly to me
from many places. But my wife couldn't deal with this trauma alone.<p> 
     "It took two of us to handle all that was happening; service pro-viders would just
have to get to know  me and learn to accept, if not like, the fact that I was involved with my
daughter's life. " </i><p>

<body bgcolor = ffffe8>
<center><h3><b>One Dad Who Makes a Difference</b></h3></center>
<i>Bob Dale, Portageville, Missouri, is an active advocate for children with disabilities. The following are
excerpts from the chapter "Creating Answers" in 
<a href = "news215.htm">"Uncommon Fathers: Reflection on 
Raising a Child With a Disability."</a></i><p>
<b>Smile of beauty.</b> In February of 1990 my daughter Jessica, was a happy, healthy seven-month-old,
pulling up and walking along the edge of the sofa, smiling a smile so bright and beautiful that
angels were envious.<p>
     Today Jessica lies virtually motionless on her back--deaf, blind, and paralyzed, but still
smiling that angelic smile and displaying the nature of the unimpaired beauty that was born to us.
[Jessica had spinal meningitis.]<p>

<b>     A good cry.</b> Most fathers are told to do the same thing I was: <p>
 Be strong for your family.<p>
Sometimes I don't feel very strong. Someitmes I'm tired and want all of it to go away.<p>
 Sometimes I
cry. I let my two boys know they can cry, too.<p>
 Sometimes we cry together.<p>

<b>Taking a break.</b> How do you take care of Jessica, and Zachary, and Devon and Robbie and
yourself without blowing a gasket? <p>Over the years we have devised an answer: We escape!<p> I
arrange for help with Jessica from whatever resources are available and plan a time to do some-

thing with the rest of the family. I think the operative word here is plan.<p>

<b>     Appreciation of today. </b>How  do I characterize my relationship with Jessica?<p> I don't know.<p> 
     You need to realize that Jesse is not expected to live much past the age of twelve or thirteen,
so every moment with her is a precious gift; a point in time to be savored.<p> Every smile is a prayer
answered. Every time I stroke her cheek I feel a sense of wonder and appreciation that she is here,
with me now. <p>

<b>     Life directions.</b> Because of Jessica, I have increased my awareness of people with
disabilities.<p> I have become educated in many areas of policy and law, and I have attended over fifty
I.E.P. meetings, other than hers, to help other kids get the most out of their education. Because of
her I have met hundreds of parents, and talked at length with them about the challenges they face
raising their child with special needs. <p> I have lobbied our state legislature for Jessica, and together 
with hundreds of other parents, helped to effect positive change in the state of Missouri.<p> Because of
Jessica I have helped to raise the level of awareness on  to the part of state officials and educators.
All because of a little four-year-old girl. <p>

<center><h3><b>Research findings</b></h3></center>

     In her study, Turbiville found that fathers of children with and without disabilities
spend about the same amount of time with their children. 
While fathers whose children have disabilities reported spending a bit more time doing
child care, Turbi-ville said that the difference in the time they spent and time spent by
fathers whose children did not have disabilities was statistically  insignificant.<p>
     "I was glad to find that the results confirmed my hypothesis," Turbi-ville said.
"There have been sug-gestions that fathers of children who have disabilities are not as
involved with their children. My study found that not to be the case.<p>
     "The big piece was that both groups of fathers perceive themselves as equally good
parents. They feel equally competent."<p>
     Eighty-six fathers in Kansas provided the study information. About half of these
fathers had children who have mental retardation.<p> 
     Other findings included:<p>
<ul>
<li>     Fathers reported that they watch a lot of television with their children.
<li>     Fathers of children who had a disability reported spending more time at home than
     did fathers whose children did not have disabilities. 
<li>     Fathers of children who had disabilities were more inclined to hold their children
     and engage in nonverbal interaction (e.g., tick-ling) than were fathers of children
     who did not have a disability.

<center><h3><b>Current research</b></h3></center>
     Turbiville and Beach research assistants Terese Maier and Gard-ner Umbarger are
now identifying strategies that programs serving children between birth and age 8 are
using to involve fathers.<p>     
     Said Umbarger, a former special education teacher, "I like working on this project,
being a father myself. I appreciate the difficulties fathers face dealing with service
providers and general perceptions about male competency to deal with children."<p> 
     Currently, information is being sought from programs in early intervention,
preschool special education, Head Start, and community day care regarding approaches
used to include fathers in programs for their children; information from fathers on how 
they feel about those approaches; and how  they would like to be included. <p>
      If you would like to participate in the project, please contact Dr. Vicki Turbiville at
(913) 864-7607 or send email to

     Based on the study, Turbiville suggests that service providers: 
<h3><ul>
<li> Learn from fathers their priorities for their children and suggest activities that
     respond to those priorities
<li> Work with fathers to talk more with their children.
<li> Tap the problem-solving orientation of fathers, such as discussing ways to adapt
     toys.

<h1>A Little Bit of a Head Start</h1><P>
<img src="rainbow.gif">
</center>
<p>
<dd><i>When Anglica Salas started school in El Paso, Texas, she was bussed to a 
school outside her home district. "We started noticing that when Anglica 
went out in the community, she was an outsider in her own neighborhood," 
said her father, Armando. "She was an outsider because there was no 
connection between her and the other kids." By the time the next school 
year came, Anglica, 7, thanks to her parents' efforts, was in her 
neighborhood school and no longer an outsider.</i>

<p><dd>When his wife Norma was pregnant with Anglica, Arman-do had a dream. He 
dreamed they had a baby girl with light hair, three eyes, and two noses. 
He told his wife in the dream that they would comb the little girl's hair
over the side to cover the extra eye and nose. When Armando woke and told 
Norma about the dream, she said that the extra eye and nose on this baby 
would be something extra about the little girl that made her special. 

<p><dd>The baby born to Armando and Norma did not have an extra eye or nose. But 
the little girl did have an extra chromosome in each cell that gave her Down
 syndrome. From the start, the family found that raising Anglica, this 
little girl with light hair, wasn't that different from raising Consuelo, 
their other daughter. 

<p><dd>They treated Anglica the same  and expected her to take the same 
responsibilities. However, her parents noticed that she did have some 
setbacks in making friends. 

<p><dd>"Anglica fits in well with most settings. However, when you present her 
with a new environment, she just takes a little bit more time to absorb it 
than most of us do. 

<p><dd>"She is a little more obvious about it. Most of us have found a way to mask 
that. But I think we all feel the way she does." 

<p><dd>Her neighborhood school is where Anglica has made her two best friends--
Cindy and Victoria. Cindy and Anglica met eating lunch together, then they 
happened to be on the same swim team. Although in different classes, they 
were in the same Girl Scout troop where they renewed their friendship. 

<p><dd>Victoria, Anglica's other close  friend, is more of a "guide" who helps 
Angelica with her school work.

<p><dd>Norma said, "I was on the teeter-totter about Anglica's first friendships. 
At first she did not mingle in, even though she was with her cousins at 
Grandma's house. 

<p><dd>"Her cousins who are her same age did not encourage her to play. 

<p><dd>As they got older they would ask 'Why doesn't Anglica do this? Why doesn't
  Anglica. . .? 

<p><dd>The curiosity started coming in, and we explained Anglica to all of them. 
'Oh, okay,' they said. The cousins just needed to ask curiosity questions." 
  
<p><dd>"In the long run, I think she needs a little bit of a head start," Armando 
said. To give Anglica that boost, he has gotten involved with community 
activities that she is involved with. 

<p><dd>Said Armando, "When Consuelo is invited to a birthday party, we'll contact 
the parents and ask whether Anglica can come along. Then we'll volunteer 
to stay at the party and help. We've gotten to know the parents that way."
Armando also volunteered to help at catechism classes--which he did for 
Consuelo, too--and helped with the swim team. He thinks it would be a good 
step if the people who know Anglica--kids, swim teacher, catechism teacher,
inclusion specialist--got together so they would be comfortable about 
disability.

<p><dd>Norma, to help others understand Anglica, talks to the parents of 
Anglica's classmates.  "Let's let them know who we are and what we're all 
about,' I said to my husband. So we did." 

<p><dd>Consuelo also teaches others about Anglica and takes her sister wherever 
she goes. Consuelo's friends are Anglica's friends. "If they pick on 
Anglica because she looks a little different, I tell them not to.  People 
are starting to know that she's okay. They are learning to love her the 
same way as my parents and me."

<p><dd>Said Armando, "I think to some extent, parents should facilitate, but I 
think there's going to come a time where Anglica is going to run with it, 
you know. There are times now when she is starting to push us away. She 
says 'I'll do it. . . .I'll do it, dad.'

<p><dd>"In my culture, when you have daughters, you tend to be a little more 
overprotective. The guys, you give them almost free rein. With females 
we're more cautious. 

<p><dd>"I think that's one of our values that might get in the way of just letting 
the kids out the front door and go play in the neighborhood."

<h1>Friendships</h1><P>
<img src="rainbow.gif">
</center>
<p>
<dd>Beach Center researchers asked 86 parents who have children with disabilities 
what they wanted most to benefit their families' lives. Their response: We 
want to help our children develop friendships. Since the Beach Center's 
staff believe the smartest way to figure out what works is to go to the 
experts, we consulted the best--children and youth with disabilities 
experiencing friendships.<BR>
 
<P><dd>We also focused on friendships within the Hispanic population, known for its 
strong family and com- munity support systems. Working with Hispanic parent 
leaders, we interviewed children and their friends, parents, and teachers 
in El Paso, Texas; Bakersfield, California; Garden City, Kansas; and 
Hartford, Connecticut. Lois Weldon of the Beach Center produced typewritten 
accounts of the taped interviews, which were run through a software program 
to number written lines. Maria Lourdes Pereira Nunez, a graduate student 
from Assuncion, Paraguay, and Ann Turnbull, both of the Beach Center, then 
coded the numbered documents and identified the transcripts' main themes, 
issues, and recommendations.<BR>
 
<P><dd>From the coded data, we learned how peer support, parent facilitation, 
proximity to others, extended family, common interests, disability 
awareness, social skills improvement, Circle of Friends, similar background,
and family acceptance contribute to friendship. What the scientific data 
can't show, however, is the richness of the families' own stories. <BR>

<P><dd>That is why the Beach Center produced <i>Amistad: Stories of Hispanic Children 
With Disabilities and Their Friendships</i> that is now being included in the 
Beach Center product list.<BR>

<P><dd>All involved with the friendship project found their work inspiring and 
enjoyable.<BR>

<P><dd>Said Ann Turnbull, "I especially liked Danny's definition of friendship:  
'Friendship is someone who will always be there when you need them, and talk 
to you when you need help and when you don't need help. <BR>

<p><dd>'And they be there even when you have been, excuse my language, such a fool 
that nobody wants to be there, but your friend is there.'" <BR>

<h1>Friendships</h1><P>
<img src="rainbow.gif">
</center>

<p><dd><i>When Angel Figueroa was 6, his father died. Angel, who has physical 
impairments as well as learning disabilities, began having such behavior 
problems after the death that he was institutionalized. After five years, 
he returned to his mother's house.  Angel's behavior problems still cause 
difficulties but are gradually decreasing, thanks to the efforts of people 
in his life. One of them, Luis Delgado, tutors Angel, 13,  for four hours 
in basic math skills, reading, socialization skills, and conflict 
resolution.</i> 

<p><dd>Then, from 3-5 p.m., Angel goes to an adult learning center for more 
individualized instruction. If he attended regular school, he would be at 
the second-grade level, which, according to Luis, would subject Angel to 
ridicule. One person who never tries to hurt Angel is Daniel, his friend.
"Huh" is a word that Angel uses a lot, because he has a hearing problem. 
Often, kids make fun of him when he says "huh?" This laughter makes Angel 
want to fight with his classmates instead of start friendships. 
Through the years, Angel has also gotten in a habit of staring at people in 
a menacing way, "looking hard." Luis Delgado, often tells Angel to loosen 
up. Angel will then catch himself and smile, because he usually doesn't 
mean anything by his stare. Esther, Angel's mother, met Luis at a meeting 
and thought he might help Angel, who had been disobeying his mother, 
fighting with his sister, and having school problems. 

<p><dd>"The system has pretty much isolated him. Whatever he is right now is 
something that we--as professionals and the system--have created. "People 
have dealt with him in a way where he's not my problem, let me give him to 
her.' Then someone else gets him and has the same approach." 

<p><dd>To combat Angel's fear of failure and improve his social skills, Luis got 
Angel a YMCA membership and arranged for Angel to come in during the day to 
play basketball with adults. "They see him--these men 25-30-40-years-old--
and say 'Hey, Angel, how you doing?' He likes that and gets along really 
well with them. He never once has become angry or to the point where he 
wants to lash out."

<p><dd>Basketball reintroduced him to Daniel Vsquez, 19, also originally from 
Puerto Rico. 

<p><dd>Esther was happy about the friendship because Daniel did not use drugs like 
so many others, had similar interests, and had a sharing personality. Luis 
said that Daniel was the first person he knew in Angel's life whom Angel was 
not threatened by. 

<p><dd>"Of all the friends that I have, I prefer being with him," Daniel said 
of Angel. Even though he's younger than my friends, I get along better 
with him because it's like I can do anything. 

<p><dd>"I can say anything. It is okay with him. With my other friends I gotta 
watch what I say. I like the way he is. He's funny and stuff, but sometimes 
he finds it hard to, like, communicate with people. I let him know that he 
can take his time on that. 

<p><dd>"When he is ready to speak up, I tell him to let me and others know what he 
really wants to say to us."

<p><dd>Daniel calms Angel down when Angel gets angry. Because Daniel has his own 
temper problems, he thinks he understands why Angel gets mad so often. 

<p><dd>"The way we've been brought up, if you don't fight someone that bothers you,
 then you're a punk," Daniel said. 

<p><dd>"Now, a lot of people bother me, call me names, and push me around. 
Sometimes,  I'lI lose my temper because I got a temper that just goes off 
like that. 

<p><dd>"But I learn how to control it by talking, like Yo, why you bothering me, 
when I'm not bothering you? Why you pick on me?--I'm minding my own 
business.' 

<p><dd>"Sometimes I start problems because I be with my friends and I just want to 
be the center of attention. 

<p><dd>"I notice that what Angel be trying to do, too. He just want to have 
everybody focus on him. That's how me and him became good friends. Because 
we basically almost the same. I used to go to his house, and I see his 
brother and ask, Where's Angel?' 

<p><dd>"He say he's locked up. His mom told my mom and they told me. When you live 
in a project, you find a way to help somebody who needs help. 

<p><dd>"I knew his grandmother. My mom knew their grandmother. It was like we was 
family. That's the way I see it.  Like we were cousins. We stand together."

<p><dd>Angel said Daniel and he like to ride bikes, practice basketball, talk 
about what is happening on the streets, play Nintendo games, and, most of 
all, go to Esther's room where the tape player is. There they perform in 
front of the mirror to rap songs.

<p><dd>"We laugh, goof around," Daniel said. "We put hats on. We fool around. Like 
dance around and be silly. I enjoy it a lot, because we look like jerks and
 be silly, but the same time, we're enjoying ourselves."

<p><dd>Rap music is one area in which Angel considers himself an expert. Said 
Angel, "Daniel wants to be a rapper. I give him  advice like You use your 
own voice' or Do something with a beat. Then it sounds right.' 

<p><dd>"The way I'm trying to tell him to change a little bit." Angel, who likes 
to draw, also encourages Daniel to try new things with the graffiti-like 
paper drawings that Daniel likes to do. 

<p><dd>Both friends spend a lot of time, too, checking out the girls in the 
neighborhood. 

<p><dd>"The thing that I'm trying to help Angel is to make a few more friends, 
like girls," Daniel said. "I don't know if he's scared of girls or scared 
to talk to them, but he always tells me "Oh, that girl looks nice, she 
beautiful, she look good.' 	"I be like, You want to take the chance 
and cross the street and talk to her?''

<p><dd>"He'll say, Oh, no. I don't know what to say.' And I'll be like just 
saying to him to say the first thing that comes to mind."

<p><dd>To this, Angel replied: "I had girls before. I like take my time. When I 
really want to talk to a girl I just go up to her and say, What's up?' But 
sometimes I feel embarrassing talking to a girl in front of her other 
friends. I'd rather talk to a girl when she be by herself." 

<p><dd>No matter how interesting girls are, the two friends said that they would 
not let girls get in the way of their friendship. They plan on Angel 
learning to swim in the summer, getting Daniel a license to drive, and 
working more with their rap music routines.

<p><dd>If the past is any indication, then it looks like they'll do those 
activities and more. 

<p><dd>"Friendship is someone who will always be there when you need them," Daniel 
said. 

<p><dd>"I love Angel like a brother. From all the friends that I have, he's been 
the only one that I could look at and say We did all this, and we're going 
to stick together.'"

"extra path information" to the URL. The test program interprets
this as a "selector" for the report and returns the selected
report. The valid selectors are:<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>CGI</B>
<DD>Reports the values of the variables as passed by the
server to the CGI program.

<DT><B>Headers</B>
<DD>Reports the MIME Accept: types and any "extra" headers that were
received from your browser.

<DT><B>Form</B>
<DD>Use this on a URL that is the target for a Mosaic form. It reports the
keywords and fully decoded contents of each of your form's fields.

<DT><B>Transparent</B>
<DD>This causes a short document to be returned directly from the Visual
Basic program to your browser, without interpretation by the server. This
is an illustration of the server's "transparent return" feature.

<DT><B>Empty - no extra path</B>
<DD>Causes this document to be returned by sending a one-line response from
the test program to the server that consists of "Location: /cgitest32.html". In
other words, a URL with "cgitest32.exe" as the target gives usage information.
</DL>

<H2>Examples:</H2>

<PRE><A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI?Query+Info+Here">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/CGI?Query+Info+Here</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Headers">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Headers</A>
<A HREF = "/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Transparent">/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Transparent</A>
</PRE>

If your browser supports forms, you should see a form below. Fill it out and choose
the Submit button. The form's ACTION option is:

<PRE>ACTION="/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Form"</PRE>

The "search on" field supports multiple selections. Try it and see
how the server handles decoding it.

Here is the form:
<HR>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-win/cgitest32.exe/Form">

<B>Employee Locator</B><P>

Search on (multiple)<SELECT NAME="LookFor" MULTIPLE>
<OPTION SELECTED>Name
<OPTION>Title
<OPTION>Department
<OPTION>Location
</SELECT><P>

which <SELECT NAME="How">
<OPTION SELECTED>starts with
<OPTION>contains
<OPTION>is exactly
<OPTION>sounds like
</SELECT><P>

the following: <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Match-pattern"><P>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Use-Case" VALUE="Yes">Case-sensitive<P>
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Submit">

Eyes -- </b></font></font>
<font color="de0e04">
Go for a simple, easy gliding liner for a soft look. Shadow liners work best because they're powder based. Try using a black liner, emphasizing the lids for a strong look. Highlight area beneath brows with white shadow. Brows should look natural -- not too thick or thin. Make sure to brush brows into shape.

To counter balance accentuated eyes, play down lips with soft colors. Peach is good for daytime. For evening, opt for something stronger like russet or a matte red.
