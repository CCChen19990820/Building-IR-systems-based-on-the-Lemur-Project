<title>Why Congress Should Not Impose Mandates on Private Health Insurance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT IMPOSE MANDATES ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h3>
By Carrie Gavora<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 462<br>
September 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is poised to enact legislation which, for the first time, would require private commercial health insurance carriers to provide specific benefits. Such federal mandates inevitably increase costs while limiting consumer choice and competition. In particular, these proposed mandated benefits would increase the costs of health insurance premiums for employers, who then would either limit health benefits or pass the higher costs on to workers and their families in the form of lower wages. Worse, Congress would be establishing a precedent for legislative determination of what medical benefits, treatments, or procedures Americans must have in their personal insurance plans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Making Health Policy Through the Appropriations Process.</b> During consideration of H.R. 3666, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, the United States Senate by voice vote approved an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) that would require insurers to cover a mother and newborn for at least two nights in the hospital after a normal birth, and at least four nights after a caesarean section. Coverage for fewer days would be permissible if agreed to by the attending physician in consultation with the mother.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition, by a vote of 82 to 15, the Senate adopted a mental health "parity" amendment offered by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN). This amendment -- a scaled-down version of the mental health parity provision dropped from the recently enacted Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill -- would require group health insurers who offer mental health coverage and apply aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits on coverage either (a) to include plan payments made for mental health services under the aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits for medical or surgical services, or (b) to establish a separate aggregate lifetime and annual payment limit for mental health that is equal to or greater than the limit established for medical and surgical services. On September 11, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 392 to 17, passed a nonbinding instruction to conferees on the VA-HUD bill to adopt both provisions. Both the Bradley and Domenici-Wellstone amendments represent a not-so-subtle creep of government control over the health care market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Compounding State Regulation.</b> The overregulation of health insurance at the state level is a problem for both small businesses and insurers. In 1970, there were 48 mandated benefit laws (laws requiring specific treatments, benefits, or procedures) nationwide. As of 1995, because of intense lobbying by medical practitioners and advocates seeking coverage for various diseases, the number had risen to over 920. And this does not include almost 100 so-called anti-managed care laws (such as "any willing provider" and "mandatory point of service" laws) by which states restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with providers and establish cost sharing.<sup>1</sup>  The most prominent form of federally tax supported, employer-based health insurance is managed care. Because of the rapid expansion of this form of health care, with its restrictions imposed on both doctors and patients, state legislatures are rapidly increasing their regulation of the insurance industry. More than 1,000 managed care bills are being considered in state legislatures in 1996; 56 have been passed into law in 35 states so far.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Imposing Higher Costs.</b> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Senator Bradley's maternity benefit mandate would cost the federal government alone some $223 million over four years in increased outlays for Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and in lost revenues due to lower wages from increased health costs. The CBO also says that the new maternity benefit would increase aggregate premium payments for employee-based and individually purchased health plans by 0.06 percent. In addition to the extra costs for government programs, the CBO estimates that direct private-sector costs would increase by $180 million in 1998 and $220 million in 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to a CBO analysis conducted on behalf of the Senate Budget Committee, the estimated cost of the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity provision of the VA-HUD appropriations bill is less than the earlier version -- estimated at $618 million over 5 years (the provision sunsets in 2001).<sup>3</sup>  The potential cost also was reduced somewhat by a modifying amendment, offered by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), stipulating that if a group health policy experienced a premium increase of 1 percent or more in a given year due to this provision, that insurance policy could be exempted from the mandate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While both amendments attempt to address real issues -- namely, the equitable treatment of mental health services and the health and safety of mothers and newborns -- they are bad public policy. The federal government should not be in the business of determining what benefits, treatments, or procedures private health insurance must provide to patients. This should be a contractual decision between consumers and insurers, and between doctors and patients. Whether to cover treatment for mental illness (or any illness) should be an insurance contract issue, not a political decision or an area for congressional intervention.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, experience at the state level indicates that mandates typically are the product of intense lobbying by provider interests rather than sound health policy. Thus, Congress should realize that once one group of practitioners begins to benefit from legally mandated coverage for its services, others will argue for similar legal guarantees. In the meantime, the price of legally privileged medical benefits hurts legally underprivileged medical practitioners, because businesses or insurers have to cut back other benefits to accommodate the new law. Desperately fighting for equal treatment, the excluded practitioners and advocates for certain disease groups lobby intensively for expansion of the mandates. The slippery slope of mandated benefits is transformed into  spiraling costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Let Consumers Fire Bad Insurance Companies.</b> Rather than adopt bad health care policy, Congress should allow consumers to choose not only their health insurance coverage, but also the kinds of medical treatments and procedures they want at the prices they wish to pay. In a consumer choice system, individuals and families -- not employers or managed care companies -- would choose the health plans and benefits that best suit their needs. The mother of a newborn forced out of a hospital before her time should have the right to fire her insurance company. Individuals and families, given tax relief regardless of where they work, should be able to purchase comprehensive health insurance, including catastrophic coverage, without imposing high costs on the private health insurance plans of other workers and their families with different needs. While rhetorically packaged with phrases like "incremental reforms" or "patient protections," federal mandates -- especially on top of state mandates -- do nothing to reform America's health care system. All they do is raise costs and limit consumer choice and competition.

<li>The mental health parity provision agreed to earlier this year by the Senate would have imposed huge new costs on working families. The CBO estimated that premiums for traditional fee for service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would cost the consumer an additional 4 percent. Understanding that it is workers and their families that ultimately bear the costs of mandated benefits, the CBO predicted that this provision would force employers either to cut back other benefits -- or health insurance altogether -- or to pass the higher cost of insurance on to workers in the form of lower wages.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<title>Government's Hidden Tax: Time to Account for the Cost of Regulation - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>GOVERNMENT'S HIDDEN TAX: TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF REGULATION</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 459<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Senate is expected soon to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/z?cp104:hr660.104:">H.R. 3756</a>, the Treasury and postal appropriations bill, which includes funding for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On July 23, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment -- Section 645, offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) -- requiring OMB to prepare an accounting statement that estimates the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB already is responsible for reviewing regulatory actions to ensure that they are consistent with the Administration's regulatory principles and agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is much debate about federal taxes, spending, and the need to balance the budget, considerably less is known and understood about the benefits and burdens of regulation. Unlike federal tax and spending programs, no comprehensive cost accounting system exists for regulation. But regulatory costs -- $677 billion in 1996 -- are nearly one-half the cost of direct taxation. And the economic impact is significant; according to one estimate, federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity to be lost each year. Just as the annual federal budget allows policymakers and the public to debate and decide what programs to support and which ones to scale back and eliminate, information on regulatory costs and benefits would help them to determine what regulations do the most good for the money spent, set regulatory priorities accordingly, and minimize the burden on the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>A Good First Step.</b> Under the Stevens proposal, OMB would be required to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report on the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB also must report on the effect of federal rules, both on the private sector and on the federal government, and provide estimates of the costs and benefits of rules costing more than $100 million annually. The public would have an opportunity to comment on the OMB report before it is submitted to Congress. OMB also would have to offer recommendations to Congress and the President about how to reform regulatory programs that are not a "sound use of national resources."  This is a sensible first step toward improving oversight and promoting greater efficiency throughout the federal regulatory system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This proposal will be criticized by federal regulators and politicians. Regulation is one of the most politically convenient ways to carry out public policy because it typically does not require substantial, direct taxation or government spending. This is particularly appealing in an era of federal budgetary restraint. The Clinton Administration has put at least 10,000 new pages of federal rules on the books since 1993. But how much has this cost, and what did the American people get for their money?  Because regulators gain power by regulating as much as possible, with little to stop them from regulating as if it cost nothing, opponents will use the same misleading rhetoric against this proposal that they used to defeat a far more comprehensive regulatory reform bill in 1995. The following three myths are typical:
<p>
<b>MYTH #1: It is doubtful that reliable estimates of costs and benefits can be developed.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> There is no dearth of methodological tools available for estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations. The Department of Commerce regularly surveys business establishments to collect information on expenditures caused by particular regulatory programs. Since 1981, every President has required federal agencies to consider costs and benefits in their regulatory decisionmaking. To assist them, OMB developed guidelines for such analysis. Even though federal agencies try to avoid any effort to measure the costs and benefits of their actions, dozens of these analyses have been done over the last 15 years. Between 1990 and 1995, for example, EPA did at least 70 rule-specific cost-benefit analyses. Ironically, in 1993, the Clinton Administration removed hundreds of rules from OMB review, de-emphasizing the need for cost-benefit analysis.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #2: Any attempt to measure the costs and benefits of regulations will consume a significant amount of new resources.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> With more than 130,000 federal regulators spending more than $14 billion annually to develop and enforce regulations, how can more be needed?  The Clinton Administration itself recognizes that federal agencies -- which have been required to consider costs and benefits of regulatory actions since 1981 -- "are the repositories of significant substantive expertise and experience...."  In addition, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews rules before they are issued, has a fiscal 1996 budget of more than $5 million and a staff of about 30 analysts and economists with years of experience reviewing and evaluating agency cost-benefit analyses. During the Bush Administration, OMB reported on the aggregate costs of regulations in a publication that later was stopped by the Clinton Administration; no such information has been published since then.<sup>2</sup>  OMB already is in an excellent position to work with other agencies to prepare this statement, but Congress must demand that it be done and that it be made available to the public.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #3: This is just the first step in an effort to justify a "roll back" of important public health, safety, and environmental protections.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> The opposite would be true. Strengthening the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking would mean higher levels of protection. A recent Harvard study estimated that current regulation of health risks is so inefficient that for the same investment of resources, we could save an additional 636,000 years of life--60,200 premature deaths every year-- simply by changing our priorities.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress already are on record as supporting regulatory cost accounting as part of more comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in 1995. In addition, President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review requires federal agencies to "assess the costs and benefits" of regulations. The Stevens amendment simply suggests that the numbers should be added up so the American people can have some idea of the kinds of regulatory decisions their government is making and how good a job federal regulators are doing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is a good first step, and Congress must go further and implement a regulatory budget like the one proposed in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3277:">H.R. 3277</a> by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). A regulatory budget would force federal regulators to operate within limits, much as an agency's fiscal budget does. Both Congress and the President would be accountable to the public for making sure that economic resources are allocated in a manner that produces the greatest benefit to society.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

<h3>HOW MILWAUKEE'S CHOICE PROGRAM HELPS POOR CHILDREN SUCCEED IN SCHOOL</h3>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

School choice for poor children is likely to be an issue this year in many state and congressional races. The idea that low-income parents should be able to select the schools -- public or private -- they think best for their children strikes at the very heart of America's educational <i>status quo</i>. Lawmakers and parents therefore need to pay close attention to the quality of academic evaluations of school choice programs, including the samples used and methodologies employed. Evaluations of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, school choice experiment are a case in point.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1990, Milwaukee instituted the nation's first publicly funded school choice program, giving low-income parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. In February 1996, data from the Milwaukee school choice experiment were made available. Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy and Paul E. Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance have conducted a detailed assessment of this information.<sup>1</sup>  Their study, released at a conference this summer, reveals that:
<p><ul>
<li> The reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years were, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school students.
<p>
<li> Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The implications of these findings are extremely significant. As Greene and Peterson note, "If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before the release of the Greene and Peterson study, the Milwaukee school choice program had been evaluated each year by the man who designed it: political science professor John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Witte had concluded that "This school experiment [has] not yet led to more effective schools.... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents... but student achievement fails to rise."<sup>3</sup>  Because Witte and his fellow researchers did not release their data for secondary analysis by other members of the academic community until this year, their evaluation was the sole source of information on the test performance of Milwaukee school choice students. Many academic specialists, foundations, and policymakers therefore had concluded that while school choice clearly satisfied parents, it was not effective in improving the education of low-income central-city students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on their own examination of the data, however, Greene and Peterson found that the statistical model used by Witte and his colleagues failed to replicate the "character" of the MSCP experiment. The most significant flaw was that Witte's group compared choice school students with a much less disadvantaged cross-section of Milwaukee public school students. Witte had compared the choice students to a general sample of public school students, a group which was significantly different in several ways. For example, the choice students were more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers, making any comparison between them and the public school sample misleading.<sup>4</sup>  Correcting for these errors, Greene, Peterson, and their colleagues at the University of Houston and Harvard designed their own study -- a study which confirms a growing collection of evidence showing that private school vouchers are the key to educational success for students who are financially trapped in failing inner-city public school systems.
<p>
<b>HOW THE HOUSTON-HARVARD STUDY WAS DONE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greene and Peterson designed an analysis that would correct for the methodological errors of the Witte study. The difference between their conclusions and Witte's is the result of a scientific methodology made more rigorous in several ways. Among them:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Random assignment of students to the test and control groups.</b>
<p>
The Houston-Harvard analysis compared the choice students with students who applied to the choice program but were not admitted. The mandate imposed on the Milwaukee voucher program by the Wisconsin state legislature required Milwaukee's choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random; the result was two randomly selected groups of students: those who were chosen to participate in the program and those who were not. The system thus set up a unique opportunity for researchers to compare students in the choice program with public school students from otherwise eligible families whose parents had made an effort to seek an education for them at a private school. This improved "control" for the extent to which families value education and desire to participate in the program meant that any differences in outcome could reasonably be attributed to the experimental condition of choice. 
<p>
<li><b> Controlling for grade, year, and school.</b>
<p>
Students seeking to participate in the Milwaukee choice program applied each year for a place in a particular grade in a particular school (with spots, as indicated above, to be assigned randomly if the program was oversubscribed). The evaluation data allowed the Houston-Harvard researchers to control for both the grade to which a student applied and the year of application. Although the specific schools to which students applied were not included in the data, researchers were able to control for that variable by taking into account the ethnicity of applicants. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools; and virtually all of the students who applied to one of these schools were Hispanic, while virtually all who applied to the other two were African American.<sup>5</sup>  The Witte study had failed to take into account that the selection of students was random only by grade, school, and year.
<p>
<li><b> Measuring academic effects as cumulative.</b>
<p>
Rather than merely measure the changes in test scores from year to year as Witte did, the Houston-Harvard researchers measured the cumulative effect of the choice program on test scores for each child for the entire time the child was in the program. Controlling for gender, the test scores of choice students were compared with those of "non-selected" students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The effects of choice schools on test performance were small during the first and second years; during the third and fourth, however, choice students made substantial gains. According to statistical tests, positive results of this magnitude would not appear had Milwaukee choice schools had no effect on academic performance. One of the most egregious errors of the Witte study was that it controlled for a student's test score in the prior year, in effect controlling for the outcomes of the choice program and incorrectly assuming that students learn at uniform rates.
<p>
<li><b>Testing for possible errors due to limited data.</b>
<p>
As Professor Witte states, "In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected... students [and choice students] came from very similar homes....  They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement."<sup>6</sup>  However, the data available to the Houston-Harvard researchers covered only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. To ensure that these two percentages accurately represented the selected and non-selected groups overall, the Houston-Harvard researchers made several additional analyses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Family background.</b> Controlling for family background was difficult. Both test and background questionnaire data were available for only 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Even among those parents who did return a questionnaire, many did not respond to all of the items. Trying to balance between controlling for additional factors and preserving the size of the sample, the Houston-Harvard team controlled for family income and the mother's education. Those factors were chosen for two reasons: 1) Past academic research shows that these factors strongly affect a child's educational performance, and 2) most parents who returned questionnaires responded to those particular questions. Adding these two variables to the analysis decreased the sample size but changed the results very little. This confirmed that there were no significant differences in family background between those for whom complete background data were available and those for whom they were not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Prior test scores.</b> Two groups randomly assigned to two categories, as was the case in this study, can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the Houston-Harvard study did not control for test scores prior to the Milwaukee program. Because of missing data, however, the researchers checked and found that at the time these two groups applied to the Milwaukee choice schools, the available data showed that they had essentially the same test scores. In fact, those who were not selected scored one percentile point higher in both reading and math. Although the sample size for this analysis was reduced by the fact that test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, a statistical analysis was run on the figures that were available. With only one exception -- the fourth year reading scores, which had to be based on only 26 observations -- the results controlling for prior test scores were not substantially different from those found in the main analysis. This confirmed that there were no significant academic differences between those students whose prior test scores were reported and those whose scores were not reported.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Potential "selection effects."</b>  The Houston-Harvard study's main analysis clearly revealed statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. This presents two possibilities: 1) Either students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years, or 2) students remain in the program for three to four years only if they are benefiting from it. To determine which was the case, the Houston-Harvard researchers analyzed the first and second year scores of students for whom test results were also available in years three and four. The effects of the first two years were no different from the effects for all first and second year students. This would imply that the positive effects of school choice accumulate over time and are not due to different student retention rates.
</ul>
<p>
<b>OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Houston-Harvard analysis is more methodologically sound than previous studies of the Milwaukee school choice program. More important, its basic conclusions are supported by a growing body of research on the value of private schools among urban poor and minority children.
In 1990, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, examined the academic performance of children in New York City's public and Catholic school systems. The results were startling: Some 95 percent of Catholic high school students graduated, for example, while only 25 percent made it out of the public schools. Similarly, 75 percent of Catholic students took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but only 16 percent took it in the public schools.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A 1982 study headed by education scholar James Coleman of the University of Chicago found that students in Catholic schools were one grade level ahead of their public school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, the New York State Department of Education found that Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 per cent).<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the 1993 New York State Department of Education study also found that Catholic and public schools have similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, Anthony Bryk from the University of Chicago reports that Catholic schools expel far fewer children.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, in a study conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that among urban blacks and Hispanics nationwide, the probability of high school graduation rises from 62 percent to 88 percent when a student is moved from a public to a Catholic high school. The probability of college graduation for these children rises from 11 percent to 27 percent. In addition, when compared with their public school counterparts, minority students in urban Catholic schools can expect roughly 8 percent higher wages in the future simply because they are more likely to complete high school and college.<sup>11</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School choice is becoming increasingly popular, and polls show it is most popular among urban African Americans --  the very group served by a program like Milwaukee's. Because black parents are less satisfied with public schools, they want an alternative. A recent study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in research on African Americans, found that only 5.7 percent of African Americans rated their local public schools "excellent," compared with 19.9 percent of the general population. Conversely, 16.5 percent of the black sample rated their schools "poor," compared with only 7.4 percent of the general population.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the claims of the education establishment, choice does not leave children of poor families in failing schools. Rather, it is their ticket out. Schools of choice have proven their ability -- and their desire -- to improve the academic outcomes of poor children. Recently, Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York offered to take the lowest performing 5 percent of students in New York City's public schools into New York's Catholic schools, where they can succeed. This also would be a huge financial advantage for taxpayers. New York's Catholic schools educate students at about a third of the cost of public schools. A 5 percent transfer would save New York City over $250 million a year.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The academic success of Milwaukee choice students, as well as other students who have been fortunate enough to escape failing urban schools, is now a matter of record. It is time for state legislators and Members of Congress to give other lower-income children the same opportunity.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>

<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3>




By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 117<br>
August 19, 1996<br>

</center>



<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:

<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<title>High Layoffs and Long-Term Unemployment Cloud Jobs Picture - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3> HIGH LAYOFFS AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CLOUD JOBS PICTURE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 115<br>
August 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Announced Layoffs for the First Six Months of 1996 Continue at Rapid Pace<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Compared with Previous Economic Expansions, Long-Term Unemployment Remains High<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3:</a> Manufacturing Employment Has Declined for the Last Year and Remains 6.2 Percent Below 1989<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future. In fact, one of every five Americans believes jobs are hard to get, and well over one of every ten believes there will be fewer jobs in the future.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives too often approach environmental issues without a clear framework within which to explain to the public how the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth can both be achieved. This failure has allowed many conservatives to be characterized falsely as "anti-environmental."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is little understanding among Americans either of the need to reform environmental laws to maintain -- or improve -- protection for health, safety, and the environment, or of the fact that this can be done while simultaneously making them less burdensome to the economy. Until conservatives can explain more clearly why protecting the environment is not synonymous with adopting the "environmentalist agenda," they will be unable to build public support for badly needed reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although current environmental laws have not worked well, conservatives have not developed a cohesive vision to help Americans understand how these laws should be reformed. Moreover, when criticized by liberals, they have failed to challenge liberals to respond with proposals to reform these programs. It is important to show that the good intentions of current law often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless regulations. But it is imperative that conservatives also show why their policies would do a better job of protecting the environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, conservatives should stress the following themes:
<P>
<b>THEME #1: The Failure of Liberal Policies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to explain that existing statutes have had many severe side effects. Among them:
<ul>
<li><b> Exorbitant costs with little return.</b> Conservatives need to explain that while costs have continued to skyrocket, the benefits being purchased have plummeted. Indeed, many of these increasingly expensive regulations now do more environmental harm than good.
<p>
<li><b>Property confiscation and loss of economic freedom.</b> Conservatives need to explain that private property is being taken from Americans through unfair regulation, and that many government "solutions" to environmental problems conflict with basic property rights.
<p>
<li><b>Lost opportunities cost lives.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the policies of the environmental agenda save few lives while squandering scarce economic resources that could be used to save more lives if dedicated to more serious risks. In effect, today's badly designed policies can kill.
</ul><p>
<b>THEME #2: A Positive Vision.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to articulate more clearly a positive approach to the environment that emphasizes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>An ethic of conservation.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the need to conserve  natural resources-- or use them efficiently --  is not in dispute. The debate is over how best to do that -- through markets or through government controls. For instance, a market-based approach would greatly reduce air pollution, and at far less cost.
<p>
<li><b>Property-based solutions.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the best way to achieve many environmental objectives is to create incentives associated with property ownership, not to issue thousands of pages of rules. For instance, property rights can be used to protect threatened species more effectively.
<p>
<li><b>Priority setting saves lives.</b> Conservatives must explain that not all things are equally important or urgent, and that regulating all risks equally means fewer lives saved for the dollars spent than would be the case if priorities were set. Conservative policies can save more lives. For instance, reforming Superfund would save more lives by focusing efforts on eliminating the highest risks more quickly.
<p>
<li><b>States do a better job than the federal government.</b> Conservatives need to explain that states are in a better position to deal with environmental matters within their borders than is the federal government. For instance, with the safety of drinking water supplies determined by states, the states would likely no longer squander resources obeying federal mandates that, until the Safe Drinking Water Act was recently reformed, required them to test for chemicals not even found in unsafe levels. Instead, they might focus on the far more mundane but persistent, serious, and largely ignored problem of bacterial contamination.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives have erred in putting too much political stock in the significance of horror stories -- absurd or onerous cases of environmental regulation. Public dismay at these stories does not signify broad-based support for deregulation. Americans understandably fear that if the "regulatory safety net" were dismantled, the country would return to the days of smokestacks billowing black smoke and burning rivers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why the message of balancing environmental protection and a strong economy has fallen on deaf ears. The public is easily convinced that the argument for deregulation is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections. And many conservatives fan this fear by adopting decidedly anti-environment rhetoric. For conservatives to be successful in convincing the public to support more reasonable environmental policies, they must explain them far more clearly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A track record must be developed by which the public's hopes are met and their fears quelled. Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. The challenge is to show Americans how to obtain more of each.
<p>
<b>CRAFTING A SUBSTANTIVE MESSAGE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most Americans want both a strong economy and a clean, healthy environment. The problem is that environmental regulations can be enormously expensive, and can cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity. On the other hand, without environmental protections, robust economic activity, particularly manufacturing, often led to a deteriorating and unhealthy environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A generation ago, as people perceived that their quality of life was beginning to deteriorate, they began to support aggressive policies to reduce pollution levels. These policies frequently failed in their aims and became increasingly and unnecessarily expensive, but the environment did begin to improve. Today, many Americans are becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that, even when they work, they seem to bring only small improvements in the environment at a heavy cost in jobs and freedom. Moreover, many Americans are beginning to recognize that there often is no sound scientific basis for assertions of environmental harm or risk to the public. As families and businesses have begun to feel the economic effects and loss of liberty caused by these policies, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like most other people, conservatives have no wish to return to the days of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks.<sup>1</sup>  But they do want common sense brought to bear in dealing with the environment; they want reasonable environmental protection without having to sacrifice their freedom. At the same time, however, Americans generally want to be assured that reform will not lead to environmental deterioration. In other words, they trust conservatives to create jobs but question their environmental track record. If conservatives want to win the environmental debate, therefore, they must build that record and convince Americans that they hold the same values.
<p>
<b>HOW LIBERAL POLICIES FAIL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While pollution levels have dropped dramatically since 1970, most of these reductions were achieved early in that period and at relatively low cost. From 1970 to 1990, total emission levels fell by about 34 percent. Over the same period, lead levels in the air fell 97 percent, and carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 41 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As late as 1986, the annual cost of environmental protection was an estimated $87 billion. Since then, it has doubled to $174 billion.<sup>3</sup>  Meanwhile, environmental gains, which initially were very great, have slowed to a trickle as the federal government has run out of easy fixes and then attempted to eke out minuscule improvements in the environment at huge extra costs. These costs now represent about 3 percent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), or almost $1,800 per household per year.<sup>4</sup>
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff> Larry Mason's family sawmill employed 40 workers in Beaver, Washington. Says Mason, "in 1990, the spotted owl injunctions closed our mill, made my equipment worthless, and my expertise obsolete."<sup>1</sup>
<p>Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for 11 years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose their farm.
<p>Environmental regulations to "protect" people can cause death. The best example is the set of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to conserve energy and keep oil prices down. The only way auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building lighter autos. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, lighter autos are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. This substantially raises the number of highway deaths; the expected number for 1989 model year cars alone is 2,500.

</TABLE><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental regulations also have caused immense hardships for businesses and small property owners alike. In the name of protecting the environment, powerless individuals have been forgotten as their businesses flounder because of expensive "command and control" regulations that tell them what to do and how to do it. The cost to individuals often is not a factor in the design of rules. Likewise, and without compensation, property owners often are required to forfeit the right to use their land for its intended purpose because regulators want to use it for wetland preservation or endangered species habitat. This can ruin them financially.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, despite the skyrocketing costs and increasing hardship for ordinary Americans, the current system does not guarantee that the environment will continue to improve, or that Americans' lives will become any safer and their quality of life any better. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. For instance, instead of working to protect species, the current implementation of the Endangered Species Act has become the main impediment to recovery of species.
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why is this?  Consider that not a single species has recovered as a direct result of the Act.<sup>5</sup>  The few taken off the list so far were recovered for unrelated reasons (for example, the Bald Eagle, which benefited from a separate law protecting it) or because they were listed improperly in the first place even though always numerous (for example, the tumamoc globe berry). But when a listed species is discovered on a person's property,  the government  may restrict the landowner's right to use his property productively in order to preserve the habitat. The result: Landowners threatened with losing their livelihoods and property have little incentive to help maintain habitat. Indeed, the opposite is true. They are encouraged to eliminate habitat, perhaps through clear cutting, before restrictions are imposed in order to escape the devastating financial consequences. Thus, instead of encouraging landowners to protect endangered species, the Act often encourages them to destroy them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, some environmental regulations may be an indirect cause of deaths among Americans. A seminal Harvard University study found that 60,000 lives are lost unnecessarily each year because of the current regulatory regime. Dr. Tammy Tengs, now at the University of California at Irvine and the author of the study, summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost.... At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars."<sup>6</sup>

Viewing the problem from a different perspective, the regulations themselves can be fatal. Statistical analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs the government imposes on the economy, overall worker living standards are lowered enough to cause one additional statistical death.<sup>7</sup>  When this formula is used to compare the number of lives "saved" by a particular environmental regulation with the number of lives lost through lower living standards, it turns out that many regulations actually increase the death toll.
<p>
<b>HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for conservatives to approach the issue in a commonsense way that people can understand. Given the general skepticism, they must stress that the environment is something they want to maintain and improve -- and show that they mean it, not just with environment-friendly rhetoric, but with substantive policies that benefit the environment. Only by building a positive environmental agenda and track record can conservatives show that their reforms would create jobs and economic growth while also helping the environment. People need to be told that, while environmental protection need not come at the expense of jobs, it will cost jobs unless the model of centralized control of environmental protection is rejected. A better approach would be based on:
<p><ul>
<li> A conservation ethic (freedom with responsibility);
<p>
<li> Property rights;
<p>
<li>Priority setting; and
<p>
<li> A strong state role.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need for a Sensible Conservation Ethic</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives traditionally have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of environmental problems. Thus, they have fought environmentalists step by step -- and have lost step by step. The reason is not complicated: Environmentalists have occupied the moral high ground, even though they typically have not provided the most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have been on the wrong side of an emotional issue.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are two lessons to bear in mind:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First,</b> what leftists and the public at large understand is that publicly owned goods free of constraints on use will be depleted over time.<sup>9</sup>  Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at the University of California, in his seminal 1968 work <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i> showed that when a good is publicly owned (or "owned" in common), no one has an incentive to conserve or manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the good inefficiently (to deplete it) as each user tries to reap the benefits for himself. This fact is at the heart of most environmental problems such as air and water pollution and species extinction.
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Ten percent of the cars and trucks on the road cause over half of the pollution emitted by autos  and 20 percent of the autos cause more than 88 percent of the pollution. Yet the liberal approach has been to tighten standards for newer, cleaner cars rather than to attack the heart of the problem  -- older cars and untuned cars, and especially older untuned cars, which pollute heavily. Rather than making more regulations that add hundreds of dollars to the cost of millions of new automobiles to reduce their already low pollutant emissions by a few percent -- and aggregate auto pollution levels by even less -- it makes more sense to cut pollution levels by making the real culprits shoulder their share of the burden. Requiring heavily polluting cars to pay locally set fees or penalties based on the levels of pollution they emit as measured by remote sensing (similar in concept to a radar gun) could reduce car pollution levels dramatically, and at a fraction of today's onerous and illogical regulatory approach. Indeed, a pilot program by the state of Utah showed car pollution could be cut dramatically and cheaply simply by giving free tune-ups to the worst polluters. Moreover, by driving up the cost of new cars, regulations cause older polluting cars that are less expensive to be kept on the road longer, which works against the goal of lowering pollution.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second,</b> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people will conserve out of self-interest. Thus, giving people a vested interest in providing environmental benefits (for example, through property ownership and other positive incentives) encourages them to provide such benefits voluntarily.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes to certain resources like the air and water, conservatives have tended to ignore the first lesson, and consequently have lost the opportunity to implement the second.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Freedom with responsibility for one's actions" should be the conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful behavior. The old environmentalist slogan "Make the polluter pay" actually is consistent with this message. But when they say this, conservatives and liberals mean different things. As Al Cobb, then Director of Environment and Energy at the National Policy Forum, says, "What the environmental lobby means by that phrase is that corporate polluters should be punished severely for any pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean, however, is that polluters should bear the full cost of environmental degradation, but no more."<sup>10</sup>  Put another way, individuals and corporations should be given the incentive of reaping rewards for conservation and environmentally sound practices.
<p>
<b>HOW PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The free market actually encompasses the conservation ethic better than command-and-control regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however, only if private citizens can engage in trade, and people can trade only what they own: some form of property. Thus, property is the cornerstone of a free market. If property rights are insecure or publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively. Some critics call this "market failure," but it really is a failure to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. Resources that are not owned will be depleted or will deteriorate because neither protection of nor damage to those resources is part of the decision-making process. Others nevertheless are subjected involuntarily to the consequences of those decisions.
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
<ul>
<li>In the decade 1979 -- 1989, East and Central African elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million to less than half that. Yet in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased dramatically. The difference is that in Zimbabwe, hunting is permitted as a property right. Small villages that own the land on which elephants live and graze charge safari operators to conduct hunts. Since the villages profit directly, they have an incentive to promote herd growth to increase their income. In surrounding African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to curb incessant poaching. But in Zimbabwe, villagers are constantly on the lookout for poachers because they cost the village income. Zimbabwe and a few other countries reward the conservation of elephants by allowing the conservationists themselves to profit from their protective behavior. In each country where this approach is practiced, elephant herd sizes are increasing.
<p><li>In Scotland and England, the popularity of fishing has burgeoned in recent decades. In these countries, property rights to fishing sites have developed which formed the building block for markets to provide access to prime fishing spots. As a result, many private, voluntary associations have formed to purchase fishing rights access.<sup>1</sup> In Scotland, "virtually every inch of every major river and most minor ones is privately owned or leased . . . . "<sup>2</sup> Owners of fishing rights on various stretches of the rivers charge others for the right to fish. These rivers are not overfished because it is not in the owner's best interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. The owner wants to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, so he conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and prevents pollution from entering his stretch of the river. If a municipality pollutes the water upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can stop it by suing for an injunction. Everyone wins, including fisherman desirous of quality fishing with some privacy.
<p><li>
One group's approach to wetland protection has shown the power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks Unlimited (DU), a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is dedicated to enhancing populations of ducks. To do this, it has purchased property or conservation easements with privately raised funds. Unlike other groups that started as hunting/outdoorsmen organizations but have largely lost their original focus, Ducks Unlimited has kept its focus on the protection of duck habitat.3 In the last 58 years, it has raised and invested $750 million to conserve 17 million acres of habitat in Canada alone, which benefits other wildlife as well as ducks. In 1994, it restored or created about 50,000 acres of wetlands. Since DU pays market prices for the habitat it protects, this group in many ways embodies the essence of the conservative message, which is to allow the market to determine the best and highest use of a good or resource -- in this case, duck habitat.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives should concentrate on explaining the innovative ways property rights can be used to protect the environment. The most efficient method -- and the one that best protects individual rights and freedoms -- is to enlist self-interest in the service of environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, property rights are under attack in the U.S. from the environmental lobby. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," but this has been interpreted to give absolute protection only against physical takings or complete devaluation of property. Most property-rights infringements, however, involve federal bureaucratic decrees that owners may not use their property as they see fit (for example, by continuing to farm it). Since the courts have been unclear as to the degree of protection these property owners should have from such intrusions, legislative protection is needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Protecting and using property rights, either in a stand-alone Act or as part of Endangered Species Act reform, would work to protect species in America. The Act does not work. Indeed, as many species are delisted because they become extinct as are recovered. The Fish and Wildlife Service now virtually ensures that threatened plants and animals will suffer because of the disincentives thrust upon landowners who understand that the value of their land and their economic security will be wiped out when federal agents tell them they no longer can make use of their property. Merely taking away this fear by promising compensation would be a large step in ensuring peaceful coexistence between species and owners of the property on which the species live. Moreover, property rights automatically will work to help species whenever there is an economic incentive to do so, such as protecting valuable fishing streams. But property also can be put to work to benefit species. If property owners were given financial rewards whenever threatened species bred on their lands, the species would not be threatened for long. It is no accident that cows, pigs, and chickens are plentiful in this country; people have an incentive to breed them. It is time this lesson was applied to other species.
<p>
<b>WHY PRIORITY SETTING IS IMPORTANT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ask the average American how much a human life is worth, and you probably will be told that "no amount is too much."  This is the answer that Congress and federal agencies use to justify imposing sometimes staggering costs on businesses to reduce the risk of death by infinitesimal amounts. While this allows policymakers to posture as saviors of life, these policymakers also generally fail to understand that wasting resources in this way means not using them in other ways that could produce better results and save more lives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy has a limited ability to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country cannot afford to eliminate every risk. There is an inherent trade-off: Attempting to regulate one risk out of existence may mean having to tolerate others. Thus, it is critical that regulators recognize the opportunity costs of their actions. Spending enormous amounts of money to eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means not being able to use those dollars in productive ways -- publicly or privately -- that would benefit the nation more.


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It makes no sense to impose burdensome costs on consumers by, for example, regulating chemicals that are much less dangerous than everyday risks which average Americans, understanding that the danger is minimal, willingly accept. Yet that is exactly what the government does. For instance, the government routinely bans or regulates chemicals -- sometimes at the cost of billions of dollars -- whenever they pose a one-in-a-million chance of cancer, while simultaneously ignoring non-chemical risks hundreds of times greater that would be far less costly to regulate.
<p>
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Priority setting will save lives and improve people's lives. The cleanup of old industrial wastes, embodied in Superfund, is a good example. The biggest problem with the law today is that cleanups are progressing at an incredibly slow pace, partly because money is being spent on lawyers to fight cleanups instead of on the cleanups themselves. Moreover, the law has stymied attempts to revitalize poor inner cities; few industries are willing to locate on sites there because of the risk of liability for cleaning up some former businesses' wastes. Also, it has been shown that fully one-third of sites pose no risk whatsoever to human health and safety unless residential housing is built -- and children eat the dirt. Thus, the standards often are inapplicable to inner-city industrial zones. The law should be reformed to speed cleanups by eliminating the barriers created by the current liability scheme, setting standards according to the real risks posed by the sites, and vigorously attacking wastes posing serious risks. Money should go to cleanup, not lawyers' pockets. This not only would protect poor people better and sooner, but also would allow inner cities to prosper again.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If lawmakers were seriously to consider which environmental policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many costly rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types of regulation that are very different from those which burden America today. In many cases, if the private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to be left in the industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy, Americans actually would benefit more, and far more lives could be saved, as the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/tp16c1.gif">chart</a> illustrates:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential for policymakers to develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing that harm to acceptable levels. Such a list would enable policymakers to know just how much risk protection is being bought for every dollar spent, and Americans to receive the maximum environmental "bang for the buck."  Conversely, the federal government could achieve environmental objectives at the lowest cost, and thus with the fewest "pink slips" for American workers.
<p>
<b>STATES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In thinking of the environment, conservatives should adopt the environmentalists' slogan: "Think globally, act locally."  There is no clearer statement of the need for greater local involvement in protecting the public safety and managing natural resources. While the federal government may serve a valuable role as technical advisor, especially to less populated or less sophisticated states, the states themselves are in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Localities form the front line in protecting public safety and should be given greater deference in prioritizing what public-sector actions will best protect the public. Communities then could redirect their attention to the most important problems, thereby protecting public safety and the environment more effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals like to argue that the states, if unsupervised, would ignore the health and welfare of their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Experience has shown that those lawmakers and government officials closest to the people are the most responsive to the people. Conservatives should point out that federal regulators in Washington, D.C., because they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, respond more to national political pressures than to the needs and concerns of those who should count -- individuals and businesses facing the environmental and financial consequences of regulatory decisions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must make it clear that in a time of budget constraints and the growing imperative to balance the budget, it simply makes no sense to spend federal money to combat exclusively local problems. States should begin to shoulder their share of the burden. Quite simply, there is no reason for taxpayers in California to pay for environmental problems in Montana, or vice versa. For instance, since hazardous waste sites by their nature are confined to very small areas, it makes sense for states to finance cleanups of "orphan" sites within their borders where no responsible party can be found.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must begin to rethink environmental issues. They have lost the debate for decades because they have ignored the simple lesson that conservation is a conservative ethic. This ethic -- which at its core is simply freedom with responsibility -- is pursued by conservatives in economic policy and should be pursued in environmental policy as well. If conservatives are to win the debate on this issue, they must acknowledge that all Americans want an environment that is clean and healthy. It is something to which all Americans are entitled. But they are equally entitled to jobs and a high standard of living. In short, they are entitled to a higher overall quality of life. Environmental protection is not the enemy of economic freedom or of a strong and thriving economy. The issue is how best to realize as much of all three as possible.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must tell the American people the truth about the failure of current environmental policy. There are numerous "horror stories" to illustrate how our policies are destroying lives and squandering scarce labor and natural resources on nonsensical or counterproductive mandates. But conservatives must be careful to articulate the positive message as well. Only this message will lead to both public trust and the needed mandate for change.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must explain how their policies can better protect the environment and lives. Whenever possible, they should explain that by refusing to prioritize risks when regulating, federal agencies systematically condemn thousands of Americans to death each year. In an era of limited fiscal resources, refusing either to get the "biggest environmental bang for the buck" or to save as many lives as possible for the money being spent is irresponsible and reckless.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The market is the best conservation tool available. By tapping into the powerful forces and positive incentives of the market and property ownership -- incentives that reward responsible behavior -- Americans can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously increasing economic freedom and growth. Once the public understands that a conservative also can be an environmentalist, the debate will be won.

<h3> HOW TO TALK ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS:<br>
WHY PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS </h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Talking Points No. 15<br>
June 19, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act,<sup>1</sup> or to effect some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains property owners from using their property as they wish-- for example, by forbidding them to build on their land. And when the government wants to build a new federal facility, the property owner can be forced to surrender title through eminent domain. To be sure, when the government wants to take privately held property for its own purposes, it has the power under the Constitution to force a sale of the property. But in these cases, it at least has to pay the owners just compensation for their property. The problem is that when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This  <I>de facto</I> taking of property-- the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction -- is now being questioned. Under this type of regulatory taking, property owners can face heavy financial burdens or even have their entire life savings wiped out.<sup>2</sup>  For example:<ul>

<p><li>John Sabanovich, an elderly man from Reading, California, saw his net worth plummet from $900,000 to $3,000 after being successfully sued in March 1996 for the purchase price of land he had sold: land that subsequently had been designated a wetland.<sup>3</sup>

<p><li>Bob and Mary McMackin of Arrowhead Lakes, Pennsylvania, built their retirement home and planted trees and shrubbery on dry land in 1989 after obtaining all necessary permits. But the couple were threatened by the Army Corps of Engineers four years later with $50,000 daily fines unless they quickly dug up their entire yard and created a wetland surrounding the house --just five feet away from the structure  --thus threatening the house's structural integrity. They were instructed to do this to restore the site to wetland status, and also to create another wetland off-site two times the size of the house to mitigate the lost wetland area on which the house sat. No one, including the government authorities who issued the various permits, had informed the McMackins that a wetland permit might be necessary for dry land.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the belief of most Americans that seizing people's property by regulation without compensating them is inherently unfair and somehow un-American, few people -- including policymakers -- understand why protecting property rights is so essential.<sup>4</sup>  This is why Congress has yet to complete serious action to stop federal regulators from forcing individuals to surrender their property rights without compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Numerous bills have been introduced in the 104th Congress to address this problem, but none has become law. In March 1995, the House passed H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995. Introduced by Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), and part of the Contract with America, the bill as passed would require compensation by the regulating federal agency whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent of the value of the regulated parcel. It also would allow the owner the option of requiring the federal government to purchase the entire parcel whenever governmental restrictions cause more than a 50 percent reduction in the value of the land -- in short, when the government's interest in the property exceeds the owner's -- and would establish procedures for resolving disputes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate has not acted on H.R. 925, but is considering the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 (S. 605), also introduced in March 1995 by then-Senator Robert Dole (R-KS).<sup>5</sup>  S. 605 would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever the taking of some "portion" of property diminishes the value by 33 percent. The Senate bill also would establish voluntary alternative dispute resolution, would require a takings impact analysis, and would establish certain administrative rights for property owners under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Majority Leader Trent Lott's (R-MS) office has indicated plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote this legislative session.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While lower percentage thresholds are preferable because more property owners will be provided relief, the difference in devaluation levels before compensation is required is not the most significant distinction between the House and Senate bills. More significant is that the Senate bill is more expansive in holding regulators accountable for their actions -- for example, by requiring that they assess the monetary impact to property owners of regulatory takings. Moreover, it uses a more expansive definition of property, including protection of contract rights, than the House version. The scope and focus of the Senate bill would be clarified if this definition were narrowed -- perhaps to real property, fixtures, and water rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite Senator Dole's departure, property rights legislation should not be shelved in the Senate this year. Property owners deserve protection from federal bureaucrats who increasingly resort to these regulations to take control of private property without regard to the burden imposed on American citizens and families.<sup>6</sup>
<p>

<b>THE IMPERATIVE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are important constitutional, economic, and fairness reasons for protecting private property rights. To understand why legislative protection is necessary, one must understand why property rights exist.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes the importance of property rights.</b><sup>7</sup> The Fifth Amendment implicitly recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use. In fact, the implicit power of government to take property -- known as eminent domain -- was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in <I>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance,</I> in which the Court found that "the despotic power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every government.... [G]overnment could not subsist without it."<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fifth Amendment, however, explicitly mandates that government must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. Although the government may take private property for public use, the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," ensures that the cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires. The Constitution does not balance the importance of such governmental action against the importance of compensating individuals. The right to compensation is absolute. Thus, balance is built into the system: The government is permitted to take property unilaterally for public use, but at the same time is required to pay for it and protect private owners from having to bear the financial burden of pursuing that new use. In its most basic sense, compensation is a fairness issue. Why should one American bear the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Just compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights.</b> Having seen the detrimental effects of King George's policies, the founders understood that property rights are essential to preventing the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was referring in <I>Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc.</I> when he stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Practically speaking, governments can control a wide range of individual activity if they can control whether individuals remain financially secure or surrender their property. Thus, the majority truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority. As James Madison wrote in Federalist 10, "[pure] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."  It was the desire to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that motivated the framers to put severe limits -- like the requirement of just compensation -- on the unchecked will of the majority.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Property protection reduces the incentive for the federal government to confiscate property.</b> If property is to be put to its best and most highly valued use, it must be owned by individuals who appreciate its fair market value. The nation's founders well understood the positive economic consequences of protecting owners' investments in their property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, the incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit would be overwhelming. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of America's land, with even higher percentages in the West (for instance, 61 percent of Idaho), and is using regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective control over even more extensive tracts. The rationale: The cost to the government of compensating owners of the land would be too high. The problem with this approach is that the potential for relatively small public benefits through regulatory takings can lead to ruinous costs to private owners, who must shoulder costs the government deems too steep for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, federal enforcement officials have found that they can use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property. When the government decides it is in the public interest to constrain the use of private property for the public good, compensating the property owner at least ensures that the cost of providing the public good is spread fairly across all taxpayers and not just a few unfortunate individuals.
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and local governments to pay just compensation whenever they take or occupy land or real estate.<sup>10</sup>  Essentially, the Court has held that, even if just a square foot of land is taken and less than one percent of the value is lost, a taking has occurred and just compensation is required.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and consistent, leaving executive branch agencies with wide latitude in decisions regarding the enforcement and interpretation of laws. Thus, the federal government can take property through regulations in most cases without payment. Legislative protection is therefore necessary, both as a philosophical and as a practical matter. Only then can property owners be secure in the knowledge their rights will be respected, and able to invest their savings accordingly.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the United States was founded on the principle that government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation. These regulatory takings can strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and with it, the life savings of individual citizens.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In light of the ambiguous and limited nature of existing protections against uncompensated regulatory takings, compounded by the increasing tendency of bureaucrats to use this ill-considered and unwise approach, legislative action is necessary to ensure that private property rights are fully protected.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On January 20, 1993, Bill Clinton raised his right hand and took an oath before God and the American people that he would "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Now, as the next presidential election approaches, the American people are entitled to know whether he has kept his vow. Specifically, they are entitled to know something about the records being compiled in office by the men and women to whom President Clinton has granted lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Are Bill Clinton's judges mostly effective defenders of the Constitution, or are they legal realists who feel free to rewrite the Constitution? Are they moderate New Democrats committed to enforcing the law, or are they left-wing "political hangers-on" with a radical and unpopular agenda for social change?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To ask these questions is <i>not</i> to challenge judicial independence nor even the fundamental decency, on a personal level, of many of the Clinton judicial appointees. The decision that faces the American people is not whether Bill Clinton's judges should be impeached, or whether he should call on some of them to resign, or whether they should have been confirmed in the first place, or whether they are nice people or smart lawyers. The question is, "Given the president's record so far, can we expect a federal judiciary shaped by Bill Clinton to respect the Constitution and honor its role as the interpreter, and not the maker, of our laws?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are two major problems with Bill Clinton's judges. First, they have been unwilling to follow the Constitution in a number of very important cases. And, second, when they choose not to follow the Constitution, they have all too often replaced it with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy. In area after area, Bill Clinton's justices and judges are compiling a public "policy" record that is far to the left of the president's own public statements on similar issues. Bill Clinton may present himself to the public as a mainstream moderate, but his likable justices and judges are working quietly to impose a radical McGovernite legislative agenda on the country.
<p>

<hr width=75% size=3>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton's judicial appointments have had their biggest impact to date on the U.S. Supreme Court. With only two appointees, he has succeeded in transforming a moderately conservative Court into one that is (at best) one vote away from being an engine of radical left-wing social change. His justices are the political heirs of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and they have gotten the better of the lightweight Republican justices imposed on Presidents Reagan and Bush by a Democratic Senate (and by liberal Republicans) after the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork was viciously defeated. Many conservatives don't realize just how liberal Bill Clinton's two affable Ivy League justices really are. In part, this is because Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are exceptionally bright and likable people. Nevertheless, in case after case they have voted for Big Government, against federalism, for a radical secular humanism that hates religion, against traditional social values, for the "rights" of pornographers and drug dealers, against private property, for racial quotas and preferences, and against the creation of a truly colorblind America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The two Clinton justices depart from the William J. Brennan model of liberal judicial activism in only two significant ways: first, they write (or join) opinions that are more cagey and politically astute than blunderbuss opinions such as <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. As a result, the public is unaware of the extent to which radical left-wing policy ideas are seeping into our court opinions. Second, they do not oppose the death penalty across the board, although to some extent they resist its implementation. In every other important respect, the two Clinton justices are the children of the Warren Court, far-left ACLU judicial activists intent on writing their own radical and elite prejudices into the Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of Bill Clinton's lower-court judges (though not all) are equally or even more left-wing, but they have been unable so far to have much of an impact, both because they remain outnumbered and because the Reagan-Bush judges on the lower courts have turned out better in most parts of the country than have their brethren on the Supreme Court. If Bill Clinton wins a second term, however, this will change. In less than four years, he has filled about 25 percent of the seats on the federal judiciary. If re-elected to another term, he will have a chance to replace hundreds more retiring judges, and many of the federal courts of appeals will flip from Reagan-Bush to Clinton-Carter majorities. And depending on how lucky he gets, he will almost certainly name another one to three left-wing Supreme Court justices. This means that the few 5 to 4 wins that conservatives have managed recently will all become losses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's look at what Bill Clinton's America will then be like, and contrast it with the America he claims to want. A good way to do this is to compare the specific policies Bill Clinton says he favors with the left-wing social policies that his judges are legislating from the bench. In doing this, we should remember that not all the Reagan-Bush appointments have turned out well, nor have all of Bill Clinton's judges turned out badly. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is quite clear.<p><b>Limited Government</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"The era of big government is over" (January 23, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address. Unfortunately, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer certainly have not yet been let in on the secret. Both have voted in favor of every single claim of national governmental power yet to come before them. Only a year ago, in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1456.ZO.filt"><i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</i></a>, both Clinton justices were members of a 5 to 4 majority on the Court that struck down state-imposed term limits on Members of the U.S. Congress. As a result, the term-limit laws of 22 states, 21 of which had been adopted by the voters directly in initiatives or referenda, were declared invalid. The Clinton Justice Department filed an unusual "friend of the Court" brief to encourage this result. The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton's Supreme Court justices killed the term-limits movement: had <i>either</i> of the two Clinton justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's elegant and brilliant dissent, we would have term limits in most of the United States today.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These votes were not anomalies. In <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1260.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, both Clinton justices again voted for the position that the national government has unlimited power to regulate <i>all</i> aspects of the nation's economic, social, and cultural life. Justice Breyer wrote the main dissent for four of the nine justices and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He paid only lip service to the idea that the U.S. Constitution limits the power of the national government in any way whatsoever. Under Justice Breyer's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the federal government could nationalize education curricula, local law enforcement, family law, and everything else under the sun, so long as Congress could rationally think that doing so would in some attenuated way be connected to interstate commerce. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg clearly believe that the Big Government of the Great Society and the New Deal can do anything it wants to, so long as it does not violate the Bill of Rights or its "emanations and penumbras."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This past March, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were again on the wrong side of an important federalism case. In <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</i>, they joined a strident dissent written by Justice David Souter that argued for overturning a 200-year-old understanding that state governments are protected from lawsuits in federal court by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Casting aside years of settled understanding, Justice Souter argued that Congress should be able to authorize citizens to sue state governments without their consent -- a theory that reduces the states from a position of co-sovereignty to one of abject subordination. Chief Justice William Rehnquist won the 5 to 4 vote in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> with no margin to spare, and the dissenters promised in their opinions to try to overrule the case at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Big Government activism of the Clinton justices also manifests itself in "separation of powers" cases since that doctrine, like the doctrine of federalism, is for them an inconvenient restraint on the unlimited power of the national government. Justice Ginsburg was one of only two dissenters in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1121.ZO.filt"><i>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i></a>, an important case that limited Congress's power to retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions already decided. Justice Breyer weighed in with a tepid separate concurrence in the case rather than join Justice Antonin Scalia's forceful majority opinion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton justices are completely unwilling to enforce the Framers' written Constitution of limited powers, federalism, and checks and balances. Their idea of constitutional law begins and largely ends with a judicially dictated jurisprudence of unenumerated rights. Even the constitutionally enumerated right that protects private property from being taken without just compensation is given short shrift: Justice Ginsburg, for example, joined three other justices in dissenting from Chief Justice Rehnquist's important opinion in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-518.ZO.filt"><i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i></a>, which protected private property from confiscation by regulation. In that case, a municipal government was ultimately rebuffed in its attempt to force a shop owner to set aside 15 percent of her land as a public easement as a condition of receiving a building permit. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also dissented in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1823.ZO.filt"><i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i></a>, the Kansas City school-desegregation case. In that case, they joined an opinion that took the extraordinary position that federal judges can require local governments to raise taxes in order to fund remedial education and magnet schools.<p><b>Religious Freedoms</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"[The First Amendment] does not convert our schools into religion-free zones. . . . I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened. . . . When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion, it is being misused. . . . Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public, because the public square belongs to all Americans" (July 12, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so said Bill Clinton in a widely reported speech at a suburban Washington, D.C.-area high school. It went unremarked at the time, however, that his two Supreme Court appointees had recently voted in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-329.ZO.filt"><i>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</i></a> to maintain our schools as religion-free zones. The issue in <i>Rosenberger</i> was whether a student activities fund, which was used to support various publications by student groups, could also be used to pay for the printing costs of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a Christian student newspaper. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said yes, over the dissenting votes of Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.

	The opinion that they joined was a militantly secular tirade against any role for religion in any public institution. It reasoned that not a penny of public money can ever be spent on anything religious, even though public money is routinely spent in huge quantities on educational programs hostile to religion or to religiously inspired moral values. Under the ahistorical rhetoric of the dissenters in <i>Rosenberger</i>, it is hard to see how the courts could ever uphold government chaplains, Thanksgiving Day holidays, mottoes on our currency, school vouchers, or even tax deductions for religious organizations. The <i>Rosenberger</i> dissent theorizes that no government aid can ever go to any religious organization, even if the aid is equally available to comparable secular organizations.<blockquote><p>

<i>	"I personally did not believe that it was coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event because I don't believe that it is coercive to people who don't participate in it" (November 14, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A nice sentiment, but one that is unfortunately not shared by Judges Theodore McKee and H. Lee Sarokin, Bill Clinton's two appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In fact, Judge McKee wrote the <i>en banc</i> opinion for the Third Circuit in <i>ACLU and Edward Ross v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education</i>, a decision that banned student-led graduation prayers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge McKee's radical opinion went further than the U.S. Supreme Court has ever gone in this area by outlawing student-led graduation prayers as well as prayers organized directly by a school principal. In order to do this, Judge McKee had to reject a directly "on point" holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld student-led graduation prayers in <i>Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District</i>. Four Reagan-Bush judges dissented from Judge McKee's opinion, while every Democratic appointee on the Third Circuit joined it. Judge McKee's pro-ACLU advocacy was so effective with his colleagues that he even brought a number of the feebler Reagan-Bush appointees along with him. Bill Clinton's hopes that we could have graduation prayer were dashed by his own appointee. Now, to determine what our national policy will be on this issue, an increasingly anti-religious Supreme Court will soon be obliged to hear and resolve the conflict that Judge McKee has created between the Third and Fifth Circuits on this issue.<p><b>Racial Quotas and Preferences</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<i>"I say to you, I'm against quotas. I'm against discrimination" (September 21, 1995). "Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative-action programs that I have already articulated--no quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them" (July 19, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Great rhetoric but, unfortunately, there are two Clinton appointees who will not be complying with the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1841.ZO.filt"><i>Adarand</i></a> outlawing quotas in federal programs. Yes, that's right -- Justices Breyer and Ginsburg both dissented in that case, and Justice Ginsburg actually wrote one of the dissenting opinions. She tried to put a pro-racial-preference spin on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion, and said she saw "today's opinion as one that allows our precedent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to changing conditions." Translated into everyday English, Justice Ginsburg hopes to distinguish or overrule <i>Adarand</i> at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And what, you may wonder, ws the "moderate" federal affirmative-action program in <i>Adarand</i> that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were so eager to uphold? It was an explicit racial-preference program for government highway subcontractors, a preference so blatant that even many who support affirmative-action recruitment efforts in universities have condemned programs like this one. Justice Ginsburg was so enthusiastic about this particular program that she not only authored a dissenting opinion herself but also joined <i>two</i> other dissenting opinions: one by Justice Souter and another, even more radical, opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Ginsburg was the only other member of the Court to join Justice Stevens's opinion, which would appear to uphold all federal racial-preference programs of any kind that are, in his opinion, well motivated.

<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have voted to uphold every <br>racial preference or quota that has come before them</EM></font><hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's votes on the racial preference/quota issue in <i>Adarand</i> were not at all idiosyncratic. Rather, they form part of a pattern in which both justices have voted to uphold every racial preference or quota that has ever come before them. In particular, they have dissented in every voting-rights case involving challenges to political redistricting, decisions in which race played the predominant role. This past year, they joined the minority in the 5 to 4 decisions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-923.ZO.filt"><i>Shaw v. Hunt</i></a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-805.ZO.filt"><i>Bush v. Vera</i></a>, in which the Court threw out racially gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas. Last year, Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent for four justices (including Justice Breyer) in the companion cases of <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-631.ZO.filt"><i>Miller v. Johnson</i></a> and <i>United States v. Hayes</i>, in which the Court invalidated racial gerrymanders in Louisiana and Georgia.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue in these cases is whether it is unconstitutional to create wildly odd-shaped legislative districts for the purpose of maximizing the proportion of voters of a particular race, when such districts violate traditional districting standards of compactness and affinity of community interests. The purpose of this whole enterprise is to use federal voting-rights law to allocate congressional seats by race, so that every racial and ethnic group in the nation is proportionately represented according to their numbers in the population at large. While greater minority representation in public life is to be desired, this particular quota regime is in fact a stealthy imposition of the system of proportional representation used in places like Israel, Japan, Russia, and Germany (under the Weimar Republic). Everyone familiar with the unstable politics of those countries knows that this kind of rigid proportional representation is disastrous for social peace, because it rewards extremists and penalizes consensus building. For this reason, many have long thought that the Anglo-American tradition of allocating electoral districts geographically is better than the Continental European tradition of proportional representation. <p>

<font size="+2"><EM>The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering<br> would

<hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering would authorize nothing less than a racial quota system for Congress. By enshrining a system of racial and ethnic proportional representation, it would also codify a political system of racial spoils and push us toward the unstable electoral system that has been the bane of Continental European democracies. 

<p><b>Crime</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>	"The United States cannot tolerate the rates of crime and violence which have come to be almost commonplace in the last several years. We have to intensify our efforts to reduce crime" (July 28, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few issues are of greater concern to most Americans than the fight against violent street crime and illegal drugs, and, as is well-known, Bill Clinton loves to boast that his administration has been tough on crime and on punishing criminals. Once again, however, his judicial appointees often seem to be seriously "off message" when criminal-law cases are before the courts. In its most recent term, the Supreme Court decided <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1511.ZO.filt"><i>Lewis v. Casey</i></a>, a major case bearing on the right of prisoners to enjoy free prison libraries and legal assistance. The case involved how broadly to read an activist opinion from the 1970s by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, which requires state taxpayers to subsidize frivolous prison litigation by providing free legal help and library facilities. In this particular case, a federal court in Arizona issued sweeping orders to state prison officials to address the complaints of state prisoners about the quality of their legal research materials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Scalia, writing for five Reagan-Bush justices, seized on the case as a chance to cut back on Thurgood Marshall's requirement that state governments subsidize prisoner lawsuits. Scalia argued that the federal courts had no business trying to run state prisons, and he set some common-sense limits on the bad precedent by making it inapplicable when prisoners' claims were frivolous or when prisoners were trying to bring legal action irrelevant to sentences and terms of confinement. Justice Thomas, in a brilliant concurrence, even called on the Court to overrule its offensive and nonsensical precedent. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, chose to dissent from most of Justice Scalia's opinion. They joined a handwringing, meandering dissent that complained that Scalia was going too far and too fast in protecting state prison authorities and taxpayers from the desire of prisoners for good libraries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This same term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also joined a sweeping opinion by Justice Stevens in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-266.ZO.filt"><i>Jaffee v. Redmond</i></a> that recognized a disturbing new rule that could keep vital evidence of wrong behavior from being used in federal court for either civil or criminal trials. In that case, the Court held that conversations between a patient and her psychiatrist <i>or social worker</i> are protected from compelled disclosure during the course of a federal criminal or civil trial. The Court's decision to exclude a sweeping new category of evidence in this case is disturbingly reminiscent of the Warren Court's great exclusionary-rule blunders in the 1960s. Every time evidence is excluded from the courtroom, the task of proving the guilt (or innocence) of the culpable becomes more difficult. To impose this burden upon prosecutors in order to protect communications not only with psychiatrists but also with social workers is sheer folly. As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, we don't allow a testimonial privilege in federal court for conversations with parents, siblings, children, or bartenders. Why on earth would we carve out such a privilege for social workers? Sadly, the case was lost by a vote of 7 to 2.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Breyer cast two other noteworthy votes in criminal cases this term. First, he joined two separate opinions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-8836.ZO.filt"><i>Felker v. Turpin</i></a> that sought to water down the new federal law for expediting the application of the death penalty. Second, he joined the dissent in an important 5 to 4 decision on whether police can apply a property seizure law designed to discourage prostitution. Had the dissenters' view prevailed, the customers of prostitutes would have been able to protect their cars from confiscation by co-registering them with the very wives they were betraying.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are countless lower-court criminal-law opinions by Clinton appointees that are deeply disturbing. To mention just one example, consider <i>United States v. Hamrick</i>, decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Clinton appointee M. Blane Michael joined a dissent that would have exonerated a defendant who had mailed a bomb to the U.S. Attorney who had prosecuted him. Judge Michael was of the view that the bomb was not a "deadly weapon" within the meaning of the federal criminal law, because it was badly made and didn't cause too much damage when it exploded!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As these examples illustrate, this administration is appointing some disturbingly fuzzy minds to the federal bench. Once again Bill Clinton's tough talk on crime is revealed to be nothing more than talk. His judges are rapidly bringing us back to the bad old days of 1960s Warren Court liberalism.<p><b>Mainstream Values</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"When I sought the presidency, I said that I wanted . . . to put mainstream values back at the heart of social policy. . . . [W]e're moving in the right direction to reassert and reinsert into American life mainstream values. And, I believe the initiatives of our Administration have played a role in that" (October 13, 1995). "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see in one of those 1950s sitcoms, but we'd be better off if more people were" (September 9, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mainstream values? Stable traditional families? So far, Bill Clinton's justices and judges have voted to: strike down his own liberalized policy on "gays in the military" as unconstitutional; require that gays be given special rights under certain state and local civil rights laws, thus forcing private landlords, elementary-school boards, and employers to associate with militant gays even if they don't want to; oppose an important Utah statute that regulates abortions <i>after 20 weeks</i>; and, incorporate a particularly strident and unreasonable version of the failed Equal Rights Amendment into the federal Constitution. And, they have managed to do all of this in just the last two years!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's take these "mainstream values" judicial opinions one at a time. As is well known, Bill Clinton shot himself in the foot shortly after he was elected by attempting to change the U.S. military's long-standing policy of refusing to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. After an enormous public uproar, he was forced to back down by moderate liberals like Senator Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In November 1993, he signed a statute creating a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy; it was designed to quell public outrage by keeping outspoken gay individuals out of the armed forces, while making clear that the military should not pursue the expulsion of gays who did not commit homosexual acts and who did not discuss their private sexual activities and inclinations.<p>
<p>
<center><hr width=90% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>A constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt <br>children, or teach in grade school may be just around the corner</EM></font><hr width=90% size=3></center> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Since then two federal courts of appeal have heard cases on this issue. In <i>Stefan v. Perry</i>, the D.C. Circuit voted 6 to 4 that the long-standing pre-1993 policy of excluding homosexuals from the military did not violate the Constitution. Bill Clinton's sole appointee, Judge Judith Rogers, voted to invalidate the policy, as did all the Carter appointees. All of the Reagan-Bush appointees voted to uphold the policy. On April 5, 1996, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9 to 4 to uphold the constitutionality of Bill Clinton's own "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Amazingly, <i>both</i> of Bill Clinton's appointees to that Court, Judges M. Blane Michael and Diana Motz, voted to strike down his own quite liberal policy as unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Judges Rogers, Michael, and Motz are by no means out of step for the Clinton judiciary on these matters. Last May, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined a 6 to 3 majority in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1039.ZO.filt"><i>Romer v. Evans</i></a>. In that case, gay-rights groups had challenged a ballot initiative passed by Colorado voters that overrode all attempts by Colorado towns to enact special civil-rights protections for gays. Had the two Clinton justices joined the three dissenters in that case, Colorado's policy of legalizing homosexuality but not granting it preferential status would still be good law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have been tempted to read the Court's confused opinion in <i>Romer</i>, which Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined without comment, quite narrowly. This is almost certainly a mistake. The opinion contains opaque references to the illegality of "status discrimination" -- a key issue in the "don't ask, don't tell" cases heard so far by the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit. If the Court pursues this idea of outlawing "status discrimination," and if it continues to view any failure to treat homosexuals like heterosexuals as being evidence only of "irrational animus," then there is no reason to think that a constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt children, and teach in grade schools is not right around the corner. The Court's meandering opinion and the silence of the five justices who joined it offer no assurance whatsoever that <i>any</i> differential treatment of homosexuality is still allowed. Those conservatives who took comfort in the Court's refusal to say it was applying "strict scrutiny" (the highest level of judicial scrutiny) to classifications based on sexual orientation are being misled. The Court is applying strict scrutiny in this case, without acknowledging candidly that it is doing so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "mainstream values" of the Clinton judges don't end with issues bearing on homosexuality. In <i>Leavitt v. Jane L.</i>, the Court voted 5 to 4 to summarily reverse a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that invalidated those portions of a Utah state law that prohibited abortions after 20 weeks, except where the mother's life or medical health will be seriously threatened or where the child will be born with "grave defects." The case arose because under <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/91-744.ZO.filt"><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</i></a> (1992), the Utah statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited abortions before the fetus is "viable" outside the womb.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Utah law, however, clearly provided for the "severability" of its other provisions in the event that one part of the law was ruled unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit had willfully refused to sever the statute so that abortions after 20 weeks could be regulated. Five Justices joined a rare, short <i>per curiam</i> opinion summarily reversing this as blatant error. This short opinion reflected nothing more than the long-settled idea that even after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the states can still regulate third-trimester, "post-viability" abortions so long as no "undue burden" is placed upon the mother's right to protect her own life or health. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, dissented. They claimed variously that the Court should defer here to the Tenth Circuit, that summary reversal should be used rarely, and (implicitly) that the issue was not important enough to merit a grant of <i>certiorari</i> and a summary reversal. Do they intend in a Clinton second term to try to extend the near-total right to abortion in Roe to third-trimester abortions or to infanticide? Why would anyone with "mainstream values" join an angry four-justice dissent in an easy severability case like this?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, of course, there is the Court's "mainstream" opinion by Justice Ginsburg in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1941.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Virginia</i></a> where the Court held that the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male military academy funded by the state of Virginia, could not constitutionally exclude women. This case is remarkable less for its invalidation of the all-male program at VMI than for its writing into the Constitution a particularly extreme version of the Equal Rights Amendment -- which had failed to win popular support and passage through legitimate channels in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
<p><center>
<hr width=85% size=3><font size="+2"><em>Single-sex combat units, draft registration, football<br>
teams, and private schools may now be unconstitutional</em></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Ginsburg wielded the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause to create a new standard of strict scrutiny for gender classifications, while using a milder label that minimizes the political fallout for liberals in the White House and in Congress. Henceforth, says Justice Ginsburg, gender classifications require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" and are subject to "skeptical scrutiny." They may not be used to do anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> "creates or perpetuates the legal, social, or economic inferiority of women" nor may they rely on anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> involves an "overbroad generalization about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women." Thus if American society thinks that single-sex draft registration or combat rules are desirable, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants single-sex sports teams at its state schools, it must have something "exceedingly persuasive" to say to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants to offer charitable tax-exempt status to a private women's college or to a Roman Catholic Church priesthood, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Chief Justice Rehnquist (in his concurrence) and Justice Scalia (in his dissent) both pointed out, this anti-democratic, elitist nonsense has nothing at all to do with the very important subject of the equal rights of women. Justice Ginsburg made no effort in her opinion to explain why she thought VMI was unconstitutional while single-sex combat units or football teams were O.K. That is because she is not interested in equal rights for women in the sense that most Americans would understand that term. What Justice Ginsburg wanted to do all along, and did do, in the VMI case was to lay the doctrinal groundwork for a final assault on <i>all</i> remaining classifications and social practices, both public and private, wherein any distinction between men and women is made according to gender. She does not identify a single gender classification or social practice, either public or private, that she is definitively willing to approve. The door is being flung open to a massive judicial assault on our sexist military services, football teams, private single-sex schools, and religious organizations.<p><b>The V-Chip</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their children see, that is not censorship. That is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing" (January 23, 1996)</i>.</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton likes to leave voters with the impression that he is concerned about inappropriate television programs aimed at children. Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg did not agree in the Supreme Court's recent <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-124.ZO.filt"><i>Denver Cable</i></a> case. In that case, the law in question sought to modify the public-access policy governing local cable networks that required them to broadcast indecent programming without restrictions. Astonishingly, Justice Ginsburg was one of only two justices on the Court who voted to hold unconstitutional <i>every single restriction</i> before the court that was aimed at suppressing indecent programming available to children watching TV. Justice Breyer's more moderate opinion would uphold a restriction like the V-chip, but not a reasonable requirement that people who want to subscribe to indecent programming must do so by taking some affirmative step to sign up for it. Evidently Justice Breyer is more concerned about the privacy rights of adults who watch indecent programming than about the rights of children who may accidentally see such programming on cable TV.<p>
<center><hr width=65% size=3><font size="+2"><em>The last two years have seen a large number<br> of opinions that are contemptuous of the <br>
values and prerogatives of the American people</em></font>
<hr width=65% size=3></center>  

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's extreme solicitude for the consumers of pornography is shared by both of Bill Clinton's two appointees to the D.C. Circuit. Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel were on the dissenting side of a 7 to 4 <i>en banc</i> decision that upheld a federal law restricting the broadcast of indecent material to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All seven judges in the majority were Reagan-Bush appointees, while all four of the dissenters were appointed by Presidents Clinton or Carter. It is by no means clear to me that this law would survive review on the Supreme Court today, given Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's views on indecency, the First Amendment, and the rights of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As I hope I have made clear, the U.S. Supreme Court is now dangerously adrift. The last two years have seen an increasingly large number of opinions that are contemptuous of the beliefs, values, and prerogatives of the American people as well as of the democratic process itself. The Clinton justices have almost always been on the wrong side of these cases, and in many instances they have joined minorities of four in support of propositions that are ludicrous and offensive. Although Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O'Connor deserve some of the blame, the other three Reagan-Bush justices have been stellar. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have joined those three to produce some very important 5 to 4 victories in fighting off racial quotas, allowing religious speech, curbing Big Government, protecting private property, and fighting crime. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and replaces any of those five justices with another "moderate" like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, then every single conservative victory of the last 28 years will be at great risk of being overturned. The Warren Court ended when Richard Nixon won the presidential election of 1968; the presidential election of 1996 will determine whether the era that Nixon inaugurated is now to be replaced by a new burst of radical left-wing judging.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what are we to make of Bill Clinton's role in all of this? Is it remotely plausible to think that he doesn't realize how far to the left his own justices and judges are of his own public statements on issue after issue? No, it is not plausible. Bill Clinton is a former professor of constitutional law, a Rhodes Scholar, and a graduate of Yale Law School. He knows perfectly well the views of the justices and judges he is nominating.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Obviously, these are very difficult times for anyone who believes in a restrained, law-abiding federal judiciary. There is, however, one consoling thought. If Bill Clinton is re-elected, he will have a mandate from the American people to rein in Big Government, protect religious speech, oppose racial preferences, preserve mainstream values, fight indecent television programming aimed at children, and fight crime and drugs. Which jurist could Bill Clinton possibly name to the Supreme Court whom he could count on to do all of the things that he says he wants done? The answer is obvious: renominate Judge Robert H. Bork.<p>

F.Y.I. No. 103<br>
May 21, 1996<br>

Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<h3>RUSSIAN HARDLINERS' MILITARY DOCTRINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.

<center><h3>ARMY REFORM AND SECURITY:<br>
Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

by Valeriy Dementyev, Lieutenant General (Ret.) and Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Anton Surikov, Doctor of Technical Sciences
</center><P>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers. Thus far, the trade agreement has been renewed five times.<sup>7</sup>
<P>


<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

<b>EIGHT REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.
<p>
	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td><img src="lect562.gif" align=left width=277 height=196></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><b>Heritage President Ed Feulner, center, introduces<br>
 Sen. Helms to Jay Lee, grandson of the late <br>
B.C. Lee, founder of the Samsung Group</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<p>(3) Push for more open, less regulated markets for U.S. goods and services; </p>
<p/>
(4) Show the nations in the region that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and multilateral agreements by punishing those who transgress; and </p>
<p>
(5) Strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market share.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have been patient with me, and I thank you most sincerely for the opportunity to share some views with you this evening. I am genuinely honored to be in the company of the high caliber of Asia and foreign policy specialists in this room tonight, and I hope I will have the benefit of your views later in the evening.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	With passage of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 earlier this year, many in Congress, the media, and the public have been led to believe that the long-awaited task of communications deregulation has been completed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	While the new Telecommunications Act takes some important steps toward market liberalization, they are in many cases tiny steps. Furthermore, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is charged with the task of implementing the Act, already has shown itself eager to exploit the vague rhetoric and loopholes found in many sections of the Act by expanding rather than rolling back regulations. Worse still, some of the recent FCC proceedings and rule-makings undertaken supposedly to comply with this legislation are so complex, notes investment analyst Susan A. Lynner of Prudential Securities, that, "If the devil is in the details, then we must be in hell."<sup>1</sup>  In many ways, these problems can be traced to poorly worded or open-ended sections and clauses found in the original legislative language of the Telecommunications Act. <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 But the more serious problem with the Telecommunications Act is not what it includes, but what it does not include. The statute almost completely ignores the segment of the communications marketplace that is experiencing the most innovation and entrepreneurship -- the wireless sector. The legislation focuses primarily on wireline issues (local telephony and cable in particular). Wireless industries that currently use the electromagnetic wireless spectrum<sup>2</sup> (such as cellular or broadcasting), as well as other businesses that hope to enter the wireless market, do not receive comparable attention.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Realizing this, Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) has circulated a staff discussion draft, "The Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act," as the prelude to possible legislation. Senator Pressler is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The proposal is sweeping in its scope and, if implemented, would force a complete overhaul of wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Among its beneficial steps, Senator Pressler's proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b> The proposal would end seven decades of spectrum mismanagement and industrial policy by allowing spectrum holders to use their spectrum for whatever purpose they wish. No longer would the FCC be allowed to "zone" the spectrum in discrete parcels and place restrictions on its use.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b> The FCC's extremely successful experiment with spectrum auctions would be expanded and made permanent for new uses of spectrum.
<p>
<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b> Although the Pressler proposal backs away from the contentious issue of auctioning off licenses already set to be given away to the broadcast television industry, it does create a favorable alternative. Broadcasters would be forced to pay a deposit for receipt of new digital licenses, and this deposit would be fully refundable when they turn in their old analog license after a 15-year transition period. Alternatively, if broadcasters did not wish to pay the deposit, they could opt to keep their current analog license forever and forgo the opportunity to obtain a new digital license. If they chose this second option, the leftover spectrum would be auctioned to other users.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b> The Pressler plan wisely mandates that the FCC could not engage in technical standard-setting because the staggering pace of technological change in this industry will likely make any standard irrelevant in the near future. Furthermore, the bill would prohibit the FCC from micromanaging construction specifications and timetables of new spectrum networks.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum:</b> In an important step, the Pressler plan demands that federal agencies reallocate large portions of inefficiently used government spectrum to private use. Furthermore, the spectrum that remains in government hands would have to be used more efficiently.
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b> The proposal also would eliminate needless spectrum management duplication by transferring all spectrum authority currently held by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the FCC. In addition, the bill would block grant public safety spectrum back to the states so they can control locally all spectrum needed for police, fire, and other safety uses.
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report.</b> Finally, the plan would mandate a review of the effects of the bill two years after implementation and require the FCC to suggest further deregulatory initiatives that can be undertaken.</ul>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Pressler plan, if enacted into law, would represent the most important privatization effort undertaken by the federal government in recent years. This would spur job and export creation in this highly innovative American industry. Failure to implement these reforms, on the other hand, would mean that Congress's efforts to revolutionize the communications industry would remain limited and incomplete. 
<p>

<b>WHY REFORM IS NEEDED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Senator Pressler's spectrum reform and privatization plan is vital for several reasons. The current system of spectrum management is roundly criticized because:<ul>
<li><b>It is resistant to change and innovation.</b> Currently, federal spectrum regulators are allowed to decide who may use spectrum, where they may use it, how long they may use it, and most important, to what use they may put their spectrum. This is often referred to as "spectrum zoning," to borrow a real estate land management metaphor. Not surprisingly, this zoning leads to massive misallocations and misuses of spectrum. Once a certain technology is locked into place, it can take years before another use of that spectrum is allowed; thus, both innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged by this technological industrial policy. 
<p>
<li><b>It imposes large costs of delay.</b> Not surprisingly, this resistance to change and innovation results in enormous costs. These costs can be measured either in terms of the number of new products offered to consumers or in terms of the overall loss of economic activity to the economy. The costs are high. For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>3</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li><b>It is open to special interest influence and discourages competition.</b> With such a tight hold on the spectrum reins, regulators can steer the industry in almost any direction they desire. Worse yet, because communications regulation often has resembled a "good old boy" network -- with favored industry groups working hand-in-hand with regulators to craft policy -- competition has been discouraged. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, for many years the broadcast industry worked with the FCC to restrict the rise of cable television, since it posed an obvious threat to the unchallenged hegemony of the broadcast industry. As telecommunications scholars Michael K. Kellogg, John Thorne, and Peter W. Huber note, "For many years the FCC's principal objective was to suppress the cable industry by preventing direct competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting. It did so quite successfully.... "<sup>5</sup> This regulatory setback delayed the onset of video competition for over a decade.<sup>6</sup>  Despite no clear explanation of how this served the public, the FCC continued to implement these anti-competitive policies, even though it had received no explicit grant of congressional authority to do so.<sup>7</sup><p><li><b>There is a lack of respect for First Amendment rights.</b> Finally, the current system of spectrum management provides regulators with the ability to influence directly the content and composition of specific types of programming, and to threaten firms with discontinuation of the right to operate if they fail to comply with regulatory edicts. For example, the FCC currently uses the Children's Television Act of 1990 as a tool for blatant regulatory extortion. The FCC has gone beyond the admittedly vague statutory language of the Act to demand specific quantitative minimum numbers of hours of children's programming in exchange for allowing business other freedoms.<sup>8</sup>  For example, after CBS and Westinghouse recently announced their intention to merge, FCC regulators (who have the power to block such alliances) forced the companies to promise that certain quantitative programming requirements would be honored as a condition of merger approval. Several other firms have faced similar threats from the FCC as a condition of normal business operation. 	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Even though such regulatory blackmail would represent a clear First Amendment violation if applied in the print realm (fo
r example to newspapers or magazines), it is considered normal operating procedure in the realm of electronic communication (radio or television broadcasters).
</ul><p>


<b>WHAT THE PRESSLER PLAN WOULD DO</b>

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the Pressler plan would correct most of these flaws within the current system. Specifically, the proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would end seven decades of misguided and inefficient spectrum management, allowing spectrum users to use their licenses to provide any service in any way they desire as long as it does not interfere with another spectrum user or violate any U.S. treaty obligations with other nations regarding international spectrum use. It also would allow spectrum users to transfer their flexible spectrum freely to others on the open market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This would mean the death of federal spectrum industrial policies because it would prohibit any further "zoning" of spectrum. This could encourage a "spectrum renaissance," as many entrepreneurial ideas that could not be acted upon in the past due to spectrum operating restrictions could now be implemented. Countless innovations and new job opportunities would spring from a wireless marketplace freed from its regulatory shackles.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would expand and make permanent the extraordinarily successful system of spectrum auctioning that Congress originally authorized in 1993. Tens of billions of dollars have been generated for the U.S. Treasury and an enormous amount of innovation already has taken place, thanks to the auctioning process. In fact, an entirely new industry, the personal communications service sector (PCS), a more advanced system of wireless cellular communication, has been created as a result of the auction process. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, Congress limited the applicability and time of auctions in 1993. The Pressler proposal would mandate that only auctions be used in the future and any potential "mutually exclusive use" of the spectrum (when two or more parties vie for the same spectrum allocation) must be thrown open to competitive bidding at an auction. There would be four notable exemptions, however, to this general rule. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>First</b>, any spectrum request that is "non-mutually exclusive" (only one party requests the spectrum), obviously would not be open to an auction. This spectrum would simply be given to the party requesting it. The FCC could demand, however, that these users pay user fees to the government to ensure that the spectrum is not hoarded or used inefficiently.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		<b>Second</b>, public safety users of spectrum would be exempted. These spectrum uses would include such things as police and fire stations that need to communicate over the radio spectrum, as well as Department of Defense military applications. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Third</b>, spectrum required for global satellite orbital assignments would not be auctioned since this would create international difficulties with other countries that possess different spectrum assignment mechanisms. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Fourth</b>, while it is reasonable to exempt the previous three uses and users from spectrum auctions, the following exemption reflects the raw political power of an industry rather than good policy. 
<p>

<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would exempt from auction the licenses set to be given away to broadcasters for the provision of digital television. This is unfortunate, because $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum would be lost if such a giveaway to the broadcast industry were allowed to go forward. Worse yet, it would single out one segment of the industry for special treatment in a time when everyone else in the industry is being forced to spend billions bidding at competitive auctions to obtain the additional spectrum they need or desire to conduct business.<sup>9</sup>  Political pressure from the broadcast lobby has led many in Congress to abandon any hope of auctioning this spectrum.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Yet the Pressler plan would create a second-best solution, referred to as the "deposit, return and overlay approach."  Basically, every television broadcast licensee in America would be able to choose between one of the following two plans: 
<p>
	 <b>Option #1:</b> A broadcaster could obtain an additional license directly from the government instead of through a competitive auction, but pay periodic fees or deposits into an escrow account. The fees collected from broadcasters would be based on the value of similar licenses sold in "overlay" auctions. Overlay refers to the technological capability to use certain portions of the spectrum simultaneously for multiple uses. Spectrum adjoining that which would be given to broadcasters therefore could be auctioned off, and its auction price would then be used to determine the amount of the fee or deposit broadcasters would be forced to pay for exclusive use of the additional spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 15-year transition period when broadcasters each would possess two licenses (one analog, one digital), accrued interest on the spectrum deposit account would be placed in the U.S. Treasury to pay for tax cuts or deficit reduction. After the 15-year transition period ended, broadcasters could relinquish their older analog license and receive their deposit back from the government (less the accrued interest that went into the Treasury). For every year the broadcasters held their old license in excess of the 15-year cutoff date, they would lose 20 percent of their overall deposit; after five years, in other words, they would lose the full value of their deposit if they did not return the old license.

<p><b>Option #2:</b> Broadcasters could bypass the opportunity to obtain a second license directly from the government and instead opt to keep their older analog license perpetually. No spectrum fees or deposits would be owed by those who chose this option. The spectrum relinquished in this manner would then be auctioned by the FCC. Overall auctions would still take place, however. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This "deposit, return and overlay" approach is a good second-best alternative to straightforward auctions because it would provide a method of compensation for the use of spectrum and, would not allow broadcasters to keep two licenses without incurring serious costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would explicitly prohibit the FCC from imposing a digital television standard on the American marketplace. It simultaneously would avoid any compatibility or construction requirements that could lead to the adoption of yet another misguided industrial policy. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, the FCC in May did adopt a standard for digital television, largely to appease electronics manufacturers that wanted to lock in the technological system they favor. Although the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Digital Standard that was adopted allows television broadcasters flexible use of their spectrum, many other potential spectrum users, especially innovative computer companies such as Microsoft Corporation and Apple Computer, objected to the standard for various technological reasons. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Surprisingly, the ATSC standard was adopted despite the warnings of FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who questioned whether the agency was in the best position to set such a standard during a period of rapid innovation. In a statement, Hundt asked, "Why is it in the public interest to adopt rules freezing the current state of technology?  Given the rapid pace of technological change, isn't it inevitable that there will be innovations that even the flexible ATSC Standard cannot accommodate?"<sup>10</sup>  Even more important, "Shouldn't we be concerned that erecting a regulatory barrier to the use of new technologies may discourage the research and development necessary for innovation?"  Hundt went on to ask, "How is it consistent with the deregulatory spirit of the new Telecommunications Act to codify (directly or indirectly) the 200-plus pages of technical details that constitute the ATSC Standard?"<sup>11</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There are no easy or good answers to Chairman Hundt's questions because there is no legitimate reason for the FCC to be in the business of technological standard-setting in the first place. The FCC has a long and checkered history of experience with television standards. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation telecommunications working group report notes, "The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards. The FCC then froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952. In the year after the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However, a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable stations per market, and impeded the creation of additional TV networks, at enormous costs to the American viewing public."<sup>12</sup>  With this history and a healthy respect for the pace of technological change in mind, the Pressler plan would prohibit standard-setting at the FCC.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would mandate that, beginning next year, 25 percent of the spectrum the federal government currently owns exclusively or shares with the private sector below a certain frequency (5 GHz) shall be re-allocated for private sector auctions. Beyond this 25 percent of publicly held spectrum found under 5 GHz, the Pressler plan would require that the President appoint a seven-member "Advisory Committee on Withdrawal" to determine the amount of additional public spectrum that could be transferred to the private sector over a ten-year period.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	More important, the Pressler plan would initiate a financial incentive program to encourage government spectrum users to surrender portions of their spectrum voluntarily for private auctions. For example, if the Department of Transportation or Department of Defense realized they were stockpiling large portions of spectrum that were not being utilized, under the Pressler proposal they could turn in the spectrum for private auction and then receive a cut of the auction proceeds (which could be used for employee bonuses). This would be an important incentive for federal agencies that are hoarding spectrum inefficiently to transfer that spectrum to more efficient and profitable uses and users.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would require that, to the maximum extent possible, federal spectrum users rely on the private sector to supply them with radio communications equipment. Competitive bidding also would be required for all new federal government procurement of radio communications systems. Finally, the proposal would mandate that federal agencies work together with private sector firms to utilize more advanced and efficient digital services that would then open up more spectrum for use. Once a government agency and a private sector firm had installed the new digital technologies and created new spectrum capacity, the agency and the firm could divide the spectrum for other uses. The President would have the ability, however, to veto any FCC action related to public spectrum use that was deemed harmful to national security or public safety.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan also would place public spectrum users on equal footing with private users in terms of spectrum flexibility. Government spectrum users would be able to transfer their spectrum to any other public or private entity and receive compensation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 In addition, the plan would likely raise significant revenues for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief. 	 
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would end needless duplication of spectrum management responsibilities by consolidating all authority within the FCC. Currently, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the publicly held spectrum, while the FCC manages all private spectrum. Upon implementation of the plan, all NTIA functions would be transferred to the FCC, and the NTIA, now part of the Department of Commerce, could be closed down.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would "block grant" authority over public safety spectrum back to the states. In essence, those portions of the spectrum required by state and local public safety users (police and fire stations) would be managed by the states. Any interference issues that arose would be adjudicated by the FCC. 
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report to monitor progress.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would require that the FCC prepare a spectrum report summarizing the progress and results of this deregulatory effort. This would include both a cost-benefit analysis of the measure and additional legislative recommendations from the FCC to further the process of spectrum reform. </ul>
<p>


<b>HOW THE PRESSLER PLAN COULD BE IMPROVED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Even though the Pressler discussion draft marks a significant and beneficial step in the right direction, it could be improved. Additional reforms that should be undertaken and policy clarifications that are needed include:<ul>

<li><b>Hold outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the Pressler proposal would create a sensible second-best solution to the broadcast spectrum dilemma, it is still preferable to apply auctions equally to all spectrum uses and users. It simply makes no sense to carve out special exemptions for certain industries while Congress is attempting to craft more pro-competitive, anti-monopolistic telecommunications policies. Many policymakers argue that the special "social compact" the public has with the broadcast industry justifies giving broadcasters special non-auction status, with government furnishing private broadcasters with free licenses in exchange for universal, high-quality informational and entertainment service.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		But by almost any measure, broadcasters have not lived up to their end of the bargain. Broadcasters, in fact have served the public poorly, primarily because they have not faced stiff competition for viewer allegiance until recent years. Hence, they have felt little pressure to improve the quality of their programming.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Congress should end this failed social compact with broadcasters and demand that they enter the competitive age of communications on the same basis as all others in the industry. The Pressler plan could be improved markedly by making sure that such uncompetitive favoritism is ended once and for all.
<p>
<li><b>De-license the entire spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While providing complete flexibility in use is an important and long-needed step toward a free market in spectrum, the Pressler plan fails to take the final step needed to ensure that spectrum socialism is ended forever. Congress needs to eliminate all spectrum licensing requirements and provide current license holders full property rights to their spectrum allocation. This would ensure that all bureaucratic spectrum meddling ends and that a truly free market reigns in the wireless realm, as it does in real estate markets where private property rights have worked so well for centuries. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This does not mean anarchy would be or should be allowed to exist in wireless spectrum markets. Government would still have an important role in enforcing property rights in spectrum. For example, interference and trespass issues would still need to be adjudicated and resolved by independent third parties. This does not mean, however, that only the FCC is suited to carry out this task. In fact, enforcing property rights in spectrum should be easier than enforcing them in land since fewer "externality" concerns exist. For example, while river and air pollution present special problems in the enforcement of land property rights, no comparable externalities exist in the wireless spectrum. Private spectrum coordination organizations (which already exist), the courts, or a federal administrative body much smaller than the FCC could carry out any straightforward dispute resolution concerns that remain.
<p>
<li><b>End "public interest standard" regulation and guarantee equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	At the heart of everything that is wrong with modern communications law lies the "public interest standard."  This standard, which has governed communications policy at the FCC for almost seven decades, has never been defined. In effect, therefore, is a non-standard; it has no fixed meaning. Its vagueness has been used by federal regulators to destroy competition, to threaten the livelihood of existing businesses, and, most important, evade First Amendment restrictions -- all in the name of protecting the public.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal, like the Telecommunications Act which preceded it, would do nothing to define this open-ended regulatory standard or minimize its uncompetitive effect on the wireless marketplace. Bureaucrats would continue to be able to diminish competitive opportunities and run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of spectrum users. This makes increasingly less sense as wireless electronic technologies (which are accorded only secondary First Amendment protections) subsume the more traditional print media (which are accorded strict First Amendment rights). If Congress does not define this standard clearly, the FCC conceivably could decide to regulate the content of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal merely because these and other newspapers and magazines are delivered over an electronic medium the agency is able to regulate under the public interest standard. Congress would find it difficult to explain to the public (not to mention the editors of these private and traditionally unregulated newspapers) just why regulation is needed merely because the public receives these dailies over computer screens instead of on paper.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In short, the public interest standard may serve the interests of regulators and the special interests that benefit from its uncompetitive edicts, but it does not serve the consuming public. It should be clear that policymakers can choose regulation under the public interest standard or they can choose free competition -- but they cannot choose both. Cutting the spectrum loose from its 70-year-old regulatory shackles is the best way to serve the public interest.
<p>
<li><b>End protectionist policies that restrict beneficial foreign investment in spectrum technologies and companies, and combine this with privatization of international satellite organizations.</b> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, foreign companies may not own a radio communications license and may not own more than 20 percent of the shares of a company that holds a radio communications license. This protectionist restriction has outlived its usefulness. While national security concerns may have served as a valid justification for prohibiting foreign investment in the past, this policy no longer makes sense. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 Restricting foreign investment in spectrum technologies and firms cuts off the flow of beneficial capital and expertise. Just as free trade in other sectors has benefited the American economy and improved the nation's competitiveness, openness to free trade in communications goods and services will best serve the interests of American firms and consumers.<sup>13</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 While an effort was made during committee debate over the Telecommunications Act to include language eliminating or at least curtailing the effect of Section 310(b), such language was not included in the final conference bill. The Pressler proposal could correct this mistake by repealing Section 310(b) and all other telecommunications spectrum protectionism once and for all.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Also, to promote international trade in telecommunications, the Pressler plan could take steps to begin breaking down the global monopolies held by international satellite organizations such as Inmarsat and Intelsat. These organizations are international consortia of various signatory countries that have long held a strong grip over access to international satellite service. Comsat is the U.S. representative to Inmarsat (which provides mobile and maritime satellite services) and Intelsat (which provides global television and telephone services). Now that viable private satellite carriers exist that can provide international communications services more efficiently, these organizations should be privatized and all special privileges they receive should be revoked to encourage a more competitive marketplace.
<p></ul>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While the Pressler spectrum privatization proposal is not perfect, it represents the boldest and most principled deregulatory initiative in the field of communications to date. In comparison to the initial drafts of the Telecommunications Act, which pre-emptively compromised on key policy issues, Senator Pressler's initial spectrum effort represents near flawless deregulatory legislation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 If Congress fails to pursue this unique spectrum liberalization effort, it will be forgoing the most important privatization opportunity in years -- perhaps in this century. Countless new innovations would flow from the creation of a free market in spectrum. This innovation and entrepreneurship would create untold numbers of new job and export opportunities. In short, the Pressler spectrum privatization plan would revolutionize the communications industry and provide a much-needed boost to the American economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since the early 1930s, no sector of the American economy has been more heavily regulated than the financial services industry, and particularly commercial banks. Addressing an industry conference, Jerry L. Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, summed up the extent of banking regulations by noting that 
<blockquote>

For more than 60 years, the Glass-Steagall Act has defined what a banking organization has been allowed to do; the Douglas and other bank holding company acts have defined the corporate form required to do it; the national or state banking authorities, deposit insurance agencies, and Federal Reserve have defined how to do it; and their supervisors and examiners have made sure it was done that way. It's a tribute to the perennial optimism of human beings that a conference on the future of banking might talk about anything other than <I>regulation</I>.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, it is difficult to speak of banking or any other financial service without also mentioning the overwhelming amount of federal regulation that affects the industry. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of this regulatory web is the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall established barriers between commercial banks and their investment counterparts. It also established barriers between banks and other commercial businesses so that today, a bank that offers loans and checking accounts cannot also directly underwrite securities for its business customers or offer life insurance policies to its consumers. This theory of "separation banking" continued to drive federal regulation for 60 years. Each time the market established a legal connection between banking and another financial or commercial sector, the government stepped in with new regulations preventing such a relationship. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As a result of legal restrictions, banks have seen their share of the financial services sector slip away to less-regulated competitors. In fact, between 1952 and 1994, banks, thrifts, and credit unions saw their share of the financial sector fall from 67.4 percent to 35.5 percent,<sup>2</sup> largely because banks are prohibited from taking advantage of innovative investment opportunities and offering modern financial options to their customers. In essence, banks are asked to compete in the technologically advanced 1990s using only 1930s investment techniques. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consumers suffer substantial harm from the forced separation of financial services. Every producer and consumer in the United States is connected in some way to the financial services industry, be it through a simple $100 checking account or by means of a complex, multibillion-dollar corporate merger. Nearly every economic transaction -- millions of them each day -- involves the exchange of money or the promise of a future exchange of money, so every producer and consumer in the country feels the weight of financial service regulations daily. And every day, producers and consumers pay an unnecessary premium for this burdensome system of regulation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the federal financial regulatory system.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress and the President should allow financial services to be provided within a free market by eliminating the many regulations that currently interfere with efficient transactions and savings. The first step in this process is elimination of the artificial barriers that have been created between commercial and investment banking and all other commercial and financial activities.<sup>3</sup>  Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ul><p><li>

Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella bank holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses;

<p><li>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services;

<p><li>Eliminate all federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and

<p><li>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Enacting these recommendations is the first step in ending more than 60 years of harmful financial regulation and allowing the American financial system to take advantage of modern technology. As a guide to policymakers, this <I>Talking Points</I> reviews the history of federal laws that have prohibited integrated financial services, offers recommendations based on a conclusion that these laws are antiquated, discusses the benefits of financial services reform, and reviews current reform efforts.
<p>
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general framework of modern financial service regulation was set by the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), passed by Congress in reaction to the more than 10,000 bank failures or forced mergers between 1929 and 1933. In general, Glass-Steagall prohibits banks from offering a full range of banking services. According to Jonathan Macey and Geoffrey Miller, authors of <I>Banking Law and Regulation:</I> "Responding to political charges that the Depression had been caused by bank speculation in securities, the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Securities firms were not to accept deposits or affiliate with deposit-taking institutions; and commercial bank members of the Federal Reserve System were barred from participating, either directly or indirectly, in many aspects of the securities business."<sup>4</sup>  This separation evolved from a fear by politicians that commercial banks were commonly engaged in risky investments using the deposits of individuals and small businesses. From their perspective, banks were gambling with the life savings of an unsuspecting public.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly before final passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, Senator Carter Glass expressed the depth of this fear: "The main purpose of the bill as passed by the Senate last spring, as Senators will recall, was to prevent, under penalty, the use of Federal Reserve banking facilities for stock-gambling purposes. I use that term in its harshest sense, realizing that it touches the sensibilities of a great many people who persist in calling it 'stock-investment purposes.'"<sup>5</sup>  These comments by one of the Act's principal sponsors epitomize the heated rhetoric that surrounded banking regulation in the early years of the Depression. It is ironic that these words are still used by legislators to justify expansion of strict banking regulations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The driving fear behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 has continued to guide banking regulation ever since. Every time the banking industry found a legal way to link commercial banking with investment services or other commercial activities, federal regulators blocked the path. For example, after the passage of Glass-Steagall, many bankers created bank holding companies or umbrella organizations that owned a share of several different companies. A holding company might have owned a commercial bank, an investment bank, and an insurance company. Because these holdings were separate entities, such an arrangement was legal. And although such an arrangement was not very efficient, it did offer bank holding companies many of the advantages of integrated banking.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, however, was passed to prevent these bank holding companies from simultaneously owning such diverse financial entities. Specifically, the Act "was intended to make bank holding companies subject to federal regulation and, more specifically, to get all of them out of commerce."<sup>6</sup>  Moreover, the same fears about bigness and the safety of individual savings that led to passage of Glass-Steagall also led to passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The principal sponsor of the 1956 Act, Senator Willis Robertson of Virginia, did not hesitate to invoke the shade of his fellow Virginian and predecessor, Carter Glass, recalling that "as early as 1938 Glass realized that the restrictions provided were not adequate to protect independent bankers from possible monopolistic situations and he sought to have them strengthened.... My own efforts to pick up and carry on the attempts of my predecessor to regulate bank holding companies more effectively began in 1949."<sup>7</sup>  As John Kareken notes, "Revealing its fear of bigness, a fear linking it to Congresses past and future, the Eighty-fifth Congress responded with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."<sup>8</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This fear of bigness and belief that integrated banks were too risky with individual deposits were evident throughout the 1960s and 1970s as federal courts and regulators continued to separate commercial and investment banking. In a 1981 decision, the Supreme Court declared: "Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures [leading up to the Great Depression]."<sup>9</sup>  As recently as March 1995, these fears continued to influence congressional action (or in this case, inaction). Testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, James L. Bothwell, Director of Financial Institutions and Markets Issues for the General Accounting Office, asked: "How would the public respond if a major company that owned a bank got into trouble?  How would regulators be able to maintain adequate supervision of the company as a whole?"<sup>10</sup>  Because lawmakers evidently found this possibility disconcerting, federal law has continued to prevent banks and bank holding companies from engaging in any other commercial or financial activity, in hopes of preventing bank failures and the loss of depositor money.
<p>
<b>THE CASE FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Two main fears have guided the mandatory separation of commercial banking and investment banking: risk of loss and conflict of interest. These fears have guided federal policy at least since the Depression. However, studies undertaken over the past 35 years have demonstrated that these fears are groundless. This research has demonstrated that integrated banking, a free market in which financial companies are free to engage in any activity they wish, leads to banks that are both safer and less prone to failure. Moreover, most banks carefully avoid a possible conflict of interest because to do so is in the best interest of the company and its investors. The natural conclusion is that laws and regulations which prohibit integrated banking should be eliminated and that commercial banks, bank holding companies, insurance providers, investment banks, and other commercial firms should be allowed to enter a full range of financial and commercial activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk of Loss.</b> Perhaps the greatest fear lawmakers have expressed concerning the relationship between commercial banking and investment or other financial activities is that the inherent risk of such endeavors places deposited money in jeopardy. A loss could destroy the financial security of people who have deposited their life savings in the bank.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor has the bank holding company structure been viewed as any safer with respect to investment money. It is feared, for example, that a bank might simply transfer capital to an affiliated investment bank or insurance company. Considered equally dangerous, "a bank might purchase securities from its affiliate at greater-than-market prices or sell securities and make loans to facilitate securities purchases from the affiliate at less-than-market prices."<sup>11</sup>  In any case, the concern is that bankers would worry first about their own financial interest and only then about the security of bank depositors' money.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these risks indeed were a threat, or if bankers really were concerned only about their own financial security, banks that engaged in stock market investment before passage of Glass-Steagall would have failed at a greater rate than those which did not involve themselves in such activities. However, this was not the case. In fact, studies have shown that banks involved in securities activities were less likely to fail than those not involved in investing. Eugene White investigated and found that "while 26.3 percent of all national banks failed in this period [from 1930-1933], only 6.5 percent of the 62 banks which had [investment] affiliates in 1929 and 7.6 percent of the 145 banks which conducted large operations through their bond departments closed their doors (see Chart 2)."<sup>12</sup>  On average, banks that engaged in investment activities failed less frequently than those that did not.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for the relative stability among integrated banks, as White notes, was their ability to diversify financial activities during a period of slow commercial banking. "This diversification allowed banks to gain new business as their more traditional activities stagnated and to take advantage of significant complementarities in the production of financial services."<sup>13</sup>  Also, integrated banks, primarily from necessity, tended to have larger asset bases which allowed them greater economies of scale during difficult economic times. Ironically, one of the regulators' greatest fears -- bigness -- was actually an asset to banks during the early years of the Depression.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conflict of Interest.</b> Another important concern of bank regulators is that integrated banks would represent a clear conflict of interest that could lead bank owners and managers to put their own financial interest before that of depositors. For example, many fear that a bank underwriting equity in a company faces a perverse incentive to influence its depositors to invest in that company, even if such an investment is unsound. Banks would have an easy time persuading investors, often considered na<ve, to make risky investments. Senator Robert Bulkley summed up this belief in 1932: "The banker ought to be regarded as the financial confidant and mentor of his depositors. Obviously, the banker who has nothing to sell to his depositors is much better qualified to advise disinterestedly and to regard diligently the safety of depositors than the banker who uses the list of depositors in his savings department to distribute circulars concerning the advantages of this, that or the other investment."<sup>14</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Securities issued by commercial banks or affiliates would have underperformed when compared to securities issued by investment banks if the fear expressed by Senator Bulkley and others were well-grounded. However, evidence from the period before passage of Glass-Steagall indicates otherwise. Randall Krozner and Raghurm Rajan, professors at the University of Chicago, have found that between 1924 and 1940, "investment bank underwritten issues experienced roughly 40 percent more defaults than [did] affiliate underwritten issues."<sup>15</sup>  Additionally, they found that commercial banks and their affiliates tended to underwrite "higher-quality issues" of larger companies that were inherently safer.<sup>16</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated banks tended to underwrite safer securities because the market corrected for the exact fear that legislators wished to regulate away: a risk of individual savings. Most depositors at integrated banks looked very closely at the investment portfolio of their bank to ensure a desirable level of security. Contrary to Senator Bulkley's fears, depositors made informed, sound investment decisions. Investors who were concerned not with safety, but with the potential for a greater return generally went to investment banks. Krozner and Rajan conclude:<blockquote>

Indeed, our results suggest that the public markets and rating agencies were aware of the potential for conflicts (or weak reputations) of the affiliates. The affiliates appear to have responded to the market's concerns by  underwriting primarily more senior securities and securities of older, larger, and better-known firms than did the investment banks.<sup>17</sup></blockquote>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, the market during the 1920s -- before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act -- was acting efficiently, with integrated commercial banks serving small investors concerned with safety and investment banks serving larger investors seeking a substantial but openly risky return.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of this evidence leads to a conclusion far different from the one historically driving federal banking regulation: Integrated banks tend to be safer and less averse to conflicts of interest than a combined system of purely investment banks and purely commercial banks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advancing Technology</b>. The historic evidence by itself is enough to warrant a change in federal financial regulations. However, there is an additional impetus to action. Modern technology has allowed expansion of the financial services sector to the point where banks as traditionally defined are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet institutions unfortunate enough to be classified as banks are unable to capitalize on new financial opportunities because federal regulations are still guided by laws and principles derived in the 1930s. Not only are banks hurt, but consumers are unable to take advantage of more profitable opportunities made possible by technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the following:<ul>
<p><li>An average money market mutual fund earns a 4.76 percent annual rate of return,<sup>18</sup> and many offer free checking services. The average commercial bank checking account earns less than 4.0 percent interest annually, and consumers often must pay a service charge for each check or transfer. Although mutual funds are growing in popularity, many consumers do not take advantage of these financial instruments because, with rare exceptions, commercial banks are prohibited from offering them. In many cases, these consumers simply are unaware of the mutual fund option.

<p><li>Many small businesses cannot expand (or even start) because equity capital is difficult and expensive to secure. Such companies are limited in their expansion potential because they cannot incur additional debt. Moreover, these difficulties place small businesses at a disadvantage in comparison to larger corporations that enjoy ready access to investment services and are more able to afford the overhead costs of obtaining equity. Integrated financial service provision would allow local banks and providers to underwrite small local businesses and finance entrepreneurs.

<p><li>Many commercial companies have created financial service departments or affiliates. Banks, on the other hand, are prohibited from entering other commercial sectors. Therefore, they cannot take full advantage of the technology that has made it possible for companies such as General Electric, Ford, and Sears to offer various financially related services such as commercial loans, credit cards, and personal insurance.

<p><li>Technology renders many of the services to which commercial banks are limited obsolete. Today, even small investors can take advantage of large potential earnings by pooling their funds. Additionally, computers and the Internet make financial services more accessible -- but not nearly as accessible as they might be in a world without federal regulations against integrated banking. Commercial banks have the infrastructure to provide an efficient retail market. There are banks in every town in America, often on every corner in larger cities. And while the percentage of the population owning a personal computer with access to the Internet is increasing, nearly 100 percent of the population currently has easy access to a bank. If these banks were allowed to offer a full range of financial services, millions of consumers could take advantage of increased earnings. The economy as a whole also would benefit from a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rate at which technology is capable of changing also makes deregulation necessary. As mentioned above, for each federal regulation that aims to prevent integrated banking, the private sector devises a legal bypass. This process is like a perpetual motion machine: As the pace of technological advance quickens, federal regulations become obsolete all the more rapidly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider just two facts:
<ol><p><li>The pace of technological change over the past ten years has tended to follow Moore's Law. Named for Intel founder Gordon Moore, this law dictates that the power of advanced technology will double roughly every 18 months. In other words, the life cycle of most modern technology is less than two years.

<p><li>The average regulation takes more than two years to conceive, develop, and implement. And this does not include the time needed to legislate changes in major regulations and the time consumed by court proceedings to interpret those regulations.
</ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taken together, these facts lead to one overriding question: How can government possibly keep pace with such rapidly changing technology?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the best example of the change technology will bring to the financial services sector is the creation of digital money, often referred to as "e-cash."  E-cash, in its purest form, represents an on-line account that can be used in a manner similar to a debit card. Often called stored-value cards, e-cash accounts are being developed by many non-bank entities. Should non-bank providers be subject to the same reserve requirements and regulations as banks, and will e-cash accounts be covered under federal deposit insurance?<sup>19</sup>  These questions will have to be answered as electronic commerce becomes increasingly popular. But the first question that needs to be addressed is: Will a government-run regulatory structure that takes years to promulgate even a simple rule be able to respond to a technology that has the potential to emerge and change within months?  The answer is that it will not.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate goal of financial modernization must be to eliminate all barriers that exist between commercial banking, investment banking, and all other commercial and financial activities. It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the current federal financial regulatory system. The only sensible course is to sweep away 60 years of government intervention in financial services and begin anew with a free and open financial market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first logical step in financial modernization is to allow diverse firms to affiliate under a single umbrella company. Currently, any company that owns a commercial bank is prohibited from owning any other financial service company such as an insurance firm or investment bank. The intent of this restriction is to prevent companies from using the commercial bank's deposits to subsidize risky investments. In reality, however, the Bank Holding Company Act has increased savings and investment costs by preventing an efficient delivery of financial services.

<p><li><b>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;True free-market reform would not stop at allowing only affiliations between diverse companies. Individual financial service firms should be permitted to provide a whole range of services, financial and otherwise. This can be accomplished only by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is unclear whether financial service companies, if given the opportunity would choose to structure themselves as individual firms or as financial service holding companies.<sup>20</sup>  However, a single corporate structure should not be imposed by federal fiat. Instead, companies should be free to chose the structure that best suits their customers and shareholders.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are several reasons why financial modernization legislation should include repeal of both the Glass-Steagall Act of 1993 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: <b>First</b>, smaller financial institutions would benefit. These small companies, many serving rural communities, would find it difficult to affiliate with other financial service companies. In order to take advantage of the opportunities flowing from deregulation, small companies might have to "go it alone" and provide insurance, underwriting, and other services within the structure of an individual company.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Second</b>, economic efficiency might require an individual firm to offer a full complement of financial services. A firm with an extensive retail network could find it more advantageous to offer expanded services within its existing structure. For example, a commercial bank with an extensive branch system in place might not want to purchase an insurance company with an entirely separate network of branches. Instead, the bank might find it more efficient to expand services available at existing branches. This would benefit customers by increasing convenience and decreasing transaction costs. The most important goal of modernization should be to ensure that choices about diversification are left to individual firms and not mandated by the federal government.

<p><li><b>Eliminate federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision.</b>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is not enough simply to remove statutory restrictions against integrated banking. Sixty years of federal regulations, rules, and tedious oversight also must be rolled back. And while statutes such as the Banking Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 have set the general framework for federal involvement in financial services, it has been the daily actions of federal regulatory agencies that have tightened the grip on America's financial system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with all government agencies, the federal financial regulatory agencies are slow to change. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal regulators did begin to allow some "well-capitalized" banks to provide limited investment and commercial services. These are steps in the right direction, but because they are exceptions to the rules and are applied somewhat arbitrarily, they create distortions in the financial services market. These exclusions also complicate the regulatory structure so that similar banks with identical characteristics often are treated differently. Moreover, banks without political clout are denied the opportunity to diversify their operations and subsequently are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, it is increasingly difficult for federal regulators to keep pace with changes in technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rolling back the regulatory powers of the various federal financial agencies is every bit as essential as repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Only when financial service companies are free from both statutory restraints and regulatory burdens will they be able to take full advantage of the free market.
<p>
<li><b>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once existing regulations are eliminated, there will be no restrictions on the financial or investment opportunities available to commercial firms. Any future regulation or federal government action should be concerned only with securing a minimum safety net for individual depositors. Every other transaction and financial service company should be left to the free market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been much talk recently of creating a two-way street between insurance companies and commercial banks. True free-market financial modernization would go well beyond this to create a virtual autobahn of activity. Financial service companies should be allowed to offer any service they wish and to choose for themselves the companies with which they want to be affiliated. Likewise, commercial firms should be allowed to enter the financial market at any point that seems most advantageous for them. This integration and free entry will breed entrepreneurship, which in turn will produce lower costs and make available more consumer services.</ol>

<p>
<b>Benefits of These Recommendations</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Increase the safety and soundness of all banks.</b> First-year economics students learn that diversity helps increase stability. Likewise, any investor who desires a safe portfolio diversifies his investments. The past 60 years of financial regulation have ignored this basic economic understanding, and banks have continued to fail as a result. Integrated financial service provision will increase the safety and soundness of all financial companies by allowing them to diversify their operations just as individual investors and other commercial companies do.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History proves that banks with diverse operations are less likely to fail than those restricted to specific activities. Research by Eugene White, for example, has demonstrated that in the 1920s, before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, banks engaged in investment activities were less likely to fail than banks engaged solely in consumer activities (see Chart 2).<sup>21</sup>  In fact, the majority of banks that failed during the late 1920s were small banks with limited investments and activities. No witnesses testifying in 1931, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and numerous bank executives, mentioned securities-related activity as the cause of any bank failures.<sup>22</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second example is provided by the failure of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As early as 1982, analysts were predicting a bleak outlook for S&Ls. Brookings Institution economist Andrew Carron wrote that "As a result of this decline in net worth and asset values, between 15 and 27 percent of the federally insured firms in the [savings and loan] industry would find themselves in an untenable position: without drastic cost cutting, good fortune, or a cash infusion from the government, they would be unable to return to break-even operations. Ultimately, they would fail."<sup>23</sup>  Indeed, between August 1989 and the end of 1992, 642 savings and loans failed. The primary reason, again predicted by Carron, was that "[t]ax laws and regulatory practice have forced savings and loans and mutual savings banks to hold fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages as their principal assets and to accept the short-term deposits of households as their major source of funds."<sup>24</sup>  Looking back on the crisis, Alan Gart wrote that the number one reason so many S&Ls failed was "a combination of mismatched maturities of fixed-rate mortgages and variable-rate short term deposits during a period of rising interest rates."<sup>25</sup>  In other words, savings and loans were not allowed to diversify their services or their assets. As long as mortgage rates and consumer interest rates were compatible, this was not a problem. But as soon as the housing market turned sour, many S&Ls failed because they had no offsetting profitable activities.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated financial service provision would allow financial service companies to diversify their investment portfolios so that downturns in one sector could be offset by upturns in others. In economics, this is known as vertical integration. Integrated financial service provision also would allow diversification of services, permitting financial service companies to move resources from inactive services to those that are active and profitable. For example, when the real estate market is in a downturn, companies could move resources from the mortgage industry to a more profitable sector, such as life insurance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow regional banks a more diverse operating arena to serve their clients better.</b> Many analysts believe that financial service deregulation would drive small local banks out of business and that would be the end of personal banking. On the contrary, integrated financial service provision would allow local financial companies to expand the arena in which they operate, thereby increasing the number of services they can offer their local community. Local financial companies are best able to understand the unique needs of the communities in which they operate, and expanding the opportunities of these companies will allow them to meet their community needs more effectively.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also, integrated financial service provision would allow many small, regional financial service companies to diversify their activities, which is inherently more stable. The evidence cited above shows that banks with diverse portfolios are less likely to fail. The reason for increased stability with diversification is simple. Diversity allows a financial service provider to offset slow times in one market area with growth in another. Diversity is the key to any stable investment strategy and should be allowed in the banking industry.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This would be particularly important in rural areas for two reasons. First, it is accepted increasingly that the future success of the American agriculture industry will depend on exports. Farmers and the agriculture community will need to take advantage of efficient foreign exchange markets, financial futures trading, and other mechanisms to increase export opportunities for their commodities. This is possible only if regional financial service companies are allowed increased access to these financial activities through integrated financial service provision. Second, regional rural banks historically have been subject to economic swings in the agriculture industry. Because current law limits banks to narrow fields of operation, such natural events as a drought or freeze can cause the failure of a rural bank limited to agriculture lending, and this failure can exacerbate the problems faced by a rural community. The ability to provide integrated financial services would allow rural financial service companies to diversify their activities, thus decreasing their susceptibility to swings in the agricultural industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to secure capital more easily.</b> One of the primary benefits of integrated financial service provision would be the ability of commercial banks to underwrite equity for businesses. This would allow small businesses to go directly to local banks to secure equity rather than being forced to go to a separate investment bank, thus incurring higher transaction costs. Also, many investment banks today do not concentrate on reaching small businesses because of the high costs involved. Capital markets would become more accessible to all businesses, especially small or regional companies, once all financial service providers were given the option of underwriting securities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow greater access to capital markets for individual investors.</b> Eugene White has noted that many commercial banks entered investment banking in the 1920s because they "had established extensive retailing networks among their depositors during [World War I]. Unlike investment bankers who generally had a small clientele of the well-to-do, commercial banks had large numbers of potential customers, each of whom could invest a small amount in securities."<sup>26</sup>  These banks saw an underdeveloped market in small investors and reacted in a typical market-oriented manner until Congress prevented such a move by passing the Glass-Steagall Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same opportunity exists for commercial banks today. Integrated banks would be able to take advantage of their extensive network of local branches and affiliates. Gerald O'Driscoll, Vice President and Director of Policy Analysis for Citicorp, recently wrote that "The homework banks do to process a loan application frequently duplicates that needed to write an insurance policy. Further, the distribution system is already present in every bank lobby."<sup>27</sup>  Likewise, insurance agents and other networked financial service providers would be able to offer their customers more services at lower cost. This all means that consumers who have access to a local bank or insurance agency, but not to the Internet or an investment bank, will be provided with more options when investing their savings.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Require fewer transaction costs for customers.</b> Not only would integrated financial service provision provide greater access to financial markets for all investors and businesses, but it would do so more efficiently in many instances. As mentioned above, commercial banks have an extensive network of local offices, affiliates, automated teller machines (ATMs), and branches. Accompanying this structure is a communications and managerial infrastructure that must be duplicated by a separate investment bank and a separate insurance agency. By combining these services, consumers would be able to take advantage of economies of scale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the administrative duties required by banks also duplicate those required by insurance agents or investment companies. For example, a loan mortgage application contains much the same information as a homeowner's insurance contract. Likewise, a business loan application requires much the same financial information as a request for securities underwriting. If a single financial institution could offer all of these services, many of these duplicated efforts would be eliminated and costs reduced. Reduced costs allow individuals and businesses to make more valuable purchases and more investors and entrepreneurs to enter the financial markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, integrated financial service provision would lead more financial service institutions to offer discount brokerage service, mutual funds, and other similar opportunities. Many individuals unable to reach these markets in the past because of high transaction costs were forced to settle for a single savings vehicle, even if that vehicle was not ideally suited to their needs. These investors, often of the lower working class, would be able to access a greater selection of investments and would soon realize a higher rate of return on their savings. Additionally, the market in general would perform more efficiently because a larger part of aggregate savings would be invested in more efficient and profitable avenues.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow capital to flow through the American economy more efficiently.</b> Many economists believe that prohibiting integrated financial service provision is a drag on the American economy because savings are not allocated efficiently. As Michael Porter has written, "The United States possesses an enormous pool of investment capital. The problem lies in how this capital is allocated -- at what rates and into what kinds of investments."<sup>28</sup>  For example, restrictions on the activities of commercial banks prevent them from informing investors about the full range of opportunities available to them. Also, the transaction costs of dealing with two separate banks (one commercial and the other investment) prevent many investors from moving their capital from a less profitable investment to a more profitable one because it is simply too inconvenient. The result is that investment is not directed toward its most efficient end.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Demand and supply of capital investment would be met better if financial service companies were allowed to offer a full range of investment opportunities and commercial businesses were able to offer financial services. More investors would have access to a broader range of investment vehicles. Increased consumer selection would lead more individuals to make better choices in the investment methods they employ. And the increased competition would force financial service providers to improve the quality of their products and increase the efficiency with which they deliver those products to the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Decrease the cost of capital faced by American companies.</b> A more efficient allocation of investment would lead to a lower cost of capital. First, transaction costs would decrease. Transaction costs constitute a significant component of the cost of capital faced by companies in the American financial market. An integrated financial services system would enable a company to complete more financial transactions through a single broker-dealer, eliminating the need for duplicate paperwork and other such administrative expenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closely related to a decrease in transaction costs is a more efficient allocation of economic resources. Current financial regulations, by definition, obstruct the natural market flow of capital, thus creating an inefficient distribution system. Capital would be allocated more efficiently if unhindered by artificial government barriers. A more efficient delivery system would produce less expensive capital for American businesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, a closer relationship between banks and commercial interests would form because banks would be both lenders and owners of companies. A financial service provider that owns stock in a company through the underwriting process has a stake in the success of that company and is more likely to work closely with the other owners to avoid bankruptcy. Large companies also would be able to carry a greater amount of debt (in relation to equity), which would lower the cost of capital because debt is usually less expensive than equities. The lower cost of debt would lead to a lower cost of capital.<sup>29</sup>  This, and the decreased risk of bankruptcy, would produce more stable companies and lower prices.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS AND REALITY OF REFORM</b>
<p>
<b>MYTH: Independent insurance agents will be driven out of business.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: The future is not bright for independent insurance agents, even without significant financial modernization.</b> Technology has made it possible for insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers without relying on distribution by agents. For example, some insurance companies are offering their services on the Internet. This technological bridge between producer and consumer makes the independent agent an expensive -- if not unnecessary -- intermediate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
True integrated financial service legislation would allow a single company to offer any financial or commercial service or, optionally, to affiliate with any financial or commercial entity. A "two-way street" would be created whereby commercial banks could begin to offer insurance products and insurance agents could provide banking services. Thus, insurance agents and bankers would be equally free to engage in a full range of financial services. Insurance agents, for this reason, and with the impetus of an otherwise bleak future, should support full deregulation so they can diversify their operations and increase their customer base.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Small local banks will be eliminated as large national financial service providers become more powerful.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Local banks will always have a place in the financial services industry.</b> The personal service and unique products they can provide will allow small banks to fill a market niche. A recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article highlighted the story of Catawba Valley Bank, a new local bank opened on November 1, 1995, in Hickory, North Carolina.<sup>30</sup>  The bank, which prides itself on individual attention and local investments, was launched by Steve Aaron, who left his job as an executive officer of a large statewide bank. The story of Catawba Valley is not unique: New U.S. bank charters rose to nearly 150 in 1995, almost 300 percent more than during the previous year.<sup>31</sup>  Clearly, there is a demand for local banks that can deal with customers in a personal manner. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, integrated financial service provision would give local banks the ability to offer more services to their customers, thus increasing their ability to survive. Just as General Motors and Ford are able to offset slow sales of luxury sedans with increased sales of all-purpose trucks or gas-efficient compacts, so would financial service providers be able to offset slow mortgage loan sales with increased mutual fund investments. The increased stability of integrated financial service provision benefits not only the financial institution itself, but also the consumers. A stable financial institution precludes the cost and inconvenience of changing financial vendors and opening new accounts.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Integrated banks will make risky investments with deposited money.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Economic theory and historic evidence both indicate that integrated financial service companies would make safe investments with deposited money or else pay a premium for risky activity.</b> Many investors are interested in earning a high rate of return on their deposits, and willing to accept the risk that accompanies the possibility of such a payoff. On the other hand, many investors seek a safe harbor for their funds (or at least a minimal portion of them) and prefer financial service providers that make only secure investments. And while safety-seeking investors cannot expect as high a rate of return on their deposits, they can be sure of the safety of their investments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This system is essentially a pricing system for financial services. It would operate just as the pricing of automobiles does. Buyers who want a safe car that gets good gas mileage are willing to pay more than somebody looking for the economy of a used motorcycle. The important point is that the market will deliver the services (in this case, financial investment tools) that consumers demand. And because many investors seek a secure harbor for at least part of their savings, the market will deliver financial service providers that make such secure investments possible. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The work of Kroszner and Rajan indicates that before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, commercial banks engaged in equity underwriting made more secure investments in larger businesses than did pure investment banks.<sup>32</sup>  Thus, banks free to invest in any manner they wished realized that their customers expected a degree of safety and therefore made relatively secure investments.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two major reform proposals were advanced during the first session of the 104th Congress. These bills represent the third time in the past five Congresses that repeal of financial service separation laws has been attempted. Compromise legislation failed in 1988 and 1991. Both of last year's proposals would amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by allowing bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial service providers, although neither bill would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced H.R. 1062, the Financial Services Competitiveness Act of 1995, on February 27. Chairman Leach's bill would allow a "financial services holding company" to own both banking and investment affiliates. This would lead to a greater integration of commercial banking and investment banking. Chairman Leach's original bill would not have allowed a financial services holding company to own an insurance affiliate, however. Also, any holding company that currently has an insurance affiliate would be required to disassociate from that firm if it wanted to acquire a commercial bank. There would be no "two-way street" and no full integration of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second bill was introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard Baker (R-LA), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Depository Institution Affiliation Act (H.R. 814 as introduced by Representative Baker) would allow a commercial bank to affiliate with any other financial services company or commercial entity, including an insurance provider or an investment bank. The D'Amato-Baker proposal, because it would allow a greater range of affiliation, would lead to greater and more efficient integration of financial services than Representative Leach's bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The D'Amato-Baker bill presents a much purer approach to financial service integration by allowing affiliation among all financial and non-financial companies. It also would allow greater flexibility of affiliate interaction by creating fewer "firewalls" between a holding company's affiliates. For example, under Chairman Leach's bill, senior officers of one affiliate would be prohibited from simultaneously serving as senior officers of another. The D'Amato-Baker bill would extend no such restrictions. Also, and perhaps most important, the Leach bill would require holding companies themselves to be "adequately capitalized."  The D'Amato-Baker bill would place such capitalization restrictions only on insured depository affiliates.<sup>34</sup>  The overall greater freedoms allowed in the D'Amato-Baker proposal are vital first steps toward a free-market approach to integrated financial service provision. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Neither the Leach nor the Baker bill moved beyond the full Banking Committee in the House during 1995. The progress of both bills was stalled as representatives of the banking industry and the insurance industry failed to reach agreement on the integration of their services. This disagreement ultimately stalled all banking reform legislation. Senator D'Amato's bill was never marked up in committee as the Senate awaited action by the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Supreme Court ruling in <I>Barnett Bank v. Nelson</I><sup>35</sup> clears the way for federal banks to sell insurance in small towns. The decision held that federal laws allowing such transactions pre-empt state laws preventing insurance sales by banks. The decision has given Chairman Leach the opportunity to push for significant reform again this year. Leach also has modified his bill to allow affiliation of banks and insurance companies, thus creating a more complete integration of financial services. However, the bill still has a number of weaknesses, including burdensome firewalls and the exclusion of non-financial commercial companies from the integration process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the new Leach bill (H.R. 2520) nor the D'Amato-Baker bill is perfect. Neither one would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial service provisions. Affiliations would allow greater efficiency but not complete freedom for financial service companies. True reform would use the D'Amato-Baker proposal as a transition to elimination of all restrictions on financial integration. 
<p>
 <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The financial service sector is the most ubiquitous sector of the modern American economy. Commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, securities trading markets, credit card providers, and other financial services are both the backbone of the commercial market and the fuel in the American economic engine. Every day, every American depends on the financial services sector to pay bills, purchase goods, pay for education, prepare for retirement, or create a business. For this reason, it is imperative that America secure an efficient and modern financial service system.

It is impossible to create such a system within the confines of the current statutory and regulatory structure, the guiding principles of which have not changed since the early 1930s. The impetus for change is made even stronger by the rapid pace of technological change. The current regulatory structure depends on being able clearly to define a bank, an insurance agent, and a security issue. But should a shopping mall-based ATM that can process loan applications be considered a bank?<sup>36</sup>  If so, how can a machine be accused of racial bias in its decisions?  Should an Internet World Wide Web site, through which anybody can apply for an insurance policy, be considered an agent?  And if so, how can one state regulate that web page, which is globally accessible?  Even if these questions are answered within the context of the current regulatory regime, they will be replaced by others. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The only solution is to sweep away the past 60 years of financial regulation and begin the process of market-oriented modernization. Current financial service regulations and the thinking they embody were misguided at their creation and are certainly misguided and outdated today. A free-market approach to financial deregulation also would benefit American consumers and businesses. More profitable investments would be available; capital would be easier to obtain, and its cost would be reduced; and the financial services sector would enjoy more stability and security. These advantages would resound through the economy every day as individual investors and companies took advantage of this more efficient and secure financial sector.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p><ol><li>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Stand for Children rally, held in Washington on June 1, called attention to the plight of the nation's children. However, the unstated, underlying goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and implicitly to criticize those in Congress who have sought to reform it. Thus, while the Stand for Children event properly called attention to the disastrous condition of America's children, it is important to recognize that children are suffering precisely because of the governmental policies supported over the last 25 years by the leading organizations promoting the rally.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The simple fact is that children are suffering because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Designed as a system to help children, it has ended up damaging and abusing the very children it was intended to save. The welfare system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. The current system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, welfare reduces poverty, and so will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not help children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastating effect on children's development.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Americans often are told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This also is untrue.<ul>

<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) already have spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.

<li>When past and estimated future receipts of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is 13 years.

<li>Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than 75 percent will spend over five years on AFDC.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is welfare dependence, not poverty, that has the most negative effect on children.
Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Welfare dependency as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the boy's earnings will be as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy. Research by CBO Director O'Neill also shows, for example, that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will cause a 43 percent increase in the number of illegitimate births within a state. Illegitimacy, in turn, has an enormous negative effect on children's development and on their behavior as adults. Being born outside of marriage and raised in single parent homes:<ul>
<li>Triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children;

<li>Nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity;

<li>Doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and,

<li>Doubles the probability a boy will become a threat to society, engage in criminal activity, and wind up in jail.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful the child will be as an adult. If America's children are to be saved, the current welfare system must be replaced. The automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout; recipients should be required to work for benefits received. Steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Finally, Americans must help children rise upward out of poverty and despair by enlisting the support of those institutions that have a record of real success. The evidence is clear that religious institutions have enjoyed dramatic success in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. In order to help poor children, America must rely on the healing and guiding force of the churches. This can be done by giving poor parents government-funded education vouchers which could be used to send their children to private schools, including religious schools.
<p>

<b>THE FAILED LIBERAL PARADIGM</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The liberal welfare state is founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:<ul>
<li><b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.

<li><b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.

<li><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Welfare is good for kids.</ul>
<p>From this logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The recent reform legislation passed by Congress sought to slow the automatic growth of welfare spending. Thus, it violated the cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system, leading to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment and a prompt veto by President Bill Clinton.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together, they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of increasing numbers of young Americans. It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 1: Raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children.</b> The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty causes such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that poverty causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values that are key to the child's success.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 2: It is very easy to raise family income through welfare.</b> This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 3: Higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life.</b> In certain limited cases, such as when it is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives.
<p>
<b>The Truth About Welfare.</b> In contrast to the failed premises of welfare liberalism are the following hard facts about welfare and children:<ul>

<li>Except in very limited cases, such as those involving serious malnutrition, welfare programs do not yield fewer problems and better life outcomes for children.

<li>Welfare programs intended to combat poverty do not help children but do increase welfare dependence, which in turn is very harmful to children's well-being.

<li>Welfare programs intended to raise family incomes do not benefit children but do significantly increase illegitimacy and single-parent families, which in turn have decisively negative effects on children's development.</ul>

<p>Overall, the wider and more generous the welfare "safety net," the greater the problems of dependence and illegitimacy will become, and the greater the harm to children.
<p>


<b>EXAMINING WELFARE'S IMPACT ON CHILDREN</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high-benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, research published in 1994 by now-Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high-benefit states.<sup>1</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children. Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant. <sup>4</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	O'Neill and Hill conclude:<p><blockquote>

	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states. <sup>5</sup>
</blockquote><p>
	<b>More Evidence on Welfare's Negative Impact.</b> A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher non-welfare income obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25). <sup>6</sup>    However, welfare income had the opposite effect: The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing up, the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.1<sup>7</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests that an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.<sup>8</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare. <sup>9</sup> Similarly, single mothers raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>10</sup>
<p>

<b>WELFARE PROMOTES ILLEGITIMACY<sup>11</sup></b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The welfare system does added harm to children by promoting illegitimacy. The anti-marriage effects of welfare are simple and profound. The current welfare system may be conceptualized best as a system that offers each single mother with two children a "paycheck" of combined benefits worth an average of between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the state. <sup>12</sup>  The mother has a contract with the government: She will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she does not marry an employed man.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		As long as a father and mother remain unmarried, they may obtain income from two sources: the mother's welfare and the father's earnings. However, if the parents marry they must rely on the father's earnings alone. Welfare thus has made marriage economically irrational for most low-income parents. It has transformed marriage from a legal institution designed to protect and nurture children into an institution that financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents who enter into it.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Similarly, welfare has made it possible to raise a child without either the father or the mother having to hold a job. Welfare thus has made a father with low education and skills at best financially irrelevant -- and at worst a net financial handicap to the mother and the child. Welfare has worked like an acid, slowly corroding the social foundation of marriage in low-income communities. All parties -- the father, the mother, and especially the child -- are damaged by this.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single parenthood have become the conventional "lifestyle option" for raising children in many low-income communities. As Washington Post reporter Leon Dash has shown in his book When Children Want Children, most unwed teen mothers conceive and deliver their babies deliberately rather than accidentally. <sup>13</sup> While young women do not bear unwanted children in order to reap "windfall profits" from welfare, they are very much aware of the role welfare will play in supporting them once a child is born. Thus, the availability of welfare plays an important role in influencing a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		In welfare, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for. The current welfare system pays for non-work and non-marriage and has achieved dramatic increases in both. Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single mothers contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. <sup>14</sup> Other studies showing the effect of welfare in increasing illegitimacy are listed in the appendix to this paper.
<p><b>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RISING ILLEGITIMACY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	From the very beginning, children born outside of marriage have life stacked against them. The impact on the child is significant and can be permanent. Out-of-wedlock birth and growing up in a single-parent family means the child is more likely to experience:<ul>

<li>Retarded cognitive (especially verbal) development;

<li>Lower educational achievement;

<li>Lower job attainment;

<li>Increased behavior and emotional problems;

<li>Lower impulse control; and

<li>Retarded social development.
<p>
Such children are far more likely to:
<li>Engage in early sexual activity;

<li>Have children out of wedlock;

<li>Be on welfare as adults; and

<li>Engage in criminal activity.</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The absence of married parents is related to retarded development in early childhood.</b> Illegitimacy leads to delays in development. A study of black infants (aged 5 to 6 months) living in households of lower socioeconomic status in America's inner cities found that male infants who experienced "minimal interaction with their fathers" had significantly lower levels of overall mental development and lower social responsiveness for novel stimuli. <sup>15</sup>  Illegitimate children tend to have lessened cognitive development. <sup>16</sup>  <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup>   Many of these children have problems in controlling their activity (popularly called "hyperactivity"). This lack of control usually is an indication of problems in learning that will arise later in the child's development. <sup>19</sup> The effect on boys is greater, at least in the early years. <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Similar findings were enumerated again in the recent 1992 National Institute of Child Health and Development summary, "Outcomes of Early Childbearing: An Appraisal of Recent Evidence." <sup>22</sup>  And such findings are in line with earlier studies. For instance, Project TALENT, a federal survey commissioned in 1960, which tracked the development of 375,000 high school students from 1960 through 1971, found that children born outside marriage were likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. Once again, all of these effects were greater for boys. <sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>	The absence of married parents risks emotional and behavioral problems during childhood.</b> The effects of illegitimacy continue to compound through childhood. The National Health Interview Survey of Child Health (NHIS-CH) confirms that children born out of wedlock have far more behavioral and emotional problems than do children in intact married families. These problems include:<ul>

<li>Antisocial behavior --  disobedience in school, cheating and lying; bullying and cruelty to others; breaking things deliberately; failure to feel sorry after misbehaving;

<li>Hyperactive behavior -- difficulty concentrating or paying attention; becoming easily confused; acting without thinking; being restless or overactive;

<li>Headstrong behavior -- easily losing one's temper; being stubborn, irritable, disobedient at home; arguing excessively;

<li>Peer conflict -- having trouble getting along with others, being not liked, being withdrawn;

<li>Dependent behavior --  crying too much, being too dependent on others, demanding attention, clinging to adults.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Children raised by never-married mothers have significantly higher levels of all of the above behavior problems when compared to children raised by both biological parents. When comparisons are made between families that are identical in race, income, number of children, and mother's education, the behavioral differences between illegitimate and legitimate children actually widen. Compared to children living with both biological parents in similar socioeconomic circumstances, children of never-married mothers exhibit 68 percent more antisocial behavior, 24 percent more headstrong behavior, 33 percent more hyperactive behavior, 78 percent more peer conflict, and 53 percent more dependency. Overall, children of never-married mothers have behavioral problems that score nearly three times higher than children raised in comparable intact families.44 <sup>24</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Children born out of wedlock have less ability to delay gratification and poorer impulse control (control over anger and sexual gratification). They have a weaker sense of conscience or sense of right and wrong. <sup>25</sup>  Adding to all this is the sad fact that the incidence of child abuse and neglect is higher among single-parent families. <sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Being born out of wedlock increases the probability of teen sexual activity.</b> Boys and girls born out of wedlock and raised by never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually active as teenagers when compared to legitimate children raised in intact married-couple families. This finding applies to both blacks and whites. Children born out of wedlock whose mothers marry after the child's birth appear to be slightly less likely to be sexually active as teens but are still twice as active, on average, as legitimate teens of intact married couples. <sup>27</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents is related to poor academic performance during school years. The risks and consequences of illegitimacy continue through the middle years of childhood and express themselves in poor academic performance. A 1988 study by Sheila F. Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois finds that the longer the time spent in a single-parent family, the lower the education attained by a child. In general, a boy's educational attainment was cut by one-tenth of a year for each year spent as a child in a single-parent home. Controlling for family income did not reduce the magnitude of the effect noticeably. <sup>28</sup>  These findings are confirmed again and again in studies, conducted in the United States and abroad, which which demonstrate that illegitimacy is also associated with lower job and salary attainment. <sup>29</sup> <sup>30</sup>  <sup>31</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents leads to intergenerational illegitimacy. Being born outside of marriage significantly reduces the chances the child will grow up to have an intact marriage. <sup>32</sup>  Children born outside of marriage themselves are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up. <sup>33</sup>   Daughters of single mothers are twice as likely to be single mothers themselves if they are black, and only slightly less so if they are white. <sup>34</sup>  And boys living in a single-parent family are twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as are boys from a two-parent home. <sup>35</sup>  The TALENT study, noted earlier, already had found that children born to teenage parents are more likely to become teen parents themselves. <sup>36</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Illegitimacy is a major factor in America's crime wave.</b> Lack of married parents, rather than race or poverty, is the principal factor in the crime rate. It has been known for some time that high rates of welfare dependency correlate with high crime rates amo
ng young men in a neighborhood. <sup>37</sup>  But more important, a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals found that "the percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary."  The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that there is an association between race and crime is false. Illegitimacy is the key factor. The absence of marriage, and the failure to form and maintain intact families, explains the incidence of high crime in a neighborhood among whites as well as blacks. This study also concluded that poverty does not explain the incidence of crime. <sup>38</sup>  This is a dramatic reversal of conventional wisdom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Research on underclass behavior by Dr. June O'Neill confirms the linkage between crime and single-parent families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, O'Neill found that young black men raised in single-parent families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activities when compared to black men raised in two-parent families, even after holding constant a wide range of variables such as family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment, and parents' education. Growing up in a single-parent family in a neighborhood with many other single-parent families on welfare triples the probability that a young black man will engage in criminal activity. <sup>39</sup><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In vetoing the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, President Clinton has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Clinton Administration's report on welfare, which formed the basis for the President's veto, makes clear a belief that rapid and automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children. <sup>40</sup>  The organizers of the recent Stand for Children rally share a similar view.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		The President's veto and the Stand for Children rally are both founded on the failed hypothesis that combating poverty through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy, which in turn have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's reform.
<p>
<b>APPENDIX<br>
Research on Welfare and Illegitimacy</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies conducted in the last decade and a half show that welfare promotes illegitimacy and discourages marriage. Many show that welfare has a dramatically positive effect in increasing the level of illegitimacy in U.S. society. The following is a list of 19 studies on welfare and illegitimacy; of these, 14 have found a relationship between higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows that childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase may be as high as 10 percent. Mikhail S. Bernstam, "Malthus and Evolution of the Welfare State: An Essay on the Second Invisible Hand, Parts I and II," working papers E-88-41,42, Hoover Institution, Palo Alto, Cal., 1988.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	2. Research by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. M.

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3. A recent study of black Americans finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates of marriage and higher numbers of children living in single-parent homes. In general, an increase of roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to 24.

Jill Kiecolt, "Mate Availability and Family Structure Among African Americans in U.S. Metropolitan Areas," <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i>, Vol. 55 (May 1993), pp. 288-302.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	4. Research by Dr. C. R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found that half of the increases in black illegitimacy in recent decades could be attributed to the effects of welfare. C. R.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	5. Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	6. Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in St. Louis has found that an increase in AFDC benefit levels of $100 per child per month leads to roughly a 30 percent increase in out-of-wedlock births to women age 19 and under.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	7. Recent research presented at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences by Mark Rosenzweig of the University of Pennsylvania showed a reduction in AFDC payments of $130 per month could lead to a 40 percent drop in out-of-wedlock births among low income women under age 22.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	8. Another recent study finds large effects of welfare on illegitimacy. A 20 percent increase in welfare benefit levels across all states would increase the probability of teen out-of-wedlock births by as much as 16 percent. (However, the authors state that these findings should be treated cautiously because they were not proven to be statistically significant.)

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The following five studies found no relationship between higher welfare benefits and illegitimacy. Significantly, no study has ever found that welfare has a positive effect in reducing illegitimacy and promoting marriage.

This study finds a small relationship between higher welfare benefits and total births to white women, but no significant relationship between welfare and illegitimate births. The study does, however, show that being raised in a single-parent home doubles the probability that a young woman will have a child out of wedlock.

<li>         The impact of increasing the lenience and generosity of welfare in undermining work and prolonging dependence has been confirmed by controlled scientific experiment. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."  Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80. The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs: Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment. See: Gregory B. Christiansen and Walter E. Williams, "Welfare Family Cohesiveness and Out of Wedlock Births," in Joseph Peden and Fred Glahe, <i>The American Family and the State</i> (San Francisco: Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1986), p. 398.

<li>         A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.

<a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">What Shortage of Affordable Housing?</a>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros's bold plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the troubled public housing industry has been stymied in Congress by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. Yet, despite the opposition, these ideas -- which first took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations (especially during Jack Kemp's tenure at HUD) -- have shown remarkable resiliency. With the support of House reformers and leaders, and with bold intervention from the federal courts, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ensuring this will be no easy task, however, as both the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over housing policy already have produced bills that would reverse 25 years of market-based reform and, in the process, serve fewer needy families for the taxpayer dollars spent. The Senate's version (S.1260) has passed the floor. The companion version in the House (H.R. 2406) is scheduled for a vote in early May, but confronts a competing reform bill (H.R. 2198) developed by freshman Representatives Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). Significantly, the freshman bill is co-sponsored by the House leadership. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. It is a dispute over how government should help the poor and a chance for the new congressional leadership to end the public housing industry's stranglehold -- a stranglehold that has hurt tenants as well as taxpayers and turned many of America's public housing projects into costly disasters. The leadership's attention, support, and intervention will be essential, both in defending reform against the public housing industry's lobbying juggernaut and in focusing lawmakers on the issues at stake.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is at stake today is what has been at stake in every year since the early 1970s, when HUD first attempted to extract itself from the costly housing policies of the New Deal: the choice between <I>tenant-based</I> assistance and <I>project-based</I> assistance. Rent vouchers and certificates, the primary means of tenant-based assistance, provide eligible families with the cash equivalent to rent the apartment of their choice, subject to a cap based on local "fair market rents."  They empower tenants and introduce market discipline into the assisted-rental market, forcing landlords and developers to seek to provide the best value for money.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, with project-based assistance (including public housing), the eligible family is offered an apartment in a building constructed and operated exclusively to house the poor. With its origins in the Depression, project-based public housing was developed as much for its direct job-creating potential as it was to meet the housing needs of the indigent; it is this dual purpose, among other factors, that explains why project-based assistance, on average, costs up to twice as much as vouchers for each family assisted. These units typically are owned and operated by government or nonprofit organizations, although some for-profit developers have been given significant tax and other financial incentives to provide such buildings. This approach empowers landlords and developers, whose incentive is to lobby Washington and produce housing as expensively as possible, not to provide value to tenants or the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>TIME TO GIVE THE POOR A CHOICE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The significant cost difference is one of the key reasons for the shift, under both Democrat and Republican Administrations, toward vouchers and away from public housing. But the different approaches also have led to dramatic differences in the quality of life for assisted families, and this has been another compelling reason for HUD's repeated attempts to extract itself from this Depression-era program. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because public housing serves only the poor, typically in large complexes of a hundred or more units, families assisted by this program are rigidly segregated from the rest of society, always by income class and also by education and workforce participation. In the major urban areas, public housing residents are segregated almost exclusively by race. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find another American institution that induces measures of racial segregation as effectively as does public housing.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Apparently the courts agree. In April of this year, in settling a desegregation suit brought against HUD by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several Baltimore public housing tenants, HUD agreed to desegregate its Baltimore public housing projects, to tear down the decrepit buildings, and to provide the majority of the displaced tenants with vouchers that can be used to rent privately owned apartments within the greater Baltimore metropolitan area (see <a href="bg1081b.html">box</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast with public housing, vouchers allow the assisted family to choose its place of residence from private landlords in the community, provided that the required rent stays within the established limits. This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities. As a 1994 congressional report observed, "Studies have found that recipients of tenant-based rental assistance were less likely than public housing residents to live in concentrated poor urban communities.... "<sup>1</sup> With vouchers, a family with children can choose a safer neighborhood with good schools; an unemployed individual can relocate to a part of the community with better job prospects; and an elderly couple can choose a place close to family, friends, and convenient shopping. Whatever their specific needs, families can "self-tailor" the assistance in ways that provide the greatest benefits for a given cost. Moreover, because vouchers are a fixed amount of assistance, tenants have a strong incentive to "shop around" for the best value, and landlords and developers have the incentive to provide good value to the tenants (which does not happen when tenants must live in designated projects). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recognizing these advantages, President Clinton's FY 1996 budget wisely proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from the project-based form to tenant-based vouchers. Under this plan, HUD would end the multibillion-dollar direct payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with indirect support through vouchers that would be provided directly to the tenants now living in these projects. In turn, the tenants could use these vouchers to continue to pay rent to the PHA, rent better quarters elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better managers. In any case, PHAs would lose their government-sponsored monopoly status, and instead would have to compete for assisted tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. Confronted with the prospective loss of revenue, PHAs would have no choice but to improve their performance and lower their costs.
<p>
<b>HOW A MISUNDERSTOOD STUDY DROVE A POLICY FLIP-FLOP</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The FY 1996 HUD plan was the most innovative housing proposal in 25 years and relied heavily on both privatization and competitive market forces. But Congress rejected this proposal, and instead drafted new legislation that largely shifted the housing assistance emphasis back to public housing while merely paring back some of the programmatic <I>impedimenta</I> that had accumulated over the 30 years of HUD's existence. In making this decision, both committees said nice things about vouchers but then went on to cite the findings of a June 1995 GAO report<sup>2</sup> that questioned their cost, with the Senate committee stating:
<blockquote><P>
	The Committee believes that a total conversion to a voucher system is a "One-size-fits-all" approach that is not appropriate or will not work in all markets or in all circumstances. For example, a June 1995 study by the General Accounting Office determined that while nationwide the cost of vouchers versus the cost of operating public housing is similar, the averages conceal wide differences in these two options in different market areas.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House came to a similar conclusion. It acknowledged that on average vouchers were 10 percent cheaper than public housing per household served, but added: "As GAO noted, these wide variations in cost raise a number of important issues.... "<sup>4 </sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO's acknowledgement that sample observations are distributed around their mean (in other words, a bell curve) would hardly have surprised a high school math student, but this commonplace point was sufficiently alarming for both congressional housing committees to reject the HUD reform plan and continue the six-decade reliance on public housing as the primary vehicle for providing assistance to the poor. Yet the findings presented in the GAO report do nothing to support Congress's action; instead, they support the 1995 HUD proposal to "voucher out" the public housing projects.
<P>
<b>WHAT THE GAO REPORT REALLY FOUND</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the reasons HUD recommended a wholesale shift from public housing to vouchers was the significant cost difference in favor of vouchers. As acknowledged in the GAO report, HUD determined "that it cost $440 per month on average to house a family with a housing certificate, compared to an average of $481 per month in public housing."<sup>5</sup>  If spread over the 1.3 million families now in public housing, this difference, described as "similar" by the Senate, would lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year. In turn, if the savings were applied to additional vouchers, Congress would be able to assist another 118,000 poor families now eligible for HUD assistance but unable to obtain it because of limits on HUD funding.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The prospect of a GAO-acknowledged savings of $640 million alone should have encouraged Congress to begin the prompt yet orderly shift recommended by HUD Secretary Cisneros. But the GAO report presents plenty of additional information to demonstrate that the potential long-term savings from shifting to vouchers are even greater than the acknowledged 10 percent. Indeed, the true cost difference may be as much as ten times the amount HUD and GAO presented when a full accounting of all public housing costs is compiled.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For example, the same section of the GAO report that acknowledges the 10 percent difference also says, in a sentence apparently overlooked by both the House and Senate committees, that "because HUD's analysis considered the capital costs of public housing as sunk costs, it made no attempt to add an imputed debt service charge to the cost of public housing."<sup>6</sup>  <I>In other words, if we assume that public housing costs nothing to build, then public housing has only a 10 percent cost disadvantage when compared with vouchers</I>. The GAO comparison is a classic case of apples and oranges because the cost of the voucher, as related to the rent it pays, embodies all costs, including operating, capital, and debt, as well as other expenses from which public housing is exempt, such as federal, state, and local income taxes, local property taxes, and local licenses and fees. No such costs are included in GAO's representation of public housing's expenses.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, the Senate Banking Committee and the GAO provide additional information in their respective reports that can be used to establish a fuller accounting of the costs associated with public housing and allow for a more accurate comparison of these costs with the cost of vouchers. When this is done, it is apparent that, on average, the true cost of public housing is as much as twice the cost of a voucher. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The search for a more accurate assessment of public housing's costs begins with an estimate of the federal government's investment in public housing, an investment comprised largely of the cost to construct and the cost to renovate and modernize the units periodically as they deteriorate over time. An estimate of this total is included in the Senate report, which states that "the Committee is committed to safeguarding the federal taxpayers' $90 billion investment in the nation's public housing industry.... "<sup>7</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Combining this $90 billion estimate with the GAO's observation that there are approximately 1.4 million public housing units in existence<sup>8</sup> yields an average per unit historic investment/cost of $65,000. Of course, today's per unit costs are much higher than the average of costs cumulated over past years. HUD estimates current public housing development costs at an average of $88,073 per unit.<sup>9</sup>  For example, HUD has just announced the planned construction of a new project in Washington, D.C., that will have an eye-popping estimated expenditure per unit of $186,500, and a new project in Baltimore entailing expenditures of $340,000 per unit when the cost of other amenities at the project is included.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to pro rate this historic $65,000 cost over the useful life of the project, as well as establish an estimate for the costs associated with the debt service charges that would be incurred for this estimated average investment, a useful proxy is the monthly payment associated with a 30-year fixed rate, level payment, fully amortized mortgage. Using an interest rate of 7.5 percent as a conservative average for the government's long-term borrowing rate over the past several decades, this approach yields an additional monthly cost of $454.49.<sup>11</sup>  When added to the HUD/GAO monthly operating cost estimate of $481, this yields a more accurate total monthly public housing unit cost of $935.49, a figure that is more than twice the cost of vouchers. Using the current cost of building a new public housing unit -- $88,073 -- the monthly debt service charge would rise to $615.82 and the total monthly cost of that new unit would be $1,096.82.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a cost difference of this magnitude between the two programs, the rationales for the policies embodied in both the housing bills developed by both the Senate and House committees (S. 1260 and H.R. 2406) fall apart. Specifically:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Vouchers are by far the better form of assistance. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With full program costs exposed as not "similar," public housing no longer merits the benefit of the doubt, and vouchers no longer deserve the skepticism that characterizes their treatment by Congress. As a result, the policy emphasis in both these bills must be reversed and the burden of proof placed on public housing, not on vouchers. Specifically, vouchers should be the chief vehicle for housing assistance, except when a particular public housing project is not used as a vehicle for racial segregation and can be demonstrated to be less expensive as a result of an independent audit covering <I>all</I> costs.
<p>
<b>2. There are no regional cost differences of consequence once total costs of public housing are included. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If public housing overall is twice as expensive as vouchers, the assertion that there are widespread regional differences in costs is also invalid. When the excluded capital costs presented by the GAO are added, each of the examples which purport to demonstrate the lower cost of public housing actually demonstrates just the opposite; not one of these examples survives the re-estimation.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>3. An independent study commission should be established to settle the cost issue once and for all. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To date, all cost comparison studies have been conducted by institutions, or contractors to institutions, with a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. As a result, and regardless of the quality of the studies, the analysis is perceived to reflect inherent biases, or at least to be tainted with the view of its benefactor. As a congressional agency, for example, the GAO cannot be seen as wholly neutral. The reason: It carries out research according to specific requests from Members of Congress and sometimes is constrained by the requesting lawmaker in the approach it can use to explore issues and evaluate costs. Nor can studies conducted by HUD be seen as free of bias in regard to prevailing HUD policy preferences.
</blockquote><P>
<b>THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the cost differences cited above should leave no doubt that all future and incremental housing assistance should be delivered through vouchers for reasons of both cost and quality, there remains the question of how to make the best use of the existing public housing stock, estimated by GAO at 1.4 million units. Although the taxpayers have invested an estimated $90 billion, this sunk cost does not justify any further investment in the system, since spending any additional dollars on public housing reduces by more than half the number of families that can be assisted, when compared with those that could be assisted through vouchers
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, investing no more money in public housing does not mean that the existing stock of public housing units has no role to play in an orderly transition from New Deal paternalism to more cost-effective tenant empowerment. In its present state, but under proper management,<sup>13</sup> much of the inherited public housing stock can provide adequate and cost-effective shelter for those in need, and the assisted tenants should be allowed to live there if that is their choice. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Providing tenants with the choice, and providing <I>them</I> with the funding rather than the landlord, puts tenants in a position to get the maximum benefit from government assistance. Providers of housing, including the public housing authorities, must compete with others in offering quality services to secure their operating revenue, which previously came directly from HUD with no effective requirement that minimal quality standards be met or cost efficiencies established.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If all public housing operators were funded only by the revenues available from federally assisted rent-paying tenants, financial survival would compel these operators to provide better services. Just as important, tenant-based assistance would force public housing authorities to decide which units to continue in operation and which to close down. Units in extreme disrepair would be rejected by voucher-bearing tenants with the right to choose. Ultimately, they would be shut down, as the federal courts forced HUD to do in Baltimore, and the money that otherwise would be wasted on uneconomic modernization could be used to assist a larger number of beneficiaries directly.
<p>
<b>THE HUMAN COST OF WASTING MONEY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for Members of Congress to keep in mind that federal housing assistance is not an entitlement, and that the level of housing assistance serves only a fraction of the eligible population. As the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out:
<P><blockquote>
	In 1989, the most recent year for which the detailed data used in this study were available, about 4.1 million households received assistance from the federal government in meeting their housing needs. Under the program rules in effect in 1994, almost 14.5 million additional households would have been eligible for aid; that is, their incomes were sufficiently low to qualify them. Not all of the households that were eligible, however, applied for aid, whereas many of those that did apply were placed on waiting lists because sufficient aid was not available.<sup>14</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In other words, for every one household served by HUD, more than three eligible ones were not. Thus, within the confines of current budget limits, the money saved through program efficiencies could be reallocated to assist the most needy of the 14.5 million poor yet unserved families now on waiting lists. The per-unit expenditures of $186,500 and $340,000 for new buildings in Washington and Baltimore, noted earlier, represent an egregious waste of money and perpetuate the long waiting lists which characterize HUD programs. 
<blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> If the $115 million that HUD intends to spend to construct just 338 new units in Baltimore was applied to vouchers, HUD could have provided a year's worth of safe and decent privately owned apartments to 21,000 of the 25,000 poor Baltimore families on the housing assistance waiting list.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given such trade-offs, Congress's continuation of new public housing funding defies reason -- and merely rewards the construction and public housing industry lobbies.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> Consider the $2.5 billion that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies proposes to modernize portions of the existing public housing stock. Had this been allocated directly to certificates or vouchers, this $2.5 billion could have provided needed help to more than 475,000 poor households currently on waiting lists for government housing assistance. 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While some in Congress may defend this multibillion-dollar modernization expenditure as necessary to provide additional housing units for the poor, the government's own statistics demonstrate that it is a waste of money. According to the government's American Housing Survey (see <a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">box</a>), there are approximately 2.6 million vacant rental units in the United States, and about 39 percent of them, or just over one million, rent for $400 or less per month -- well within the $440 range of the average HUD voucher. About 49 percent, or 1.3 million units, rent for $500 or less, also within HUD's range given that most assisted tenants are expected to supplement the voucher with their own financial resources.<sup>15</sup>  In central cities, the vacancy rate is much higher because of continuing depopulation. 
<P>
<b>MORE AUTONOMY AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PHAS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although public housing authorities are financially dependent upon the federal government for virtually all aspects of their operations, Congress has not had much success in using the leverage this dependency should provide to induce improved performance. Despite numerous financial concessions, its not-for-profit status, exemptions from all taxes, and exhortations to better management, public housing still costs more than vouchers on a per unit basis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The difficulties that both HUD and Congress have had with public housing are underscored by the 15 percent of the units under the control of authorities formally described year after year as "distressed."  Although the Cisneros voucher plan would have transferred the hapless tenants in these units to private sector housing and put the poorly managed PHAs out of business, Congress chose instead to rely on modified versions of Washington-managed solutions. Yet, what little management and oversight of public housing there is comes from HUD. And it was Secretary Cisneros's understanding that trying to manage from Washington is not the answer that contributed to his voucher plan to replace failed central planning and management with the discipline of the competitive marketplace. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Aspects of both congressional committee bills could make this situation worse by diminishing executive branch oversight of the housing industry and key decisions in the choice of assistance. For example:
<ul><p>
<li>HUD's oversight of the PHAs would be diminished by the House committee bill's creation of an independent Housing Foundation and Accreditation Board, comprised largely of the recipients and beneficiaries of federal spending on housing. This board would establish benchmarks for local housing and management authorities, establish procedures for accrediting authorities, and classify authorities. It is through board accreditation that a PHA would become eligible to receive the proposed block grants under this bill. This proposal creates a legislative precedent by turning over executive branch spending authority to an independent board comprised of individuals whose chief qualification for eligibility is the possession of a conflict of interest.
<p>
<li>Both bills move the responsibility for determining the future course of federal housing policy from Congress and the executive branch to the PHAs by granting to PHAs the responsibility for conducting cost comparison studies on vouchers and project-based assistance. The bills then give PHAs the discretion to act on the outcome of their own studies. With so much turning on a single cost comparison, it is hard to understand how Congress can place responsibility for cost comparison studies on the bodies that stand to benefit or lose financially from the outcome of such studies. As recommended earlier, these comparisons should be conducted by a blue ribbon commission of independent experts. 
  </ul><p>
<b>DISTORTING THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the taxpayer bears an indirect burden for having his money wasted on poorly conceived programs, the brunt of the failure is born by society's most vulnerable households, including millions of children who are condemned to live in these public housing units or, worse, are denied any housing assistance at all because billions of dollars are wasted on costly and inefficient housing programs. As noted above, the Senate's proposed $2.5 billion modernization program will be at the expense of nearly 500,000 eligible households who will receive no assistance this year because of budget shortfalls in other program accounts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Added to this is a Republican-endorsed change in public housing regulations that will shift the government's limited housing resources away from the poorest segments of the population by allowing local public housing authorities to "serve residents with a greater range of income."<sup>16</sup>  As the Senate Committee report puts it: "The Committee's bill promotes mixed-income conditions by repealing federal regulations that prescribe strict occupancy preferences and deregulating well-run public housing authorities."<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If these proposed changes are enacted into law, the government's long-standing commitment to use its limited housing assistance funds to help those in greatest need first will be rejected in favor of policies that enforce notions of economic diversity. With 14 million eligible but unserved households, of which about 8.4 million are categorized by the CBO as "very low income renter households,"<sup>18</sup> this policy change, at least on the surface, would appear to be ethically odd. But upon closer inspection, it can be justified by the sort of "burn the village to save it" logic often compelling in the narrow factual confines in which government discourse is engaged.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although they have not yet been enacted into law, HUD has wasted no time in putting these ideas into practice. In announcing, in early April 1996, a grant of $25 million to build 134 new units (equaling $186,500 per unit) near the U.S. Capitol, HUD also noted that households with incomes as high as $78,430 would be eligible to move into this project.<sup>19</sup>  HUD made no mention of its plans for the 15,983 poor people in the District of Columbia who are on government waiting lists for housing assistance.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As noted earlier, one of the more serious drawbacks of public housing, and indeed of any government bricks and mortar housing program, is that it serves to segregate households by race and income. By warehousing such large concentrations of the poor, often in deteriorated inner-city neighborhoods where much of the nation's urban public housing is located, Congress has created volatile social environments characterized by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect, and other social pathologies that tend not to occur as frequently with the less costly voucher program that allows assisted households to self-integrate into the community at large. But rather than blame a fundamentally flawed program, Congress blames the victims, and proposes to solve the problem by serving fewer of the poor.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House committee bill would allow public housing authorities, once compelled to take the poorest and most vulnerable on a priority basis, to rent to higher income families, and would require that no more than 25 percent of a project's units be dedicated to the very poor, characterized as those with incomes below 30 percent of the area's median family income. Expressed another way that better quantifies the human cost of the proposed change, Congress will allow public housing authorities to set aside no more than 350,000 units to serve a population that the CBO estimates at 11.9 million eligible households, of which about 8.4 million receive no housing assistance at all, in part because of programmatic financial limits. With public housing authorities allowed to discriminate against the poor, the worsening situation will likely deteriorate even further.<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However bad some of the housing legislation before Congress may be, there remains the growing possibility that federal courts increasingly will render efforts now underway by Congress and HUD as irrelevant and in violation of the law. As court-directed settlements in Baltimore and several other communities demonstrate, tenants and their legal counsel are becoming increasingly less tolerant of the pervasive <I>de facto</I> segregation that characterizes most of HUD's urban public housing projects, and many of the suburban ones as well. Increased use of vouchers is the only acceptable alternative to the plaintiffs, and to the courts which render the final decision. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the Baltimore case also demonstrates, decisions by the courts also can be remarkably coercive, and could ultimately be as disruptive and as counterproductive as were the school busing decisions of a past generation. But this need not happen if Congress enacts a new initiative that breaks with past housing policy and the federally financed <I>de facto</I> racial segregation that is an integral part of it. Legislative proposals such as those of Representatives Myrick and Brownback, or HUD's plan of last year, each of which is founded on tenant choice, would be consistent with American principles of civil liberties. In contrast, the legislation produced by the housing committees of both the House and Senate simply entrenches today's disastrous programs and further frustrates reform.

Accordingly, there are no mortgages on public housing or associated debt payments."

The per unit cost estimates were derived from information provided in these two articles.  Repeated efforts to confirm with HUD were met with non-response.<P>
<li>    Thirty years was chosen because it is both a conservative estimate and, at present, the government's official estimate of the useful life of structures, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of determining allowable depreciation charges.  Given the exceptional wear and tear that the typical public housing unit is subject to, a shorter period of, say, 15 or 20 years would be more reasonable and also would lead to a higher monthly cost estimate.  As for the interest rate, this also allows the analysis to err on the conservative side inasmuch as the average 30-year government bond rate was 9.2 percent for as long as there has been a 30-year bond (since 1977).  Obviously, this too would yield a higher monthly cost.  Alternatively, using the 10-year government bond rate, whose series goes back to 1953, a time span that more closely parallels the construction of today's public housing stock, the average 10-year interest rate is 6.8 percent, and this would yield a monthly debt service cost of  $423.79, making public housing still the most expensive form of housing assistance.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When President Clinton vetoed welfare reform last year, he also vetoed significant adoption reforms included in the package. Congress will soon take up the adoption issue again in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996 (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03286:">H.R. 3286</a>), sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari (R-NY).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The key component of this bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. This tax relief is phased out gradually for families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $110,000. Beyond ending inequities in interracial and Indian adoptions, the bill also permits employees to deduct from their taxes up to $5,000 in employer assistance for additional adoption expenses. These reforms are financed by changes in foreign trust law and in energy subsidies, both mechanisms also approved by the House and Senate last year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $5,000 tax credit, which may be spread out over five years, defrays a significant portion of the costs of adopting a child and is a bargain to taxpayers who now pay an average of $13,000 per year to foster a child.<sup>2</sup>  But the bill still does not allow the credit to apply to payroll taxes, and thus prevents families who adopt but pay less than $1,000 in federal taxes each year<sup>3</sup> from benefiting from the adoption tax credit. These are precisely the families who need help the most.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Ending Discrimination.</b> H.R. 3286 removes obstacles to interracial adoption by penalizing, with a decrease in funding, any state that refuses to allow any person to adopt a child regardless of race or color. It also ends an unjust application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Today, parents who are totally or partially Indian and have not maintained close contact with their tribe may have the adoption of their child by non-Indian parents blocked. This can be achieved by admitting the child or one of the parents to full membership in the tribe, even after the adoption has taken place. In the future, under H.R. 3286, unless one of the parents maintains a significant affiliation with the tribe, adoption by non-Indian parents may not be blocked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Other reforms are needed in the adoption and foster care system if the rate of adoptions is to increase. Removing the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy is the most significant of these remaining reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted (see <a href="bg1080c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Yet public interest has increased: close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the federal government should do:
<P><ul>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.
<p>
<li>Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.
<P>
<li>Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.
<p>
<li>Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
<p>
<li>Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.
<p>
<li>Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.
<p>
<li>Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<li>Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the states should do:
<ul><p>
<li>Privatize adoption services.
<p>
<li>Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<li>Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li>Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<li>Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<p>
<li>Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Christine Bachrach, now Director of the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), adoption has declined since the early 1970s primarily because of a drop in the proportion of white mothers who place their babies for adoption. Birth mothers who have continued to place their babies for adoption are more likely to have well educated mothers, are still at school,  have never worked, and are older. Also, they are more likely to place daughters for adoption than sons. Levels of adoption have remained low for blacks and are virtually non-existent for Hispanic women.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Women likely to adopt tend to be married, sterile,<sup>6</sup> and 30 years of age or older. Nearly half of all women with these characteristics have adopted.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).<sup>8</sup>  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.<sup>9</sup>  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers<sup>10</sup> and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,<sup>11</sup> that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.<sup>13</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.<sup>14</sup>  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.
<p>
<li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.<sup>18</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 1991.<sup>19</sup>  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"<sup>20</sup> homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.<sup>21</sup>  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.<sup>22</sup>  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.<sup>24</sup>  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) in 1994 to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.<sup>25</sup>  The bill was not enacted.
<p>
<b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b>
<p>
<b>Benefits for Children</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.<sup>26</sup>  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<p><ul>
<li>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
<li>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.<sup>35</sup>  Results from the survey were compared across four groups: adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:
<p><ul>
<li>Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li>Have superior access to health care compared to all the other groups;<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<li>Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and
<p>
<li>Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.<sup>38</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:
<ul><p>
<li>Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<p>
<li>See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<p>
<li>Have better health status than all other groups;
<p>
<li>Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
<li>Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
</ul><P>
<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<ul><p>
<li>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.<sup>40</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Christine Bachrach of NICHD concluded from the National Survey of Family Growth that over 2,000,000 women have sought to adopt at one time or another, and about 200,000 were actively seeking to adopt in 1988.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,<sup>44</sup> many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.<sup>45</sup>  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #1: Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.<sup>49</sup>  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:
<ul><p>
<li>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.
<p>
<li>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<li>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.<sup>50</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act<sup>51</sup> was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
<b>BARRIER #2: Misuse of the Foster Care System</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<p>
1. Family preservation;
<p>
2. Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and
<p>
3. Long-term foster care or adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.<sup>53</sup>  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal: preventing the removal of children.<sup>55</sup>  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.<sup>56</sup>  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.<sup>57</sup>  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion: children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<p><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.<sup>58</sup>  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.<sup>59</sup>  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #3: Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.<sup>60</sup>  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><ul>
<li>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.
<p>
<li>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.
<p>
<li>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.
<p>
<li>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4: Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding<sup>61</sup> in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.<sup>62</sup>  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.<sup>63</sup>
Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.<sup>64</sup>  If successful, the growing push for open adoption<sup>65</sup> could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.<sup>67</sup>  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.<sup>68</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #5: Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,<sup>69</sup> has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently<sup>70</sup> that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in <I>Lehr v. Robertson</I>,<sup>71</sup> is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #6: Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption: against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<b>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Interracial adoptions account for about 8 percent of adoptions and consist primarily of adoptions of black children by white parents.<sup>72</sup>  There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.<sup>73</sup>  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.<sup>74</sup>  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.<sup>75</sup>  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.<sup>76</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.
<p>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is some evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.<sup>77</sup>  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study78 put these comparable rates at:
<p><ul>
<li>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:
<p><ul>
<li>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;
<p>
<li>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and
<p>
<li>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.<sup>79</sup>  There is, however, conflicting evidence that white women were more likely to make adoption plans than black women.<sup>80</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.<sup>81</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.<sup>82</sup>  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.<sup>83</sup>  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.<sup>84</sup>  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Institute for Justice last year filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.<sup>86</sup>  Similar racial discrimination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."<sup>87</sup>  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.<sup>89</sup>  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Bunning Amendment, incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,<sup>90</sup> despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive parents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.<sup>92</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster <I>and</I> adopt. They show a double generosity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1)  Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.<sup>93</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<p>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic: the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.<sup>94</sup>  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<p>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<p><ul>
<li>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,
<P>
<li>The rate of adoption,
<p>
<li>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,
<p>
<li>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and
<p>
<li>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<p>
<b>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<p>
<b>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<b>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws. H.R. 3286 addresses this issue well.
<p>
<b>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children: black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.95  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.<sup>96</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To encourage adoption, states should:
<p>
<b>1)   Privatize adoption services.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<p>
<b>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<p>
<b>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<p>
<b>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<p>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children: older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<p>
<b>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<p>
<b>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.<sup>97</sup>  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<p>
<b>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<p>
<b>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<b>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses: lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<p>
<b>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<b>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation: the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption works.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By vetoing the adoption legislation passed last year, President Clinton defeated the most significant reform in the practice of adoption to be seen in decades. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The need is great and the solution is obvious: adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

An Attributional Analysis," <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I>, Vol.  48, No.  4 (1985), pp.  1054-1066.  An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies.  Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings.  The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates.  Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population.  This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment.  Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis.  The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<p>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care.  If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported recently that Congress has identified more than 750 education programs in various departments and agencies of the federal government.<sup>2</sup>  One program -- the largest and most ambitious in the federal arsenal -- is Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged (formerly Chapter One), which provides funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty in order to provide additional educational assistance to low-achieving students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title I was an invention of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Enacted in 1965 with great fanfare, it was designed to reach poor children across the board from all geographic regions, of all races and ethnic groups, in all school settings: public, private non-sectarian, and private religious schools. The terms of its enactment were so unusual that they bear re-examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until Johnson's elevation to the Presidency in 1963, no President had even attempted a major federal education program for elementary schools. Americans were skeptical of, even hostile to, the idea of federal encroachment on education. Local control was a tradition as old and as venerable as the Republic, and citizens of both parties and all regions guarded their prerogative jealously. While President Dwight Eisenhower had adopted a number of education programs in response to Sputnik, reflecting a tradition one and one-half centuries old, the nation as a whole was reluctant to support general programs of federal aid to elementary and secondary schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the robust and long-standing commitment to local control, another factor was at work: If there were federal aid available, would it be for all children, without regard to whether they attended public or non-public school, or would it be restricted to public schools only?  Not to put too fine a point on it, the question was whether poor children in Catholic schools would receive aid on an equal footing with children in public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not an academic point. Indeed, the whole fate of the federal role in education hinged on this issue alone. The decision of the Congress in 1965, at the urging of the President, was that all eligible children should receive federal support regardless of whether they attended public or private school. Interestingly, this issue was raised by, and the decisive votes cast by, big-city Democrats. Indeed, they withheld their votes subject to meeting the condition that all poor children must be eligible, not just public school children. This was an historic and honorable compromise. Federal aid to public schools would not have become a reality without it. In this case, at least, the public schools' best friends were private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Let me provide some sense of scale. Between 1966 and 1995, the federal government spent nearly $100 billion on education aid to the disadvantaged, of which the vast majority was for Title I; about three percent of that money made its way to the support of private school students, the fact that they make up about 12 percent of total enrollment notwithstanding. Even though private school support had led to enactment of Title I, public school officials across the nation were slow to include private schools in Title I programs; yet Title I represented the greatest single windfall for public schools in their history. It is important to re-emphasize this little-noted fact: The windfall was thanks to, and at the expense of, private schools. But public school officials had short memories and a weakly developed sense of obligation to their counterparts in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though the public schools had been slow to respond, respond they finally did; and the relationship that emerged, if not cordial, was correct. In spite of significant bureaucratic hurdles, Title I funds for private school children flowed -- not in amounts as large as might have been expected, but the program, limited though it was, worked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Twenty-five years later, the portion of Title I that supported private school children was virtually destroyed, first by action of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Aguilar v. Felton</I> (1985), then by congressional inaction. Public school officials never raised their voices to support private education. The Court struck down 25 years of a relatively successful program through which private school students received limited services. The Court ruled that the existing educational practices by which Title I funds were delivered to non-public schools created "excessive entanglement between church and state," thus violating the constitutional ban against public support for religion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, the number of private school children served by Title I has fallen significantly, and the cost of services to them has risen dramatically. The reason?  The extraordinary lengths to which the <I>Aguilar</I> decision has driven even well-intentioned school districts. New York City, for example, with the largest Title I program in the country, has been using Title I buses (something like bookmobiles of old) to bring Title I services to eligible private school students. No longer permitted (by <I>Aguilar</I>) to send public school teachers into Catholic and other religious schools, the buses pull up at the curb (which is public space), and the children leave their school as they set foot in this mobile classroom.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to buses, Title I "infrastructure" for non-public school students includes computers that are programmed to work only with Title I programs in them. Imagine: a computer with a "v" chip that prohibits children in religious schools from studying anything except secular subjects!
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If it were not true, it would be funny. New York City reports that $16 million of its Title I funds will go for infrastructure, not instruction. It is a Kafkaesque solution to a problem created by a Supreme Court clearly unable to make sense out of its own history of tortured interpretations of the constitutional requirement that church and state be separated. In striking down the practices that led to the <I>Aguilar</I> decision, the Court put the ball back in Congress's hands -- not implicitly, as all decisions do, but explicitly and deliberately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Supreme Court invited Congress to fashion a constitutionally defensible method of funding children who attend non-public schools. In particular, Mr. Justice Powell, writing in his concurring opinion in <I>Aguilar</I>, makes the point that if Congress could develop a strategy for helping children in denominational schools --without using public schools -- the Court would be likely to accept it. Congress could create, for example, a Title I voucher system, an approach that would survive judicial scrutiny.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That the Congress did not respond to this invitation is public knowledge. The reason for it is not. The public schools -- which had been the principal beneficiaries of Title I over the years -- refused to come to the aid of their private school compatriots, whose initial support had permitted the program to come into existence in the beginning.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is time for the worm to turn.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is now widely recognized that there are two major problems with Title I. The first, and in some respects the most formidable, is that the program does not produce what researchers call "sustaining effects."  Put most bluntly, Title I does not appear to make a difference in the lives of children. While the program appears to do no harm -- the first test for any helping service, as all physicians know -- it is not clear that it does much good. Or, if it does do much good, it is not clear for whom and in what circumstances. The fact that Title I does not do what it was intended to do -- significantly improve the academic performance of low-income and low-achieving students -- means that the current program configuration can no longer be seriously defended.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, there is a growing body of evidence about what does make a difference in the education of poor children: Researchers and practitioners alike know that a school with a shared culture and a shared commitment to academic excellence makes a difference. They know that expectations make a difference. They know that high standards make a difference. They know that a safe and orderly learning environment makes a difference. Most important, it is clear that religiously affiliated schools share all these characteristics. The work of the late Professor James Coleman of the University of Chicago, perhaps the nation's most important research sociologist, makes the point unequivocally: Poor youngsters -- particularly poor black youngsters -- do better in parochial school than in public school.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Critics assert that Coleman's work is flawed. No doubt it is in some small ways, but the overall findings have not been challenged. Indeed, in any other field -- housing, health, transportation, the environment -- findings as robust as Professor Coleman's would form the basis of new policy, as they should for Title I. Originally launched as a demonstration, fueled as much by hope as by fact, Title I should continue to be the source of flexibility and innovation, not a program cast in the bureaucratic concrete of the Great Society. Indeed, both the spirit of Title I and research of the kind produced by James Coleman present Congress with the opportunity -- in fact, the obligation -- to make significant program changes. I will return to those later.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The second problem is that schools across the country -- but most notably in New York -- are at their wits end with <I>Aguilar</I> compliance. It is so clumsy and bureaucratic -- and so obviously so -- that not even these giant bureaucracies can tolerate it any longer. As a consequence, they are seeking relief. New York is going to Court to get <I>Aguilar</I> overturned. According to <I>Education Week</I>, Secretary Riley supports New York City.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this connection they have some reason to be optimistic. The United States Supreme Court has changed since <I>Aguilar</I> and now appears ready to change its decision. Five justices have expressed an interest in doing so. (As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, reminds us in his wonderful article "What Do You Do When the Supreme Court Is Wrong?"  you wait, as the Court's "most enduring practice is to reverse itself.")
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an energetic and robust democratic republic, however, the possibility, even the probability, of the Supreme Court reversing itself should offer only scant comfort. In particular, Congress has within its power the opportunity and the capacity to do the right thing on its own, in which case the Court can simply ratify the action at some later date. More to the point, the Court is a blunt instrument, and Congress can legislate with surgical precision.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be precise, the Supreme Court will not institute aid to individuals, but Congress can. The best that could be expected from the Court, with no new statute to interpret, in reversing <I>Aguilar</I> is a return to the <I>status quo ante bellum</i>. That is not good enough. It is time to return to first principles. Indeed, the only intellectually defensible federal role in education is one in which Uncle Sam supports all Americans equally. The U.S. Congress has no more interest in a narrow program of support for public schools <I>qua</I> public schools than it would have in a program detrimental to public schools. The congressional test should be neutrality and equal treatment of equals, just as the original Title I legislation was based on the conviction that all poor children -- no matter whether they attend government or private school -- should be beneficiaries of federal largesse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is the principle of the famous GI Bill for higher education; it should be no less a principle in lower education. Indeed, in a little-known footnote to the GI Bill, servicemen and women were eligible to use their GI Bill benefits to complete high school, and some significant number did just that.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform, then, should be reconnecting the Title I program to its true beneficiaries -- students, not schools. As it is, Title I now commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Now, $1,000 a child may not sound like much in the public sector, particularly in cities like Washington, D.C., where per pupil expenditures are about $10,000 a year in public school, but the facts of the private school world are quite different.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
True, the First Child's private school, Sidwell Friends Academy, costs well over $10,000 a year, but that is the exception, not the rule, in the world of private schools. Nationally, there are about 28,000 private schools, and they are, on average, low-cost institutions. For example, in 1990, average tuition in Catholic secondary schools was $2,878 per year, and average tuition in Catholic elementary schools was $1,243; average tuition in non-Catholic private secondary schools was $4,395, and in private elementary schools, it was $1,780. In the private school world, $1,000 is a lot of money. (By way of contrast, average per pupil expenditures in public schools in 1990 were $6,472 in secondary schools and $5,177 in elementary schools.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of communities across the country are trying vouchers or voucher-like mechanisms to see if they will make a difference in the lives of children. The two most notable examples are Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Ohio; in those communities -- in any community anywhere in the nation -- flexible Title I funding (letting dollars follow children) could make an enormous difference. In this connection, beware the critics; unhappily, in schools as in other parts of public life, self-interest is paramount. At a minimum, even the most ardent member of a special-interest group should be pressed hard as to why Congress should not at least permit states and localities to use their Title I funds as vouchers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress should keep two crucial points in mind.
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, no program could be more appropriate to the pedagogical needs of today; public schools in our big cities have become bureaucratic nightmares, often frightening places to teach in or attend. Teachers are as much losers in this equation as students. Title I vouchers would free the teacher as they free the student. At issue is not competition for Title I vouchers (though there would be some, and it would be welcome). One thousand dollars a child will not unleash massive competitive pressures. What it will do is permit families to choose schools that are consistent with their values. And it will permit teachers, who ultimately manage these resources, to do so with more professional autonomy and flexibility.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, it is by now universally recognized that the nation faces a moral as well as a public school crisis. Not surprisingly, the two issues are intertwined inextricably. They cannot be separated. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, thoughtful men and women have known that the single most important purpose of schooling is character formation, to turn boys and girls into men and women who know right from wrong, good from bad. Successful schools impart the values of democratic capitalism -- honesty, self-respect, respect for others, tolerance, enterprise, diligence, moderation, forbearance, courage. It is precisely to these issues that religious schools are most committed.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most recent report of the Public Agenda Foundation indicates that Americans across the board prefer private to public schools; families with the resources have long acted on this. Witness the First Child. Witness the behavior of Members of Congress, of whom about one-third use private schools. Witness the behavior of public school teachers. Of those with the means (twice the median family income), as many as half -- in big cities -- enroll their children in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of <I>Aguilar</I> has been to actively discourage poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. The price of <I>Aguilar</I> is to lose benefits or to make it so awkward to claim them that it is hardly worth the candle. It is a bizarre commentary on modern times that a nation founded on a fundamental commitment to religious freedom would produce policies actively hostile to religion. More bizarre yet is that the burden should fall most heavily on the poor.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Congress has before it an historic opportunity to convert Title I into a voucher program. Let poor families -- not bureaucrats -- decide where their children will go to school: government or non-government, secular or non-secular, as the case may be.

<h3>LIBERATING PEOPLE FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT	</h3>
<b>By Stephen Goldsmith</b>
<P> Stephen Goldsmith is the mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Resource Bank Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on April 25, 1996.

<p>
Let me begin by stating the obvious: We do not have enough wealth in this country, or in the state of Indiana or the city of Indianapolis, to redistribute it fast enough to buy our way out of poverty. This is true for a couple of reasons: because there is not enough wealth and because it is a self-contradictory process. 
<p>

Indianapolis is the 12th largest city in the country, and we have the same problems as the other top 25. If we do what the mayors of the other large cities have done, particularly east of the Mississippi, we get elected and raise property taxes so we can do more good deeds for the people who are in our communities. But when we raise property taxes, people figure out that since wealth is mobile, they can pick up their business, pick up their home, and move to the other side of the city line. When anyone moves to the other side of the city line, by definition the city is a little less wealthy, just because one wealthy guy got up and left. So we have to raise taxes a little bit more to make up for the guy who left, and then raise taxes a little bit more, and so on.
<p>

As reflected in an interesting study done a couple of years ago by the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, there is a supply side curve in property taxation, in addition to enormous out-migrations of wealth and populations from urban centers, in part because of the policy decisions made by mayors, and, to some extent, governors. In a global economy this problem is even more pronounced because firms do not have to stay in Washington, D.C., or Chicago, and you don't have to manufacture on this side of the ocean. You have a number of other choices about where to invest, and this mobility means we have to think about our issues somewhat differently.
<p>

My office is on the twenty-fifth floor of the City-County Building in Indianapolis. On a clear day, I can look out my window and see the dollar bills float across the city line and land on the other side where the schools are better, the crime is less, the property taxes are lower, and the dollars find a more hospitable place to land. This is a concept that you can repeat in any large city in the country. That is one dynamic. Another important dynamic is that top-down, autocratic, control-driven systems do not work. 
<p>


<b>Creating Systems That Don't Work</b><p>


Ever since the 1930s, government has been very interested in control mechanisms: how to control purchasing, how to control hiring, how to control everything. But no matter how much good we want to do through government, we are creating systems that cannot do so. These big rule-driven systems insure that we do not have enough discretion in the way we deliver public services to tailor those services to the needs of a highly diverse population. If we take a situation in which wealth is mobile and add to it this dynamic that big systems do not work very well, we begin to get a sense of the problem.
<p>

Let me give you a story about big systems and competition to illustrate this. In Indianapolis, we have a severe labor shortage and tens of thousands of people on welfare simultaneously. This is perverse, to say the least. So I invited America Works to come to Indianapolis. America Works is a for-profit organization, and we pay them a performance fee when they take someone off of welfare and that person has a job for six months or more. Inviting them to Indianapolis was controversial because even there, there is a feeling among social service providers that you cannot both make a profit and do a good deed -- a particularly socialist view of life.
<p>

About 45 days after America Works came to Indianapolis I asked them how they were doing, because I had a lot of political capital involved in this experiment. They said, "Not very well."  I said, "Why not?  Can't you train anybody to secure a job?"  And they said, "That's not the problem. We have lots and lots of employers who want the employees. We can't get the welfare department to refer anybody to us."
<p>

So I decided to visit the welfare department. Each week I do a different city job. I've done this for a long time; it's a good way to learn what goes on. Welfare is run out of the state. So I called the state and said, "I want to go to the welfare department."  The state director of welfare said, "You're not welcome."  I responded, "The police department still works for me and I'm going." 
<p>

So I went to the welfare department, stood behind the desk, and watched state employees administer the system. They were not slovenly; they were not lazy. They were doing their job, which was to verify eligibility and hand out a check. They had a little check sheet that said, "Have you looked for a job?"
<p>

But there was nothing in their job description that connected their performance rating to whether welfare recipients found jobs. There was a total disconnect between the bureaucracy and the values that we claim we are trying to implement. Furthermore, everybody had to be treated the same in this rule-based system. If the applicant's problem was that her husband beat her up, or that her son was a drug addict, or that she could not get a voucher to get to the bus system, or whatever the case might be, the system did not allow enough discretion to solve the problem because it is a "one size fits all" system.
<p>

<b>Competition Creates Value</b><p>
Another key point is that competition creates value. I had a chance-of-a-lifetime opportunity to have breakfast with Milton Friedman about six weeks ago. We talked about schools. I kept saying "public schools," and he kept saying, "They're not public schools. They're government schools, and there's a difference."  I said, "What difference does it make?"  He said, "Here is the difference. You can't have innovation if you don't have markets. And you can't have markets if you don't have customers. And you can't have customers in the ordinary sense in a monopoly. That's a big difference."
<p>

The same is true in every service I deliver in city government. Absent competition, absent customer choice, we cannot create maximum value. Every time we touch a public service and open it up to the marketplace for bidding, we drive up the quality and drive down the price. We can take city employee work groups that have done total quality management for 20 years, ever since it was invented, and say to them, "You're going out of business if you don't bid to keep your jobs," and they will drive down their overhead costs in 60 days.
<p>

Competition always creates efficiencies. We have a wastewater treatment plant in Indianapolis. My City-County Council, who disagree with me on virtually all of these issues, asked me to evaluate the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant. I agreed. We hired Ernst & Young. They came in and said, "Congratulations, yours is the most efficient wastewater treatment plant in the country. You can save five percent if you really tighten down."  I said, "Let's try this differently. Let's bid it out and see what happens."
<p>

We had five bids from all over the world, most of which were European, because in the United States this is really a government business and there are few private providers. The winning bid reduced our costs by 44 percent or $65 million -- and we already were the most efficient wastewater treatment plant. When government benchmarks itself against other government monopolies, it is meaningless. We need to open up our services to the marketplace.
<p>


<b>Bureaucracy: The Enemy of Devolution</b><p>
I mention these things just to set the stage for my theme, which is that I am an enthusiast for devolution and I think it has no chance of working. I find nothing inconsistent in my position. A state bureaucrat is still a bureaucrat. No matter how well-intentioned bureaucrats may be, and while they may be a little closer to the public, they are still making decisions in place of customers or parents or other individuals who are in need of public goods. I don't think we can create the organizational culture, going back to the welfare department example, that will allow devolution to work.
<p>

Nevertheless, devolution sets in place a chain of events which I hope will allow bold governors and mayors to downsize government. I was a prosecutor for 12 years, have been mayor for five, and yet realize that government is the problem, not the solution.
<p>

Let me talk about where the devolution revolution might take us. Although obviously there is a role for government-produced public goods, generally the marketplace, whenever it can be used, is a much better way to deliver those goods. There has been terrible confusion -- obviously not in this room, because you are the ones responsible for good ideas, but among public officials -- about what is a public good and whether government needs to produce it. We need to address that question.
<p>

For example, I went to HUD two-and-a-half years ago and asked, "Would you do me a favor?  I'd like to give a voucher to every one of the recipients of public housing. Let them pick where they want to live, and if they don't want to live in my public housing units, then I'll tear them down. Let me go out of business."
<p>

As we think about the devolution revolution, the first principle should be to use the marketplace wherever we can. That means either using tax policy instead of grant policy -- tax policy is much more efficient because it appeals to the customers -- or using vouchers. I don't believe that is a very robust part of the current conversation about devolution. Devolution today is taking a federal program, delivering it to the state house and having a state bureaucrat run it as contrasted to asking, "What can we do to help citizens make decisions on their own?"
<p>


<b>Importance of Religion and Mediating Institutions</b><p>
A second point: as we consider these issues, we must underscore the importance of values and religion. If you have not read the Heritage publication on why religion matters, it shows the correlation and/or causation between belief in religion and stable families, belief in religion and rising out of poverty, belief in religion and crime-free environments. It is extremely important.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

Government has a responsibility, if it can do nothing else, to stop supplanting religious institutions and mediating institutions. We should support them. One way is to abolish welfare. Don't abolish helping people, but abolish the government welfare delivery system and deliver necessary services through neighborhood-based and religious-based organizations. If your path to the future is a government check, the check itself is part of the problem.
<p>

Two summers ago, I took the job training money that mayors generally waste and said, "Let's connect kids in tough neighborhoods with a church because a church is virtually always the most important asset in those communities. Let the churches do job training for the summer."  We did it, and it was a great success. At the end of the summer, the state regulator knocked on my door and said, "You've violated the terms of the grant."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "The problem is that you allowed" not required but allowed "the participants in the program to say a prayer before lunch."
<p>

It may seem like a silly example, but the point is that religion matters. Government could at least get out of the way. We continue to try to work through "charter welfare" programs, and we have turned over 20 of our parks to neighborhood churches to maintain. We do everything we can to help inner-city kids connect with religion.
<p>

So we need to understand the role of mediating neighborhood institutions, and particularly religious institutions, in devolution, and they need to be much more visible and much more activist in the public policy arena.

<p>

<b>How to Make a Difference</b><P>
When I got elected, I identified seven neighborhoods, 8,000-20,000 people each, with the greatest problems -- poverty, single-family head of households, and all the rest -- and said, "We're going to try and make a difference. How?  By doing the things I'm supposed to do well and stop doing everything else."
<p>

My fundamental responsibilities as mayor are really to make sure the streets are smooth, the sewers work, and you don't get beat up on your way to work, church, or school. Yet in most urban communities government is not fulfilling its real responsibilities and instead is redistributing wealth and saying that the problem is that we don't have enough social programs.
<p>

In Indianapolis, we have saved $240 million through competing out city services. We have reduced our non-public-safety work force 40 percent, competed out 65 city activities, and created an infrastructure fund of $500 million, without increasing taxes. We have invested our savings in public safety, in streets and sewers and sidewalks, and in cleaning up neighborhood parks. We have tried to help neighborhood leaders take back their parks and their streets. We have tried to make a difference with how we provide our core responsibilities. We see neighborhoods come back together. When the police, the community, and the infrastructure are solid, businesses will invest.
<p>

After I began making these changes in city government, I sent a letter out to every small business in these tough neighborhoods and said, "What is the most important factor that would make you decide to expand or invest in your neighborhood?"  I expected them to say, "The cost of raw materials or the price of my competitor's goods."  But the first two problems with whether they would expand were taxes and regulation. It is interesting that the top two items for the business community in determining whether they would invest in their current sites were government and government. So we began to clear out the regulatory burdens and the other issues they addressed, and sure enough they did in fact invest.
<p>

This approach is inherently populist. Our small-government approach to big-city problems is only fair to those citizens in our community who lack opportunity. When we artificially put a cab cartel together because we don't trust the marketplace to deliver cab services, when we artificially restrict mass transit, when we drive up the price of housing through silly regulations, when we hire middle-class folks that are public bureaucrats to run inferior services in inner-city neighborhoods, all of those things are inherently unfair to the people who need the most help.

<p>

<b>The Ultimate Arrogance</b><p>
The ultimate arrogance is when we tell parents in failing school systems that, because they are poor, their children are banished to poor education. For people like me, who believe that the welfare system is bad for the recipients, not just the taxpayers, the path to the future is a job. And education is essential to getting a good job. It is irresponsible to allow these government-run monopolistic schools to deny parents choices.
<p>

In the City of Indianapolis we have 12 school systems. In the main central school system, there are third grade classes where every child in the class has failed the standardized tests. If you are a poor parent of a second grader in that school, your child will go to that third grade class. The only way out is if you have enough money to move or to send your child to a private school, or if you're fortunate enough to have a voucher that is paid for as the result of the civic concern of a private business.
<p>

Let me give you a couple of statistics about the results of these vouchers, taking children with similar demographics. A second grader in the city public schools is 14 percent behind the state average. A second grader from the inner city enrolled in a Catholic school as a result of a voucher is 9 percent behind the state average. By the time he gets to the eighth grade, the Catholic school child has reached the state average. The public school child is 25 points behind the state average. Every year the child stays in public school, he or she is worse off. Eventually, over 50 percent drop out -- and that's in Indianapolis. We are not good, but there probably are worse examples around the country.
<p>

While fighting the charter school battle and the voucher battle, we had a clarifying event in the Indiana General Assembly last year when the teachers union, which is the most powerful political group in the state of Indiana, came forward and all but said that you can't trust parents to make decisions about where their children should attend school.
<p>

<b>The Fundamental Requirement</b><p>
All of these issues have consistent themes. The Congress of the United States favors public ownership through the tax code. They make me pay police officers more for overtime through the Fair Labor Standards Act. They tell me how much I should pay someone who paints a part of my HUD-owned buildings. They tell me who can work and who cannot work, and a whole range of other things.
<p>

As they push authority down, and as we advocate for devolution, we need to remember that it will not work unless it is just the first step toward a market-based system that recognizes that the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisions that are in their own best interests. There is no better way for our country to allocate public resources and create opportunities.

<h3>RATIFYING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION: AMERICAN BUSINESS WILL PAY THE PRICE</h3>

<a href="fyi111t1.gif">Table</a>: CWC's Impact on Business Widespread
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


By September 14, 1996, the Senate will be voting on ratification of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1732:">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC), a treaty that would ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The CWC contains serious shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable. As a result, it will not serve the security interests of the United States. But the potential damage from the CWC is not limited merely to national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden on American businesses and thus harm America's economy. This burden will result from the CWC's requirement that businesses prove to the U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical weapons. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in companies' being fined as much as $50,000 per incident.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What follows is a state-by-state breakdown of the industrial facilities that are likely to be subject to the requirements of the CWC. These data are provided by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and are based on aggregate data maintained by the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Following the data on production facilities is a flow chart provided by the Department of Commerce describing the regulatory process governing the data collection effort.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estimates of the direct cost that implementing the CWC will impose on U.S. businesses range as high as $200 million annually. The potential indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential information, are difficult to estimate. However, billions of dollars in losses are not out of the question.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is true that the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) supports ratification and implementation of the CWC. Because the CMA is a prominent trade representative in Washington for the chemical industry, its support for the treaty would appear to suggest that the potential regulatory burden is not excessive. But the CMA does not speak for all chemical manufacturers. In fact, more than 60 percent of the facilities most likely to be affected by the CWC are owned by companies not represented by the Association. Further, small businesses, which are less likely to be represented by the CMA, are the ones most likely to be hurt by the increased regulatory burden, because they do not have the money to cover the added costs that will be imposed by the new regulations. Finally, something which the CMA does not emphasize is that chemical companies are not the only ones subject to this treaty. So, too, are food processors, brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies, petroleum companies, and rubber companies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the inspection regime. But to ask American businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security makes neither economic nor security sense.

<title> Clinton Takes Undeserved Credit For Congress's Deficit Reduction - Heritage</title>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

President Bill Clinton and other opponents of national missile defenses charge it will cost too much to defend Americans against missile attack.<sup>1</sup>  As evidence Clinton points to a May 15 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a missile defense system required by the Defend America Act of 1996 would cost as much as $60 billion.<sup>2</sup>  Both the President and the CBO are wrong. Defending America from nuclear attack will not cost as much as the CBO thinks. The U.S. could deploy a missile defense system for as little as $8 billion.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO estimate is wrong because it is based on a flawed assumption that a ground-based system is the best option for ballistic missile defense (BMD). It is not. A sea-based option would not only be more effective, it would cost much less. Besides, the CBO report has been mischaracterized by critics of missile defense. All the critics say is that such a defense will cost $60 billion. What these critics ignore is that in the CBO estimate the initial defense system would cost only a fraction of the $60 billion claimed. The larger total applies to the deployment of several defensive systems, not just one, over a fourteen-year period. Critics pretend that the total cost figure would have to be paid in order to defend America from attack. This is not true. Using CBO's approach, an initial missile defense system costing as little $14 billion could provide coverage for the territory of the United States against very limited attacks with unsophisticated missiles.
<p>
<b>The CBO Report</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Congressional Budget Office is charged by Congress to estimate the budgetary impact of legislation. In performing this function, the CBO issued an estimate on May 15 of the cost of enacting the Defend America Act, which would commit the nation to the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. However, the act is essentially a statement of strategic policy goals or priorities. It includes no budgetary authorization and mandates no particular BMD system or "architecture" which can be costed with any precision or certainty. This allowed the CBO to estimate the cost on the basis of its own assumptions. These assumptions led to a general cost estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion to deploy a combination of several national missile defense systems, extending over a fourteen-year period. This wildly varying estimate has been used by critics of missile defense to distort the real cost of missile defenses.
<p>

<b>CBO's flawed assumption.</b> The CBO estimate of the cost of the Defend America Act is based on a flawed assumption: that the ground-based approach pursued by the Clinton Administration is the only option for fielding an initial defense. The CBO began its analysis by examining hypothetical approaches proposed by the Clinton Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). However, the Clinton Administration is opposed to national missile defenses and has no incentive to discuss the most cost-effective approach to deployment, even hypothetically. The Administration's hypothetical approach would deploy a single site of 100 fixed, ground-based interceptors, as allowed by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This system, according to the CBO, would cost $14 billion if an array of sensor satellites were included in the deployment plan. The CBO then added two additional interceptor sites. This ran the cost of the system up, according to the CBO, to $18 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But the ground-based-only approach is not the only option. In fact, it is the worst option, not only costing too much, but not doing the job of effectively providing a wide-area of coverage against attack. The CBO failed to consider the option of modifying existing Navy AEGIS cruisers to serve as BMD platforms. The Heritage Foundation's Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B") estimates the cost of this alternative at $2-3 billion over six years, with an additional $5 billion for the sensor satellites.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, the cost of an initial defense could be between $7 billion and $8 billion, as opposed to CBO's estimate of between $14 billion and $18 billion.<p><b>Distortions of the CBO estimate.</b> The failure to consider other more viable options was not the only problem with the CBO estimate. Another is the wide range in the estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion over 14 years. The 100 percent variance in this estimate is so broad as to make it meaningless. No one can seriously base a judgment on it. Estimating the cost of missile defenses over a 14-year period would have been akin to devising a similar cost estimate in 1958 for the cost of five generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles (the <i>Titan I,</i> the <i>Titan II,</i> the <i>Minuteman I,</i> the <i>Minuteman II,</I> and the <i>Minuteman III</i>) through 1972. If the procurement cost of these systems -- likely more than $200 billion -- had been debated prior to the decision to develop ballistic missiles, perhaps Congress would have been equally shocked by the "sticker price" of deploying a nuclear deterrent for the next 14 years. The country should be very glad indeed that the Congress did not engage in such a spurious debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further, the assertion that deploying a missile defense system will cost $60 billion distorts the CBO's analysis. First, the $60 billion estimate is an upper limit. Even by its own analysis, CBO's cost of a multiple-system deployment could be as low as $31 billion. Second, this range of estimates covers the period from fiscal 1997 through 2010, or 14 years. That amounts to between $2.2 billion and $4.2 billion per year, or less than 2 percent of annual defense budgets. Third, the five-year estimate (fiscal 1997 through 2001) is less than $10 billion. Finally, and most important, the CBO assessment includes additions to the initial deployment that consist of space-based interceptors and space-based lasers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While any long-term deployment plan may cost any amount of money, the fact remains that CBO's initial deployment of ground-based interceptors, along with sensor satellites, would cost as little as $14 billion. Thus, despite the fact that CBO adopts an expensive approach to missile defense, even its own plan is still clearly affordable under defense budgets that will range between $250 billion and $350 billion per year (as measured in current dollars) for the 14-year period in question.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The presumed high cost of a national missile defense system serves merely as an excuse, not a reason, to oppose a decision to deploy national missile defenses. The CBO cost estimate is based on the flawed assumption that the Clinton Administration's approach to deployment is the most cost-effective. It is not. For this reason, Congress can safely ignore CBO's estimate and it certainly should ignore the misrepresentations of CBO's analysis provided by President Clinton. The fact is that a decision to deploy a national missile defense system is compatible with the defense budgets proposed by both the Clinton Administration and Congress.

<a href="fyi109t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Comparing this Congress with Clinton's and Reagan's Selected Spending Cuts
<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<a href="fyi110c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Money Available to Pay for Hospital Benefits<br>
<a href="fyi110c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Who Pays for Part B Costs?<br>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The latest annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees underscores the severe financial plight of the program and the urgent need for structural reform. The six trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries, make clear that no amount of fine-tuning can stave off disaster. The report indicates that the only way to assure Medicare's ability to deliver adequate health care to most of today's senior citizens, let alone the next generation of elderly Americans, is to overhaul the program now so that it can deliver better care for less money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the recent media attention given to the report has focused on the trustees' assessment of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, also known as Part A. The trust fund is like a savings account, where the income is payroll tax revenue and the outlays pay for services. The problem is that for a number of reasons, most significantly the aging of the baby-boom generation, the trust fund is being hit by a financing windshear, already causing outlays to exceed income and exhausting all reserves by 2001. In other words, the fund in 2002 literally would have no money to pay promised benefits. Thereafter, for at least the next 70 years (the limit of the trustees' projections), the cost of continuing services would continue to exceed program income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Absent any reform, Medicare can continue after 2001 only if it drastically cuts services or tries to keep the HI program afloat with tax increases. But the cost of a bailout would be staggering. The report indicates that the cumulative deficit in the trust fund (that is, the extra money needed to maintain services) would be over $400 billion by 2005. In that year alone, outlays would exceed income by over $100 billion, and the red ink would be accelerating annually. So just to continue hospital services until 2005, the bailout cost to the average American household would be about $4,000 in new taxes. As the trustees conclude, with classic understatement, "The HI program remains severely out of balance."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But that is just Part A. Part B of Medicare, which pays for physician and other services, is financed only partly by premiums (which cover about 30 percent of program costs), with the rest financed by general revenues. The level of taxpayer subsidy has nothing to do with the beneficiary's income -- elderly millionaires get the same subsidy as the poor. Under current law, say the trustees, taxpayers will have to cover 84 percent of Part B costs by 2005 and an increasing proportion thereafter. According to the trustees' figures, the cumulative taxpayer subsidy between 1996 and 2005 alone will be $950 billion, or roughly $10,000 in taxes for the average American household. The figures for succeeding decades will be even larger.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taking the two parts of Medicare together, to keep the program afloat just until 2005 without reforms will take about $14,000 per household in taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, this stark picture prompts the trustees to call for "the earliest possible enactment of legislation" only to delay bankruptcy for a few years, not to address the long-term problem. Instead, they call for a national commission to recommend long-term solutions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commission would be a serious mistake. Rather than encourage serious public discussion of the tough choices that must be faced, it would allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years. But by then the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Advocates of a commission point to previous examples of supposedly successful commissions in making the case for a Medicare commission. Most often they cite the 1982 Social Security commission and the recent panel on military base closures. But the experience of commissions intended to produce legislation is that they are successful in only two situations: first, when only a relatively small mid-course correction is needed in the funding of a sensitive program to keep it in operation for many years (the Social Security commission), or second, when there is almost unanimous agreement on what needs to be done and the commission merely provides political protection (base closing).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Medicare fits into neither of these categories. The problem is not small and short-term: It is massive and structural. And there is no consensus on what needs to be done. To deal with Medicare, major and controversial decisions will have to be made concerning the nature of the entitlement, the benefits, and the role of the taxpayer. These already have been discussed at length on Capitol Hill. In fact, legislative decisions were taken last year, only to be vetoed by President Clinton. All a commission can do, in effect, is take a year or so to put the options already known into a single binder and deliver them back to Capitol Hill. But Congress and the President will still have to make the tough choices --a commission would not render them any easier. With the program so close to collapse, it would be much wiser for the elected government to begin making those decisions today, preferably with the President as an active partner.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve long-term stability in Medicare, three broad changes are needed to encourage much greater efficiency by giving much more economic control and more sensible incentives to the elderly. The bill Congress enacted last year would have begun this reform, but was vetoed. Specifically, Congress and the White House should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Turn Medicare into a defined contribution program.</b> Medicare currently promises a set of specific benefits, rather than a certain degree of assistance to seniors to purchase the benefits they want. Moving to a defined contribution system would give the elderly much greater choice and an incentive to seek better value for money.
<p>
<li><b> Open up new plan choices for the elderly.</b> In today's Medicare, benefits are designed and priced in Washington and updated only slowly, if at all, after months or years of intense debate and lobbying in Washington. That is why the elderly are still waiting for the kind of routine drug benefits, or service options, that are available in almost any standard private plan -- or to retired federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Thus, allowing seniors the right to choose from a wide range of plans and benefit packages is needed to modernize coverage. It also is needed to spur competition between plans to provide the best value for money for seniors.
<P>
<li><b> Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who do not need it.</b> Part B is not a social insurance program. It is a heavily subsidized, optional, government-run physician insurance program. Rich elderly Americans receive the same subsidy as seniors who rely entirely on their Social Security checks. It is time for Congress to rein in the unwarranted taxpayer-funded subsidy for those who do not need it to afford health care.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Medicare trustees' report is grim reading. It refutes utterly the nave idea that only a little fine-tuning is needed for the program to exist for the next generation of elderly Americans. The report makes clear that there are only three choices available: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms to enable the program to deliver health care at less cost. Obviously, only the third choice makes any sense. The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

<title> Taxes, Deficits, and Economic Growth - Heritage</title>

May 14, 1996 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Even assuming the Clinton Administration's forecast for this year is accurate, the United States economy's performance since 1989 will have been the worst seven-year period since the end of World War II. Adjusted for inflation, median household income has declined by 6.6 percent since Ronald Reagan left office.<sup>1</sup>  And while the unemployment rate is reasonably low, many Americans are worried about the future and fear their children will be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than its parents. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The economy's sub-par performance has triggered a debate on how best to stimulate economic growth and boost income. The good news is that all sides of the debate agree that the key to economic growth is capital formation -- increasing the levels of savings and investment (including investments in human capital). The bad news, however, is that there is a significant disagreement over the policy changes that will best meet that goal. On one side are those who argue that high tax rates dampen incentives and believe that correcting the anti-savings, anti-investment bias of the current income tax code will improve the economy's performance. The flat tax, they would argue, offers the best opportunity to generate a substantial and positive impact on job creation and income growth. The other side of the debate is dominated by those who believe the most important variable is the budget deficit. They argue that a lower budget deficit will lead to significant reductions in interest rates and that lower interest rates will spur higher levels of investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, no discussion of economic growth would be complete without addressing the size of government. Regardless of whether it is financed through taxes or borrowing, government spending represents a transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. If government spends that money in a way that generates a sufficiently high rate of return, the economy will benefit. If the rate of return is below that of the private sector, however, then the rate of growth will be slower than it otherwise would have been.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Needless to say, the debate over growth has important policy implications. Should taxes be increased or decreased?  Should the budget be balanced and, if so, how quickly?  Is the deficit the real problem, or is it a symptom of an underlying problem of too much government?  What is the impact of tax reform?  What types of government spending count as investment?  If certain policies increase growth, should that higher growth be included in government economic and revenue estimates?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Careful analysis of the historical and theoretical evidence yields three important conclusions that can help guide policymakers as they focus on the nation's economic problems:<ol>

	
<p><li>The tax system is taking too much money out of the productive sector of the economy. Perhaps even more important, the structure of the tax system is grossly flawed and imposes a particularly steep penalty on the very behaviors -- saving and investing -- that are needed to promote growth.

<p><li>Government borrowing is morally wrong because it imposes bills on future generations,<sup>2</sup> but the deficit should not drive economic policy. Contrary to what both political parties argue, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the budget deficit and interest rates. Nor is there much reason to believe that lower interest rates, by themselves, will have a pronounced effect on investment. Moreover, focusing on the deficit can undermine sound economic policy by leading some to view higher taxes as an appropriate policy option.

<p><li>Government spending is too high. Many programs fail to generate an adequate rate of return (and many, such as welfare programs, almost certainly have a negative return and have made things worse). Not all government spending, needless to say, is dependent on "rates of return," but legislators should fully understand that funding programs with money that could be more productively used by the private sector will result in less economic growth. Finally, for those who do view the deficit as the key variable, there is ample evidence that slowing the growth of spending -- not higher taxes -- is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Why Capital Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As stated above, there is very little controversy about what causes growth. There is near-unanimous agreement that salaries and wages are linked closely to productivity. The only way to raise the income of workers permanently -- assuming no change in their skills -- is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools allows them to produce more. The level of capital formation, for instance, largely explains why workers in the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive, generating more output per hour of labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economists of all persuasions recognize this relationship between investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:<blockquote>

	What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then controlled by the Democrats:
<blockquote>
	When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less depreciation)<sup>4</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases. A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock, the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the Congressional Research Service:
<blockquote>
	Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term rate of growth will hinge on the United States' ability to increase the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability to increase the level of investment spending -- more spending for capital equipment and more spending for research and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:
<blockquote>
	The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Competing Theories of Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Every economic school of thought -- even Marxism -- agrees that capital formation is the key to rising living standards. This happy consensus, however, does not translate into agreement about how to spur more savings and investment. In the political economic debate, at least in America, there are basically three (actually two and one-half) views on how to promote economic growth. These are:<ul>

<p><li><b>Old-Fashioned Keynesianism.</b> This is the half-theory because it has so few adherents in America. In periods of economic sluggishness, Keynesians believe the government should increase spending, financed by borrowing, to give the economy a shot in the arm. This spending is supposed to stimulate aggregate demand, which causes private sector behavior to perk up. With a handful of exceptions, such as the failed 1993 stimulus bill, this approach does not receive much attention in Washington.

<p><li><b>1950s Republican/1990s Democrat Balanced Budget Orthodoxy.</b> The title is made up because this school of thought does not really have a name. Proponents of this approach, which is dominant in Washington, believe that the economy hinges on changes in the budget deficit. Contrary to old-fashioned Keynesianism, however, this orthodox approach argues that reducing the budget deficit is the key to economic growth. The theory works as follows: A lower budget deficit leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to more investment, more investment leads to higher productivity, and higher productivity means more growth. Although some of the proponents favor smaller government as a philosophical goal, the balanced budget crowd does not think taxes have a major effect on incentives to engage in productive behavior. As a result, they are skeptical of tax cuts and instead are willing to raise taxes.

<p><li><b>The Free Market.</b> Another made-up title because other options -- supply-side, conservative, classical liberal -- do not capture the central tenet, the free-market approach believes that the keys to economic growth, at least in terms of fiscal policy, are the size of government and the structure of the tax system. In short, the free-market approach believes that total spending, regardless of whether it is financed by taxes or borrowing, hinders the economy's performance by transferring scarce resources from those in the private sector who have incentives to use them wisely to politicians and bureaucrats who oftentimes respond to political incentives. Because the size of government matters, free market advocates would prefer a government with a $1 trillion budget and a $200 billion deficit to a government with a $2 trillion budget that was balanced. On the tax side of the ledger, free market supporters believe taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest. A major goal of these folks, therefore, is radical tax reform designed to minimize tax rates and eliminate multiple taxation of capital. These reforms, it is believed, will boost capital formation, which will increase productivity, which means faster economic growth.
</ul><p>


<b>Who Is Right?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The policy debate in Washington largely revolves between Options 2 and 3 (though there is also a fight amongst supporters of Option 2 over the size of government -- Should the budget be balanced at level "X" or level "X+Y?"). Stripping away much of the rhetoric, the victor in this struggle depends on which set of relationships is more robust:
<ol>
<p><li>Are balanced budget proponents right that interest rates will fall significantly once deficit spending comes to an end?  And are they correct in believing that investment is very sensitive to interest rates?

<p><li>Are free market supporters correct in believing that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and the size of government?  Even more important, are they accurate in stating that decisions to work, save, and invest are significantly altered by the tax code?
</ul>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In some sense, both sides are right. Unless economists want to repeal the laws of supply and demand, there can be no doubt that lower budget deficits will lower interest rates. And, all other things being equal, lower interest rates should mean more investment. It is also unambiguously true that lower taxes will reduce the price of providing labor and capital to the economy. And it is certainly accurate to note that a large government, by reducing the cost of not working, will adversely affect the economy's performance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The real question is the magnitude of these effects. Would balancing the budget really reduce interest rates by two percentage points?  Is the level of investment primarily driven by the interest rate?  Just how sensitive are decisions to work, save, and invest to the rate of taxation?  To what extent do government spending programs actually undermine work effort?
<p>

<b>Doubts Regarding Balanced Budget Orthodoxy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is ample reason to question the robustness of the interest rate argument. According to the theory, lower budget deficits should result in lower interest rates. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that interest rates are significantly affected by changes in the U.S. budget deficit. This does not mean that the laws of supply and demand have been repealed. It simply means that in world capital markets, a shift of $30 billion, $40 billion, or $50 billion is unlikely to have a dramatic effect and can easily be overwhelmed by other factors such as monetary policy and demand for credit. <sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if interest rates fall by a significant amount, the second link in the balanced budget chain of reasoning is very weak. Yes, interest rates must affect investment choices, but it appears that this variable is dwarfed by other influences.<sup>8</sup>  Why invest, for instance, if there is no hope of making a profit?  Real interest rates were negative during the 1930s in America, yet investment was moribund because investors did not see many opportunities to earn an adequate rate of return. Likewise, real interest rates were high in America during much of the 1980s, yet investment rose because people saw ways to make money. Moreover, since a large portion of investment is self-financed on the part of business, it is difficult to see how interest rates would have a dramatic impact.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All things being equal, it is a good idea to balance the budget. And, yes, lower interest rates will promote investment. Balancing the budget, however, is not a silver bullet for the economy. This approach is especially short-sighted if it is used as a reason to raise taxes or block pro-growth tax cuts. As the following section illustrates, changes in tax policy can have a pronounced effect on the economy's performance.

<p>
<b>Why Free Market Supporters Are Right About Taxes and Capital Formation</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The attached appendices provide a sampling of empirical work on the impact of taxes. To put that work in context, however, it is useful to walk through an example illustrating just how heavy the tax burden is on savings and investment. Between personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes, a single dollar of investment income can be subject to as many as four layers of tax in America. Added to that burden are provisions of the law, such as depreciation and the alternative minimum tax, which force taxpayers to overstate their income. Adding insult to injury is the heavy compliance cost of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 35 percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving only $6.50 out of the original $10. This $6.50 then goes to the investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much as 39.6 percent of his $6.50, leaving him with less than $4.00 of annual income from a "successful" $100 investment. In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized world. To make a bad situation even worse, he will be taxed on the nominal gains, often meaning that taxes are paid on assets that have lost value in real terms (and do not forget that the person who sold him the stock originally may have been subject to capital gains taxes on that sale). The final insult is the estate and gift tax. Successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor -- one who actually earns money on his investments -- may have to send more than 80 percent of his earnings to the government, not to mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment, the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume rather than to build for America's future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since taxes have such a dramatic impact on incentives to work, save, and invest, it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median household income, almost certainly is attributable in part to the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill Clinton.
<p>


<b>The Answer: The Flat Tax</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Each of the tax code's many shortcomings can be addressed by targeted legislation, but a far better approach is simply to replace the existing system with a flat tax. There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but they all share certain key features. These are:
<ul><p><li><b>One low tax rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The Armey-Shelby flat tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent rate which phases down to 17 percent after a couple of years.

<p><li><b>Tax income only once.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double- (and sometimes triple- and quadruple-) taxation of income generated through savings and investment. The key principle is that the tax code not discriminate against income that is used for savings and investment as opposed to income that is consumed. 

<p><li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> All pure flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Included in this would be special tax breaks for businesses and corporations and, for individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and the state and local mortgage interest deduction. Eliminating these "loopholes" solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.

<p>
</ul>
<b>Benefits of a Flat Tax</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By addressing the many problems of the existing tax code in one fell swoop, the flat tax would have an immediate and dramatic positive impact. Included among the benefits are:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to the annual rate of economic growth. How significant is this?  An increase in the growth rate of just one-half of one percentage point would boost an average family of four's yearly income by more than $5,000 after ten years.

<p><li><b>Instant wealth creation.</b> Eliminating the second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on capital income would significantly boost the value of all income-producing assets. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, enactment of a flat tax would immediately boost wealth by some $1 trillion.

<p><li><b>Simplicity.</b> The 600-plus tax forms of the current system would be swept into the trash and replaced by two simple postcard-sized forms. Wage, salary, and pension income would be reported on the individual form and business and capital income would be reported on the business form. Neither form would require more than a few minutes to complete, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion-hour yearly burden of today's tax code.

<p><li><b>Fairness. All taxpayers and all income would be treated equally.</b> A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs no longer would be penalized by discriminatory tax rates, and no longer would the politically well-connected by able to benefit from special loopholes and preferences.

<p><li><b>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> All deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would be eliminated under a flat tax. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. Investment decisions would be guided by economic forces rather than tax considerations.

<p><li><b>Increased civil liberties.</b> The complexity of the tax code makes it nearly impossible for either taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law. A greatly simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of the conflicts and controversies that make the IRS one of the most feared agencies of the federal government.
</ul><p>

<b>The Spending Problem</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While current tax policy represents a huge impediment to economic growth, policymakers also must focus on the size of government. To the extent that politicians and bureaucrats do not spend money as wisely or efficiently as it would be spent in the private sector, economic growth will lag as government increases in size. More specifically, many government programs do not generate benefits (or minimize costs) to the economy that  exceed those which would have occurred had the money remained in private hands. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appropriate approach for policymakers is to determine whether spending for a given program will yield enough benefits to offset the loss of the money to the private sector (including the incentive and compliance costs of collecting taxes). A certain level of transportation spending, for instance, will facilitate economic growth by permitting the efficient flow of goods and services. Policymakers should debate, of course, whether the spending could be privatized or conducted at the state and local level. And to the extent they believe it has to be conducted by Washington, they should do their best to ensure that funding is allocated according to sound guidelines rather than pork-barrel politics. Other types of spending, such as crime prevention, also may help the economy by reducing the cost of crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In too many cases, however, there is strong reason to believe that the federal government is spending money in ways that do not produce good results for the economy. Some programs, such as welfare, reduce the cost of not working and inevitably undermine productive economic behavior. Other types of spending, such as the budgets for regulatory agencies, can have significantly negative rates of return because of the heavy costs they impose on the private sector. Unfortunately, policy makers usually do not subject government programs to this type of cost/benefit analysis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Note that one important conclusion from using this approach is that the deficit is not the critical variable. The key is the size of government, not how it is financed. Taxes and deficits are both harmful, but the real problem is that government is taking money from the private sector and spending it in ways that often are counter-productive. As a result, fiscal policy should focus on reducing the level of government spending, with particular emphasis on those programs that yield the lowest benefits and/or impose the highest costs. The importance of reducing spending, it should be noted, exists regardless of whether the budget happens to be balanced and is not contingent on changes in the tax system (just as reforming the tax system and adopting other pro-growth tax changes should not be contingent on what happens to the spending side of the ledger).
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There is no magic formula to boost growth. The economy can only grow if people work more or work better. Unfortunately, much of the world has adopted policies that impose increasingly steep tax penalties on those who add to the economy's wealth. Compounding the damage of these policies are spending programs that shield people from taking responsibility for their own lives. The combination has been an unmitigated failure. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This raises a particularly important issue for those on the left. They must decide what is more important: keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate. It is certainly true that modest reforms like reducing the tax rate on capital gains or big reforms like the flat tax will boost after-tax income of the rich. The empirical evidence, however, shows that other income classes will benefit as well -- and may benefit even more.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Critics of tax reform complain that it is nothing more than "trickle-down" economics that relies on tax cuts for the "rich" to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful politically, but it cannot change economic reality. Economist John Shoven has explained:<blockquote>

	The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment is sometimes derisively referred to as "trickle-down" economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I> way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments per worker.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For a profession usually chided for its lack of agreement, economists are nearly unanimous in their recognition that capital formation is the key to economic growth. Policymakers seeking to boost living standards and take-home pay face two competing options for how best to achieve the goal of more savings and investment: Should they focus on the deficit or should they shrink the size of government and reform the tax system?  While these goals need not conflict, to the extent there is a division, there should be little doubt that a myopic fixation on the deficit will not necessarily produce the right policy results. Adopting a flat tax, by contrast, combined with long-overdue reductions in the level of government spending, will generate the desired outcome of a more prosperous economy.

<hr><p><b>APPENDIX 1:<br> Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b></center> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours worked.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A University of California economist found that because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist found that "Husbands of retirement age, 60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related systematically to wages and income in the expected way."  Moreover, "Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive to wages and income."<sup>13</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income falls, so does the incentive to work.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists estimated that "wives' labor supply will increase by 3.8 percent" in response to a reduction in the marriage penalty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I> found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study found that they work eight percent less than they would in the absence of taxes.<sup>17</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of at least $1,000 per person.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase incentives to work by increasing the "price" of leisure, but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual choices, two economists note that "the generalization of the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid" because "It will be impossible for all individuals to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual work-leisure analysis implies."<sup>19</sup>  The actual economy-wide response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all studies indicate.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent, for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 2:<br> Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b><p>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B. Kenneth Sanden noted, "The bias against saving in the present tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income used for consumption."<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market to rise by 3 percent.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written that "increases in the real after-tax rate of return received by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital accumulation."  Further, "bequests may account for a large fraction of national capital formation," which strengthens the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted that "Nations... where the extractive [tax] capacity of government did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product, have, in a sense, opted for... an increasing rate of private capital accumulation."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a "decline in U.S. saving."<sup>26</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal of Public Economics</I>, "suggest that dividend taxes have important effects on investment decisions" and that "an increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment rate by about 15 percent."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found "significant effects for the after-tax return on saving, after-tax cost of borrowing, or both."  The Reagan tax cuts "had a major impact on U.S. economic growth."<sup>29</sup>


<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 3:<br> Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A 1983 World Bank study of 20 countries found that low-tax nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living than high-tax nations.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist. For working wives, the losses are even higher: more than 58 cents for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study published in the <I>American Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated 1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost economic output.<sup>35</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded that "Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one percent annually."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy, with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> found "The estimated long-run effects [of high marginal tax rates] are sufficient to explain up to 75 percent of the recent decline in the measured growth of the Swedish GNP."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a former Treasury Department official, between 75 percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> estimated that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it raises for the government. The "excess burden" is "123 percent of revenue."<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1984 study in the <I>American Economic Review</I> estimated "20.7 cents of welfare loss per additional dollar of tax revenue."<sup>41</sup>

	A study of U.S. taxes at the state level found that low-tax states grew 35 percent faster than high-tax states between 1970 and 1980.<sup>42</sup>  The relationship between growth and taxes among the states has been shown in literally dozens of studies.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist was able to illustrate a very strong inverse relation between average per capita growth rates and average tax rates on income and profits in developed countries.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to an article in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I>, based on worldwide data, increasing the tax burden by ten percentage points will reduce annual growth by two percentage points.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a paper presented at the World Bank, two economists uncovered an "impressive negative relation between the rate of growth and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP" as well as a "negative association between growth and... the 'marginal' income tax rate."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of the explosive growth of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, Hoover economist Alvin Rabushka has written that 
<blockquote>
	The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence of or very light charges on capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains), and a smorgasbord of inducements for domestic and foreign enterprises to invest and reinvest in each economy.<sup>47</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other studies have found that the economy is harmed when government spends tax revenue:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A National Bureau of Economic Research study, using worldwide data, found that an increase "in government spending and taxation of 10 percentage points was predicted to decrease long-term growth rates by 1.4 percentage points."<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to Daniel Landau, "The results of this study [published in the <I>Southern Economic Journal</I>] suggest a negative relationship exists between the share of government consumption expenditure in GDP and the rate of growth of per capita GDP."<sup>49</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two economists found that increases in U.S. government outlays for social programs "are associated with reductions in the growth rate."<sup>50</sup>

<h3>OFF WITH THE LIMITS: WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT MONEY AND POLITICS WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT</h3>
<p>
<b>By Lamar Alexander</b>
<br>May 23, 1996.

<P>

On March 3, one day after the disastrous -- for me -- South Carolina primary and three days before I withdrew from the presidential race, I attended Sunday services at the Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Rev. Frank Harrington preached about how Joshua, after a great victory at the Battle of Jericho, had been surprised and humiliated in the battle of A'i -- so humiliated that Joshua renamed A'i the "Valley of Calamity." He wanted his warriors always to remember the lessons of what had happened there.
<p>
Walking out after the service, I asked Rev. Harrington, "Was the point that I should rename South Carolina the `Valley of Calamity?'" 
<p>
"No," he said, "the point is, you must learn lessons from your defeat -- and then pick yourself up and go on." 
<p>
The voters, in their wisdom, have given me a defeat, and now several weeks to reflect upon its lessons. The Heritage Foundation has invited me today to talk about one of those lessons: the influence of money on the race for the presidency. While my wounds are fresh, here is my view: The so-called campaign reformers are selling the American people a real bill of goods on this one. They are saying that limits on what individuals can give to presidential campaigns and on what candidates can spend will reduce the influence of money and create a better democracy.
<p>
In fact, such limits do precisely the reverse. We now have 22 years of experience with them. Limits have increased the influence of money and are dangerous to democracy. It is the law of unintended consequences operating in all of its glory. Instead of adding more limits, we should take the limits off and rely on full disclosure to discourage corruption.
<p>
The limits on giving and spending for a presidential campaign were well-intentioned, placed into federal law after Watergate. Corporations can't give at all; political action committees may give up to $5,000; and individuals may give up to $1,000 during the primaries (the government pays for the general election). In addition, there are limits on what a candidate may spend in each state primary and a ceiling on spending for the entire primary. The Federal Election Commission enforces all of this.
<p>
The limits were designed to make things better for you, the average voter, so let's look at what they have done. As a result of these limits: 
<ul>
<p><li>You are more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa or New Hampshire; 

<p><li>You have fewer choices of candidates;

<p><li>The primary campaigns start before you care and end before you have a chance to vote;

<p><li>You are less likely to hear the candidates' messages; 

<p><li>Your nominee is more likely to be someone already holding office, rather than an insurgent;

<p><li>More of your choices are among candidates who are rich enough to spend their own money; and 

<p><li>Washington, D.C., has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.
</ul><p>
In short, the federal limits on giving and spending during elections are turning presidential races into playgrounds for the rich, the already famous, and the Washington-based, and are helping to deprive most Americans of the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
<p>
When we create a system for picking Presidents, I believe our objectives should be these:
<ul>
<p><li>We should want the largest number of good candidates.

<p><li>We should want a good opportunity to hear what they have to say.

<p><li>All of us, if possible, want the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
</ul><p>
If this is also your set of objectives, then here is my remedy: Off with the limits. Off with the limits on individual contributions. Off with the spending limits. Require maximum disclosure. Open up the system. Let the candidates speak. Let us vote.
<p>


<b>Three Disclaimers</b>
<p>
Before you think it, let me say it:
<p>
First, I am not here to wallow in gloom. In fact, I come away from the campaign more optimistic, not less. I would do it again in a minute. I believe even more that there is very little wrong with our country that more jobs, better schools, and stronger families won't fix. 
<p>
Second, I believe I can make these remarks in the spirit of a gracious loser. That is made easier because our process produced a nominee whom I respect, who is my friend, and who I will be proud to call my President. Under any process, Bob Dole was our party's most likely nominee this year. (I will confess that my determination to be a gracious loser is tested about once a week when I remember what another defeated Tennessean, Davy Crockett, once said. Congressman Crockett strode to the courthouse steps, faced the voters who had just turned him out of office, and said what every defeated candidate has always wanted to say to such voters: "I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell!")
<p>
Finally, I am not here to complain because Steve Forbes spent $33 million of his own wealth on his presidential campaign. I believe the First Amendment to our Constitution gives Mr. Forbes the right to spend his money to advance his views. The Rockefellers and Perots and Forbeses and du Ponts all have made valuable contributions to our public life. I hope they continue to do so. What I object to, as I will discuss, is letting them spend all they want and then putting limits on the rest of us.
What I am arguing -- that it is wrong to put limits on giving and spending -- runs smack in the face of what we have been hearing ever since Watergate. So let me take my points one by one. What I have to contribute is a view from the inside. I will stick to my impressions and stories from the road and let scholars here at Heritage and elsewhere compile the statistics and perform the analysis.
<p>
<b>Because of the limits, you're more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa and New Hampshire.</b> 
<p>Of course, not everybody wants to meet a presidential candidate. Walking across New Hampshire, I met a woman taking a work break outside a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander. I'd like to be your next President." She looked at me, and at my red and black shirt, and said with disgust, "That's all we need. Another President!" Congressman Mo Udall used to tell about walking into a barber shop. "I'm Mo Udall, running for President," he said. "Yeah, I know," the barber replied. "We were just laughing about that yesterday."
<p>

But if you are one of those persons who would actually like to meet and size up someone who might be your President, get your wallet ready because the $1,000 limit on giving forces candidates to spend most of their time with people who can give $1,000. As with many federal laws, these limits have done just exactly the opposite of what they were intended to do. Limits have increased the influence of money on the candidates.
<p>

For example, to raise $10 million in 1995 for the Alexander for President campaign, I traveled to 250 fund-raising events. Now, think about this. This is about one event per campaign day. This took 70 percent of all my time. As a result, I became unusually well acquainted with a great many good Americans capable of giving $1,000 (who probably represent a cross section of about one percent of all the people in the country). Wouldn't I have been a better candidate, and the country better off had I been elected, if I had spent more time traveling around America and visiting allies abroad? (I actually did this during 1994, driving 8,800 miles across America and spending two months overseas. This was when I was not spending most of my time meeting nice people who could give me $1,000.)
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you have fewer choices for President.</b><p>
This is because, in the real world, a $1,000 limit on gifts makes fund-raising so difficult that it discourages most candidates. I will now wave my own red flag: It is important not to get carried away with this argument. The difficulty of raising money is sometimes just an excuse. There are other more compelling reasons not to run for President. 
<p>
For example, I recall in November of 1995, when Colin Powell was on the cover of the news magazines and his approval rating in the polls was, literally, higher than the Pope's -- and I was struggling to secure a paragraph in the Keokuk, Iowa, daily -- I was driving to the airport after a New York fund-raiser with a former associate of General Powell's. The unavoidable question arose, "Will Colin run?" The former associate answered, "I don't know. But I can tell you two things about General Powell. One is, he makes rational decisions. Two is, he doesn't like uncertainty." I knew from that moment that, if that were true, there was no chance whatsoever Colin would be a candidate. Running for President is not a rational decision. It is instinctive. It is a passion with a purpose. And it is most surely a symphony in uncertainty. That is why I am so surprised that so many have such a hard time taking Colin Powell at his word, that he simply doesn't want to do it. Most people don't. They don't want the job, or they are afraid they can't win, or more and more they are unwilling to expose themselves and their families to the scrutiny that comes with the candidacy. 
<p>
Having said all of that, it is still true that the prospect of trying to raise $20 million from contributions of $1,000 or less makes the race much less attractive and often impossible for many good candidates. In 1995, Bill Bennett told me he didn't know how to raise that kind of money. Jack Kemp said he knew how but didn't want to. Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney discovered it would have been very hard even for a former Vice President and a former Defense Secretary; they both decided not to become candidates. 
<p>
You might have wondered this year, where have all the governors gone? I don't think I have ever met a governor who didn't think he or she would make an excellent President. Seventeen of our Presidents have been governors. There are today 32 Republican governors. One might argue (and I will confess that I tried out this argument a few hundred times during 1995) that the natural presidential partner for our strong Republican congressional leaders would have been the best of our Republican governors. 
<p>
But at the end of 1995, not one sitting Republican governor was in the race. Carroll Campbell, Tommy Thompson, and Bill Weld, perhaps others, had considered it and drawn back, privately saying, "I can't raise the money." Even the governor of California, Pete Wilson -- who by my calculation is governor of five percent of all the money in the world -- could not raise enough money. So, for Republicans, 1995 turned out to be the year of the "money primary." 
<p>
This is how it worked. There were, in the end, only four of us who could find a way to raise enough money to run for President. We all had certain advantages. For example, a contribution to Bob Dole was also a contribution to the respected Senate majority leader. Phil Gramm had worked relentlessly for six years as chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee to build a list of 83,000 names and a $5 million campaign kitty, which he then transferred to his presidential account -- a perfectly legal loophole, but one which was unavailable to the governors or others not holding office. Pat Buchanan was able to depend on direct mail for smaller contributions because it was his second race, he had been on network television for 15 years, and he took, shall we say, especially noisy positions. 
<p>
The Alexander campaign had some advantages, too: exceptional national leadership and strong support at home. Six of the last seven Republican national finance chairs chaired our fund-raising. We began with a $2 million dinner in Nashville on March 6, 1995, and raised $5.2 million in 21 events during the next six weeks. At the end of 1995, the three zip codes in America which had contributed the most to presidential campaigns were all in Nashville. By the time I withdrew, we had raised nearly $13 million from 26,000 contributors, 8,800 of whom had given $1,000. (We received another $4 million from federal matching funds.) 
<p>

But after the initial $5.2 million spurt, it became much harder for us. I was traveling to 20 events per month to raise $500,000. This created logistical adventures of Desert Storm proportions. On one day, I flew from Nashville to Colorado Springs to Denver for fund-raisers and then on to Phoenix to be ready for an early morning breakfast. To collect $20,000 during the crucial week before the Iowa caucus, I "dropped by" Knoxville, Tennessee, on the way from New Hampshire to Iowa. To raise another $30,000, I flew from Sioux City, Iowa, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, one Sunday in December. By the last four days of the New Hampshire primary, we were running on empty except for the money set aside for debts, audit, and winding down.
<p>

Then, when I placed a strong third in the Iowa caucus on February 12, the money dam broke. Beginning three days after Iowa, five days before the New Hampshire primary, contributions started rolling in to our Nashville headquarters at the rate of $100,000 a day without events. This continued for every day except Sunday, until I withdrew on March 6. Our once-a-week telephone conference calls sometimes included more than 200 volunteer fund-raisers. But it came too late, for New Hampshire ads had to be purchased the Friday before the primary on Tuesday. I failed (by 7,000 votes) to overtake Senator Dole. The Republican nomination was decided in the first primary. 
<p>

<b>Partly because of the limits, the campaign starts before you care and ends before you have a chance to vote.</b> 
<p>
Not only did the campaign end early; it started ridiculously early because, it seemed at the time, starting early was the only way to raise the necessary amount of money. In early 1995, Senator Gramm of Texas, flush with his 83,000 names and $5 million kitty, declared that it would take $20 million to run for President, that he could raise it and that he doubted many others could, and then sponsored a $4 million kick-off dinner in Dallas and announced, "Ready cash is a candidate's best friend." 
<p>

 None of the rest of us were about to be left behind. I held my $2 million dinner in Nashville. Senator Dole jumped in, as did others. Off we went, pounding the streets in 1995 trying to raise money for a race in 1996. It was like trying to stir up a conversation about football in the middle of the NBA playoffs. For me, by mid-summer 1995, it was going something like this interview: 
<blockquote><p>
	From Washington, D.C., "Inside Politics," Wolf Blitzer (already bored with the long "money primary"): "Governor Alexander, why do the polls show Senator Dole ahead of you 54 to 4 in Iowa?" 
<p>
	From Vermont, in my red and black shirt, Me (already tired of being asked the same question for the 50th time): "Wolf, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. The reason Senator Dole is ahead of me is that everyone knows him and nobody knows me." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, add to the cost of creating such a long campaign the usual costs of fund-raising. A rule of thumb is that it costs 30 cents to raise a dollar. That meant that of the $10 million we raised in 1995, about $3.5 million went for fund-raising. Then there is the cost of complying with federal regulations. Another $1 million of the $10 million we raised during 1995 went for that. We set aside still another $500,000 for the campaign audit, which usually takes years. I think you can see where I am heading. 
<p>
 Add the costs of the long campaign to the usual costs of fund-raising and complying with federal rules and, by the time the 1995 money primary was over and the real primary in 1996 was here, the handful of us still standing (except for Mr. Forbes) were running out of money. The Alexander campaign spent $10 million during 1995, everything we raised, which left us about $3 million in the bank (counting federal matching funds) at the beginning of 1996. And, by comparison, we were running a bare-bones effort. Senator Gramm had spent $28 million when he dropped out just before the first primary in mid-February. Senator Dole had spent more than $30 million by March 1 and, with 39 primaries yet to go, was coming uncomfortably close to the federally imposed primary spending ceiling. Steve Forbes spent $33 million before he dropped out. I'm not sure whether my friend Pat has dropped out yet or not! 
<p>
 The reason why the Republican nomination was decided in the first primary is not only because limits on giving and spending forced the campaigns to start early. It is also because so many states moved their primaries to an earlier date in an attempt to give their citizens the same privilege Iowa and New Hampshire citizens have: the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote to pick the first President of the new century. This bunching of primaries created a wild roller coaster ride through 38 states in the 25 days after New Hampshire. Ironically, this made New Hampshire even more important. Here was the law of unintended consequences mischievously at work once again. The money primary became so long and expensive that we all arrived financially exhausted at the real starting line: New Hampshire, which turned out to be the finish line as well. About the time the voters had returned from the refrigerator to settle in and watch the presidential campaign unfold and perhaps even to vote in it the campaign had ended. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you are less likely to hear the candidates' message.</b>
<p>

This is because limits on giving and spending prevent most candidates from raising enough money to get across their messages, especially if the candidate is relatively unknown at the beginning. Let me offer an example. Yesterday's <I>Newsweek</I> contains a column by Meg Greenfield which says this: "The doomed Presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander should tell the Republicans something. It was the quintessential anti-government pitch -- complete with an implicit -- and often explicit -- denial and disavowal of Alexander's career as a government guy. He bombed." 
<p>

 Well, now, this is the stuff of a pretty good debate. Of course, I disagree with Ms. Greenfield. I think my campaign nearly succeeded because I understand that the next President must lead us to expect less from Washington and ask more of ourselves, including our local governmental institutions. Ms. Greenfield's and President Clinton's solution is more from Washington. So let the debate begin. 
<p>

 Ms. Greenfield has her page in <I>Newsweek</I>. She is also editorial director for the <I>Washington Post.</I> President Clinton has the best forum of all. Their "more from Washington" side of the argument will get plenty of exposure. But what about my "more from us" argument? I made my case in Iowa during 80 visits and walked 100 miles across New Hampshire. I found that in those small meetings I could be persuasive. I also found that nothing much happened in the public opinion polls until I was on television. "Free TV" -- the network news -- was not of much help (although some local stations were very aggressive). To begin with, the national networks didn't arrive until mid-January when the campaign was nearly over. 
<p>

 The Center for Media and Public Affairs watched all the network newscasts in January and February, ten-and-one-half hours of campaign coverage. The Center found that we nine Republican candidates were allotted 79 minutes total. We were allowed to present our views in seven-second sound bites. The journalists covering us received five times as many minutes of coverage on those same newscasts. What the journalists said about us and our campaigns was more negative than what we candidates said about each other. And more than half the journalists' comments were about the horse race, not the issues. The Freedom Forum, in a remarkable survey of the journalists covering the presidential campaign, found that in 1992, 89 percent had voted for Bill Clinton. A candidate cannot rely on "Free TV" to get his message across. That is why, in our media-drenched society, where things are not important unless they are on TV, a candidate must have money for television to get a message across, and the limits on giving and spending make it difficult for candidates to do that.
<p>

This is not just one candidate's lament. Limits on giving and spending are an affront to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The whole idea of the framers of the Bill of Rights was to keep the government from attempting to limit political debate and criticism: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." In <I>Buckley v. Valeo</I>, the Supreme Court acknowledged this and struck down most congressional limits of this sort, but left standing the current provisions because of its worry about "corruption." I believe the better antidote to corruption is disclosure. To correct something bad, we have created something worse. 
<p>
<b>
Because of limits, your nominee is more likely to be an incumbent than an insurgent.
</b><p>
In the real world, insurgents not only need more money than incumbents; they need it early. The <I>New York Times</I> reported that two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire made their minds up during the last week before the primary, after the Iowa caucuses. Among those voters, I won with 31 percent. Among the one-third who voted before Iowa, I received six percent. More money, earlier, might have helped get my message across to those early deciders. 
<p>

Candidates for President who already hold public office have government-paid staffs of policy advisers, PR people, and political administrators. They have name recognition and franking privileges. They have a fund-raising advantage because of their positions of power. If they are in Washington, they have a huge media advantage because that is where the media are. So putting a limit on what all candidates can raise and spend turns out to be a protection policy for some candidates: the ones who already enjoy the perquisites of public office. 
<p>

This is not just true in federal races. My home state, Tennessee, has just limited contributions to governors' races to $500. This is an enormous advantage for our incumbent Republican governor, Don Sundquist. And it virtually guarantees that the only effective candidate against Governor Sundquist when he runs for re-election will be someone who is so rich that he can spend his or her own money -- which brings us to the most important point. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, more of your choices are likely to be rich candidates willing to spend their own money.</b><p>

This brings us to the major problem with limits on campaign giving and spending: The limits apply to some candidates but not to others. This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from preventing anyone from spending his or her own money on our own campaigns. So the limits apply only to people who aren't rich enough to spend money on their own campaign. 
<p>

This creates an absurd advantage for wealthy candidates and a distorted contest for the voter. The first advantage is the obvious: The wealthy candidate has more money to spend. For example, Mr. Forbes spent $33 million of (mostly) his own money; I spent, with matching funds, about $16 million of other peoples' money. 
<p>

There are two other less obvious advantages. The candidate with his own money spends no time raising it. On the other hand, the candidate raising it is careening from event to event, repeating speeches, meeting nice people who can give $1,000, wearing himself ragged, and using up 70 percent of his time. By the time you reach the finals the week between Iowa and New Hampshire, you are a candidate for a fitness center, not the presidency. 
<p>

Finally, there are the state-by-state spending limits, which also help the rich. The federal government has decreed, for example, that a campaign may not spend more than $1 million in Iowa and $618,000 in New Hampshire during the presidential primaries. Mr. Forbes, unaffected by these limits, spent $5 million in Iowa on television. The Alexander campaign spent $930,000. The AP reported that on the third week before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes bought 700 ads on one Boston television station (which covers southern New Hampshire). That week, Senator Dole bought 200 ads on that station. The Alexander campaign: none. Mr. Forbes must have spent $5 million in Arizona, by my estimates. Local newspapers said it was more than any advertiser had ever spent on local television to introduce a new product. (It must be pointed out that having your own money doesn't automatically mean you win. Mr. Perot is not President. Mr. Forbes came in fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. I recall my race for governor in 1978 against a candidate who must have spent $8 million. I spent $2 million, enough to win, although I could never have raised $2 million if there had been limits of $500 or $1,000 per contribution.)
<p>

What kind of contest is this, having different rules for different contestants? This is like watching the Magic play the Bulls with one team wearing handcuffs. It is certainly not the game the voters paid to see. Think of it this way: Say the fifth grade teacher organizes a contest for class president with water pistols as the weapon of choice; then some kid arrives with a garden hose. Either take away the new kid's garden hose (Bill Bradley suggests a constitutional amendment to limit what individuals can spend on their own campaigns) or give the rest of the fifth graders the freedom to raise and spend enough money to buy their own garden hoses. And if the New Hampshire primary is most of the ball game in presidential primaries, why should state-by-state spending limits keep candidates from defending themselves, even if they use up all their money?
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, Washington has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.</b> 
<p>
Talking about Washington these days has gotten to be a sticky business. The rest of the country is tired of Washington, and Washington is tired of hearing about Washington. The rest of the country is becoming more offensive about its feelings, and Washington is becoming more defensive. "Cut their pay and send them home" still makes sense in Sioux City, but they call it nonsense here. One of Washington's most senior journalists told me sadly last year that "This town has grown too big for its britches." I have been coming and going from Washington off and on for 30 years and I believe that is true as well; but to come from outside Washington and say it, and to really believe it, is asking for trouble.
<p>

I believe our President must lead us to expect less from Washington and to ask more of ourselves. That is a message less frequently heard in Washington and more difficult to launch from outside Washington. For one thing, this is a media-drenched society, and the message-launchers -- the media -- are increasingly concentrated here. That will be more true in 2000 and 2004 than it was in 1996. The party fund-raising apparatus is here. The party leadership is here. The think tanks, if you will excuse me, are here. To receive maximum attention to my speech today, I am here. There are all sorts of good people here in Washington, but we of necessity, when we are here, talk mostly with each other.
<p>

<b>Reforming the Process</b><p>

Limits on giving and spending make it less likely that a candidate based outside Washington can succeed. Such candidates, by their experience and skills, may be able to help make Washington more like the rest of America, rather than the rest of America more like Washington. I believe Washington will always be a better place if it is constantly refreshed by the strength of the country outside Washington. The way we pick Presidents today makes that more difficult. Limits are not all that is wrong.

<p><b>The process should be deregulated.</b> We should sunset the existing regulations and start over. Fewer rules and full disclosure should be the byword.

<p><b>Spread out the primaries.</b> Let Iowa and New Hampshire go first, in February or March, and then arrange all the other primaries on the second Tuesday of the next three months. This would give winners a chance to capitalize on success, voters a chance to digest new faces, and candidates a chance to actually meet voters. 

<p><b>The candidates should be given the opportunity to speak on television more often for themselves.</b> My even mentioning this runs the same risks Dennis Rodman would take if he suggested some rule changes to a convention of NBA officials. So let me begin with some praise. Some print reporters sat through New Hampshire Lincoln Day dinners in the early stages of the money primary, in 1994 and 1995. C-SPAN and CNN labored valiantly and early. In January and February of 1996, the <I>New York Times</I> began printing some long excerpts of the candidates' speeches, and the networks began showing unedited stump speeches. But most of the coverage came late, or was about the horse race, or about candidates who were never going to run. Seventy-nine minutes of network exposure in seven-second sound bites for nine Republican candidates is pathetically little. 
<p><b>
There are dangers to early voting.</b> In a growing number of states, voters may vote a month or two before the election day. According to the Edison exit poll of 1996 New Hampshire primary voters, 40 percent of the voters made their minds up during the last three days before the primary. Those who cast their votes a month earlier were voting in quite a different race. 

<p>
 <b>Other Options For Reform</b>
<p>
The first option is suggested by Senator Bill Bradley, whose sporting background must make him especially allergic to contests with one rule for some participants and another rule for others. Senator Bradley would try to create a level playing field by putting limits on everyone, in effect making Mr. Forbes live by the same rules I do. 
<p>
This takes care of Mr. Forbes and me. But the AFL-CIO will still be able to run $35 million worth of TV ads attacking particular Republican candidates. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors will still be able to run ads slamming President Clinton's product liability veto. The National Restaurant Association will advertise that President Clinton is wrong about the minimum wage. The National Education Association will say I am wrong about school choice.The national political parties will raise tens of millions in "soft money." The President is the one person in America who is able to advocate the best interests of the country as a whole. Why should we limit the speech only of those who seek to speak for the country as a whole?
<p>
Senator Bradley should leave the First Amendment alone. The First Amendment is correct. It stands in the way of preventing ill-advised efforts by the government to limit a candidate's right to speak. And if there cannot be limits on most of us, why should there be limits on any of us? 
<p>
A second option is public financing which we now have with the presidential general elections. But such taxpayer-funded campaigns still leave Mr. Perot and the AFL-CIO and other committees free to spend millions creating an unlevel playing field. Also, public financing leaves the media with more horsepower than the candidates themselves have. And I cannot fathom how public financing would work in a primary situation. Would the government have funded everyone who showed up at the Republican debates this season? If so, such funding would have produced countless more candidates. I am opposed to public financing. It is incestuous. It is an unnecessary use of taxpayers' money. It invites government regulations. It creates an unlevel playing field by favoring incumbents. 
<p>
Finally, there are various proposals to require the media to give away TV time. (Such proposals would never work in a primary for the same reasons public financing could not work: How would you choose to whom to give it?) The lack of an opportunity for voters to consider the messages of candidates -- especially insurgent candidates -- is at the heart of the problem with our presidential process. But I am afraid these well-meaning proposals will drown in their own complexity and the law of unintended consequences will somehow rear its head again. Isn't the best solution for the media simply to cover the races and present the serious candidates on network news and in the newspapers more often on appropriate occasions, speaking for themselves?
<p>

<b>Find the Good and Praise It</b><p> 
I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I came away from the campaign with a good feeling, not a bad feeling. My friend Alex Haley used to say, "Find the good and praise it," and I can easily do that about this process, even with its flaws. During the last year, I walked across New Hampshire, meeting several hundred people a day, spent 80 days in Iowa in maybe 200 meetings that ranged from 20 to 300 people, and had at least 50 meetings in Florida with the delegates to the Presidency III straw poll. During most of these meetings I was little known and unencumbered by the news media, so there was no disruption to the flow of the session. 
<p>
I remember wishing time after time that anybody who had any sense of cynicism about our presidential selection process could be with me, like a fly on the wall, because they could not be cynical after hearing and seeing and feeling what I saw. The groups with whom I met always listened carefully. Most often, they wanted to talk about our jobs, our schools and our neighborhoods, and our families. In meeting after meeting, I came away certain that this is a nation hungry for a vision contest, not one willing to tolerate a trivial presidential election. I believe there is a great market in the American electorate for a full-fledged discussion about what kind of country we can have in the year 2000 and beyond. 
<p>
As the song says, it is a long, long time from May 'til September when the presidential race really begins. One way to help fill this time usefully would be to review the way we pick Presidents and make certain that next time, in the new century, we have a process that attracts the largest number of good candidates, that gives them an opportunity to say and us to hear their messages, and gives as many of us as possible a chance to cast a meaningful vote. 
<p>
One lesson I learned when I ran for President is that step one toward those objectives would be these four words: Off with the limits.

<h3><center>Dr. Edwin J. Feulner Remarks for Town Hall Launch<br></h3>
<h4>June 29, 1995<br></h4></center>

<p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><p><b>[Town Hall President Tim Butler introduced Dr. Feulner]</b>

<p>Dr. Feulner:<p>
Thank you, Tim, for that kind introduction and welcome to all of you here today as we write another chapter in the unfolding and never-ending story that is democracy in our great nation.  We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, it has been created to serve people. To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue; an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who is interested.

<p>And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.

<p>Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families and communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.

<p>But in Thomas Jefferson's time, in the days of John Adams and Ben Franklin, communication was not a simple matter and so through print -- through the power of the written word -- the intellectual underpinnings of a revolution were laid.

<p>Two hundred years ago, the pamphlets of Tom Paine and so many others were the home pages of a network of idealists that became a movement... that became a revolution... that became a nation.

<p>Thomas Jefferson once wrote James Madison that a "little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."  In 1994, the winds of political change once again blew across the land.

<p>I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in creating Town Hall as <i>the</i> conservative meeting place on the Internet, but I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, we will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.

<p>On the Senate front, Bob Dole continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country. In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a leader -- a man of action and accomplishment.

<p>On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.

 <p>We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and Speaker of the House -- Newt Gingrich.


<p>Thank you both for joining us.  We are all honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to conjure up someone who ought to know.  Please welcome the father of inventions, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.


<p>Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboard?


 <p>Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors?

<p>[Ben Franklin: <i>Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny; and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentleman, on a count of three.... one.... two.... three.... start your engines.</i> ]

<p>Feulner: Ladies and gentlemen, Town Hall is officially launched.


<p>Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, Mr. Franklin. Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations whose vision and creativity have spurred them to join this innovative effort.  I am very pleased to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.  As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall.
<p>

<ul><p>First, please welcome, David Keene, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a>.

<p>Next shades of the Boston tea party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.

<p>It is also a great pleasure to welcome the President of <a href="/empower/">Empower America</a> -- Bill Dal Col.

<p>Following Bill is Gary Bauer, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council</a>. Welcome aboard, Gary.

<p>Next, Town Hall is privileged to house <a href="/lead-inst/">The Leadership Institute</a>, headed by Morton Blackwell.

<p>Now, one of our newest additions, Grace-Marie Arnett, Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>.

<p>We are also delighted to have with us, <a href="/nmp">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher, Willie Richardson.

<p>Following Willie is John O'Sullivan, Editor of <a href="/nationalreview>National Review</a> magazine.

<p>I am also very pleased to introduce the President of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan. Come on up, Karen.

<p>Next we are pleased to announce the addition of the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> to the ranks of Town Hall and its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.

<p>Finally, I am very proud to welcome, the <a href="/yaf/">Young America's Foundation</a> and its president, Ron Robinson.</ul>

<p>It's a great starting line-up but only the beginning of a fast-growing community. Thank you all for being here today.

<p>I am now very happy to be able to give all of you the opportunity to hear from our two wonderful leaders here today. It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- Newt Gingrich.

<p><b>[Gingrich speaks]</b>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for those wonderful words.  It is my great privilege to introduce to you now the outstanding Majority Leader of the United States Senate -- Senator Robert Dole

<p><b>[Dole speaks]</b>

<p>We are honored that both of you have been with us today. Thank you for that great vote of confidence and thanks to all of you for coming today.

<p>You, too, are now a part of history but this historic day isn't over. As you see, we have terminals set up for any or all of you to try your hand at surfing the Net, and there are Town Hall Net guides available to help you navigate uncharted waters.

<p>Also, this afternoon there will be a lecture series featuring a number of conservative and industry leaders followed by question and answer periods. We hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity to begin the debate. Thanks again for coming, and I hope we'll be talking soon -- at <a href="/townhall/welcome.html.cgi">www.townhall.com</a>.

<h3>AMERICAN MILITARY INTERVENTION: A USER'S GUIDE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1079<br>
May 2, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deciding when, where, and how to intervene with military force presents a truly perplexing set of questions. In a post-Cold War world, with no overriding threat to serve as the focus for American national strategy, it is even more difficult to decide when, where, and how to use the U.S.'s limited military resources. In this increasingly uncertain world, it is therefore imperative that American policymakers follow clear guidelines in deciding where and when American military intervention is most needed and how it can be most effective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, however, the United States currently has no such guidelines in place. Because of this, the Clinton Administration has been tempted to intervene militarily in peripheral areas of the world. In Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, the result has been either failure or settlements that even one former Clinton advisor has characterized as "provisional, fragile, and reversible."<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, congressional and public support has been very weak because it has been unclear to most Americans how these interventions serve the national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations unless the Clinton Administration and Congress adopt a concrete set of policy guidelines for when and how to use American military forces abroad. These guidelines must be flexible enough to address a wide range of military options, but they also must be constant enough to balance the projected benefit of any intervention against the costs to the American people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before approving any future military intervention, the Administration and Congress therefore should make certain that it meets the following criteria:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #1 - Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b> Both the President and Congress must recognize that not all national interests are equally important. They must also acknowledge that not all national interests are national security interests that require military intervention. Instead of focusing on core security interests, the Clinton Administration has committed American military power only on the periphery, and with inconclusive and negligible results. The Administration has what one critic has called an "instinct for the capillary" -- a tendency to send U.S. troops on missions that serve lesser national interests, or in some cases (such as Haiti and Somalia), no security interest at all.<sup>2</sup>  For America to use its power effectively, it must prioritize where and how it chooses to defend its vital, important, and marginal interests, thereby avoiding both excessive activism that diffuses important resources and isolationism that eschews important opportunities to shape events.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #2 - Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.</b> America's current national military strategy is strategically bankrupt. Not only is the Bottom-Up Review force too small to execute the two major regional conflicts strategy, but it is woefully underfunded as well. Huge interventions in areas of marginal security interest have exacerbated the strain on the U.S. military and made it doubtful that the military can mobilize the resources necessary to defend vital national interests and honor current security commitments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #3 - Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b> Military interventions should be conducted to accomplish clearly definable military goals that are militarily achievable, consistent with overriding political objectives, and supported by enough force to achieve these goals. In Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has failed to define these military objectives clearly, and those objectives that have been articulated are insufficient to achieve the larger political goal of reaching a sustainable peace. Thus, there is no reliable way to measure success or failure, which is why Clinton has imposed a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The President, in effect, has made withdrawing U.S. forces on schedule the only clear-cut, identifiable U.S. military goal in Bosnia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #4 - Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support. </b> President Clinton has made a habit of circumventing Congress in deciding to undertake military interventions. In non-emergency contingencies like Haiti and Bosnia, Congress should have the opportunity to vote on the merits of an intervention, not merely whether to support American troops already on the ground. Such decisions should not be made by polls; Americans traditionally are reluctant to intervene. However, when intervention is required, the President should mobilize public support (as President Bush did during the Persian Gulf War) so that American troops abroad will know that the nation and the Congress support not only the troops, but the actual goals of the operation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #5 - The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b> The U.S. armed forces must be allowed the operational freedom to create the conditions within which they can succeed. The U.S. military should never be placed in a situation where it has no control over the outcome, as was the case in both Haiti and Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, Congress can help redress the policy shortcomings of the Clinton Administration. First, it should ask the President to issue a presidential directive that establishes these five criteria for military interventions. This would add to the Administration's presidential decision directive concerning multilateral peace operations (PDD-25), which was limited to guidelines for U.S. participation in peacekeeping. Congress also should require that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain:
<p><ul>
<li><b>A prioritization</b> of national interests and national security interests;
<p>
<li><b>A listing of criteria,</b> such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions;
<P>
<li><b>A set of criteria</b> for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures such as the United Nations;<p>

<li><b>An unequivocal guarantee</b> that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and
<P>
<li><b>A declaration</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine.
</ul><P>
<b>THE NEED FOR CRITERIA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Few issues of foreign and military policy are as vexing for the policymaker as military intervention. The problem of finding reliable criteria for deciding when, where, why, and how to intervene abroad with military force is made particularly difficult by several factors. First, there is the character of the "new world disorder," a volatile and unpredictable international arena that does not lend itself to conceptual or strategic clarity. On the one hand, there is no one clear and present danger on which to base a coherent strategy; on the other hand, the many lesser threats to American interests, like those posed by such rogue states as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya, cannot be ignored. These threats are more than enough reason for maintaining forces capable of many different levels of military intervention.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second factor that complicates operating in this world disorder is a dilemma in the way Americans think about military intervention. Henry Kissinger has aptly described this dilemma and the solution that is needed:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself. Indiscriminate involvement in all the ethnic turmoil and civil wars of the post-Cold War world would drain a crusading America. Yet an America that confines itself to the refinement of its domestic virtues would, in the end, abdicate America's security and prosperity to decisions made by other societies in faraway places and over which America would progressively lose control. Not every evil can be combated by America, even less by America alone. But some monsters need to be, if not slain, at least resisted. What is most needed are criteria for selectivity.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has failed to put forth such selective criteria for military intervention: when and why it should take place, and how it should be carried out.<sup>4</sup>  Instead of offering a sensible strategy that sets strategic priorities and matches America's means to her most important foreign policy objectives, the Administration has concentrated on marginal "feel-good" operations on the periphery of U.S. national interests. While neglecting the core priorities of American foreign policy, the Administration has squandered American resources on interventions in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- military operations in which the claimed successes are both transient and easily overturned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Professor Michael Mandelbaum, a former Clinton advisor, writes that President Clinton has intervened on the periphery in "social work" at the expense of successfully managing relations with other great powers -- the core concern of U.S. foreign policy.<sup>5</sup>  Nothing demonstrates the validity of this argument better than the continued insistence of Administration officials that Bosnia is a conflict "raging at the heart of Europe."  Bosnia is indeed a European security problem, but hardly one that threatens to overwhelm the continent. It needs attention, but not the same sort of military attention given by America to Europe as a result of the hegemonic designs of Germany and the Soviet Union in the past. Americans deserve a foreign policy that is shorter on such rhetoric and longer on rational discourse about core and peripheral interests. Such discourse is needed to promote consensus and understanding about where, when, and how America should intervene.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the United States is the world's leading power, U.S. leaders must shape events and not be shaped by them. In Bosnia, however, President Clinton portrayed American leadership as a fateful burden that has painted America into a corner as the leader of the NATO implementation force (IFOR). Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke has stated that "we did not choose this as the test case.... [N]obody wanted it to happen, but that is the hand history has dealt us. The U.S. role in Europe and NATO's future and our bilateral relationships with all the major countries in Europe are all going to be determined by Bosnia."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the U.S. has no control over its own destiny in Bosnia or Europe, and leadership simply means accepting the many bad options presented by European and Administration indecisiveness. In addition, such a statement means surrendering America's right to help shape the future of Europe and instead allowing the American role in Europe to be determined by local factions in Bosnia. This is hardly leadership. America leads because of the conditions leadership engenders, conditions that are favorable to the U.S. and its allies. Leadership is a means to an end, not an end in itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By failing to lead and shape events in Bosnia, the U.S. has relegated itself to the role of medium-sized player in a peripheral European security affair. The Administration has put aside the larger questions, such as NATO's expansion, in favor of a one-year peace implementation mission in Bosnia. More important, it has tied the measure of American power and successful foreign policy in the world to insignificant operations that the President claims are "test cases" of American leadership. The danger, as one analyst has noted, is that "it is surely perilous to think of the Balkans as an 'acid test,' 'test case,' or a 'defining moment' for anything. We have already seen what devastating effect such manufactured challenges can have on Western unity."<sup>7</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States needs a military intervention policy that is consistent with America's role as the greatest power in the world today. Such a policy would be based on the need to protect and defend America's national security interests through a range of military options, including deterrence, preventive attacks, warfighting, diplomacy, and even peace operations. An intervention policy should discriminate between America's interests and how best to defend them so that America's limited military resources will be used where they are most needed and most effective and not wasted on inconsequential operations of little lasting significance. 
<p>
<b>THE INTERVENTION DEBATE</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has acted without an effective doctrine for military intervention. Clinton's national strategy of "Engagement and Enlargement," for example, offers more in the way of academic abstractions than discriminating policy guidance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This reluctance to provide useful criteria for military intervention comes on the heels of long-standing debate. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was attacked in 1984, from both the left and the right, for proposing criteria that were perceived as too restrictive. Weinberger proposed six conditions for military intervention: 
<ul><p>
<li>Vital national interests are threatened,
<p>
<li>The U.S. clearly intends to win, 
<p>
<li>The intervention has precisely defined political and military objectives,
<p>
<li>There is reasonable assurance that intervention will be supported by the American people and Congress,
<p>
<li>The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be reassessed constantly and adjusted if necessary, and
<P>
<li>The commitment of U.S. forces to combat is undertaken as a last resort.<sup>9</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Critics maintained that Weinberger's criteria were a prescription for inaction, arguing that America's military options in many cases would not be clear-cut enough to support their application. In addition to the expected attacks from the left, critics ranging from Secretary of State George Shultz to conservative commentators and <I>National Review</I> magazine claimed that the Weinberger criteria were simply unobtainable in many instances in which the U.S. would want to entertain limited military action. Newspaper columnist William Safire echoed the sentiments of many when he wrote that Weinberger would restrict the U.S. to "only the fun wars."<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
From the military's point of view, however, the Weinberger doctrine was meant to guarantee that the U.S. would not repeat the strategic mistakes of the Vietnam War and the failed Lebanese intervention of 1982-1983. In both of those cases, there was no clear intention of winning despite the sacrifices being made; there was tenuous public and congressional support; and the military and political objectives were never clearly defined, attainable, or decisive. The Vietnam syndrome was, in essence, the understandable desire on the part of America's military that their sacrifices not be in vain. As the post-Vietnam military sought to rebuild the strategic ethos, one officer wrote that "when it comes to being engaged in any undertaking where political objectives are hazy, public support only tepid, the prospects for a rapid decision remote, and the risk of substantial casualties high, service opinion is unanimous: count us out."<sup>11</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It therefore came as no surprise when General Colin Powell, who had been a young infantry officer in Vietnam, bolstered the Weinberger doctrine while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell weighed in with even more explicit guidance as to how military force should be used in interventions.<sup>12</sup>  In particular, he wished to reinvigorate the strategic link: closely matching military goals to political objectives. And, as is well known, he favored using overwhelming force to guarantee that objectives would be reached at minimum cost in American lives. This was very much the philosophy in the Gulf War, where Powell stated that his strategy left nothing to chance; the U.S. military was "not operating in the margin" and would "win decisively."<sup>13</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the resounding victory in the Persian Gulf, critics still openly questioned the utility of the Weinberger-Powell doctrines as guidelines for the use of force, especially in other-than-war military interventions such as peacekeeping. The late Congressman and Defense Secretary Les Aspin and others said that Weinberger-Powell left the policymaker with only two options: all or nothing. Aspin postulated that with the end of the zero-sum game of Cold War superpower rivalry, the U.S. should adopt a more flexible approach to military intervention. Knowing that military power was a blunt instrument, he also hoped that new military technologies (such as precision guided munitions) would help to provide the U.S. with more precise and flexible tools that could be used in limited military interventions without mobilizing public and congressional support or using overwhelming military force.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's early position on intervention was couched in light of its doctrine of "assertive multilateralism" and addressed only peace operations. The Administration hoped that U.S. military intervention could be conducted mainly through such multilateral institutions as the United Nations. However, the failure of the U.N. mission to Somalia and the shocking deaths of U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu street battles prompted President Clinton's security team to rethink their criteria for participation in U.N. operations. The result was Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD-25), a document that set intervention criteria solidly in the tradition of prudence and caution started by Caspar Weinberger. PDD-25, published in May 1994, set out eight criteria for the U.S. to consider when deciding to support a peace operation, six further restrictions for U.S. participation should American troops be involved, and an additional three if there was a strong possibility of combat.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this note of caution, however, the restrictive criteria of PDD-25 did not prevent the Clinton Administration from undertaking a peace enforcement mission in Haiti; U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti, Rwanda, and Macedonia; and the NATO peace implementation mission in Bosnia. In these interventions, the cautionary criteria of PDD-25 were ignored. Given the controversies over Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, it was obvious that there was little desire in the Administration to set criteria, let alone to comply with guidelines when they were set. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In March 1996, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake further contributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty in a speech at George Washington University in which he proposed seven broad circumstances that "may call for the use of force or our military forces."<sup>16</sup>  These circumstances included:
<p>
<ol>
<li>To defend against direct attacks on the U.S., its citizens, and its allies;
<p>
<li>To counter aggression;
<p>
<li>To defend key economic interests;
<p>
<li>To preserve, promote, and defend democracy;
<p>
<li>To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking;
<p>
<li>To maintain U.S. reliability; and
<p>
<li>For humanitarian purposes.<sup>17</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an attempt to answer "why" and "when" the U.S. might conduct a military intervention. However, Lake's list is not specific enough to serve as a useful guideline for military intervention. For instance, stating that the U.S. will use force "to counter aggression" is strategically meaningless. It assumes that aggression everywhere, large or small, may require the use of American military force. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lake's list can hardly be used to provide constructive guidance on "where" and "whether" to intervene. In addition, the question of "how" must be addressed, as it significantly affects all the other questions. Americans need a clearer set of criteria for military interventions -- which, while not necessarily identical to the Weinberger or Powell criteria, nevertheless are well within the tradition which they established. These criteria are:
<P>
<b>Criterion #1<br>
Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The essence of American statecraft today consists of being able to discriminate among competing national interests and then balance these interests against the willingness of the U.S. to defend them. Otherwise, America risks squandering its power by failing to differentiate between vital interests and others that are merely important or marginal. Without strategic priorities, the U.S. will be left rudderless in the post-Cold War era, lurching from one media-generated crisis to another and vacillating between the extremes of mindless interventionism and rigid isolationism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States today has a limited pool of resources to use for military interventions. These resources are manifested in tangible forms (for example, number of troops, carrier battle groups, or fighter wings) or intangible forms (public support, willingness to sacrifice). America must use these resources wisely, only where American action is most needed and most effective. Devising criteria for military intervention requires a methodology to establish priorities among America's interests in the world.<sup>18</sup>  It is not enough to develop a laundry list of national interests and assert that they are all equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's national interests vary not only in degree of importance, but also in the types of military interventions necessary to defend them. <b>Vital national interests</b> (a term often used but not universally understood) are interests essential to the continued existence and well-being of America as a free and prosperous nation. They also are national security interests: Threats to vital interests threaten the security of the United States. Therefore, the United States should be willing to go to war to defend these interests, and should consider all manner of military intervention in order to uphold them. In contrast to Weinberger's criteria, military force in defense of vital national interests should not necessarily be used only as a last resort; many times it will be more effective when used as a first resort. Vital national interests include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Protecting</b> America's territory, borders, and airspace;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> hostile interference by an outside power in the Western Hemisphere;
<p>
<li><b>Ensuring</b> access to foreign trade and resources; and
<p>
<li><b>Protecting</b> Americans, at home and abroad, against threats to their lives and well-being.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Important national interests</b> are those which are less than vital but important enough to warrant major diplomatic, economic, or possibly limited military intervention. This recognizes the need for more flexibility than given by the Weinberger doctrine. In the post-Cold War world, with its lesser but more nebulous threats, the U.S. must be prepared to use limited force in defense of national security interests that are not vital national interests. Important interests are are not always national security interests, however, because not all threats to the security of the U.S. can be addressed through military means. Important national interests include general stability in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, as well as promoting more open trade arrangements with Japan and China, promoting democracy and stability in areas such as the former Soviet Union, and combating terrorism and the flow of illegal drugs into America. As a rule, military intervention should be considered as a last resort in defending most of these interests. In most cases, diplomatic and economic efforts will be more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Marginal interests</b> are national interests, but rarely national security interests, and should not be high on the list of priorities that require the commitment of America's military resources. Marginal interests include political stability and economic development in many parts of the developing world, humanitarian concerns, and environmental issues. These interests also should be considered marginal from a military perspective because they tend to involve the sorts of problems that do not lend themselves to military solutions, especially when imposed by an outside force. For instance, the attempts by U.S. and U.N. military forces at coercive disarmament, political reconciliation, and nation-building in Somalia backfired. Problems of economic and political development, humanitarian crises, and environmental concerns only rarely are susceptible to a military solution. Lasting solutions to these problems most often come from within and are best supported by diplomatic or economic programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While policymakers must always weigh other considerations, such as moral and legal factors, calculations of national interest must always be their principal focus in setting priorities for military intervention. Moral considerations, media pressure, and legal prerogatives do not always give policymakers a clear sense of the value of a national interest to America and what Americans will be ready to sacrifice for that interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For instance, moral outrage and disturbing media images fueled President Bush's decision to conduct a limited humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. Moral considerations and vague internationalist ideals also drove President Clinton to continue the Somalia operation and expand its goals to include political reconciliation and nation-building. However, these moral motivations never gave either President a sense of what the Somalia effort was worth to the American people. In the end, 18 American soldiers killed on October 3, 1993, turned out to be too much for America. The result was a humiliating withdrawal because of a miscalculation over value and the threshold of national sacrifice. The Somalia episode showed the transient and ephemeral nature of national interests generated by the media or academic abstractions about the new world order. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moral umbrage, media-generated urgency, and offense taken from legal transgressions all combine to add pressure for military intervention. Naturally, the policymaker needs to consider all these factors. However, only calculations of national interest, based on the prosperity and well-being of America and her allies, can measure accurately what the American people will sacrifice to see the intervention through to a conclusion. As former National Security Council official Richard Haass writes, "the ability to sustain an intervention over time, and, more importantly, despite human and financial costs, is linked directly to the perceived importance of the interests at stake."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #2<br>
 Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.  </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. is operating with an enormous gap between its national objectives and its military means to achieve them. The gap between security commitments and actual forces is exacerbated by the fact that even the inadequate force of the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review is underfunded by some $150 billion over the next five years.<sup>20</sup>  In the meantime, while drastically cutting America's armed forces by some 35 percent, the Administration has used what is left for tangential peace operations in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia: missions where the reward for the U.S.'s military efforts are tenuous, indecisive, and easily reversible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current national security strategy ostensibly is predicated on fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts (MRCs). While President Clinton maintains that "the forces the Administration fields today are sufficient to defeat aggression in two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts,"<sup>21</sup> most experts disagree.<sup>22</sup>  More damaging is the assessment of the uniformed military, those who actually will have to carry out the Clinton strategy with inadequate resources. General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, has testified before the House National Security Committee that the service chiefs "had made no secret of the fact that we have never had the force structure that was called for... to execute the two-MRC strategy."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This strategic bankruptcy, exacerbated by military interventions in areas of marginal strategic importance, violates what the great American foreign policy thinker Walter Lippman called "the controlling principle" of strategy: that a nation should keep its goals within its means and should never make commitments without providing the resources necessary to achieve them. For the United States, this means ensuring that the shrinking military forces of the U.S. are trained, ready, and postured to defend the national security interests of the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary mission of the U.S. armed forces should be to fight and win the nation's wars, although this obviously does not mean that war is their only task. In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.<sup>24</sup> In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest). However, two critical points must instruct the wide range of possible interventions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first is common sense: Forces intervening somewhere are not available elsewhere. Nor are they training. Congressman Ike Skelton (D-MO) has noted that "peace-keeping commitments may so degrade the armed forces' warfighting capability that it will be impossible to carry out the national military strategy."<sup>25</sup>  His findings are supported by the General Accounting Office, which has found that even small combat units returning from peace operations need up to six months of recovery time to train back up to warfighting standards; larger units (such as divisions) need more.<sup>26</sup>  This means that because the Bosnian peace implementation force requires so many resources from the 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions, the U.S. Army in Europe is unable to meet the Army's standards of warfighting readiness for one to two years. It also means that the shrinking forces of the U.S. are finding it difficult to keep up with their many security commitments.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second point must always underpin American military strategy: Focus on warfighting and keep America's powder dry to protect vital security interests. Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, the Joint Chiefs' strategic planner, knows that the U.S. armed forces may be called upon to conduct many types of limited interventions in defense of less important interests. He notes that "American military power need not, and indeed, must not, be reserved for use only in cases of vital interests."<sup>28</sup>  However, it is equally true that military interventions in support of peripheral interests should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests: a perilous situation that many believe the U.S. is rapidly approaching today. As Colin Powell stated shortly before he retired,
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	we can modify our doctrine, we can modify our strategy, we can modify our structure, our equipment, our training, our leadership techniques, everything else to do these other missions, but we never want to do it in such a way that we lose sight of the focus of why you have armed forces -- to fight and win the nation's wars.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. must act like a great power and use its military forces where the American role is unique and decisive. The U.S. must concentrate its diplomatic, economic, and military efforts on its core interests: relations with other great powers and preventing major conflicts between them. For instance, America's military role in NATO is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or bloc of powers. This is a role that no other nation in the world can play. Consequently, an America with security commitments all over the world cannot be expected to play the principal military role in every local security crisis that does not threaten the basic security of the European continent.<sup>30</sup>  As Richard Haass has written, "there is little reason for U.S. involvement in peacekeeping, a mission that can be readily undertaken by the forces of many countries."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #3<br>
Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interventions must always be driven by political and military objectives that will define success or failure in an operation. More important, military objectives must support the political objective. In Vietnam, the numerous battlefield victories achieved by American and South Vietnamese forces made little difference to the political outcome of the conflict. In order to correct that incoherence in America's Vietnam strategy, the U.S. military now specifies in campaign plans exactly how military achievements will produce the political success of an operation. This is what the Weinberger doctrine meant by "winning."  For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from in and around Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task on the battlefield, the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For military objectives to contribute to the political goal of an intervention, they must be clearly defined, decisive, and attainable. In some American interventions, the military was not given a clearly defined objective whose attainment could be measured. For instance, in Lebanon in 1982-1983, the U.S. Marines in Beirut were asked to "establish a presence."  This objective was ambiguous, indecisive, and unsustainable, and made little contribution to the political goal of stabilizing Beirut and Lebanon. In Somalia, the initial mission to provide humanitarian relief was clearly defined, and the U.S. military was able to measure its success. However, the mission of nation-building could not be supported by unambiguous and conclusive military missions. As a result, the U.N. force never defined the criteria for its success in Somalia, and the military forces were left to hope that an incoherent campaign of partial disarmament and the fact of their presence would make political reconciliation possible. There was no direct connection between military goals and political objectives, only an oblique influence on political events by various military activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Working toward clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point, but it has been violated consistently by the Clinton Administration. Lacking clear military and political objectives for his military options, Clinton has fallen back on setting deadlines for troop withdrawal as the only objective that is both clearly defined and attainable. In short, Clinton has substituted time-driven objectives for event-driven objectives. This violates the profound military dictum of Clausewitz that "No one starts a war -- or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so -- without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve and how he intends to conduct it."<sup>32</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In contrast, for the Clinton Administration it is enough that an intervention endure for a certain period of time. Bosnia is case in point. The Administration has not given the military an objective the achievement of which would signal the end of the mission and the accomplishment of something important -- an exit strategy. Instead, President Clinton has offered an exit date and stated that the U.S. military effort in Bosnia will last "about a year."  Therefore, U.S. troops will pull out of Bosnia regardless of whether they achieve any other objectives. In other words, the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the [unstated] goals are fully achieved."<sup>33</sup>  Some critics have maintained that this lack of strategy is intentional because if a goal is never set, Clinton cannot be accused of not reaching it. Exit dates, in fact, are foolproof; time always marches on. Supporting the realization of the Dayton Peace Accords -- the vaguely stated goal of the mission in Bosnia -- may not be achieved, but the goal of withdrawing U.S. troops can be.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Time-driven interventions are the <I>de facto</I> strategy of this Administration because it cannot find achievable and sustainable military goals in its ill-defined and ambiguous interventions. In his March 1996 address on intervention, Anthony Lake stressed the Administration's emphasis on schedules and deadlines rather than objectives: In Haiti and Bosnia, "for these operations to succeed, tightly tailored military missions and sharp withdrawal deadlines must be the norm."  Lake has been forced to rely on deadlines and timelines because the Administration is intervening in peripheral conflicts that cannot long sustain the support of the American people and their Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the American people thought the Bosnian intervention was really as profoundly critical to the security of Europe as the Administration pretends, the effort would be worth doing for more than "about a year."  The American public has supported U.S. involvement in NATO for 47 years but is skeptical about Bosnia. This inconsistency between rhetoric and commitment illustrates the Administration's failure to measure the real value of marginal national interests. The President's pollsters know that weak public support for inconsequential interventions can be somewhat ameliorated by deadlines, regardless of mission accomplishment. They also know that if the going gets rough, they can pull out the troops and argue that nothing much was lost anyway --precisely because Americans know that no vital interests were at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a gross misuse of American military power. When the U.S. military is committed to an intervention, it must be given goals whose success can be measured clearly. If policymakers do not set clearly defined military and political objectives, they will tend to choose, as in Vietnam, plans that are politically controllable over plans that will be militarily and politically successful.<sup>34</sup>  This is the case in Bosnia. The military plan is controllable, but whether it will be successful is out of the military's hands. As a result, there is no guarantee that the year spent in Bosnia will achieve anything of note.<sup>35</sup>  Ultimately, the goal of the U.S. military is to be persuasive in peace and decisive in war. To satisfy both conditions, it needs clearly defined and decisive objectives in all interventions.
<p>
<b>Criterion #4<br>
 Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The role of Congress in foreign policy and defense today is certainly not what the framers of the U.S. Constitution intended. During the past three years, Congress has been marginalized and unable to vote on the merits of a military intervention. This condition was fostered during the Cold War and exacerbated by the necessity that the President be able to act with secrecy, expediency, and continuity of purpose. However, neither Somalia, nor Haiti, nor Bosnia represented a critical emergency or imminent threat to national security. There was time for debate about ends and means, costs and benefits, and the role of American military force in the world. Congress must reinvigorate its constitutional role by reasserting its decision-making powers concerning military intervention without infringing on the President's ability to act decisively in a crisis. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In both Haiti and Bosnia, President Clinton committed large numbers of U.S. combat forces without the approval of Congress. In fact, in both instances, the President obtained the authorization of the U.N. Security Council before asking the U.S. Congress for its support. In the debate over the Bosnian intervention, by the time Congress was prepared to vote, the vote was no longer about the value and efficacy of the intervention itself. Rather, it was about upholding a President that already had committed American troops and American prestige. Having painted Congress into a corner, the President won the vote to uphold American credibility and support American troops. Even so, the House of Representatives voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops. The Senate voted 69-30 to stand by the troops but "not endorse the President's decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, in the first months of his Administration, the President expanded the U.S. role in Somalia and pushed the United Nations to take on a more ambitious mandate. Congress never approved this plan, and when 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Mogadishu on October 3, 1993, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) led the successful effort to cut off funds for the mission and force a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from Somalia by March 1994. Not having consulted Congress before changing the nature of the Somalia intervention, President Clinton could not gauge the inherent value of the mission to Congress and the American people. Committing U.S. troops and national prestige to interventions when Congress is unsupportive and the national will is not engaged weakens American credibility abroad.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has always been tension between the Congress and the President over foreign policy, and military intervention in particular. The framers of the Constitution clearly intended both the legislative and executive branches to have a role beyond one branch's rubber-stamping the unilateral actions of the other. The system delineated by the framers was to have Congress declare war (Article I, Section 8) and the President wage war (Article II, Section 2). But since modern convention is for nations to resort to the force of arms without declaring war, this system of checks and balances has broken down. And yet, as Professor Chistopher Layne recently noted, "as the embodiment of the American people's political will, Congress has a legitimate role in deciding whether U.S. troops participate in global military interventions."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people must be involved in supporting significant military interventions, and this requires the support of Congress as well. If an intervention is not supported by the public, it can collapse after minimum resistance and a few American casualties. This is not to say that Americans are intolerant of casualties incurred in military interventions, but they will not tolerate losses in interventions that do not have clear goals and readily apparent benefits that are worth the cost in blood and treasure. As strategist Harry Summers has written, "casualties per se are not the limiting factor. It is whether those casualties are disproportionate to the value of the mission."<sup>37</sup>  This proposition is supported by a recent sociological study of public opinion during the Lebanon and Somalia interventions. The study showed that public approval of some interventions "is not conditioned by a knee-jerk reaction to casualties. Judging from the responses we have seen to Lebanon and Somalia, it is conditioned rather by the demand that casualties be incurred for some clear and worthy purpose."<sup>38</sup>  If the mission appears to be worthless, the tolerance for casualties will be low. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The decision to undertake a military intervention cannot be made by polling or by having 535 Members of Congress act as national security advisors. Traditionally, the American public and Congress are reluctant to intervene. Presidential leadership can make a significant difference in building a case for intervention, however. President George Bush worked assiduously for months to rally Congress and the public behind Operation Desert Storm. Even then, not a single member of the Democratic leadership in either the House or the Senate voted in favor of the Desert Storm resolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress and the American public should be involved in voting on the merits of any American military intervention, and it is the task of the President to seek that consensus. Only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the U.S. hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad.
<p>
<b>Criterion #5<br>
 The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should use its military forces for objectives that can be achieved decisively, and that are politically decisive as well. This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just "the big ones," as some critics charge. Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli in Libya, can have a decisive effect. However, in limited interventions, there is often the temptation to restrict military requirements because the purpose is to send a political signal. This happened in 1979 when Iran was threatening Saudi Arabia. Embarrassingly, it was revealed that the F-15s which President Carter sent to help defend Saudi Arabia were unarmed. It was an empty political signal that could have been a military disaster. If U.S. combat forces are to be used in any intervention, their operations must be completely consistent with the proven operational doctrine of the United States military. This allows the U.S. armed forces to create and control the conditions for their success, no matter how big or small the tasks and the stakes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategy is the art of using military means to achieve political ends. A coherent strategy ensures that the armed forces have objectives that, once attained, contribute directly to the desired political solution. These military objectives must be clearly defined, attainable, decisive, and consistent with military doctrine. In other words, the military should be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well-trained, and that will make a difference once attained. From a military perspective, the most sought-after strategy would be similar to that used in the Gulf War, in which President Bush formulated "clear-cut and attainable political objectives; and the armed forces achieved those objectives through rapid and decisive military action."<sup>39</sup>  While this formula is not always so easily achieved in limited military interventions, the policymaker should strive to replicate it as much as possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. military prefers rapid and decisive action because it delivers results. Not only is overwhelming force and decisive action consistent with the greatest success, but it tends to be the least costly way to fight. In any intervention, the military wants to keep the initiative. The actions of U.S. forces, not others, should dictate the pace of events and the outcome. Even in limited interventions, the use of overwhelming force helps American forces keep the initiative and create the conditions for success. It also helps minimize the casualties and costs of protracted or attritional warfare. Although this is often referred to as the "Powell Doctrine," it is in fact a classic tenet of military action. The official history of World War II notes that "the efficient commander does not seek to use just enough means but an excess of means. A military force that is just strong enough to take a position will suffer heavy casualties in doing so; a force vastly superior to the enemy's will do the job without serious loss of men."<sup>40</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many types of intervention are inherently resistant to this formula. Peacekeeping, for example, relies on the consent and cooperation of the local factions in order to succeed. The peacekeepers themselves cannot guarantee the outcome no matter how efficient their operations. It is for this reason that peacekeeping missions can carry on for 20 years on the Golan Heights, 30 years on Cyprus, or 40 years in India and Pakistan with no conclusion. This also could become the case in Bosnia, where U.S. forces have been deployed to a volatile environment without being able to create the conditions for success. Such interventions should be avoided, since they offer no control over what return can be expected from America's military sacrifices. The U.S. should not be interested in make-work military options in which a "draw" is a good result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, because the U.S. is the world's military superpower, American forces will be involved in multilateral peacekeeping or other inconclusive interventions. It is imperative that the U.S. play only a supporting role in these indecisive multilateral ventures. The U.S. should promote a sensible division of labor in multilateral operations; America is not just another power. Using U.S. leadership in this way will extend American resources and allow the U.S. to focus on those crises in which the American role can be both unique and decisive. Faced with all manner of security crises, both great and small, the U.S. should function much as the Mayo Clinic does in an unhealthy world: American combat troops should not make a house call for every case of nighttime heartburn, but instead should support local doctors as the need arises. More important, the forces of the U.S. should be committed to those illnesses that are truly consequential and for which the unique and decisive capabilities of the American military are most needed and most effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also must decide when to work under the rubric of an international organization, as part of a coalition of the willing, or on its own. As a rule, if a military intervention is worth doing, it is worth doing alone. However, operating with the support and assistance of allies can offer tremendous political and military advantages. Another factor that must be recognized is the constraints presented by international organizations. An alliance such as NATO has the political legitimacy, military authority, and practiced procedures for mounting and deploying significant military operations; an organization such as the U.N., however, is not capable of forming, directing, and employing large military forces in pursuit of ambitious objectives. It is inhibited by the constraints inherent in a 185-member voluntary organization. The U.N. has neither the legitimacy nor the authority that would allow it the resources and procedures for forming and controlling complex military operations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The more complex a military operation becomes, the more it will require a stringent, rehearsed, and reliable command and control structure that can be provided only by a practiced alliance structure or a coalition dominated by a major power. A coalition of the willing, such as that in the Persian Gulf War, can be a tremendous success as long as there is a clear unity of effort and purpose among coalition partners and a legitimate and authoritative framework for command and control. Any time U.S. combat forces are involved in coalition operations, the United States should work either as the lead nation or in a parallel command and control structure where American troops remain under U.S. command and control. U.S. troops should never be put under non-U.S. command and control structures in order to "balance" coalition forces on paper; they must always have the operational autonomy to succeed through operations based on American training and doctrine.
<p>
<b>CODIFYING A MILITARY INTERVENTION POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration and Congress should institutionalize these steps in order to provide strategically sound criteria for military intervention in the post-Cold War world. The goal should be for Congress to have some oversight over America's military interventions without usurping the President's duty to form and implement a national military strategy. The President should codify his military intervention policy in a Presidential Decision Directive similar to PDD-25, but addressing more than multilateral peace operations. Unfortunately, there is no legal recourse against a President who insists on making poor strategic decisions. However, Congress can take steps to redress this problem through the National Security Strategy. This is a presidential document required by Section 603 of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act of 1986. In this document, the President is required to lay out his national security strategy: when, where, why, and how he intends to use America's armed forces in promoting the goals of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton's National Security Strategy has failed to provide constructive criteria about America's role in the world and how the U.S. armed forces will support that role, Congress should consider an amendment to the 1997 defense authorization bill requiring the President to:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Prioritize national interests</b> and specify national security interests that the President will support through military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Stipulate the criteria</b>, such as the five listed here, that will be used to discriminate when, whether, where, and how the U.S. will undertake a military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Specify the criteria</b> used to decide when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other multilateral structures.
<p>
<b><li>State unequivocally</b> that he will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies.
<p>
<b><li>Declare</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved decisively through proven military doctrine.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention. However, by establishing workable criteria, the United States can minimize those risks or, at the very least, ensure that risks are consistent with costs. The Clinton Administration has not done well in measuring the value of its interventions and has persisted in costly and inconclusive operations on the periphery instead of focusing on America's core interests. By refusing to prioritize the value of national interests, the Administration has failed to understand the price, in magnitude and duration, that the American people are willing to pay to protect these interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategic priorities lend clarity and coherency to a national security strategy that addresses criteria for military intervention. They also help to allocate America's finite means among the many different challenges facing the U.S. today. Failing to match means to ends results in a credibility gap and severely strained forces, a condition the United States is approaching today.<sup>41</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, if a military intervention is worth undertaking, and is better than other options, it also must be accomplishable. Thus, the U.S. must set clearly defined and achievable military objectives that the armed forces can achieve through their proven operational doctrine. Empty political "signaling" that overrides military requirements for successful operations is ultimately self-defeating. Most important, the objectives U.S. military forces achieve must be able to stand alone as politically decisive; the U.S. should not be in the business of making strategic gestures that are transient and easily reversible. Intervention must achieve a goal that serves the long-term security interests of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. owes it to its armed forces to give them every conceivable advantage in any intervention. This includes giving them enough autonomy to create the conditions they will need to succeed. It also means that when working in a multilateral framework, U.S. forces should have a unique and decisive role that makes sense for a global leader with singular capabilities. Finally, by keeping Congress and the American people involved, the President can assure that the value of his objective is understood by all and that the benefits from military intervention are worth the costs in blood and treasure.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Bill Clinton has recommended that the United States give more money to institutions like the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/Welcome.html">World Bank</a>. The Clinton Administration has obligated the U.S. to contribute $800 million to one of the Bank's agencies, the International Development Agency.<sup>2</sup>  This is about $100 million more than was requested for the last fiscal year. Spending more on the World Bank ignores the overwhelming evidence that its programs have done little to promote economic growth in less developed countries. Moreover, it ignores the economic lessons of what really causes countries to develop.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since its founding in 1944, the World Bank has been involved in over 165 countries. The Bank argues that less developed countries stand little chance to prosper economically without substantial subsidized loans from the developed world. It further contends that it is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge and that it must continue to transfer capital to poor countries.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is wrong. The data show that most long-term recipients of World Bank money are no better off today then they were when they received their first loan. Many are actually worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for more than 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans.
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, most (20 in all) actually are poorer today than they were before receiving aid from the Bank.
</ul> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Former less developed countries that have prospered over the past 30 years did so by freeing up the productive forces of their economies. The best examples are Hong Kong and Singapore. Even though a country like Singapore received a small amount of money from the World Bank, the evidence shows that what most effected economic growth was not World Bank aid, but economic freedom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress would do well to take a critical look at the World Bank's history and programs. If it does, it will find that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Rather than let the Bank try to reform itself, as it claims it has tried repeatedly to do in the past, the U.S. should withdraw financial support altogether. Specifically, the U.S. Congress should:
<ul><li>
<b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank.</b> Last year the U.S. paid $1.2 billion to the World Bank. In addition, the U.S. has pledged some $28 billion to the World Bank that has not been disbursed. However, the Bank can call on the U.S. at any time to disburse funds up to this amount. While it would be best to end any future liabilities by terminating all World Bank funding immediately, at the very least Congress should begin to phase out funding for the Bank by cutting this year's budget request to no more than 50 percent of the current level. All funding should be terminated by 2002.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) long has analyzed the effectiveness of such foreign aid programs. A new study should be commissioned to analyze the effectiveness of current World Bank lending practices.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> The World Bank is a highly secretive organization, which blocks the ability of outsiders to monitor its effectiveness. Congress should make further funding contingent on the full release of World Bank records and information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide it with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank loans and grants.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT IS THE WORLD BANK?</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Officially named the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank was founded in 1944 by the 44 nations that met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new post-war international economic system. Today, the Bank has 178 members; only 12 nations are not members. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some $53 billion since 1944.<sup>3</sup>  Even though the U.S. has reduced its funding as a percentage of the Bank's total deposits from 29.3 percent in 1965 to 17.5 percent in 1995, it remains the Bank's largest donor and has pledged more money to the Bank than any other country.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
World Bank members provide contributions based on the size of their economies. The larger and wealthier the economy, the more the country is likely to give. A country's voting power is based on the amount of its contributions. Since the U.S. is the biggest donor, it therefore has the most voting power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is governed by several bodies. These are:
<p><ol>
<b><li> The Board of Governors.</b> Overall authority resides with a president and a board of governors. The board includes one individual from each member country. It meets annually to receive a report on financial matters from the executive directors, an elected group of 25 representatives from the Bank's total membership. The board also reviews any other matters that the executive directors present to it.
<P>
<b><li> Executive Directors.</b> General operations are overseen by a 25-member group of executive directors: one representative from each of the five largest donors (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Britain) and 20 elected by the remaining 174 donor countries. This group reviews loan proposals submitted by the president of the Bank and has the final authority to approve or decline a loan.
<p>
<b><li> The President.</b> The president of the World Bank is appointed by the executive directors, typically for a five-year term. Though no written article requires it, traditionally the president is an American. The current president, James D. Wolfensohn, formerly an international investment banker, was appointed to a five-year term on June 1, 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Arms of the World Bank.</b> There are several institutions that make up the World Bank, each with a unique mission. Throughout its 50-year history, members of the Bank have created many arms, known collectively as "the World Bank Group."<sup>5</sup>  These are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Each has its own mission and goals.
<p><ol>
<b><li> The International Finance Corporation (IFC).</b> The Bank established the IFC in 1956 to provide loan guarantees and subsidized loans to businesses in less developed countries. These loans, usually long-term, are focused on equity investment (like stock markets) and similar lending. Interest rates are supposed to be the going market rates, which vary between countries and with the proposed project. Maturity on the loans is generally 13 years, with a grace period of up to eight years. Some 80 percent of the funding is borrowed by the Bank from international financial markets and through public bond issues. The rest is borrowed from the IBRD. Each year, the IFC approves some $4 billion to $5 billion in new financing.<sup>6</sup>  In 1995, the U.S. contributed $36 million to the IFC.
<p>
<b><li>The International Development Association (IDA).</b> The Bank established the IDA in 1960 to provide assistance to poor countries that cannot afford to borrow money from the IBRD. The funds are provided separately by donor nations and through IBRD investment profits. Two types of loans have been offered through this branch of the Bank: IDA credits and Special Fund credits. The IDA no longer makes Special Fund credits, but many are still in effect. Special Fund credits were granted with a 50-year maturity and a 10-year grace period during which no interest was applied. The interest rate on these credits is merely 0.75 percent. IDA credits are now the IDA's sole lending vehicle. They have the same service charge as was applied to the Special Fund credits. They also have the same 10-year grace period, but a shorter maturity of 35 or 40 years.
<p>
The United States also is the largest shareholder in the IDA, holding some 15 percent of the total votes in 1995. The U.S. has contributed some $21 billion since 1960,<sup>7</sup> and contributed $1.1 billion in FY 1995 alone.
<p>
<b><li> The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).</b> The Bank established the ICSID in 1966 to promote an increased flow of international investment to areas of the world where foreign investors chose not to invest. The ICSID arbitrates disputes, helps put countries seeking investment in touch with investors, and provides advice, analysis, and studies on investment opportunities around the world.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b><li> The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).</b> The Bank established MIGA in 1988 to remove some of the risk for investors investing in poor countries. MIGA provides investors with guarantees on many types of investments. It also provides governments with advice on improving their investment climate to attract more foreign investment. MIGA may insure up to 90 percent of an investment, with a current limit of $50 million per project. In 1995, it guaranteed some $672 million in investments and had another $210 million in outstanding credits.<sup>9</sup>  The U.S. contributed $22 million to MIGA in 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>How the World Bank Makes Loans and Grants.</b> Each year the Bank considers many loans. Though loan proposals officially are submitted by the president of the Bank to the executive directors, in reality the executive directors often work with the president's staff to develop proposals. Thus, the approval process is often merely a formality. The United States has no veto power over Bank loans, and the Bank frequently approves loans that the U.S. has opposed.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bank's funds are derived from country contributions and from investments the Bank makes in financial markets. The Bank sells bonds and other debt securities to pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, other banks, and individual investors. Its original source of income is contributions by member countries. Countries receiving loans are charged an interest rate, currently 7.27 percent. This rate is adjusted every six months. Maturity on the loans is generally from 15 to 20 years, with a five-year grace period.
<p>
<b>HISTORY OF THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank has undergone a major transformation since it started in 1944. The Bank claims it has kept up with change to deal with the new challenges facing less developed countries. This contention is debatable, but it is true that the fundamental mission today is substantially different from what it was in 1944.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Lender of Last Resort.</b> In the beginning, the Bank's primary mission was to loan money to the war-ravaged countries of Western Europe and Japan to help them get on their feet after World War II. These loans were intended to help rebuild roads, bridges, electrical plants, and other public facilities and enterprises.<sup>11</sup>  Japan and the European countries would use World Bank loans when private bank loans were not forthcoming. Many private commercial banks refused to lend these nations money because they were bad risks, some of them having defaulted on World War I and post-World War I debts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1944 to the mid-1950s, most World Bank loans went to the developed countries in Europe that had suffered extensive damage in World War II. Therefore, even though the Bank loaned some $543 million for the reconstruction of Europe, the money was absorbed by countries that essentially were advanced developed economies with strong economic foundations in banking, property rights protection, the rule of law, functioning courts, and borders open to foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because these countries already had the basic building blocks of an advanced economy, they were able to put the World Bank loans to productive use. Yet U.S. private investment in post-war Europe played a larger role in reconstruction than the World Bank. The World Bank loaned Western European countries $543 million from 1945-1950, while U.S. private investment was $1.76 billion for the same period.<sup>12</sup>  Therein lies the real success story of Europe's recovery. While it is true that funding from the World Bank, other financial institutions, and the Marshall Plan helped rebuild war-torn Europe, the biggest impact on Europe's economic recovery came from private foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An International Welfare Agency.</b> By the late 1950s, it became clear that the World Bank had served its purpose. Europe and Japan were well on their way to recovering from World War II. Private foreign investment was pouring into these regions to take advantage of their renewed economic strength. America realized its economic dominance in the world as U.S. investment flowed abroad to fuel economic development and growth. At this time, the Bank faced a fundamental choice: It could dissolve because its major goal had been met, or it could evolve into something not imagined by its creators.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eventually, the World bank decided on the second course. By the mid-1960s, the Bank began to transform itself from a lender of last resort to an international welfare agency to assist the poor and less developed countries of the world. In 1960, for example, the Bank created the International Development Agency (IDA), which makes subsidized loans to poor countries either unable to afford private commercial loans or regarded as bad credit risks. Even though the original mission statement made casual reference to the "less developed" world, the Bank's founders largely had envisioned this as purely advisory. Yet the Bank began to give more than advice to less developed countries; in the 1960s, it began to give them substantial loans. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>McNamara's Brainchild.</b> The mastermind of this transformation was former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who took charge of the World Bank in 1968. To fund McNamara's new international welfare clearinghouse, the Bank had to seek ever-increasing levels of contributions from donor countries. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also under McNamara's watch, the Bank formulated a new concept, called "sustainable development," that became the IDA's principal mission. Stated simply, this means that less developed countries can achieve sustainable levels of economic development only if enough resources are transferred from wealthy countries to poor countries. If loans are any measure of success, McNamara was "successful" indeed. By 1981, when McNamara resigned as president of the World Bank, lending had grown more than tenfold, from $883 million to $12 billion. World Bank lending and grants continue to grow, today totaling over $20 billion.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The World Bank remains fully committed to this kind of thinking, with most of its bureaucrats dedicated to the McNamara dogma. A book published in 1995 by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to commemorate their 50-year anniversary claims that "This institutional evolution has been matched by a changing approach to development. The early focus on discrete projects has evolved into a broader emphasis on policies, strategies, and institutions, and a more holistic approach to development.... [The World Bank] Group's primary concern is to help borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>14</sup>  In other words, the World Bank is not the institution created in 1944 by the Bretton Woods Agreement; it has changed from lender of last resort to international welfare agency.
<p>
<b>DECADES OF FAILED POLICIES</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While many of the Bank's economists are free to acknowledge the importance of macroeconomic reform in the recipe for economic growth, many of the Bank's officials continue to place too much emphasis on the importance of multilateral institutions to less developed countries. For example, former World Bank President Lewis T. Preston said in 1995: "Of fundamental importance, the Bank Group has evolved from being simply a financier of development to being also a trusted advisor on development, sharing its global experience of what does and does not work and helping its member countries to apply the lessons.... Fifty years of experience have validated the Bank Group's fundamental objective today: helping borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, the Bank seems to claim not only that it has been successful at reducing poverty and improving living standards in less developed countries, but also that its continued existence is vital to the economic prospects of less developed countries in the future. Yet all the evidence shows that this is not true. Since its inception, the World Bank has provided over $356 billion to countries around the world, mostly to the less developed world.<sup>16</sup>  But most recipients are no better off today than they were before receiving such aid. In fact, many are worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for at least 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are worse off today than they were before receiving aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<p>

<li>Of these 20, eight have economies that have shrunk by at least 20 percent since their first World Bank loan (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>); and<p>

<li>The remaining 17 countries have economies today that are essentially the same as when they first received aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While many countries are no better off today than before they received money from the World Bank, some have performed particularly poorly.
<ul>
<li>From 1965 to 1995, Nicaragua received over $637 million in World Bank aid. Its per capita gross domestic product in 1965, measured in constant 1987 U.S. dollars, was $1,752. Today it is only $875, some 50 percent less than before Nicaragua received any aid.
<p>
<li>The African country of Niger received over $589 million in World Bank aid from 1965 to 1995. Yet its per capita GDP has shrunk by 54 percent, from $605 in 1965 to $280 today.
The evidence shows that the World Bank has a poor track record. One might expect that at least half of its recipients would be better off economically today then before they started receiving such aid, but this is not the case. Many are actually worse off. After nearly three decades, it seems clear that most long-term recipients of World Bank loans still are not achieving "sustainable development."
</ul><p>
<b>WHY WORLD BANK PROGRAMS FAIL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The main reason for a lack of economic growth in these countries is a corresponding lack of economic freedom. A lack of economic freedom prevents countries from creating wealth and prosperity, and a recent worldwide survey of economic freedom finds that many World Bank recipients have economies that are mostly not free or repressed. <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, published by The Heritage Foundation, analyzes the level of economic freedom in 142 countries.<sup>18</sup>  The study considers ten economic factors -- trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, wage and price controls, private property rights, regulation, and black markets -- and categorizes each country as having a "free," "mostly free," "mostly not free," or "repressed" economy. The findings of the study demonstrate that a majority of World Bank loan and grant recipients do not have significant levels of economic freedom:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 60 long-term recipients of World Bank aid that were graded in <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, 37 have economies that are "mostly not free" or "repressed" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li>Only 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid have economies that are "mostly free," and none have economies that are "free" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, most long-term recipients of World Bank loans and grants still do not have significant levels of economic freedom. Moreover, those recipients that have performed particularly poorly are the least economically free:
<p><ul>
<li>he 18 countries whose economies have shrunk since they have been World Bank recipients, 16 have either "mostly not free" or "repressed" economies (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economic prosperity is not forthcoming in these countries because they do not have economic freedom. Rather, most have high taxes, barriers to trade, restrictions on foreign investment, banking systems in disarray, onerous government regulations, bad monetary policies, extensive wage and price controls, and large black markets. To be sure, 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid do have mostly free economies, but most of these are in Latin America, an area which has benefited from several years of economic reform. Thus, their categorization as having mostly free economies is a recent phenomenon.<sup>19</sup>  It is good that they are making progress, but given the evidence elsewhere in the world, it would be difficult to attribute this progress to help from the World Bank.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE: MODELS OF GROWTH WITHOUT WORLD BANK AID</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The poor record of the World Bank in delivering on its promise of economic development can be demonstrated not only by listing its many failures, but also by examining some development successes that occurred without the Bank's help. Hong Kong and Singapore are the most successful of the so-called Asian Tigers, running up phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. They did this largely without loans from the World Bank. Even though they were as poor 30 years ago as other countries that took World Bank aid, they eschewed World Bank loans and embarked instead on successful programs of economic liberalization. The evidence shows that there is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries enjoy and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years. Of one thing there can be absolutely no doubt: World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen during this 30-year period.
<p>
<b>Hong Kong </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the 1960s, the U.S. foreign aid community and international lending institutions like the World Bank decided that the East Asian region was barren of economic promise and that they should focus their aid on Africa instead. Hong Kong received no aid from the World Bank and only a small amount in U.S. foreign aid -- $43 million, most of which was cut off after 1965. The World Bank admitted that many economists misjudged the economic prospect in Asia. In the commemorative volume marking the Bank's 50th anniversary, the authors state: "In the 1960s, many economists were more optimistic about sub-Saharan Africa than East Asia. Yet, East Asia proved to be the 'miracle' of the developing world -- and sub-Saharan Africa its most daunting challenge."<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While eschewing foreign aid after 1965, Hong Kong at the same time began a massive economic liberalization program. This included reforms in many sectors, including banking and financial services, government regulation of business, and foreign investment laws. Among the most important of these reforms was lowering barriers to international trade and making Hong Kong's trade laws consistent with international standards. The government eliminated virtually all tariffs, duties, licensing requirements, and other import barriers. It also set up export processing zones, or "free trade areas," that allowed manufacturers to cut through red tape to sell their products overseas.<sup>21</sup>  These reforms enabled Hong Kong to create a large export industry which provided much of the fuel for Hong Kong's economic growth.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another critically important reform took place when Hong Kong established a tax structure that allows individuals and businesses to keep most of the wealth they create. For example, Hong Kong has a flat tax of 20 percent on incomes over $155,000. The worker making the average income of about $22,500 is taxed only 2 percent. Hong Kong's corporate tax rate is a flat 16.5 percent, compared to 35 percent in the U.S.<sup>22</sup>  These and other economic reforms helped turn Hong Kong into the economic powerhouse it is today.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

After these economic reforms were in place, Hong Kong's economy indeed took off. GDP increased 9.2 percent a year from 1970 to 1980. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.5 percent.<sup>23</sup>  Overall, over the past 35 years, Hong Kong's per capita GDP has grown an astonishing 530 percent, with most of this growth occurring since the beginning of economic liberalization.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
<b>Singapore </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Singapore also exhibited little economic promise in the early 1960s, according to the economic forecasts of the day. In fact, it was often referred to as "Asia's Cuba."<sup>25</sup>  The World Bank gave most of its loans to Singapore -- some $93 million -- before 1970. Singapore received its last World Bank loan in 1975.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As World Bank loans were drying up, Singapore, like Hong Kong, embarked on a course of economic liberalization -- with the same stunning results. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, Singapore instituted a series of economic reforms aimed at achieving two major goals. The first was to promote increased foreign investment and higher levels of exports. To this end, Singapore opened its market to foreign investors. By 1970, some 80 to 90 percent of all manufactured exports were derived from foreign investment.<sup>26</sup>  Why did foreign investment pour into Singapore?  There are many reasons. One surely was that Singapore's legal system, based in British common law, provided rule of law, an efficient legal system, and a way for investors to achieve protection of their investments through contracts. Equally important was the fact that Singapore established a foreign investment code, free of local content or production restrictions, that guaranteed equal treatment under the law for both domestic and foreign firms.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second goal was to reform Singapore's tax system. Singapore adopted a tax system that reduced the burden on most of the people. For example, while the top tax rate is 30 percent, the tax on the average income level of $21,000 is little or none. In fact, the average Singapore worker must make almost $30,000 before paying taxes. For that first tax bracket, the rate is 19 percent.<sup>27</sup>  In addition, Singapore resisted the implementation of onerous business regulations; abolished trade restrictions on imports (the average tariff rate now is about 0.4 percent, compared to 3.3 percent in the U.S.); and has kept inflation below 3 percent a year since the mid-1970s.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These economic reforms helped increase Singapore's gross domestic product. From 1970 to 1980, GDP increased by 8.3 percent a year. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.9 percent. Overall, Singapore's gross national product has increased by over 6 percent a year since 1965.<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved the highest levels of economic prosperity to be found anywhere among the world's recently developed countries. In fact, they have achieved phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. The evidence suggests that their policies of economic freedom are the principal reason for this success. There is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries have achieved and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years.<sup>29</sup>  There is also a direct correlation between this growth and a lack of aid from the World Bank. World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen over the past 30 years (see <a href="bg1082c1.gif">Chart 1</a>):
<p>
<b>PHASING OUT SUPPORT FOR THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The facts show that the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. The facts also show that countries which adopt free market economic reforms can develop without aid from the World Bank or any other institution. Promises by the World Bank to reform have made little difference. The U.S. therefore should begin withdrawing its financial support. Specifically, Congress should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank. </b>Ideally, the U.S. Congress would refuse immediately to appropriate any more money to the World Bank. But with current political realities, this approach seems unlikely. Therefore, the most workable approach would be for Congress to phase out U.S. funding over seven years. In the event the Clinton Administration refuses to sign onto a seven-year balanced budget, Congress then should seek to withdraw funding through the appropriations process.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The General Accounting Office (GAO) long has performed intensive analyses of such programs as foreign aid. Many of these audits have concluded that much of the U.S. foreign aid program is fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse; in some cases, these audits have discovered that programs simply do not work. The last GAO report dealing specifically with the World Bank, published in 1994, found that most of the Bank's reforms have failed to make it more efficient and effective.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should call on the GAO to launch a new study of the effectiveness of World Bank lending, to focus on:
<p>
<b>1)</b> The economic performance of recipients of World Bank aid;
<p>
<b>2)</b> The effectiveness and efficiency of World Bank programs in meeting their stated goals;
<p>
<b>3)</b> The influence the World Bank has on encouraging recipient countries to adopt specific economic policies; and
<p>
<b>4)</b> Conducting an audit of the World Bank's financial records.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> It is difficult to obtain detailed information on the recipients of World Bank loans, the conditions imposed on loan recipients, and the number and amount of loans in default. While the World Bank is an international organization, it is partly funded by the American taxpayer, who has a right to know how the money is being spent. The American public and Congress should have access to all of the Bank's financial records and information. As long as Congress continues to appropriate money for the World Bank, it should make that funding contingent on free and open access to World Bank information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> While the World Bank continues to lend money to countries with little chance of growing economically, there is no accounting of the economic conditions in many of these countries. Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide Congress with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank funding. Specifically, the report should include information on the level of economic freedom that exists in the following areas: trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, regulation, wage and price controls, and property rights.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since 1944, the World Bank has spent $346 billion trying to advance economic development around the world, and not all of this money has been repaid. While it played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, the World Bank has drifted away from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. Most recipients of loans and grants are no better off today than when they first received them. In fact, many are worse off.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. But while recipients of World Bank loans continue to wallow in poverty, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore continue to experience unprecedented growth. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is overwhelming evidence to show the futility of such aid, the U.S. continues to support this failed institution, providing over $50 billion to the Bank in 1995, including both monetary allocations and commitments. American policymakers should admit this failure and begin phasing out U.S. financial support for the World Bank over seven years. Not only will billions in U.S. taxpayer dollars be saved, but countries in the less developed world may be able finally to break the economic chains that have kept them impoverished.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using distressing stories of laid-off workers, decreasing paychecks, and increasing income inequality, some politicians and journalists have been painting a picture of economic gloom and doom in America. At the same time, the economy exhibits increasing employment, low inflation, and growth. Still, while the economy appears to be doing well, many Americans see themselves as struggling to make ends meet and feel they are worse off than their parents were a generation ago. This raises the obvious question: Are middle-income and low-income workers falling farther behind, or is the standard of living increasing for most Americans?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has really been happening to wages, profits, and incomes in recent decades?
<p><ul>
<li>There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living. In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise.
<p>
<li>There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, the employees' share of a growing economy remains fairly constant.
<p>
<li>The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of "corporate greed."  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity, caused in part by the growth of government taxes and regulations on business and investment. Higher taxes also are taking an ever-larger bite out of personal income, leaving a smaller and smaller share for individuals to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
<li>Although the income difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men and women have seen their real earnings increase. Studies suggest the increasing divergence in the earnings of high-wage and low-wage workers is due primarily to an acceleration in the rate of technological change favoring those with higher skills, changes in the composition of the workforce, and a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries. Increased trade and the number of low-skilled immigrants, however, have had only a small effect on wage patterns.
<p>
<li>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people, stuck in the same jobs over time, is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. In America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement.
</ul> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are falling, the middle class is moving down instead of up, and corporate profits are rising at the expense of workers. But like so many other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong. The truth is that most workers are better off today because their real earnings are increasing and their standard of living continues to rise. Both corporate profits and labor compensation are growing, and although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, the U.S. economy remains dynamic and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates and government programs, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.
<p>

<b>HOW COMPENSATION INCREASES WHILE WAGE GROWTH STAGNATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase.<sup>2</sup>  The reason for this is that workers are taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free benefits than ever before.<sup>3</sup>  Hourly wages do not account for the increasing tendency of employees to receive their "pay" in the form of untaxed fringe benefits.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, hourly wage data are limited as to the types of employees they cover, further understating actual wage growth.<sup>5</sup>  Real compensation thus is a more accurate measure of the "pay" American workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and pension payments, as well as cash.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates, total compensation has increased even when average wages have declined. From 1959 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>6</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, real hourly compensation increased an average of 0.4 percent per year. The problem is not that the average cash wage has declined, but that total "pay" has grown more slowly since 1973. The reason: a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the proliferation of government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes, all of which reduce the net value of a worker's output, which leads in turn to a slowdown in compensation.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most of the growth in real compensation since 1986 can be attributed to the fact that benefits have increased faster than cash wages (see <a href="fyi97c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real wage growth as measured by the Employment Cost Index has stagnated since 1986, sharply rising benefits have increased total compensation by 1.9 percent.<sup>8</sup>  Between 1981 and 1995, real employee benefits have increased 26.8 percent as workers have continued to demand more of their total pay in the form of tax-free benefits, and the cost of providing those benefits has increased.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While real compensation for most Americans has increased, workers correctly believe that they should be better off today than they are. Tax increases in the 1990s deprived them of a higher standard of living by undercutting the economy's rate of growth, undercutting productivity gains, and holding back pay increases.<sup>9</sup>  If workers and businesses were not burdened with large tax and regulatory increases, total compensation and real take-home pay would be higher.
<p>
<b>HIGHER PROFITS BENEFIT WORKERS, FALLING PROFITS LIMIT COMPENSATION GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular assumption that rising corporate profits and the record high stock market have come at the expense of workers.<sup>10</sup>  <I>The Washington Post</I> was correct when it editorialized: "[Secretary of Labor Robert Reich] charges that the productivity improvements are going disproportionately to corporations. That's not the real explanation. While corporate profits, as a share of total economic output, are slightly higher than in the late 1980s, they remain lower than in the 1970s. The causes of the country's poor wage performance lie elsewhere."<sup>11</sup>  Those causes also do not include the trade deficit or immigration, both of which increased during the 1980s at the same time labor compensation increased significantly.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, labor's share of a growing economy remains fairly constant (see <a href="fyi97c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). The share of national income going to corporate profits declined in a seesaw fashion from 14.1 percent in 1965 to a post-World War II low of 6.0 percent in 1982. Workers' share of national income, however, rose from 68.1 percent in 1965 to 74.2 percent in 1970 and has remained relatively stable ever since.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together (see <a href="fyi97c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). When corporate profits declined in 1974, labor compensation declined too. When corporate profits declined from 1979 to 1982, compensation failed to increase. Corporate profits resumed their increase in 1983, and labor compensation followed suit, increasing by 23.3 percent from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991, the growth of corporate profits declined and labor compensation stagnated; when corporate profits began to increase again in 1992, however, so did labor compensation.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Higher profits also benefit workers because they are shareholders. Sixty-four percent of all workers are employed by companies with pension plans, and 50 percent of all workers participate in those plans.<sup>12</sup>  Nineteen percent of all workers also have their own individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Real labor compensation has risen $340 billion (in 1992 dollars) between 1991 and 1995, and corporate profits have increased $152 billion over the same period. Moreover, the fixed-pie assertion that a higher level of after-tax profits means less income available for labor compensation or tax revenue for the government is simply wrong. The problem is that the share of national income taken by all levels of government has increased from 32 percent in 1965 to 39 percent in 1994.<sup>13</sup>  This leaves a steadily smaller share for private citizens to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
	
<b>WAGE AND INCOME DIFFERENCES HAVE INCREASED</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wage growth and wage differences are two distinct concepts,<sup>14</sup> but they interact to shape a worker's sense of well-being. If all real wages increase, everyone is better off, even if there is a widening difference in earnings. On the other hand, if average real wages stagnate while wage differences are growing, low-wage workers as a group may become poorer as the rich grow richer.<sup>15</sup>  In the case of the United States, the former pattern holds true: The standard of living for most Americans actually continues to rise, even though both wage and income differences have widened.<sup>16</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  Studies suggest that there are several reasons for widening wage differences. The accelerated rate of technological change, for example, favors those with higher skills. Also, changes in the composition of the workforce -- including a slowdown in the relative growth rate of college graduates and the increasing labor force attachment of women -- lead to a divergence of incomes. And there has been a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries (such as lower paying services replacing higher paying manufacturing).<sup>17</sup>  The increase in low-skilled immigrants (both legal and otherwise) and trade, however, had only a small effect on wage patterns in the 1980s.<sup>18</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1973, income differences among families also have grown because of the sharp rise in the proportion of Americans who live in families with no male workers, growing differences in earnings among men, and the increasing likelihood that in a traditional family both husband and wife will be working.<sup>19</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of a family makes a difference. Census Bureau income data collected according to the presence of children show that while families with no children experienced a 36 percent increase in real median income over the past 25 years, families with one or two children did considerably less than half that well. The real median income of families with more than three children declined over the same period.<sup>20</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men saw their real earnings rise 5 percent or more from 1979 to 1989, and a large majority of women (76 percent) saw their earnings increase.21  Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and reforms that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities for Americans by, for example, improving basic education and encouraging more investment.
<p>
<b>MORE AMERICANS ARE MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The comparison of average incomes by group would be meaningful only if America were a caste society in which the people comprising one group remained constant. This is one reason why Americans with modest incomes tend to resist "soak the rich" class warfare arguments: They hope to be rich one day themselves. Further, average wage statistics are affected by economic changes that do not adversely affect most American workers.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, there was considerable upward mobility for those in the lower-income and middle-income groups.<sup>23</sup>  For example, from 1979 to 1988, the income of 85.8 percent of workers in the lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher-income group.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Income mobility is important, but the direction of that mobility is more important. Needless to say, some people move up while others are moving down (see <a href="fyi97c5.gif">Chart 5</a>). But in America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement. From 1979 to 1988, the income of 60.1 percent of workers in the second-lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher income group, and 47.3 percent of workers in the middle group had moved up.<sup>25</sup>  Over the same period, much smaller percentages of workers were moving down: only 10.9 percent of the second-lowest group and 19.7 percent of the middle group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility of moving down increases as incomes rise, while the probability that low-wage workers will move up is much greater for those in the lowest quintile. Moreover, a worker in the lowest income group was more likely to have moved into the top income group by 1988 than to have remained in the bottom group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>26</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers earn 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>27</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. economy, while not without problems, thus remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans in the bottom income groups to work their way up the economic ladder. What is needed is policies to ensure that the opportunity for advancement is extended as widely as possible.
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS: MORE EQUALITY AND LESS GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concern about stagnating wages and increasing income inequality has some politicians looking to Europe for solutions. But proponents of government actions to "alleviate inequality" would do well to ponder the anemic job growth in Europe. European firms are encumbered with costly mandates and taxes that have discouraged hiring and held back employment growth,<sup>28</sup> so while incomes are more equal in Europe, this equality comes with a very high price in terms of economic growth, new jobs, and inflation.
<P><ul>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. economy has grown an average of 2.9 percent per year, compared with 2.3 percent in the European Union.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Between 1970 and 1992, employment increased in the United States by 49 percent, compared with only 9 percent in the European Community.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>Europe's employment rate (the proportion of its population of working age that is working) is the lowest of any industrialized part of the world. Moreover, it has fallen over the past two decades. The employment rate in the United States, which started in 1970 at a level similar to the European Community's, has grown in two decades to its current level of around 70 percent.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. unemployment rate averaged 6.9 percent per year, compared with 9.9 percent in the European Union.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, consumer prices in the U.S. rose an average of 3.7 percent per year, compared with 5.1 percent in the European Union.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>Although wage differences between low-income and middle-income workers are much higher in the United States than in Europe, the relative differences between middle-income and high-income workers are the same.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Europe is now realizing that its existing collective bargaining, tax, and labor cost arrangements do not create more jobs; instead, they cause gains from economic growth to be absorbed mainly by those already employed. European Community member states are seeking to remove obstacles to employment growth by adjusting employer taxes, the idea being to make more jobs available to the relatively less-skilled by reducing the cost to employers. They also are lowering the relative cost of labor with respect to other factors of production -- for example, by reducing the employers' social security contributions. These are precisely the types of policies that should be adopted in the United States instead of more mandates and labor market restrictions.
<p>
<b>TAXES AND MANDATES LIMIT TAKE-HOME PAY AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Real compensation and benefits are important, but take-home pay is what matters most to workers.<sup>35</sup>  The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of corporate greed or trade deficits.<sup>36</sup>  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the expansion of government regulation, which in turn reduces the net value of workers' output and contributes to slower wage growth.<sup>37</sup>  Further, an ever-larger share of workers' total pay (wages and benefits) is beyond their control, consumed by mandated benefits and taxes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c6.gif">Chart 6</a> illustrates, productivity growth has slowed since 1973, leading to reductions in the growth of workers' pay. From 1959 to 1973, productivity increased an average of 3.2 percent per year, and real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>38</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, however, productivity growth slowed to an average of 1.3 percent per year, and real hourly compensation growth increased an average of 0.4 percent per year.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government taxes and fees at all levels are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (see <a href="fyi97c7.gif">Chart 7</a>). Although personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person at all levels increased 155 percent over the same period. In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every man, woman, and child.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Several studies also point to the job-destroying effect of the regulatory and mandate explosion in recent years.<sup>39</sup>  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>There are at least 3 million fewer jobs in the American economy today because of the growth of regulation over the last 20 years.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
<li>A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone had caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than it otherwise would have been.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1994, legally required benefits<sup>42</sup> accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>43</sup>  These mandated benefits are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, 88 percent of the cost of all legally required benefits or payroll taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to employers and workers of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.<sup>45</sup>  One study has estimated that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<sup>46</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Up to a certain point, government functions enhance economic well-being. Beyond that point, however, the burden of excessive government reduces economic growth.<sup>47</sup>  Employers and workers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and high taxes on labor and capital. This increasing drag on economic freedom has slowed growth, job creation, and wage gains. Government must roll back taxes, reduce the regulatory burden, and balance the budget to unshackle the economy and increase the real wages of all American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Like most other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States remains a nation of extraordinary opportunity and mobility. The real wages of high-income, middle-income, and low-income workers do not come at the expense of each other; they rise and fall together. The U.S. economy remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not more government programs, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage; it is policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and slow productivity growth. Only by correcting these problems can we increase job opportunities and real wages for all Americans.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two key advisory boards for the Medicare program, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), have joined in the calls for Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending.  The annual reports of both official panels also shed light on the deficiencies in Medicare's complex system of price controls.  In the case of PROPAC, there is a clear acknowledgment that the "dynamic process" works by shifting the rising costs of the Medicare program over to workers and their families in the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1983, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) advises Members of Congress and the Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and other medical facilities.  Created by Congress in 1985, the Physician Payment Review Commission was charged with advising Congress on physician payment reform, and later with advising Congress on Medicare fee schedules for doctors.  It also examines the related issues of patient access, utilization, and assignment policies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In practice, PROPAC's main responsibility is to advise Congress on how to regulate hospital rates under the Prospective Payment System (PPS), Medicare's hospital fee schedule; the PPS is essentially a complicated price control system.<sup>1</sup>  PROPAC currently is chaired by Stuart H.  Altman, Ph.D., a professor of health care policy at Brandeis University and formerly a key adviser on health care policy to President Clinton.<sup>2</sup>  The PPRC's main responsibility is giving advice to Congress on regulating the Medicare fees of doctors, in particular the administration of Medicare's Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),<sup>3</sup> in conjunction with standards governing the volume of medical services and limitations on billing.  The PPRC is chaired by Gail Wilensky, Ph.D., of Project Hope, formerly the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) under President George Bush.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its most recent report,<sup>4</sup> PROPAC outlines 26 separate recommendations governing various aspects of hospital payment and other features of the Medicare program.  Most of these are technical and include detailed recommendations concerning payment schedules.  The PPRC's 401-page report also makes numerous technical recommendations on various aspects of Medicare reimbursements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But more significant are the panels' recommendations on general Medicare reform.  These recommendations touch on Medicare's fundamental structure and financing, as well as the growth in overall Medicare spending.  Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Both panels emphasizes the urgent need to control Medicare spending,</b> and PROPAC notes that despite partisan rhetoric, the White House and Congress are quite close in their targets for spending control;
<p>
<li><b>Both call for giving beneficiaries more choices;</b>
<p>
<li><b>Neither panel opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs)</b>, in contrast with the White House; and
<p>
<li><b>Both panels note the limitations and heavy costs</b> associated with today's Medicare price controls.
</ul><p>

<b>WHAT THE PANELS SAY ABOUT REFORM</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress showed great political courage in attempting structural reform of the Medicare program.  While that reform was vetoed by President Clinton, recent reports on the operating deficit of the hospital trust fund underscore the need for urgent action to contain costs and reorganize the 30-year-old program.  Members of Congress should heed the Commissions' contributions to the reform debate, particularly on technical issues.  Many of these are particularly helpful and may suggest ways of resolving some of the disputes between Congress and the White House.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider some key observations:
<p>
<b>Observation #1:  Both panels urge Congress to slow the growth in Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "The rise in Medicare spending threatens the solvency of the program's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, its primary source of income.  Moreover, it has been a major contributor to the federal budget deficit."<sup>5</sup>  The Commission notes that between 1967 and 1993, Medicare spending jumped thirtyfold.  Between 1980 and 1993, Medicare spending was climbing in excess of 11 percent per year.  As the Medicare trustees noted last year, the Medicare hospitalization program, which already has run a deficit for the first time in 1995, is expected to go bankrupt in the year 2002 or possibly even sooner.  The Medicare payment for physicians services, also known as Medicare Part B, while not facing insolvency, is taking an ever-larger share of general revenues to break even, rising from 49 percent of Part B income in 1972 to 72 percent in 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, taxpayers are required to cover Part B expenditures automatically:  "The growth in Part B Medicare spending, therefore, increases the federal budget and contributes to the deficit."<sup>6</sup>  By 1995, Medicare spending reached $177 billion, an amount equal to 12 percent of the federal budget.  By the year 2002, it will reach $332 billion, and Medicare, together with Medicaid, which covers the poor and the indigent, will equal approximately 27 percent of the federal budget:  "[The Congressional Budget Office] points to the rapid growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending as the major factor driving up its deficit projections."<sup>7</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC says, Medicare's "growth has outpaced defense and social security, and today is second only to net interest payments on the national debt.  And while Medicare expenditures are expected to continue accelerating at annual rates of 8.6 percent to 10 percent from now until 2005, rates of growth in federal outlays for other national priorities are expected to decline."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC notes that the private sector has been more successful in recent years in controlling health care costs and recommends a similar slowing of Medicare costs:  "Over time, spending for services furnished to Medicare enrollees should increase at rates comparable to those in a cost- and quality-conscious private sector."<sup>9</sup>  Similarly, PPRC says, "recent data showing that private sector health spending is growing more slowly than Medicare expenditures have reinforced the view that greater discipline in spending is possible without threatening access or quality of care."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #2:  PROPAC notes that the budget debate obscures a significant fact:  Both the White House and Congress are relatively close in their efforts to slow the growth of Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Notes the Commission:  "The annual increase in Medicare spending is similar in all proposals, ranging from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent.  The variation in total savings, however, is much greater due to differences in the growth of Part B premiums among the proposals."<sup>11</sup>  If nothing is done to curb the growth in Medicare spending, the Congressional Budget Office projects that it will grow between 1995 and 2002 at a rate of 9.4 percent annually.  Neither Congress nor the White House regards this rate of growth as acceptable.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, enacted by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton, Medicare spending would rise at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.<sup>12</sup>  President Clinton proposed a Medicare reform package that would have established an annual growth rate of 7.6 percent.  A third proposal, offered by a coalition of members of the House of Representatives, would have set annual spending increases at 7.5 percent.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #3:  Both panels agree that Congress and the President should give Medicare enrollees the personal and financial benefits of consumer choice and competition. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "Medicare beneficiaries should have a wider range of health plan options.  Under the current program beneficiary choice is largely limited to the traditional fee for service program and, where available, an HMO option.  Additional alternatives would let Medicare beneficiaries choose the type of plan that best meets their needs and would permit new beneficiaries enrolled in a particular type of plan before retirement to stay in that arrangement.  In addition, more alternatives could increase plan competition for Medicare beneficiaries on the basis of additional benefits and quality."<sup>14</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress's plan would have given enrollees a broad range of choice.  PROPAC notes that the congressional "MedicarePlus would allow a broad array of managed care plans, including preferred provider organizations (PPOs) to participate.  Fee for service plans also would be permitted.  New options not widely available in the private market, such as medical savings accounts (MSAs) and provider sponsored networks, also could be offered to beneficiaries.  All MedicarePlus plans would receive a capitation payment from Medicare."<sup>15</sup>  PROPAC also acknowledges that the Clinton plan would give less choice to elderly Americans than the congressional plan:  "The President also has proposed expanding the risk program, but the changes would be less comprehensive than those Congress has envisioned under MedicarePlus.  Beneficiaries would be able to enroll in qualified PPO's and provider sponsored organizations as well as HMOs.  Most enrollees would be able to join one of those plans only during annual open enrollment periods.  Private fee for service plans and high deductible plans combined with MSAs would not be among the available options."<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC observes that the creation of a market-oriented Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition would encourage private organizations to promote and disseminate vital consumer information:  "As the number of choices under Medicare increases either through the current program or expansions, private entities likely will begin distributing information about these choices to beneficiaries.  Although this is appropriate, Medicare should not abandon its responsibility to ensure that beneficiaries receive unbiased, comparable and reliable data."<sup>17</sup>  The Secretary of HHS, much like the Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the consumer-based Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for federal workers and retirees, could play an important role in providing unbiased plan information to Medicare enrollees, according to PROPAC:  "The Secretary should continue efforts to identify the information beneficiaries need to make informed health plan choices and the most appropriate format for it.  This is even more critical as health plan choices are expanded for Medicare beneficiaries.  The Secretary should explore initiatives that would, for example, measure the satisfaction of beneficiaries who used services, describe total benefits available in an area (including those covered under insurance policies offered as supplements to Medicare) and document performance of individual providers within a plan."<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The PPRC similarly favors an aggressive information program for Medicare consumers on plan options in a reformed and modernized Medicare system, showing consumers costs and benefits, including the costs and benefits of enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO) plans.  Says the PPRC:  "Plans should disclose information about the general nature of the financial incentives faced by providers who contract with a health plan."<sup>19</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC recommends the expansion of Medicare's limited capitation program and patient choice:  "The Commission supports reforming the Medicare captitation program to control spending while expanding beneficiary choice."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #4:  Surprisingly, neither official panel comes out in opposition to medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Both panels acknowledge that MSAs would provide additional choice for the elderly and note that most, though not all, Medicare beneficiaries choosing MSAs would benefit financially from their choices.  The panels do emphasize that MSAs must be carefully designed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to PROPAC, "Most beneficiaries who selected the Medicare MSA option probably would benefit financially.  Beneficiaries who did not anticipate using health services would be attracted to this option, because they would expect to keep unspent MSA funds."<sup>21</sup>  The Commission notes that the effectiveness of MSAs in the area of cost control would be determined largely by the way they are designed.  Specifically, senior citizens would likely be prudent purchasers of medical services if they saw the money in their MSAs as their own money and viewed anything unspent as personal savings.  The MSAs must be designed as a savings vehicle.  If they are improperly designed or presented, and if the elderly do not understand the money in the account to be potential savings, and not just an account for health services, the MSA could become a "spending plan" and, PROPAC notes, thus would "tend to reduce beneficiaries' restraint in purchasing health services."<sup>22</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another issue related to MSAs is the problem of adverse selection.  Critics claim that MSAs would be selected mainly by healthy seniors, which could lead to a large increase in Medicare spending rather than a reduction.  PROPAC says that the current risk adjustment mechanism in the Medicare system is inadequate to deal with the problem of adverse selection.  This has consequences for MSAs.  PROPAC suggests that in developing an MSA program, policymakers should scrutinize its design carefully, with special attention to the amount of funds deposited, the length of time before persons may disenroll, and the "features" of the high-deductible plan.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is strong opposition to MSAs among liberals in Congress, particularly in the Senate, and in the Clinton Administration.  Thus, it is significant that PROPAC, which serves as an official advisory board for Medicare, does not oppose MSAs.  Instead, PROPAC favors improved risk adjustment and says that "The likelihood that rates would better reflect risk would be enhanced if Medicare enrollees were required to remain in the MSA option at least for several years."<sup>24</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC recommends that "The enrollment and disenrollment rules of Medicare medical savings account plans should be structured to reduce the potential risk for risk selection.  Examples of restructured rules include a minimum enrollment period of several years in an MSA or requiring beneficiaries to announce their disenrollment from an MSA one or more years in advance."<sup>25</sup>  The PPRC calls for careful monitoring of risk selection and its impact on Medicare costs.  Moreover, says the Commission, Medicare MSA plans should be on a level playing field with other plans.  In this respect, it says, MSA plans should be held to the same standards as other plans in reporting data to Medicare.  Moreover, there should be "no undue legal restriction of managed care plans' ability to offer this product."<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the PPRC notes that the personal choice of an MSA plan is not, of course, a risk free option and estimates that 28 percent of Medicare beneficiaries probably would reach the $3,000 deductible limit that qualifies them for catastrophic coverage under the congressional Medicare reform plan.<sup>27</sup>  Consumers therefore should fully understand the potential costs, including out-of-pocket costs.  Thus, the PPRC recommends:  "Medicare MSA plans should be required to disclose beneficiaries' typical (and potential) out-of pocket spending including exposure to balance billing.  This information should be provided to beneficiaries in a uniform format so that they can easily compare insurers."<sup>28</sup>  It should be noted that in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, health plan cost comparison data, including potential out-of-pocket costs, are made available routinely through private sources to Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees during the annual "Open Season," the special time of year when these consumers pick and choose among a variety of health plans.
<p>
<b>Observation #5:  Both panels say that Medicare should improve risk adjustment mechanisms to reduce the problems of adverse selection and to control costs in the Medicare program. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1985, Congress established a "risk contracting program" under which health maintenance organizations (HMOs) would receive a per capita payment from Medicare for providing medical services to the elderly.  Through this capitation system, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to enroll in these special HMOs and get extra benefits, while Medicare would be able to realize savings through a fixed payment.  Today, about 8 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program.  The government's pricing system is inefficient and does not reflect market conditions.  As PROPAC notes, "The program's capitation rates appear to be too high in some markets and too low in others, discouraging plan participation.  Further, it appears that healthier beneficiaries are likelier than others to enroll, and the payment rates do not adequately reflect this lower risk of illness.  Thus, Medicare may pay more for beneficiaries in its risk program than it would have had they stayed in the fee for service program."<sup>29</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC argues that Medicare needs a better risk adjustment method in setting rates to reflect more accurately the differences among individuals in their use of medical services.  Without this effective risk adjustment, especially if capitated plans and traditional fee for service plans are competing in a reformed system, the result could be higher-than-expected costs.  PROPAC suggests that while no ideal risk adjustment mechanism exists, the Secretary of HHS should "implement interim improvements as soon as possible."<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to meet budgetary targets, Congress included a "fail safe mechanism" in the Medicare reform legislation last year.  This would have meant automatic reductions in payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers if specified budget targets were not met.  The mechanism would rely on the existing apparatus of Medicare price regulations.  With respect to this approach, PROPAC says, "Any fail-safe budget mechanism should include a more effective risk adjustment factor to ensure payment equity between the Medicare capitation and traditional fee for service programs."<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given its limited experience with managed care options, the PPRC agrees substantively with PROPAC on the issue of risk selection:  "Although Medicare's per capita payment should be adjusted to reflect the risk mix of each plan's enrollees, current risk adjustment approaches capture relatively little of any biased selection across plans."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #6:  Medicare's price controls have their cost.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Physician Payment Review Commission is charged with advising Congress on how to pay doctors the "right price" for their professional services.  Given the complexities of the cumbersome Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), this is an inherently formidable task.  As the PPRC puts it, with classic understatement:
<blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In hindsight, however, physician payment reform has not been an unqualified success.  In part this reflects inconsistencies within the policy that resulted from compromises made in crafting the reform.  For example, distortions in relative values have been reintroduced owing to the existence of separate volume performance standards (VPSs) for different categories of services:  surgical, primary care and non surgical.  As a result, shifts in relative payments accomplished over the past several years will likely be reversed unless further legislative changes are made.  In addition, some expectations about payment reform's effects may have been unrealistic given the underlying incentives of fee for service medicine.  Despite progress in slowing the rate of growth in physicians services, for instance, overall Medicare expenditures continue to increase at a rate many consider unaffordable.<sup>33</sup></blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If Medicare's price control regime governing doctors has not been an "unqualified success," neither has its system governing hospitals.  Since 1983, Congress has imposed a complex system of price controls on hospitals called the Prospective Payment System.  Under this system, hospitals are prospectively reimbursed for medical services; almost 500 of these medical services are grouped according to categories, each called a diagnostic related group (DRG), for which there are fixed payments.  Hospitals may not charge more for the services to Medicare payments, nor may hospitals rebate funds to Medicare enrollees if they can provide a medical service more cheaply.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, the impact of the PPS/DRG system on inpatient care has been to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare's hospital costs.  The economic incentives in the system have reduced the length of inpatient hospital stays, especially for older Medicare patients.  Says PROPAC:  "The rapid fall of Medicare length of stay may partially reflect a trend toward discharging some patients to post-acute settings earlier in the course of their treatment, representing a change in the hospital product.  This has led to concern about how Medicare pays for patients who are discharged from PPS hospitals to inpatient post-acute care providers."<sup>34</sup>  Price controls always encourage a shifting of resources from the controlled to the less controlled or uncontrolled sectors of the economy.  This, of course, invariably generates a demand for an extension of the price controls, an absurd process that distorts economic arrangements even more.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A clear example of hospital gaming has been the broader shifting of Medicare hospital costs since the inception of PPS to the private sector.  Says the Commission:  "During this period, hospitals generally were able to obtain the revenue they needed to cover additional losses from treating Medicare patients by cost shifting to private insurers.  This was accomplished by obtaining payment increases from private payers that exceeded the corresponding cost increases.  As a result, the average payment to cost ratio for private payers went from 116 percent in 1986 to 131 percent in 1992.  Primarily because of cost shifting, hospitals were able to maintain fairly stable total margins, which reflect gains and losses from all payers as well as from non-patient care activities."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, Americans with private insurance pay extra to offset the relatively low reimbursements received by providers from the Medicare program.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's official advisors have strongly reaffirmed the need to reform the Medicare system.  This is welcome support for necessary changes in the program.  Failure to enact reform means either huge future cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly or huge tax increases on working families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's advisory panels have argued forcefully in their reports that Medicare spending should be slowed, and that the failure to do so threatens Medicare's financial solvency and aggravates the federal budget deficit.  But Medicare's advisers also have endorsed broader consumer choice while declining to oppose medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Moreover, they have made constructive proposals in the technical areas of risk adjustment and information sharing for a modernized Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition.  And, finally, they have been forthright in their description of the operations of the system's price regulations.  PROPAC, in particular, has noted that price regulation of hospital services -- long the official recipe for slowing down Medicare's rising costs -- imposes its own costs on workers and their families in the private insurance market.  Obviously, any "reform" of Medicare that relies on clamping down even more tightly on payments to hospitals and physicians will aggravate that cost shifting to the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform, and they indicate yet again that there is bipartisan support among experts for that reform.

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, supporters and employees of Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation, both by mounting a massive lobbying campaign -- paid for in part by federal funds -- and by devising loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. Faced with renewed pressure to reform and cut spending in 1995, the LSC responded with a new set of subterfuges and strategies designed to assure business as usual.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC's actions during the past year prove that the legal services network is fundamentally unreformable. In addition, the efforts of LSC grantees to secure new funding sources indicate that subsidized legal services for the poor would continue to be available even without federal aid. It is therefore time to abolish all federal funding for legal services.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders struck a compromise which included reduced, though still significant, funding for the LSC coupled with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. In light of the past year's events, Congress should reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998 in the FY 1997 Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.
<P>
<b>Background</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federally funded civil legal assistance to the poor, first offered under Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, was institutionalized in the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974. From its inception, the Legal Services Corporation, with its 323 local affiliates and 17 support centers, has been viewed as one of the most politicized of federal programs. Liberals have cheered LSC as a force for "social justice," but conservatives have criticized it as offering taxpayer funding for radical activism and expansion of the welfare state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Though President Ronald Reagan's attempts to abolish the LSC -- the first full-scale effort by conservatives to end the program -- failed in the face of congressional opposition, in the 1980s abuses uncovered by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and a Senate committee led to some restriction of political activity by grantees. Predictably, legal services programs fought even the most modest attempts to rein in their political activities. Grant recipients, for instance, fought a protracted battle in the federal courts over a regulation forbidding the use of federal funds for congressional redistricting litigation and lobbying. <sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the seating of the 104th Congress in January 1995, the legal services program found itself for the first time under the jurisdiction of a largely conservative Congress. Given the LSC's history, conflict was inevitable. Conservatives sought to eliminate federal funding for both policy and budgetary reasons. LSC grantees are among the leading opponents of welfare reform and chief litigators for left-of-center causes; moreover, the LSC budget, as part of discretionary domestic spending, offered a prime target for almost every plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a full-scale lobbying effort launched by LSC grantees and their allies, Congress approved a phased elimination of all federal LSC funding. The omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in late April 1996 reduced LSC's budget from $400 million in FY 1995 to $278 million in FY 1996. Further reductions are planned for next year, with an end to federal funding in 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, the 104th Congress imposed numerous restrictions on the types of cases in which LSC grantees could be involved. The Clinton-appointed Corporation and its grantees responded by returning to the strategy LSC had used effectively in the Reagan years: exploiting all possible legal loopholes. The efforts of legal services lawyers to avoid compliance with new restrictions have reinforced the conviction of many congressional critics that the politicized legal services fund must be eliminated from the federal budget.
<p>
<b>The 104th Congress: Phased Elimination and New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Intent on cutting the deficit in early 1995, the new Congress proposed a recission of $17.1 billion in federal spending, including $15 million from the LSC. Legal services supporters responded with vitriol. In February 1995, for example, American Bar Association President George Bushnell attacked conservative critics of legal services as "reptilian bastards."<sup>2</sup>  Congress and President Clinton eventually agreed to rescind $15 million of the $415 million FY 1995 LSC budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general commitment to achieving a balanced budget placed heavy pressure on moderate Members of the 104th Congress, who otherwise might have spared the LSC, to go along with significant cuts. The May 1995 budget resolution, which passed along party lines, therefore endorsed a phased elimination of LSC spending in which the adjusted funding level of $400 million for 1995 would be reduced to $278 million for FY 1996, $141 million for FY 1997, and zero for FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the budget resolution sets forth the general budget plan for LSC, actual appropriations are made through a separate process. The House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), recommended an FY 1996 funding level of $278 million -- the amount specified by the House budget resolution. House conservatives, however, mindful of how legal services groups might thwart welfare reform and other key elements of their agenda, advocated an immediate end to all LSC funding. The fact that the Legal Services Corporation Act had not been reauthorized since its expiration in 1980 gave LSC's foes an opportunity to use House rules to challenge funding for an unauthorized program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within this framework, the House Republican leadership met with the interested parties and struck an agreement to protect legal services appropriations from a floor challenge with the further understanding that the terms of a planned reauthorization bill would be added as an amendment, or rider, to LSC appropriations. The reauthorization legislation then under consideration included elimination of the LSC coupled with block grant funding to the states, to be used to provide legal services, and far stricter prohibitions on political activities than in prior legal services legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In mid-1995, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, chaired by Representative George W. Gekas (R-PA), held hearings and voted out a bill containing many of the needed reforms, including elimination of the LSC and the block granting of legal services funds. However, the full House Judiciary Committee -- reflecting both its more liberal membership and the influence of the organized bar -- narrowly passed a number of amendments extending the life of the program and increasing its spending levels. This new bill, unacceptable to House conservatives as well as to the Republican leadership, was never brought to the floor for a vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Senate, Phil Gramm (R-TX), a longtime critic of the LSC, chaired the Appropriations subcommittee that reported out an even lower funding level for LSC than had been reported by the comparable subcommittee in the House: $210 million. That figure survived a vote by the full committee, but an effort on the Senate floor -- led by Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), aided by the votes of 15 other Republican Senators and most Democrats -- narrowly defeated the Gramm proposal, replacing it with a much higher funding level of $340 million.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A House-Senate conference committee agreed to $278 million for LSC along with restrictions on lobbying, prison litigation, class action suits, illegal alien representation, and lawsuits against welfare reform, but President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill on December 19, 1995. The LSC appropriations thus became part of a long series of continuing resolutions which contained none of the proposed new restrictions, leaving legal services programs free to continue many of the same ideological and political activities that had motivated the 104th Congress to cut the program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 24, 1996, the President signed a new appropriations bill which reduced LSC funding to $278 million, the figure reported out by the original House-Senate conference committee. This bill also eliminates all funding for LSC's 17 support centers, some of which have engaged in litigation supporting the provision of government services to illegal aliens and opposing parental consent requirements for adolescents seeking abortions. These major cuts in the LSC budget are clear victories for congressional conservatives.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly as significant as the cuts in LSC funding are the restrictions placed on the types of cases LSC grantees may pursue. Grantees no longer may file challenges to welfare reform, for example, and class action lawsuits -- traditionally a major weapon in the grantee arsenal -- now may be filed only with the approval of the Corporation. Moreover, legal services lawyers are barred from representing prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being evicted for drug-related crimes.
<p>
<b>Replacing Federal Funds and Avoiding New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the fight over the future of legal services, the LSC empire's 4,000-plus attorneys, many with activist backgrounds, organized rallies, lobbied Congress, wrote op-eds, held demonstrations, and undertook direct-mail campaigns. A similar lobbying effort to counteract the Reagan Administration's effort to eliminate the LSC in the 1980s was investigated by the GAO, which found that federal funds intended for the provision of legal services to the poor were diverted to the LSC's political "survival campaign."<sup>4</sup>  Perhaps even more significant than their lobbying efforts was the fact that grantees sought additional non-federal funding and sought to create new loopholes by which to avoid federal restrictions.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal budget numbers do not begin to reflect the actual funding available for legal services programs. The 323 programs funded by LSC also receive in excess of $250 million a year from other sources, including foundations, state governments, legal fee awards, and the organized bar's Interest on Lawyers Trust Account programs. Without exception, in each of the last ten years, combined funding for legal services grantees from non-LSC sources has increased.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to raise non-federal revenues have increased significantly over the past year. According to the LSC, at least 27 states are studying ways to provide additional funding for legal services programs.<sup>5</sup>  Typically, most proposals seek an increase in filing fees for civil cases, with the proceeds earmarked for legal services:
<p><ul>
<li>In May 1995, Tennessee increased the filing fee for civil cases by $1 and designated the increased revenue for legal services programs.
<p>
<li>In February 1996, a bill was introduced in the Maryland legislature to raise $4.5 million for programs, including legal services, by adding a surcharge to civil case filing fees.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li>In New Jersey, a proposal to increase fees for filing civil motions from $135 to $160 was endorsed by the New Jersey Bar Association and the head of Legal Services of New Jersey. The entire $25 increase in filing fees is slated to be turned over to Legal Services of New Jersey. If the proposal is enacted, legal services will receive a projected $8 million increase in funding.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>New Loopholes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton has signed the appropriations bill, the new restrictions on legal services are now in effect. Many of the activist lawyers who lead legal services programs resent these regulations, which will bar a wide range of controversial activities undertaken by LSC-funded lawyers in the past, including lobbying, class action suits, and the representation of illegal aliens, drug dealers, and other criminals.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even more upsetting to opponents of reform, the new prohibitions would close the largest loophole in the legal services program by forbidding the use of non-LSC funds to support activities for which LSC funds also may not be used. In the past, legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, non-LSC funds which are not subject to this limitation. Critics of legal services note that money is fungible, as is a lawyer's time. The absence of mandatory timekeeping, along with the fact that case files are closed to outside monitoring, made it easy for legal services programs to use federal funds for restricted activities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new restrictions have left legal services activists looking for new ways to continue their controversial activities. Using a variation of a strategy tried in the 1980s, grantees are seeking to evade the restrictions by setting up new closely affiliated but legally separate entities. A 1985 GAO investigation determined that such affiliated groups often engaged in activities prohibited to LSC grantees and that the relationships between these two sets of groups were so close that LSC should consider them one group for purposes of complying with restrictions.<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Growing numbers of legal services groups have announced they will refuse LSC funds because of pending restrictions. Foremost among these are Community Legal Services (CLS) of Philadelphia; the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara, California; three Washington State grantees; and Greater Boston, Massachusetts, Legal Services. The strategy is simple: Such "former" grantees will continue to receive bar support, private funds, and state support for soon-to-be-restricted activities; meanwhile, new organizations will apply for and receive LSC funds to use in non-prohibited cases. Many of the new organizations have been created by attorneys affiliated with the "former" grantees, which would be free to handle political and ideological cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused. Early signs of close ties between former and current grantees, however, are already apparent:
<p><ul>
<li>The Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center, for example, was formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services to assume CLS's non-prohibited cases, setting up shop in the same building as CLS.<sup>9</sup>
<p><li>Members of the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara's executive committee opted to refuse LSC funds and set up a new organization to take LSC funds. LAS Vice President Elizabeth Shivell explained the tactic in an unguarded moment: "If [Congress] can screw people with technicalities, we can unscrew them with technicalities. That's why we're lawyers and not social workers. Two can play this game."  A bar publication reported that many poverty lawyers worried that her remarks could cause trouble with Congress.<sup>10</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A top LSC staff member, Robert Echols, was quoted as describing the rash of new groups as a perfectly appropriate approach.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Legal Services Corporation -- run by a Clinton-appointed board and run by senior-level staff with strong ties to the groups they are charged with regulating -- has provided guidance to its programs on this issue. In a December 1995 memo to its 323 field programs on "Applicability of Restrictions to Interrelated Organizations," LSC set forth the factors to be considered in determining whether one group controls another, thereby subjecting both groups to the new restrictions. Among the eight criteria used to determine control are:
<p><ul>
<li>Any overlap of officers, directors, or managers;
<p>
<li>Contractual and financial relationships;
<p>
<li>A close identity of interest; and
<p>
<li>A history of relationships among organizations.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC memo pointed out that any determination as to whether two groups are subject to common control would consider the "totality of circumstances," with the "presence or absence of any one or more of these factors" not necessarily determinative. Translation: LSC staff, with close ties to LSC grantees, will be the sole judges of whether two groups sharing office space, staff, and other resources are subject to common control, and therefore to the new restrictions.

<p>
<b>Other New Loopholes: "Restriction" of Drug Cases and the Cohen Amendment</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Legal services lawyers have incurred the bipartisan wrath of Congress by representing public housing tenants in drug-related eviction cases. LSC-funded lawyers, for example, thwarted attempts by then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp in 1991 to expedite evictions to clean up the serious drug problem in public housing.<sup>12</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the poor -- those whom these programs ostensibly are designed to help -- have lined up almost uniformly in opposition to legal services and in favor of expediting drug evictions. In a major case now pending in New York City, representatives of New York's 500,000 public housing tenants have entered a court case on the side of their landlord, the New York Housing Authority, to support expedited drug evictions. On the other side is the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee once chaired by the Corporation's current President, Alex Forger.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with the likelihood of tough new restrictions imposed by Congress, the LSC board made a virtue out of necessity: It promulgated a new regulation purporting to restrict representation in drug-related eviction cases. This regulation appeared in the <I>Federal Register</I> on April 1, 1996. While appearing to crack down on one of the most indefensible of legal services activities, however, the new regulation actually is filled with loopholes.
<p><ul>
<li>It allows family members who knew about and benefited financially from drug activity to be represented, provided they are not charged with a crime.
<p>
<li>It specifically allows legal services lawyers to use non-LSC funds to represent the drug dealer.
<p>
<li>But nothing in the regulation prohibits legal services lawyers from filing actions to challenge attempts by federal, state, and local governments to expedite drug-related evictions from public housing.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents of legal services have tried to minimize this issue by claiming that such cases are rare; critics, on the other hand, point to the action against Secretary Kemp and the case pending in New York City to show that legal services' involvement delays drug-related evictions, thereby harming hundreds of thousands of low-income tenants.<sup>14</sup>  In short, the new regulation offers the perfect metaphor for the claim that the legal services program finally is reforming itself: While doing nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from continued involvement in drug-related evictions, it gives LSC a pretext for telling Congress that it has cracked down on such representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the LSC's obvious failure to follow the new restrictions, the legal services empire scored a major victory in 1996 with the inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus spending bill. This amendment, sponsored by Senator William Cohen (R-ME), allows grantees to comment on legislation and participate in legislative rulemaking. The effect of the Cohen amendment is to provide a major loophole for legal services lawyers disposed to engage in lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Looking to the 105th Congress</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although LSC escaped total defunding in 1995, it lost nearly one-third of its federal appropriation. Fearing that Congress would impose several important limits on grantee activities, the LSC, its grantees, and their affiliates worked to devise new strategies to avoid complying with such restrictions. As a result, conservatives in Congress remain determined to push for phased elimination of all federal LSC funding.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House Republican leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached last summer, is expected to ensure that the Rules Committee will not protect LSC from a point of order when the full House considers the FY 1997 appropriations bill containing LSC funding. This could open the opportunity for the House to "zero out" LSC. So far, there is no reliable head count, but it should be remembered that whatever happens, the Senate -- given last year's performance -- is not likely to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The major battle in Congress therefore will be over whether the budget resolution's FY 1997 figure of $141 million for LSC will be followed. This would represent a sharp cut from the $278 million voted for FY 1996. If Congress approves $141 million, the stage will be set for the final showdown on legal services. The 105th Congress, to be elected this November, will decide whether it has the political will to vote for the final installment of the budget resolution plan for LSC: zero support from the American taxpayer by FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reducing LSC's appropriation by one-third while placing significant restrictions on the allowable activities of LSC grantees, the 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of grantees to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense. LSC grantees responded by attempting to blunt the impact of congressional efforts, primarily by seeking new, non-federal revenue sources or by restructuring their organizations to circumvent the new regulations. Through these actions, grantees have shown once again that legal services cannot be reformed. It is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program.

<P>
<B>CISNEROS AGREES TO DESEGREGATE HUD HOUSING PROGRAM</B>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under the guidance of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in April 1996, HUD finally agreed to the terms of a settlement of a January 1995 desegregation suit (<I>Thompson vs. HUD, et al</I>., Civil No. MJG 95-309) brought against it by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several African-American families living at Lafayette Gardens, a decrepit HUD-supported public housing project operated by the Baltimore Public Housing Authority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, "The suit alleged that the city, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally segregated black public housing tenants for six decades, which the defendants deny. It said they would 'rebuild segregation for generations' and perpetuate poverty if allowed to redevelop the high rise sites as public housing."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In April 1996, HUD agreed to a $300 million settlement under which, among other promises, it would tear down several of the dilapidated, segregated public housing projects and replace them with 814 new, low-rise public housing units. Money earmarked for 150 of these units could be redirected to vouchers if Congress concurs. HUD also would provide vouchers to allow another 1,342 families to move into better neighborhoods. In addition, 664 of the proposed 814 new public housing units or vouchers could be made available for homeownership, partly under a resuscitated version of former Secretary Kemp's HOPE program. Traditional public housing is nowhere part of the court-supervised desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although in principle the settlement is a significant endorsement of the Reagan-Kemp empowerment policies of the 1980s, in practice the implementation details are remarkably coercive and would deny the winning tenants the right to exercise their choice in using the voucher.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Specifically, the assisted tenants, who are almost exclusively African-American, can use their vouchers only if they agree to move into a "non-impacted" area. In HUD-speak, non-impacted areas are defined census tracts, mostly in the surrounding suburbs and predominantly white in racial composition. In response to suburban concerns that the federal government will be forcibly relocating poor, inner-city blacks to their communities, HUD has established annual quotas under which the relocation program will be conducted. For example, only 60 black families per year will be permitted to move into neighboring Baltimore County in each of the next six years until the 360-family quota of African-Americans for the county is exhausted in 2002.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Although dramatic in cost and scope, the Baltimore settlement is not the first of its kind, and is not likely to be the last, unless Congress abandons its six-decade obsession with public housing.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<a name="ahs"><b>WHAT SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the perception within Congress is that there is a dearth of affordable housing available to the poor, the facts indicate otherwise. The table below, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, demonstrates clearly that a substantial portion of the U.S. rental stock is available at rents well within the range of the resources available to the typical HUD voucher recipient.
<p><center>

<th>Total Occupied Units</th><th>	33,472	</th></tr></table>			
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	As the table indicates, there are 33,472,000 occupied rental units in the United States. In 1993, the most recent year for which such data are available, the vacancy rate calculated by the Bureau of the Census was 7.4 percent of the rental stock, roughly as it has been for most of this decade. This means approximately 2,674,000 additional units were vacant. Further, the number of affordable vacant units available from the private sector, estimated at 1.3 million units, is nearly equal to the entire stock of public housing units now in existence. With the private sector able to provide these units at rental rates below either the partial cost ($481) or the full cost ($935) of public housing, one is hard-pressed to explain Congress's long-standing bipartisan obsession with this failed approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It should be noted that the vacancy rate is higher, and housing therefore more available, within urban areas, reflecting the long-term depopulation trends within those communities as more and more Americans choose not to make their homes in cities. In 1993 when the overall vacancy rate was 7.4 percent, the rate inside Metropolitan Statistical Areas was 7.6 percent, while that outside MSAs was 6.4 percent. Thus, it should come as no surprise that 89 percent of voucher recipients are able to find suitable, qualified, affordable rental housing from the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The claimed shortage of affordable housing is one of the more popular rationales used by the public housing industry and its defenders to justify pouring billions of dollars into renovation, modernization, and new construction. Indeed, so great is this obsession that for years Congress has forbidden HUD to tear down any public housing unit, no matter how dilapidated, unless it first agrees to replace it with a new unit. Although both the House and the Senate propose to repeal this absurd and long-standing restriction, apologists for public housing still go to great lengths to misconstrue the actual state of affairs, as the House Banking Subcommittee report demonstrates with its creative interpretation of a GAO finding. On the matter of affordability and availability, the GAO says that:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Generally, the lower the vacancy rate in an area, the more difficult it will be for assisted households to find alternative housing. In the New York City housing market, for example, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, the vacancy rate is less than half the national average, making alternative housing more difficult to find.<sup>3</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Seven months later, the House Subcommittee on Housing had this to say on the same matter in a paragraph referencing the GAO's findings:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also, for vouchers to succeed, housing must be available, and availability is very much market specific. For example, the vacancy rate in markets such as New York City, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, is less than one half the national rate. Providing a voucher in this area would be useless.<sup>4</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Despite the difficulties that more than 50 years of rent control and rent stabilization have created for the New York City rental housing market, it is significant that HUD has a 62 percent success rate with vouchers and certificates.<sup>5</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Today our federal [work force] is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President."

<p>-- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton wants to convince the American people he has pared back the bloated federal work force. The American people certainly have every reason to resent the large number of federal bureaucrats whose apparent mission is to turn their daily lives into the sort of nightmares described in the novels of Franz Kafka. These bureaucrats include auditors from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutinizing tax returns, regulators from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undermining productive enterprises, and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) trying to seize the guns of law-abiding citizens. Reducing the numbers of these bureaucrats should and will be popular with the American people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The disturbing thing is that most of the eliminated positions cited by President Clinton are not coming from the IRS, the EPA, the ATF, or similar regulatory or enforcement agencies. The vast majority of the positions being eliminated belong to the people who helped win the Persian Gulf War. In short, most are from the Department of Defense. For example:<ul>

<p><li>Some 60 percent of the 200,000 eliminated positions cited by the President come from a single department, the Department of Defense.<sup>1</sup><p><li>Personnel reductions at the Pentagon are even more severe than the President would have Americans believe. The personnel reductions cited by President Clinton include only federal civilian employees, including those at the Department of Defense, but not active duty or reserve component military personnel. In fact, total federal employment, including both civilian and military personnel, as of the end of fiscal 1997 will have dropped by 849,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>2</sup><p><li>Of all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of FY 1992, over 89 percent (almost 760,000) will have come solely from the Department of Defense (see <a href="bgup278c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).

<p><li>President Clinton's cuts in defense jobs have not been limited to the public sector (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Defense industry jobs by the end of FY 1997 will have dropped by 795,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>3</sup><p><li>In 1997, there will be 1.5 million fewer defense jobs (including those in the military, the civil service, and industry) than in 1992 (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>  In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. Meanwhile, IRS employment has dropped by only 6 percent, ATF positions have dropped by less than 5 percent, and EPA positions have <i>increased</i> by over 2 percent (see <a href="bgup278c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).</ul>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The President's policies punish defense employees in the private sector as well. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA, and ATF watching their every move and telling them how to live their lives. But they do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War.
<p>
<b>RESTORING BALANCE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To restore balance to federal employment policy, the Clinton Administration should:<ul>

<p><li>Freeze military personnel reductions at the level recommended by the Clinton Administration in its 1993 "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy. This amounts to about 2.4 million positions, including active troops and reserves. A military of this size should be adequate to handle the nation's future military requirements. However, within these limits, the Pentagon should be flexible in dividing the number of billets for active and reserve forces. The Administration should decrease personnel strength in the Army National Guard and increase the number of active duty personnel, who are better suited to addressing the short-notice conflicts likely to arise in the post-Cold War world. Moreover, since the Navy's power projection capabilities are particularly suited to the post-Cold War security needs of the U.S., the Administration should ensure that the number of naval personnel is relatively higher than the number for other services.

<p><li>Limit further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts. The current excessive reliance on public sector civilian employees to perform such routine services as depot maintenance of equipment for the Department of Defense and the military services should be reduced. Current law requires that public employees perform no less than 60 percent of this work. The private sector certainly is more efficient in performing maintenance and other services. Savings can be achieved by privatizing a significant number of services and allowing defense contractors greater flexibility to do the work. Additional civilian work force reductions outside the privatization effort, however, should be limited. This will ensure that civilian support and management positions within the Department of Defense are adequate to meet the needs of the military force required for U.S. security in the post-Cold War world. 

<p><li>Increase the Department of Defense procurement budget. Procurement funding -- the money the Pentagon spends to buy new weapons -- has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. This has caused the loss of over 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the employment peak in 1987. Annual real increases in the procurement budget, which provides much of the money for defense industry jobs, will reverse this trend and help preserve the defense industry jobs that are necessary for a strong national defense. These increases are needed to replace aging weapons and equipment that will become obsolete by early in the next decade.

<p><li>Concentrate federal work force reductions within non-defense departments. Further reductions in non-defense civilian positions in the federal government should result from a policy of eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies. Putting caps or ceilings on the federal civilian work force does little to reduce the size or scope of government. In fact, it may lead to the poor delivery of government services by failing to distinguish between successful and failed federal programs. Instead, work force reductions should come from eliminating unnecessary agencies, consolidating similar programs, devolving authority to the states, simplifying taxes, and pursuing a policy of deregulation. The Heritage Foundation's budget plan, <i>Rolling Back Government</i>, would reduce the federal government from its current level of 14 cabinet-level departments to five.<sup>5</sup>  The plan also would reduce the non-defense federal work force by approximately 10 percent over the next five years (FY 1997-2001).</ul><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Reducing the federal work force is an appropriate goal. The American people should demand the elimination of wasteful bureaucracies. But cutting into America's fighting force and then claiming credit for downsizing the government is not only misleading, but damaging to national security. In essence, Clinton's federal employment policy is a cloak hiding the Administration's policy of weakening America's military strength.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Now that the true impact of President Clinton's federal employment policy has been revealed, Congress should set about the task of restoring balance to the federal work force. It should limit further reductions in the defense sector and focus instead on dealing with the real cause of waste in government: the bloated non-defense federal bureaucracy.

<p>

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 805, "The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement: Keeping Up the Managed    Trade Agenda," January 24, 1991.) 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration and some Members of Congress argue that the decades old U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has helped save America's ailing semiconductor industry and increase previously slumping sales in Japan. They are wrong. The semiconductor agreement, signed in 1986 by the Reagan Administration, nearly destroyed America's computer industry, forced higher prices on American consumers, and has had little to do with the U.S. industry's rebound in this crucial technology. The President and Congress should let this agreement expire as scheduled on July 31, 1996.

<p>
<b>The 1986 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The United States and Japan agreed in 1986 to monitor foreign semiconductor market share in Japan. There were two reason for this. First, the U.S. industry complained that Japan was protecting its semiconductor market from foreign competition. Thus, they argued, the U.S. was not selling as many semiconductors in Japan as it could. Second, the U.S. industry argued that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were selling these products in the U.S. at prices below their cost of production.1  The result was the 1986 trade agreement with Japan, which sought to monitor both the level of foreign semiconductor market share in Japan and the prices of Japanese semiconductors sold in the U.S. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Some supporters of the semiconductor agreement argue that it established a "guarantee" by which foreign semiconductor manufacturers are granted a 20 percent market share in Japan. If foreign market share falls below the 20 percent figure, the U.S. and others can impose trade sanctions on Japan. Yet the 1986 agreement makes no such guarantee. In fact, the market share number is based on a secret side letter that the Japanese government supposedly sent the U.S., stating that it would work to help American companies achieve higher market share in Japan. The U.S. treated the Japanese pledge as binding, but the Japanese were more ambiguous, preferring to make it in private. The Japanese government refuses to confirm the existence of this side letter.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Unsatisfied with America's slow progress on increasing market share in Japan, the Reagan Administration had imposed some $4 billion in penalties on the Japanese industry in the mid-1980s. Most of these penalties were suspended in 1986. The Reagan Administration, however, applied some $165 million in retaliatory duties to Japanese imports in 1987. The Japanese were compelled to raise prices for their semiconductors sold in the U.S. in order to avoid the imposition of special tariffs and duties resulting from U.S. antidumping investigations. As a result, Japanese computer chips cost American computer manufacturers 30 percent to 40 percent more in the late 1980s than before the agreement. Personal computer prices shot up drastically in the late 1980s, almost destroying America's competitiveness in this crucial high-tech product area.

<p>
<b>The 1991 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the semiconductor agreement expired in 1991, it was clear that foreign market share had grown only marginally in Japan, from about 9 percent in 1986 to only 14 percent. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration sought to extend the agreement for five more years. This time, the strategy was different. Rather than focus on numerical targets and guaranteed market shares, the Administration backed off the claim that the 20 percent market share number was a guarantee which, if not met, could invoke sanctions. The Administration sought to include a reference to the 20 percent foreign market share figure, but both it and the Japanese government specified that this figure was not a guarantee. The 1991 agreement states:<blockquote>

	<p>The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The two Governments agree that the above statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling, nor a floor on the foreign market share.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thus, the 1991 agreement should have removed any doubt that the 20 percent foreign market share figure was to be used as a benchmark in measuring the openness of the Japanese market to foreign semiconductors. Yet, despite the text in the negotiated agreement, both the U.S. government and U.S. semiconductor industry continued to focus almost exclusively on this number, leading many economists to call this a managed trade agreement. Even so, the agreement paved the way for U.S. and Japanese firms to enter joint ventures. Both the U.S. and Japanese agreed not to enforce strict antitrust laws which could stifle such relationships, and to sponsor meetings between U.S. and Japanese companies to arrange such relationships. These joint ventures were beginning to occur, even without the agreement, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would continue to occur without the agreement. After the 1991 agreement, instead of promoting the use of numerical targets, the Bush Administration focused on private sector solutions. The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market has increased from 14 percent in 1991 to more than 29 percent today.

<p>
<b>The Cause of U.S. Success </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The U.S. semiconductor industry is more competitive and prosperous today than it was before the U.S.-Japan agreement. It now is the world's largest producer of semiconductors. The question is: How much does this success have to do with the agreement, and how much is the result of market forces and the sound business decisions of private companies?  The answer is simple: America's renewed success in Japan has occurred because of private sector initiatives by U.S. and Japanese companies to work together, and despite the U.S. government's managed trade policies.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The 1991 agreement emphasized the use of "long-term relationships between Japanese semiconductor purchasers and foreign capital-affiliated producers, including joint product development with Japanese customers."  This statement gave rise to an avalanche of trans-Pacific strategic alliances or joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese semiconductor companies. Some of these alliances could have been challenged under America's antiquated antitrust laws. But the emphasis on joint ventures in the agreement eased the concerns of many U.S. companies seeking partnerships with Japanese firms. In 1991, for example, there were fewer than a dozen such partnerships between U.S. and Japanese companies. Three years later, in 1994, there were more than three dozen.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Located in Japan, many of these alliances gave U.S. firms direct access to Japan's complex distribution system, advanced manufacturing techniques, and new and innovative marketing techniques. Moreover, they allowed U.S. and Japanese firms to pool resources, thereby reducing the research and development costs of new and advanced semiconductor products, and helped U.S. firms gain access to the Japanese semiconductor market. U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances therefore are the principal reason not only for America's regaining its role as the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, but also for America's increased market share in Japan.

<p>
<b>Misguided Focus on Market Share </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The semiconductor agreement is both a failure and an unwise policy. It is based on a fundamental misconception about trade: that because Country A's market share in Country B is significantly lower than Country A's global market share, Country B must have a closed market.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
This assumption is fallacious. Japan has 47 percent of the world market in semiconductors, excluding North America, but only 23 percent market share in semiconductors in North America. Japan also has 33 percent of the world market share in microprocessors, excluding North America, but only 6 percent share of the microprocessor market in North America. Few would argue that the North American (including the U.S.) semiconductor or microprocessor market is closed to Japan. American computer companies dominate the U.S. market because they are more competitive than the Japanese, not because the U.S. government protects them from competition.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
There is a danger that extending the semiconductor agreement could cause the U.S. to be held to the same standard of market openness as it expects of Japan. If other countries were to decide that America is closed, they could retaliate by imposing tariffs and duties on America's exports, further harming U.S. businesses and threatening American jobs. Under these circumstances, the U.S. would have no ground on which to stand against foreign retaliation.

<p>
<b>Objectives Fulfilled</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Even if the semiconductor agreement's goal was to give foreigners a 20 percent share of the Japanese semiconductor market, as its supporters contend, this goal has been exceeded, thanks largely to U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances. Today the foreign market share for semiconductors in Japan is over 29 percent. Moreover, while total foreign sales of semiconductors in Japan in 1986 amounted to only $900 million, foreign sales today are worth over $6 billion -- a sevenfold increase.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration believes that the recent success of America's semiconductor industry is the result of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. It is not. The U.S. semiconductor industry is successful today because it sought joint ventures with Japanese firms which gave American companies access to the Japanese market, advanced manufacturing techniques, and reduced research and development costs. The semiconductor agreement sets a bad precedent by focusing on market share numbers. If other countries applied the same policy to the U.S., many of America's exports could faced increased tariffs abroad. The President should let the agreement expire.

<p><li>While the U.S. International Trade Commission found that many Japanese companies were selling their semiconductors in the U.S. at prices below their production costs, there is little evidence that this was done to undercut the prices of U.S. producers. Instead, it was more the result of intensive competition within Japan and a drop in demand for personal computers in the mid-1980s, which caused the prices for semiconductors to fall rapidly. In order to cut their losses, many Japanese semiconductor firms which had overproduced and had bulging inventories sought to cut their losses by quickly selling off their stockpiles of semiconductors.

Defenders of big government would have us believe that Congress and the President have shown tremendous fiscal restraint in recent years and that this Congress's efforts to reduce spending further can be achieved only by cutting muscle and bone. But waste, fraud, and abuse still abound in many government programs. Consider the following recently revealed examples:<p>

<b>Doing Well by Doing Good. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Baltimore Public Housing Authority's operations are funded largely by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- $52 million in operating subsidies for FY 1994 -- and the PHA has a waiting list of 25,000 poor families in line for housing assistance. Yet the Baltimore authority was found to have improperly used the public's money by buying eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers, hiring a high-bid security firm that employed 29 convicted felons, and spending more than $25 million of building repair funds on no-bid contracts to contractors, including some who were friends and relatives of Authority employees. HUD asked that $725,000 be returned because of inflated costs or work never completed.<sup>1</sup>  Despite this record of mismanagement, HUD just awarded the same housing authority $115 million to construct 338 new apartment units for the poor as part of a court-imposed desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Kevin E. Marchman, HUD's Assistant Secretary-Designate for Public and Indian Housing, (202) 708-0950.
<p>
<b>They All Threatened to Leave. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 95 percent of the bonuses recently granted by the managers of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to their employees were "improper and excessive" and cost the taxpayer as much as $1 million in overpayments.<sup>2</sup>  According to the GAO, 1995 bonuses were granted to 200 of the Bank's 448 employees, but only 10 of the 200 employees were actually eligible to receive the money. Ex-Im's bonus abuse was uncovered a year earlier when a GAO audit revealed that just five government agencies accounted for 94 percent of these special retention bonuses. Although the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force of the five agencies reviewed, it accounted for 25 percent of all bonuses government-wide, and the GAO auditors noted that many of these awards "did not appear to comply with the statutory requirement."  Whereas the Department of Defense granted such bonuses to only 0.03 percent of its work force in 1994, 21 percent of Ex-Im employees received such bonuses that year, and nearly 45 percent received them in 1995. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the acting head of the Ex-IM Bank was stripped of his authority to grant bonuses by the Office of Personnel Management, his April 1996 recess appointment to the top Bank post by President Clinton was accompanied by the reinstatement of bonus-granting authority. And although Ex-Im Bank officials have argued that they are merely continuing Bush Administration practices, the GAO audit indicates that no such bonuses were granted by the Ex-Im Bank during those years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Martin Kamarck, President and Chairman-Designate of the Export-Import Bank, (202) 565-3500.
<p>

<b>Deadbeat Schools. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Students attending proprietary trade schools are eligible for federal student loans, and these loans have experienced excessively high default rates over the past several years, hitting a high of 41.2 percent in 1990. Included among the hundreds of proprietary schools that were selected for direct federal student loans are the California Medical School of Shiatsu, the Hypnosis Motivation Institute, the Trend Benders Academy, the Milpitas Electrolysis and Thermolysis College, and the Las Vegas Gaming and Technical School. Although improvements have been made in reducing the default rates at proprietary schools during both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, students from more than 200 of these schools have current default rates in excess of 40 percent, and these schools are still eligible for federal student loans.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth M. Hicks, Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs, U.S. Department of Education, (202) 260-6536.

American consumers pay a heavy price to subsidize the sugar barons, of whom some of the richest are foreign citizens. The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, immigrants from Cuba but citizens of Spain, possess a fortune estimated at over $500 million. This fortune includes several Florida sugar mills, 170,000 acres of cane in south Florida, and another 240,000 acres of land in the Dominican Republic. But as "domestic" growers, they are entitled to the sugar import protection enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which adds about 8 cents a pound to what the American consumer pays for sugar and about $65 million to the annual income of the Fanjuls.<sup>4</sup>  As if this were not enough government help, the Fanjuls' other business interests have benefited from federal, state, and local affirmative action programs that provide minority set-asides for qualified firms. For example, the Fanjuls' investment firm, FAIC Securities, enjoys the right to market the debt of Florida municipalities and such government-sponsored enterprises as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks.

Years of financial mismanagement have left the District of Columbia's government bankrupt and D.C. officials coming to Congress for yet another taxpayer bailout of hundreds of millions of dollars. So serious is the shortfall that clinics for the poor have been closed, teachers furloughed, snow covered streets unplowed, and police cars left unrepaired. But despite the fiscal crisis, Lloyd Arrington, Jr., President of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), was able to maintain most of his costly perks despite the poor performance of the EDFC. Created in 1986 to encourage business development in the District of Columbia, and provided with $6.75 million in funds to loan to promising businesses, the EDFC and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Neighborhood Economic Development Corporation, made only 17 loans through 1994, or less than two loans per year. Although nine were in default or charged off as of 1994, the audit<sup>5</sup> reported that EDFC's President Arrington received a bonus of $17,000 on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 to pay for parking, and $600 in "improper expenditures" for rented formal wear, dinners, and entertainment. Nonetheless, the audit does indicate that progress toward fiscal restraint is being made:  The EFDC's annual spending on flowers, which had hit a high of more than $2,000 per year in 1989 and 1990, had been phased out to zero by 1993.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, Congress tried to cut the U.S.  foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful government spending and balance the federal budget deficit.  Moreover, both houses of Congress passed legislation that would have abolished the Agency for International Development, the U.S.  agency responsible for most of America's $13 billion foreign aid program, along with most of its functions.  Because the Clinton Administration fought these proposals, Congress was unable to make more significant cuts in foreign aid or eliminate these wasteful government functions.
The Clinton Administration says foreign aid supports America's interests overseas.  It claims, for example, that U.S.  aid helps America gain influence with countries around the world and that these countries generally support America's foreign policy goals.  A quick look at the facts, however, shows that these arguments are groundless.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One measurement of America's influence around the world is the voting records of U.S.  foreign aid recipients in the United Nations.  If a direct connection exists between foreign aid and winning friends overseas, as the Administration asserts, recipients should be voting with the U.S.  in the U.N.  most of the time.  In fact, they do not.  The data show that most recipients of foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  Consider the following fact gathered from the 1995 U.N.  session:
<p><ul>
<li><b>64 percent of U.S.  foreign aid recipients</b> voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time.
<p>
<li><b>India,</b> the fifth-largest recipient with some $157 million in U.S.  foreign aid this year, voted against the U.S.  83 percent of the time.  That is as often as Cuba and more often than Iran.
<p>
<li><b>The ten countries</b> that voted against the U.S.  the most frequently will receive over $212 million in foreign aid in FY 1996 (see <a href="fyi101t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Seven of the ten largest recipients</b> of U.S.  foreign aid voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time (see <a href="fyi101t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Of the ten countries</b> that voted with the U.S.  the most often, nine are former Soviet bloc countries (see <a href="fyi101t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Egypt,</b> the second largest recipient of American foreign aid, voted against the U.S.  67 percent of the time.  This is worse than the 1994 session, when Egypt voted against the U.S.  65 percent of the time.  Egypt will receive some $2.2 billion in U.S.  foreign aid in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Haiti,</b> where President Bill Clinton sent American troops to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, voted against the U.S.  60 percent of the time during the1996 session.  Despite this, the U.S.  will send some $124 million in foreign aid to Haiti in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Mexico,</b> where President Bill Clinton fought for a $40 billion international economic bailout, most of which will come from U.S.  taxpayers, voted against the U.S.  58 percent of the time.  In addition to its $40 billion economic bailout plan, the Clinton Administration has endorsed another $25 million in foreign aid for Mexico.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There may be many reasons why a country votes with or against the U.S.  at the U.N.  But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does not win friends where it counts:  in supporting U.S.  diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations.  Clearly, the U.S.  foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton Administration in particular, has done little to justify public confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by America's foreign aid bureaucracy.  President Clinton has defended two of his biggest foreign policy and economic initiatives -- "restoring" democracy in Haiti and the economic bailout of Mexico -- as in the U.S.  national interest.  Yet these countries seem to care little about Americas interests when it comes to supporting the U.S.  at the U.N.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should evaluate the extent to which U.S.  recipients of foreign aid support America's national interests.  U.N.  voting records clearly show that a majority of recipients of U.S.  foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  In fact, the data show that some of these countries actually undermine U.S.  interests abroad.  For example, South Africa, America's sixth largest recipient of foreign aid is quickly extending relations to some of America's biggest enemies:  Cuba, Iran, and Libya.  This fiscal year, South Africa will receive some $132 million in U.S.  foreign aid.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why, then, is the U.S.  spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?  And why is the Clinton Administration fighting to save this program when most Americans are opposed to it?  This year, when the U.S.  foreign aid budget is scrutinized by Congress as a target for reaching a balanced budget, Congress would do well to cut the program further and seek to abolish the Agency for International Development.

<h3> A Personal Report from the Education Summit: What Does It Mean For Education Reform? </h3>
<b>By Denis P. Doyle<br> 
Senior Fellow in Education </b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given May 21, 1996.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Allow me to share with you my impressions of the recent Education Summit, sponsored jointly by IBM and the nation's governors. As an invited guest representing The Heritage Foundation, I was impressed by the tone and temper of the meeting. There was a clear reaffirmation of the principle that the job of public education is a state and local task; it is not the job of the federal government. And while the governors and the representatives of corporate America have a direct interest in the best education of America's children, including real standards, tests, and results, the ultimate engine of reform is dedicated parents. They are most interested in their children's education. While school choice, the most vigorous and far-reaching education reform measure available to us, was not on the summit agenda, we all know that market-based reform like school choice enforces accountability to parents. It is the natural ally of high academic standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It was an extraordinary first. Forty-three governors encamped to the IBM Palisades, New York, conference center March 26 and 27, 1996, to talk about -- and act on-- education standards. A gathering of eagles, each governor was accompanied by a home-state CEO of his or her choosing. To round out the invitation list, IBM CEO Louis V. Gerstner and co-host Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson invited 30 education "resource people."  More than the usual suspects, the resource people were a motley crew of special-interest pleaders, state education leaders, foundation executives, think tank intellectuals, and policy analysts. Indeed, the most distinctive resource person was Secretary Riley, invited neither as a participant nor as a speaker. His silence spoke volumes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Governor Thompson and CEO Gerstner jointly presided over the two-day meeting, and were joined at the head table by a bipartisan steering committee made up of Governors Terry Branstad (R-IA), John Engler (R-MI), Jim Hunt (D-NC), incoming NGA head Bob Miller (D-NV), and Roy Romer (D-CO). CEOs Robert E. Allen (AT&T), John L. Clendenin (BellSouth Corporation), George Fisher (Kodak), John Pepper (P&G), and Frank Shrontz (Boeing) shared the spotlight.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the meeting's larger purpose was to reinvigorate the standards movement and highlight education technology, its real function was to solemnize the fact that the federal role in education is virtually at an end. Governor Thompson made one thing crystal clear in his opening remarks: The meeting was addressing a problem that was national in scope but that did not call for a federal government solution. The governors and CEOs could handle it themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b> HAIL TO THE CHIEF</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The harmonious picture was completed when President Clinton addressed the group just before lunch on Wednesday, the second day of the conference. Even seasoned Washington watchers were impressed by the security; in addition to the usual complement of Secret Service agents and countless members of the New York highway patrol, each governor was accompanied by a phalanx of plainclothes officers. There were many more people with earpieces and distinctive lapel pins than there were participants.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the putative purpose of the meeting was to get the education standards train back on track, the first afternoon's plenary session was followed by small group meetings with no press present, chaired jointly by a governor and a CEO; resource people were present but largely seen, not heard. Cocktails and dinner were followed by a six-person panel featuring Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT); Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina; Chester Finn and Lynn Cheney, conservative appointees and education specialists in the Reagan and Bush Administrations; and Governors John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. The next morning, small groups of governors, CEOs, and resource people were moved at a forced march through more than a dozen technology exhibits (ten minutes per exhibit). The technology exhibits were carefully scripted and were a great success, not least because of a striking example of enlightened despotism: The majority of the technology displays were running on Apple software. Moreover, the CEO of Apple was at the summit as the guest of the governor of North Dakota.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>PRIVATE INITIATIVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two things stand out. First, the original idea was Lou Gerstner's. As Chief Executive Officer of IBM, he has had a long-standing interest in education. It was not a government conclave, and it certainly was not a typical business meeting. One of the nation's most vigorous business leaders, Gerstner gained the confidence of Tommy Thompson (concurrently the head of National Governors' Association and Education Commission of the States, the first governor to chair both organizations since Bill Clinton) and Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado and as liberal as Thompson is conservative. While no summit could escape political overtones, this one was neither politically conceived nor politically motivated. It achieved a status often talked about but only infrequently realized: It was bipartisan. (The issue of school choice was not on the table; had it been, the bipartisan aura would have evaporated quickly, as a brief public colloquy between Governors George Allen of Virginia and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin revealed as the summit was wrapping up. Even more was apparently said in private.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Limiting the agenda to issues about which bipartisan agreement could be achieved was no small feat. Indeed, two years ago, when the 103rd Congress was still sitting, there could not have been widespread agreement about standards. That such agreement is emerging is a commentary on the temper of the times. And while Gerstner is a political animal within the corporate world, he does not approach education as a political issue. It was his insight to take the issue to the governors. Gerstner is no newcomer to the issue; he has been worried about the quality of the nation's schools for a very long time. I know about his interest first hand as the co-author of a book with him (and two other colleagues) several years ago: <i>Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools </i> (New York, E. P. Dutton). Among other things, it tells the story of the RJR Nabisco Foundation's Next Century Schools program, in which Gerstner oversaw the investment of $32 million in 43 schools across the country -- not an insignificant amount, even by Washington standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, governors, highly political in their own states, are strikingly nonpartisan with each other. They are as courtly with other governors as members of the U.S. Senate are with colleagues; but unlike Senators, their show of bipartisanship is real. In part this is because they do not see other governors as competitors. They have much in common and much to learn from each other, and they know it. They genuinely enjoy each other's company as well, which is one of the reasons they gave former Governor Clinton such a warm welcome; regardless of party affiliation, he's a member of the tribe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton, for his part, gave a speech calculated to please--as it did--and demonstrated that what he is ideally suited to be is "governor" of the United States. The President, as many know, can charm the birds out of the trees. And if he believes what he says--or if he acts as though he does--American education could be in for a big change. This is always a challenge for those of us who tend to be skeptical of the President's diplomatic relations between his language and his actions. In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Clinton had proclaimed that the era of big government was at an end. From his federal budget submissions, however, this is not at all clear to the rest of us. In his Palisades education policy speech, he repeated that promise. Not surprisingly, like much of his State of the Union Address, it was a speech 95 percent of which any Republican could have delivered with complete conviction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The high points were few and memorable. Clinton opened with the claim that what matters in education is effort. Not talent or IQ or luck; effort. How quaint. And how on the mark. Nothing is more patronizing--or damaging--to poor or minority children than to tell them that nothing they do matters, that whatever might happen to them is the luck of the socioeconomic draw. About this point the President is right. He went on to say that standards are essential, just as state-developed assessments are. The pivotal point, however, was his use of the word "consequences."  Only one other public figure regularly uses that word, AFT President Al Shanker, and it is no accident that he has been heavily lobbying the President and his senior staff about this issue for months. Clinton gave "consequences" operational significance when he attached a liberal sacred cow: social promotion. No more, he intoned. Right again.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
C-SPAN carried the full proceedings of the summit. President Clinton mentioned that he had watched the panel discussion from the comfort of the White House. His folksy references to panelists' comments--particularly Al Shanker's--offered another striking example of his command of the subject of his speech.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton closed with a paean about discipline: No one can teach or learn in an undisciplined and unsafe environment. As Checker Finn noted, it was a speech which Ronald Reagan could have given. There was not a single reference to the federal government, no talk about federal standards, and nary a word about Goals 2000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what was true of Clinton's comments was true of the governors and CEOs. The idea that standards are a state and local issue was supported unanimously, or at least with no public dissent. In the case of governors like Jim Hunt and Roy Romer, their willingness to go along may be simple political prudence. They know that the federal role will soon be <i>de minimis</i>, and they are reconciled to this new reality. They might wish that it were otherwise but made no public complaint or statement to that effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>NEW, NEW FEDERALISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For my part, I am convinced that whatever their private reservations or reluctance might be now, they will grow to like their new role. Governors actually enjoy governing, and education is typically the biggest single item in their budgets. While they know that freedom from Washington will have a price (federal spending reductions), they are likely to find that life is both simpler and more interesting without Uncle Sam looking over their shoulders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Presidents from Nixon to Clinton, of course, have flirted with the idea of "new federalism."  Indeed, it is a Nixon coinage, but has made little substantive headway over the years. It is one of those ideas that is good in principle but very difficult to put into practice. Part of the problem is the sheer weight of habit, part is fear of the unknown, part is the heavy lifting required to change the contours of massive programs. Changing what Washington does is hard work, just as changing what the states do is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1978 by Jimmy Carter is a case in point; it was a major Democratic campaign promise to the NEA, but Carter could barely marshal the votes to get the bill out of the House of Representatives. It was a "ho-hum" issue in Congress, eliciting only weak support and unenthusiastic opposition. Undoing the department falls in the same category, as President Reagan discovered to his chagrin: He couldn't find an author to carry his promised legislation to abolish the department in his first term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the real strength of "new federalism" will depend precisely on the extent to which its practitioners prefer it to the old federalism. And the assembled governors gave every indication that they will actually welcome it. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A second noteworthy point is that the summit was not dominated by the otherwise ubiquitous special interests. True, many of the resource people were members of the special-interest crowd; the AFT's Al Shanker and NEA President Keith Geiger were both there, but they were among a silent throng at the back of the hall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In an era overwhelmingly dominated by politics--indeed, in an era in which "politics" has become a dirty word -- it is hard to overestimate the importance of the simple fact that the summit was the product of private, not public, interest. That may account for the relative isolation of the special-interest groups at the summit itself. Ironically, there was concern in some conservative circles that the summit was no more than a new generation of "robber barons" working their will on a malleable and hapless populace. Perhaps, but a more realistic analysis is to take Gerstner of IBM and his fellow CEOs at face value. They are genuinely worried about the future of America and are convinced that, left to their own devices, schools will not spontaneously reform. If not CEO pressure, then whose?  If not now, when?  To suspect them of sinister motives is a bit much, particularly when their professed motives are manifestly reasonable. Parents, whose children have the most to lose in a failing educational system, need their help and should enlist them as allies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fact is that CEOs are interested parties, not parties-at-interest, and they come as close to being disinterested as any reformers can. They are the ultimate consumers of the schools' product and have a real stake in school performance. Equally important, they don't want problems; they want solutions and have no desire to tell anyone how to do it or what to do. They just want results. The CEO point of view is captured in David Kearns's comment when he was head of Xerox before joining the U.S. Department of Education as former Secretary Lamar Alexander's Deputy Secretary: "If the schools educate, business will train."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MANY A SLIP BETWIXT CUP AND LIP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is the ostensible and what is the likely outcome of the summit?  In this case, they are likely to be the same. There is actually reason to believe that something will happen as a result of the summit. No one in America is more results-oriented than CEOs; they are serious, and about this they mean business. The governors too; they are now in it so deep that it would be hard to pull back. Indeed, the issue is not withdrawing, but just what it is they will do and when they will do it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The communiqu produced by the summit was reasonably clear about the next step: the creation by the governors of a national--not federal--clearinghouse (or "war room," as Governor Thompson called it) that would be going full-bore within two years. Designed to serve the states, it would keep everyone up to date on standards, but its more important function would be to set the stage for meaningful comparisons among states. Then we -- and the governors--would know who is "world-class" and who is not. Discussions about the clearinghouse have already begun; to be sure, there are numerous practical decisions to be made, not least who will pay for it and will "it" be a new or existing organization?  While logic would suggest that an existing organization should assume that role, candidates are not so obvious as they might at first appear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most logical is the Education Commission of the States (ECS), created three decades ago by then North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford and James Bryant Conant, former Harvard president and author of <i>The American High School Today</i>. ECS's mission was to keep Washington at bay, a task at which, to no one's surprise, it failed utterly. A sort of <i>estates general</i>, its membership included governors, chief state school officers, state legislators, and sundry interested citizens. ECS quickly became a part of the establishment and today is a flaccid institution. If ECS was too broadly conceived to maintain any focus, the National Governors' Association (NGA) suffers from the opposite problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the summiteers seemed to have no interest in passing the standards baton to either ECS or NGA. In the closing comments at least, the governors asserted their interest in a wholly new organization, one that would exist for the sole purpose of promulgating standards and comparisons. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the communiqu did not call for a state "wall chart," it is hard to imagine state comparisons without one, and we may soon witness states actually participating in comparisons, the one with the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was missing at the summit?  Ironically, two points of view were virtually absent. One is the national (not federal) perspective that Diane Ravitch, a sensible conservative reformer, ably represents. In her post-summit wrap-up, she laments the absence of this view. Who needs fifty sets of standards?  Diane asks. Who indeed?  For better or worse, it is my strongly held view that we do need state, even local, standards and that the issue of "fifty standards" is moot. We will not have Nevada math and Maryland math, Oregon English and Florida English; Americans in each state and locality will quite naturally gravitate to similar standards, and insofar as differences may emerge, they will probably emerge for good reason.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real danger of national (not federal) or state (not local) standards is that they will be forced to a lowest common denominator by political pressures. True, the absence of national or state standards would permit lackadaisical school districts to continue in their feckless manner, but the presence of high standards in neighboring districts will have a salutary effect. It may put some starch in slackers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Be that as it may, the most important point of view not represented at the summit (except in a brief reference by Lynn Cheney) was old-fashioned localism or, as it is characterized in education circles, local control. That governors and CEOs would not be naturally drawn to this point of view is no surprise; modern CEOs are as likely to think in global as local terms, and governors by virtue of their jobs, think in statewide terms. This is not to say that either is opposed to local control, just that the terms of the discussion were cast as state-level concerns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a powerful statewide dimension; in all the states, education is a state constitutional responsibility, and education typically consumes more than half the state budget. Only in a few outliers like New Hampshire is the state role tiny; less than ten percent of New Hampshire's education spending comes from state sources. At the other end of the scale is Hawaii, the nation's only statewide school system (though, thanks to the interaction effects between Proposition 13 and the <i>Serrano</i> school finance case, California is virtually a statewide system). Even in these situations, however, education is quintessentially a school-based (even schoolroom-based) enterprise, and the role of the state in standard setting should be approached with the utmost circumspection. The obvious danger is standardization, a fate to be avoided at all costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts and school buildings must be on the front lines of standard setting for several reasons, not least because they must live with them. Governors, chief state school officers, and state legislators have an understandable interest in setting standards, but they should resist the temptation to impose them on school districts. Standards cannot be parachuted in; schools must "own" them if they are to have any lasting effect. Equally important, the process of setting standards at the local level is a powerful trainer and community builder. If teachers and parents are involved in setting standards from the beginning, they both learn about them and support them. Knowing what they are and how they are to be put in place lends reality to the idea that standards will have consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most powerful and useful role for the state will be in developing standards "advisories": model standards, templates even, for local school districts to use as they engage in the standard setting process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The logic of local standard setting is not "let a thousand flowers bloom," though there will be some of that. The logic is ownership, because as each community works through the standard setting process, each community's standards will be substantially like each other's. So too, each state's set of "advisories" will be like every other's. There are two reasons for this. First, there exists among Americans a high degree of social consensus about what young people should know and be able to do. For example, most Americans would agree that to earn a diploma, all students should be able to read and understand a news story in a national news magazine, a national newspaper, and their local paper. They should be able to count and compute; understand plane geometry and algebra; read, write, and speak standard American English; and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There will be differences, to be sure. The citizens of Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example, may want their graduates to know solid geometry and trigonometry, not just algebra. The citizens of Seattle, Washington, may want their graduates to master marine biology and vulcanology, while their counterparts in Arizona may be more interested in desert ecosystems. Citizens in Texas will want graduates to know Texas history and geography to a level of detail that other communities will not. And so on. So much the better. This is not a difference to be ignored or suppressed, but one that should be applauded.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, even insofar as there are regional differences in subjects like history and literature, the foundations are much the same. A high standard requiring mastery of historical material and methodology can be satisfied using very different content. The study of literature is made richer and more rewarding by attending to local writers. So too with science standards. It would be altogether sensible for each area of the country to emphasize its strengths; Arizonans might master the scientific method and meet high science standards by emphasizing Canyon geology and water erosion, just as residents around the Great Lakes might emphasize the impact of glaciation. Finally, there is no California algebra or Illinois chemistry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>TEACHING TO THE TEST</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the assessment and consequences parts of the standards agenda are attended to with enthusiasm, the issue of who sets the standards is less important than who asks the test questions. Ultimately, that is what standards are all about. If the tests and measures are carefully crafted and calibrated, they will do a world of good, for the assessments actually set the standard. Indeed, that is what the old bromide about "teaching to the test" is all about: If it is a bad test, so much the worse; if it is a good test, so much the better. One way to think about it is this: The test is the interrogatory form of the standard; the statement of the standard is the declarative form. What this means in practice is that the test must be a solid instrument, because many people--employers, school board members, taxpayers, students, teachers--will come to rely on it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The questions must seek and measure "world-class" knowledge and skills, and they must do so in a world-class way. Which is to say, the tests must de-emphasize the true-and-false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks format. The only reason for such a format is low-cost, high-speed scoring -- administrative convenience. It is noteworthy that adults are not tested this way in the real world. The tests we must meet are performance-based: Do we measure up?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Schools--and the institutions that test them and their students--will need to reintroduce the written and spoken word: essays, declamations, auditions, performances. Again, that is how we are measured after school. School measures should be no different.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>BENCHMARKING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The issue of assessment raises the most important aspect of standards--seeing that they are met, holding people accountable. To do this sensibly requires tests and measures that are reliable. Put simply, standards and the tests used to measure them must permit comparisons, both among schools in a district and among districts in a state as well as among schools in different states and between states. Governors must be able to boast (or complain) about their states' academic standings as readily as they do state university football scores. Without the capacity to compare each other with some precision, the whole standard setting exercise will be worse than moot; it will be an exercise in futility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, the German Republic provides an example of this in action. A federal system, the German states, or <i>Lnder</i>, are entirely free of federal control, and federal funding as well. Like their American counterparts, who have a Council of Chief State School Officers housed in Washington, D.C., the Germans have a similar council housed in Bonn (soon to move to Berlin). But there the similarity ends. The German council meets and confers to keep the national government at arm's length; they will not tolerate national intrusion in <i>Land</i> affairs. At the same time, the German council members use their forum to compare themselves to each other, which they do with gusto. America's governors can--and should-- take a page from the German book. At the turn of the old century, we borrowed <i>kindergarten</i> from the Germans; as the new century approaches, it is time for another learned borrowing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What remains is for the governors to push hard on the assessment front. Their task, difficult but within reach, is to see that state assessments permit both intrastate and interstate comparisons. Without the capacity to do so, standard setting will be for naught. Ironically, the place for them to turn is the federal government and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board, the operation has gained the respect of most observers of the passing scene. It has been genuinely bipartisan, and its members have acted responsibly and prudently. The NAEP is almost all we have to go on as a nation, and it would be wise both to strengthen it--for national-level data and analysis--and to permit states and school districts to tap into the data stream so they can learn more about themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, that is the crux of the matter: When schools and school districts want to learn more about themselves, when they actively want to know how they compare where they are strong as well as weak, then the momentum for change will grow. Whether or not the summit will ignite that spark remains to be seen.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GRASSROOTS REFORMERS?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the final analysis, the summit was wonderful theater, but the heavy lifting of school reform remains to be done. Who will do it and where will the work be carried out?  It will be accomplished school-by-school, district-by-district, by involved citizens. They will make it happen. To be involved, they must know what is going on and what needs to be done. First, citizens across the country should welcome CEO and gubernatorial interest; it is genuine and may even be useful. Certainly, governors like Thompson, Romer, and Engler, who were central to the summit planning process, are serious about reform. So too were the CEOs. And while their perspectives will differ to some degree, all will respond to citizen interest and activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three things that should happen at the grass roots, then. Citizens everywhere should take the pledge to support:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
High academic standards;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Realistic tests and measures to see that students are meeting those standards; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What does this mean in practice?  Standards must be set and met locally. The state is not much better than Uncle Sam when it comes to local control. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty as regards both the state and federal governments. To be sure, states can play a more constructive role than Washington, but they should not engage in a command-and-control relationship with local school districts. It is not only bad politics; it is worse pedagogy. The freer schools are to do their own thing, the better off they are. Standards templates, or advisories, can be designed at the state level and made available to local districts but should not be imposed on them. If the standards are realistic and useful, local districts will flock to them. If they are not, they will not. And properly so. So too with tests and measures. To see that the standards are met, school districts must adopt tests that fit their standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this connection, there are two interlocking issues. Local districts should adopt tests that are consistent with the standards they have adopted. Not every district will want to (or be able to) design and adopt tests unique to it. In this case, the state can offer technical assistance and advice but should not impose its will on local districts. Again, to do so would be bad politics and worse pedagogy. The state does, however, have a reasonable and proper interest in knowing how much its students know, and should support statewide testing to provide both state and district information. Such tests should be developed cooperatively with local schools, but should permit the governor to brag about the state's overall performance. Without such information, the cause of school reform will falter and eventually founder. And the information--once it is available -- will be invaluable to local schools. If anything, they need it more than the state does. No business could do without high-quality performance data, and schools are no exception to this general rule.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is one final note that everyone must attend to, and that is the one issue that was not on the table at the summit: <i>education choice</i>. Its absence was duly noted by several governors in attendance, but the ground rules made it impossible to bring it up. No such ground rule works at the local level. Bring choice up, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is crucial to the standards debate. Indeed, without choice the standards debate is almost sure to become an empty exercise. There is simply no reason to believe that every school in every district in every state will hold itself to the same high standards; it can't be done politically, and it can't be done logistically, at least not in the next two decades. Only highly centralized school systems like those of France and Japan even attempt such an approach, and it is not clear that it works in those countries. And the American commitment to local control rules out any centralized solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE BLESSINGS OF THE MARKET</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The alternative to command and control is a market, whether it is purely private, as many of us would like it to be, or regulated, a mix of public and private providers. Markets have two overwhelmingly important characteristics. First, they are exquisitely calibrated communications systems, letting willing buyers and sellers know what good or service is available at what price in what quantity and quality, and letting each know what the other would like; second, as Schumpeter declared, they permit "creative destruction."  Inefficient, corrupt, and ineffectual organizations disappear. That's what markets are all about. That is why in a market the consumer is sovereign. That is why cost doesn't determine price.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To create a system of high academic standards, and schools which are safe and disciplined, there must be choice among schools. Schools themselves must be able to choose to have high standards and to deliver on them. Just so, parents and students must be able to select schools that measure up and select out of those that do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempting to push standards down from the top will not work any better than the endless skein of failed reforms that already litter the education landscape. But double-joining standards and choice can work. Indeed, it is the last, best hope of school reform.

<title> Speaking for Hong Kong-- Heritage</title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 563</b>

<hr>
<p>
<b>By The Rt. Hon. Christopher Patten</b></p> 
<p>
Given May 7, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong is very fortunate to have so many friends and well-wishers in the United States. Over the next 14 months and beyond, Hong Kong is going to need its friends in the United States and elsewhere. Hong Kong needs the understanding and the support of the United States as it progresses through the most testing period of its history, the final months before July 1, 1997, and the transfer of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China. I have come to Washington this week to talk to our friends about an issue which is crucial to Hong Kong's ongoing economic and social success. As you all know, I have come to Washington to put Hong Kong's case--let me repeat that--Hong Kong's case for the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I want to make this point absolutely clear right at the start. I have not traveled to Washington to speak on behalf of the People's Republic of China. It is not for me to put China's case for the renewal of MFN status. Nor is it for me to defend China's record on human rights, on arms proliferation, or its trade practices. These are matters which Chinese officials must address, not the Governor of Hong Kong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not saying that Hong Kong has no view on these issues. On the contrary, Hong Kong has very strong opinions about human rights and about free and fair trade. Our record as a pluralist society based on the rule of law and our record as probably the most open economy in the world tells you all you need to know about where we stand on these issues. My task today and during the rest of my visit to the United States is to speak for Hong Kong, to put, as I have said, Hong Kong's case for MFN renewal, and I shall do so with all the force that I can command.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I shall be putting two arguments to everyone I meet. The first is an argument for the preservation of a fundamental trade principle. The second is an argument for the preservation of jobs and livelihoods in Hong Kong. Let me start with principles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Round about the turn of the last century, the Patten family, my forbears, decided it had a principled position on the pressing issue of poverty. They did not like it, so they left Ireland and set off for Manchester. Now Manchester, during the last century, was the epicenter of a free trade earthquake which shook protectionism everywhere. Manchester was so committed, some might say obsessed, with free trade as a political issue that it named its principal place of public assembly the Free Trade Hall. This is the only example that I know where a city named one of its public buildings for a proposition from economic theory. That is, of course, unless I missed the opening of the Milton Friedman "Tight Money" concert hall in Chicago recently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Manchester won the free trade argument, and, as a result, the first great free trade revolution occurred after 1846 under British leadership. During the following 30 years, international trade increased by more than 300 percent. History repeated itself and the second great revolution in free trade occurred exactly a century later. This revolution took place under American leadership and started in 1946. Again, the value of international trade increased by more than 300 percent in the following 30 years. It was the United States which made this 20th century expansion of trade and prosperity possible. The United States provided the world with unstinting aid directly and through almost every multilateral organization. The United States also provided resources and incentives to emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere and kept its huge market open to the export products of these economies. At the same time, American business invested enormous amounts of capital in the reconstruction of Europe and Japan and in developing economics everywhere, but particularly in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic, social, and political consequences of this American free trade leadership have been profound. You need look no further than Hong Kong to understand what it has meant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has enjoyed 35 years of unbroken economic growth. During this time, our per capita GDP has increased by 530 percent so that we are now on a par with Canada and much of Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has put its growing prosperity to good use. We provide tertiary education places for 24 percent of each generation of students--up from about 3 percent 10 years ago. Our health care standards are now fast approaching the standards of Western Europe and North America--and some of our health indicators are actually better. We have invested in our people and invested heavily in our infrastructure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, hard work and a high savings ratio have been important. But it was free trade-- access to the United States market in the post-war years--which gave Hong Kong, and many of our neighbors in Asia, their big break. Without the liberal trading environment created under the GATT and now continuing under the World Trade Organization, there would have been no German, Japanese or, more recently, Southeast Asian economic miracles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has been true of the past 50 years will, I think, be true of the next 50 years. American leadership will be as vital in maintaining the momentum of free trade during the first half of the 21st century as it has been during the second half of the 20th century. And a crucial test of this leadership is the one which most concerns Hong Kong. The issue can be simply stated: Can the United States and China establish and maintain a normal trading relationship?  I say normal trading relationship because, of course, MFN status is the international norm. The alternative is an abnormal trading relationship between the United States and China, and that, it seems, would be in no one's interests, certainly not Hong Kong's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me make Hong Kong's position absolutely clear. We are not suggesting that the United States, or any other country which shares your and our values, should soft-pedal on the other major issues in the relationship with China. Human rights are at least as important as trade relations. Nor can there be any higher priority for all of us than controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nor can there be any doubt that trade practices must be fair or that intellectual property rights must be protected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But I believe that MFN should be used as a key to achieve progress on all of these issues, not as a weapon. MFN status should be allowed its opportunity to facilitate progress on all of these issues. By contrast, I believe, withdrawal of MFN status would hinder, rather than promote, such progress. The policy of engagement adopted by the United States seems to me, and seems to the community for which I speak, to be the only policy which offers the possibility of making progress on the full range of issues in the U.S.-China relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I said earlier that I wanted to preserve a principle and that I wanted to preserve Hong Kong jobs. This second argument for renewing China's MFN status is, to put it bluntly, a matter of special pleading. Hong Kong is now so closely integrated with the Chinese economy that anything which damages the relationship between the United States and China, our two largest trading partners, is certain to injure us. Specifically, if MFN is not renewed, Hong Kong stands to lose about 90,000 jobs and up to half of our forecast annual growth in GDP. I recognize that Hong Kong's economy is flexible and that we would recover from such a blow in time. But the blow would fall at a particularly difficult time for Hong Kong. It would come just as we are about to start the final year of the transition to Chinese sovereignty, at a time when Hong Kong is particularly vulnerable to shocks to confidence in its future and we can least afford a setback to our economic fortunes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There might be people here today who wish Hong Kong well on MFN, people who are concerned to give Hong Kong the best possible chance of making a success of its future as a Special Administrative Region of China, people who think that putting conditions on the renewal of China's MFN would in some way help Hong Kong to achieve this. I want to say to you in the clearest possible terms: Thanks, but no thanks. I am not aware of any community leader in Hong Kong who advocates anything other than renewal of China's MFN without conditions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The message I bring from Hong Kong on MFN is this: If you want to help Hong Kong, please listen to what we are saying on this crucial issue and saying unanimously. To any of our friends and supporters in Washington or elsewhere who are tempted by the idea of MFN conditions, I say to you on behalf of the whole community in Hong Kong that you will not help us by damaging our economy and damaging confidence in our future. The best way to help us is by renewing MFN and by continuing the policy of engagement towards China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have not pointed and will not be pointing to the economic consequences for the United States of any deterioration in the trade relationship with China as a result of not renewing MFN or of attaching conditions. This is a matter for Americans, not for the Governor of Hong Kong. I will make only one tangential observation and leave it at that. I am no economist, and I do not claim to be an expert on the theory of comparative advantage and free trade. But I hope that I have got the basics right, perhaps because my family absorbed some of Manchester's free trade zeal, or perhaps just because I read Adam Smith. And the basics are that free trade is beneficial to those who practice it regardless of what others do. If I may paraphrase a 19th century French economist, to argue that the United States should be protectionist because other countries do not practice free trade is like saying that you should block up your harbors because other countries have rocky coasts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas Jefferson once said that no country was ever ruined by trade. He was right, but quite a few countries have been damaged by protectionism. The essential point I want to leave you with today, ladies and gentlemen, is that Hong Kong has lived and prospered by free trade. Please do not do anything to jeopardize Hong Kong's trade, Hong Kong's prosperity, or Hong Kong's future.

<p>
<b>THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history behind the Chemical Weapons Convention is a long and tortuous one. It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Among the earliest attempts in modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague Convention. Approved by the European powers, the convention prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition had little effect. After the war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production, and stockpiling. Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan. Unlike the 1907 Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke out. Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders, particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any chemical attack. It is one of history's clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S. honors its terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975. It is, however, a weak agreement. If countries violate it, they remain unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first. Some states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several occasions since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union and its clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in 1971 when the U.N. Conference on Disarmament's predecessor organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. This allowed for the conclusion in 1992 of the Biological Weapons Convention, which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the back burner for well over a decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S. military. The subsequent U.S. program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of chemical weapons to Third World countries. In 1984, Australia proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons. This proposal was made to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic development policies for the Third World. The Australians wanted participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third World. Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to individual governments. The "Australia Group" now has 29 members, including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has limited its effectiveness. For example, the enforcement of the export restrictions falls to individual member governments, but industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they enforce export restrictions. In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol (used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, and Britain is reported to have sold thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. Both transfers were contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the Australia Group. Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President George Bush came to office determined to ban chemical weapons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce the chemical stockpiles of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to 5,000 metric tons each. No accord, however, was reached outlining inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. That was left to subsequent negotiations, which were supposed to be completed by December 31, 1990. This deadline passed without agreement between Moscow and Washington, and the "bilateral destruction agreement" has yet to be brought into force. This failure, to some extent, was due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing politically. Further, both sides were aware that progress was being made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection procedures and would ban the weapons entirely. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the setbacks at the bilateral level with Russia, President Bush announced on May 13, 1991, that the U.S. would agree to a complete ban of chemical weapons even if some other nations did not eliminate their arsenals. Bush also pledged that the U.S. would forswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, including situations in which U.S. forces are attacked with such weapons first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible retaliation. This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere" inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track. The final draft of the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva. It was signed in Paris by more than the 65 countries required for ratification to bring the convention into force, including by the United States. Now the Senate, in fulfilling its role to advise and consent to all treaties, must decide whether the United States will ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
<p>
<b>PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think it would be useful to review the content of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The purpose of the convention is to ban chemical weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use by participating states. It would do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons production facilities within the same ten-year period. The convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form toxic chemicals), or facilities that are used for peaceful purposes. Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may be retained for the development of defenses against chemical weapons. These chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into weapons. The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. agency that fosters cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power. In a similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the representatives of all states participating in the convention. It will establish general policies for implementing the convention and will oversee the functions of the organization. The second will be the Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve geographic balance. The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the inspections to verify compliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at The Hague. Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes into force. Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have included finding a building to house the agency, establishing inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the 1995 budget for the Preparatory Commission was roughly $17 million, of which the U.S. paid 25 percent. Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will operate at a cost of about $200 million annually. On the basis of a 25 percent contribution, U.S. taxpayers could be expected to pay $50 million annually to support this international organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat are vast. The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities are destroyed. The Technical Secretariat also is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities are not used to develop and produce weapons. The Verification Annex outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical Secretariat. The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical weapons are destroyed. The second is to verify the destruction or conversion of chemical weapons production facilities. The third, fourth, and fifth kinds of inspections are to detect whether certain types of chemicals have been used in building chemical weapons, based on how easily each of three categories (schedules) of chemicals can be turned into weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the convention. The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites where chemical weapons may have been used.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At first, the U.S. demanded that so-called challenge inspections be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected. It ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for so-called managed access to suspect sites. Under this provision, the inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long as they do not involve evading the convention's terms. In order to protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers; shroud displays and equipment; log off computers; restrict the types of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent samples; and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular areas at a suspect site.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The inspection process is long and involved. It starts with OPCW officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as weapons sites. The declaration must be filed with the Technical Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into force. Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must begin within two years and must be completed within ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and monitoring devices to guard against a violation. Similar procedures, such as for placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical production facilities have been destroyed. As many as 1,000 inspections a year may be required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Operating this complex arrangement of inspection regimes will prove costly to U.S. industry and the government. According to expert David Evans of Analytic Services, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia, U.S. industry can be expected to incur costs of between $20 million and $200 million annually to support the inspection process. The higher costs are more likely in the early stages of implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. But this general cost to industry assumes that everything goes as planned. If the mechanism in the convention to protect proprietary and other sensitive business information fails, Mr. Evans estimates that the cost to business could exceed $1 billion annually. The U.S. government will have its responsibilities for implementing the convention as the national authority serving as an intermediary between industry and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The cost of these activities to the U.S. government is estimated to be $25 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on compliance. The Executive Council bears the responsibility for demanding that a participating state redress a violation. If corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention. This could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the right to vote in the Conference of State Parties. In more serious cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken. For example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut off. In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council. Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of final appeal in the enforcement process.

A FIVE-PART TEST OF ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To deserve the support of the Senate, any arms control agreement should pass a five-part test. This test should serve to determine whether a particular arms control agreement meets the minimum standards necessary to serve the national interest. The test consists of five questions, all of which must be answered affirmatively when applied to a particular agreement to insure that it does not contain a fatal flaw. These five questions are: 1) Does the agreement reduce the risk of war?  2) Are the agreement's requirements consistent with U.S. global security responsibilities?  3) Is the agreement adequately verifiable?  4) Is the agreement enforceable?  and 5) Does the agreement enhance national security?  The Chemical Weapons Convention fails to pass this test in all five particulars.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #1: Will the Chemical Weapons Convention reduce the risk of war?
<p>
ANSWER #1: By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the Chemical Weapons Convention may increase the likelihood of war or result in the escalation of an existing conflict.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of arms control. Reducing the risk of war is far more important. Arms control agreements should not be destabilizing. It is counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by reducing arms, only invites attack.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security. But the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can deter a chemical attack. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of violence. The Chemical Weapons Convention, although unintentionally, will encourage escalation in two ways. First, chemically armed enemies, knowing that the U.S. and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have little incentive to refrain from using such weapons. They will enjoy a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are likely to use it. Second, the convention may increase the likelihood that nuclear weapons will be used. Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack on U.S. forces. While it is prudent to reserve the right to use nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #2: Are the Chemical Weapons Convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?
<p>
ANSWER #2: The Chemical Weapons Convention, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the Cold War over, the U.S. is the world's sole superpower. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal. In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate interests of other states. But America's global responsibilities also mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major conflicts. The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood that chemical weapons will be used against U.S. forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same manner. It assumes that U.S. troops face the same likelihood of chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica, which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty. In this way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which the U.S. and four other nations (Britain, China, France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different from all other nations. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty accounts for the special responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs. The Chemical Weapons Convention also could have done so, simply by adopting the same discriminatory approach established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #3: Is the Chemical Weapons Convention adequately verifiable?
<p>
ANSWER #3: Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be adequately verified.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an impossible task. In a devastating report prepared for the Defense Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated: "Detecting most types of cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be highly unlikely, if not impossible."  This committee itself was notified of the problems with verification during a June 23, 1994, hearing. At that hearing, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey stated: "But, still, the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<p>
<b>QUESTION #4: Are the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention enforceable?
<p>
ANSWER #4: Violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention are likely to go unpunished.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not enough. The U.S. also must be able to do something if other countries are caught violating the agreement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to address the question of enforcement. It states that unspecified sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention, either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or by the United Nations. Ultimately, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement. Starting in the early 1980s, the U.S. acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet Union of violating the Biological Weapons Convention. Yet the U.S. never lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with resolving the Biological Weapons Convention's enforcement problems just as it would under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason for this inaction is clear: If the U.S. had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the U.N. Security Council. China and Russia will have an equivalent veto authority against enforcing the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention as they pertain to their programs.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #5: Does the Chemical Weapons Convention enhance U.S. national security?
<p>
ANSWER #5: By making arms control an end in itself, the Chemical Weapons Convention will not serve to protect U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This question establishes the most important test of arms control. Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. It should never be thought of as an end in itself. Reduced arsenals are not always better. A comprehensive security strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations, as well as arms control. In short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic test. The convention requires that the U.S. completely abandon its chemical deterrent. But this requirement will not enhance U.S. security. Since no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons. And since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global chemical disarmament. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if, as a practical matter, other nations still possess them. By way of analogy, would it be in the U.S. interest to conclude a similar agreement relative to nuclear weapons?  Such an agreement would require the U.S. to dispense with its nuclear arsenal even though some other countries may retain nuclear weapons. This is no longer an academic question. India, among other nations, is demanding that the U.S. commit to such an agreement in principle at the negotiations over banning nuclear tests at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The precedent set by U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention would indicate that the U.S. is willing to accept a similar agreement attempting to ban nuclear weapons.
<p>
<b>TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY: THREE PRINCIPLES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not just an arms control agreement; it is also a non-proliferation agreement. As such, it carries important implications for U.S. non-proliferation policy. While the U.S. has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, an effective counter-proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone. A truly effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying chemical weapons and weapons facilities. As the Senate considers the merits of the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on the following three principles. 
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #1: The need to deter a chemical attack.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate for chemical attacks against the U.S. or its allies. This retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S. with chemical weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention would deny the U.S. the capability to retaliate in kind for a chemical attack. America therefore would be left with only two options in case of a chemical attack: 1) to escalate the conflict by launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical and non-nuclear) arms, or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons. But the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to deal with these options. Not only is it cutting the conventional forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that nuclear weapons have a role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #2: The need for defenses against chemical weapons.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always work. Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint. Therefore, the U.S. needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. U.S. forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and decontamination kits, and they need to be defended as well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There certainly is room for improvement in chemical defenses. The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons. Although some progress has been made in improving the chemical defense posture of U.S. forces during the intervening years, it is unlikely that all the vulnerabilities cited by Mr. Davis in 1991 have been eliminated. As for defenses against the delivery systems used to launch chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile defense program by more than 50 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons Convention will make it politically difficult to field better defenses. In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S. would forswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. After the Nixon decision, the U.S. biological defense program withered. This outcome was not the result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention outlawing defenses; it was the result of constant criticism of these programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention surfaced during the Persian Gulf War. An interim report to Congress on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are sure to lobby against defenses. The argument will go that they are not needed because chemical weapons have been banned.
<p><b>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a chemical attack. U.S. armed forces can destroy preemptively an enemy's chemical weapons and weapons facilities with air strikes and other forms of offensive combat operations. Targets for such strikes should include chemical production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with chemical munitions. Destruction of the production facilities and storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S. and allied forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should be required to devise a comprehensive strategy for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war. It can do so by continuing and improving Pentagon programs already underway. The Air Force has conducted "sensor to shooter" experiments with the aim of devising a system for directing attacks against enemy forces within minutes of detection. The Navy has an equivalent concept called the "cooperative engagement capability."  These programs need to be coordinated and focused on destroying the weapons and forces capable of delivering chemical munitions.
<p>
<b>REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement. Likewise, the existing U.S. policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. Neither is solely the fault of the Clinton Administration. The decisions to conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S. policy toward countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration has chosen not to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration. As the Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt a different approach. It can do so through the advice and consent process established by the United States Constitution for approving the ratification of treaties. As it does so, it should consider that:
<p>
<b>1. A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two treaties serve as models for agreements on controlling weapons of mass destruction throughout the world: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty. It seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy biological weapons. But it is now known that the Biological Weapons Convention was violated by the Soviet Union from the beginning. Further, a report issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on May 30, 1995, states that China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia, and Taiwan either definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention. In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to determine with absolute precision because compliance with the convention cannot be verified. Further, the report states that Egypt and Syria may have biological weapons programs. These two countries have signed but not ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. Thus, despite the evidence that other countries retained biological weapons, the U.S. has destroyed its biological deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been relatively successful. While it has not prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly. Today only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states have nuclear weapons. More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty did not require the elimination of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by sending the treaty back to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted. The Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step. The Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed. If this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it is modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second alternative available to the Senate. The advice and is not limited to approving or disapproving ratification. The Senate can amend the text of a treaty. Through this amendment process, the Senate itself can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Doing so would require amending the convention in several articles. After adopting these amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification. The practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the Senate. Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the treaty.
<p>
<b>2. A new policy is needed to deter chemical weapons strikes.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will not address the threat to U.S. security posed by chemical weapons. This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy adopted by the Bush Administration. The policy established by President Bush on May 13, 1991, essentially committed the U.S. to the unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal. This policy should be dropped, and the U.S. should state it will preserve the broadest possible array of responses to a chemical attack, including retaliation with conventional military means, an in-kind response, and, in the most extreme circumstances, a nuclear response. Further, it should not describe the specific circumstances under which it will resort to any particular response, in order to retain the greatest deterrent effect possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make these changes in U.S. chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can take actions that result in the same changes. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. chemical deterrent. Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification -- that declares that the U.S. reserves the option of retaliating against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. It must be acknowledged, however, that in order to adopt such a reservation the Senate may first be required to strike Article XXII of the convention. Article XXII bars reservations. Striking Article XXII is something that should be of general interest to the Senate in any event. Barring reservations narrows the freedom of action of the Senate in terms of its advice and consent role. The Senate should not accept any provisions in this convention or any future treaty that so limits its freedom of action.
<p>  
<b>3. U.S. defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted. In fact, the convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defense programs. The danger is that the implementation process will be hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate can counter these pressures on U.S. chemical defense programs in three ways. First, it can provide adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs in the annual authorization and funding bills for the Department of Defense. But since the funding question is under the jurisdiction of other Senate committees, the Foreign Relations Committee may prefer to focus on establishing clearly defined standards for the military in terms chemical defense preparedness. A condition could be attached to the resolution of ratification that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the Department of Defense has met the requirements for improving chemical defense preparedness made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting Office in testimony before Congress. These include meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into the overall training program for U.S. troops. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate should also set requirements for improving U.S. defenses against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks, particularly ballistic missiles. This must include a requirement for the development and deployment of missile defenses capable of effectively destroying chemically armed ballistic missiles in the boost phase. The Senate could force this outcome by adopting a condition requiring the Administration to propose such a boost-phase defense for deployment by a specific date.
<p>
<b>4. The U.S. capability to destroy chemical weapons production and storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical weapons, should be improved.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending U.S. and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack. These can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at enemy positions. For example, countering enemy artillery firing chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and control networks and destroying chemical production and supply facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an effective deep strike capability. Many command and control centers, for example, were destroyed by U.S. air power in and around Baghdad. But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made. For example, the U.S. had trouble countering Iraqi mobile <I>Scud</I> missiles with air power. To deal with this problem, the military services, and the Air Force and Navy in particular, have launched programs which are focused on enhancing the U.S. ability to strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities. The Senate should direct the Department of Defense to coordinate these programs and focus them on countering weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including chemical weapons. The Senate again has the option of adopting a condition during its advice and consent process that forces the Clinton Administration to continue these programs and gear them to meeting the weapons of mass destruction threat.
<p>
<b>5. The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three problems with U.S. policy for enforcing compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention has a built-in conflict of interest in terms of enforcement. By establishing the U.N. Security Council as the court of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members to veto any pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged violation. Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example -- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem can be resolved by redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since the redrafted convention would establish declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these states be the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second enforcement problem is that the U.S. historically has been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control treaty partner. Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.S. did not take the proportionate steps allowed to it under international law. Thus, the violations went unpunished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Solving this problem will require a change in the government process for handling these issues. Currently, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations, but there is no requirement for follow-up. Ultimately, the law could be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after the report is issued. This would guarantee a substantive response once a violation is discovered. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This can be dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack. This is the ultimate insurance policy, but it can be maintained over the long term only by the actions of a Congress determined to fund and supervise America's defense programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including the U.S., are weapons states. It also requires a policy under which the U.S. reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons, in addition to conventional means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the best example in history of a successful deterrence policy came during World War II. Despite the existence of chemical arsenals, chemical weapons were not used widely during that conflict. The reason: The Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. may now be throwing away this successful policy. By adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention and declaring a unilateral policy of neither maintaining nor using chemical weapons, even in retaliation, the U.S. would eliminate its chemical deterrent even though it could never be sure that potential enemies have taken equivalent steps. U.S. national security interests demand that this process be reversed. The U.S. must not abandon its ability to deter attacks with chemical weapons.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When the new Congress took charge in January 1995, the House and Senate leadership promised fundamental overhaul of the federal government. Included among the many proposed reforms was the closing or consolidation of redundant and obsolete government agencies. The most visible manifestation of this effort was the call by House freshmen to shut down the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Energy, and Education. Although this initiative was associated most closely with the more junior members of both houses, the goal of streamlining government by terminating programs and closing agencies also was embraced by the leadership, with Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) endorsing the Senate freshmen's plan to close four departments.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sharp contrast to its record in past years, this time Congress actually followed through and achieved more than most observers expected, shutting down over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. This performance is illustrated by the action taken on 41 independent agencies recommended for termination in a January 1995 Heritage Foundation study because of their obsolescence, redundancy, limited value, or regional focus.<sup>1</sup>  Excluding the five independent agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process,<sup>2</sup> Congress's record for the remaining 36 is:
<P><ul>
<li> 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years.<p>
<li> Funding for 12 agencies substantially reduced (by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years.<p>
<li> No change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million saved over the next five years.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By taking significant action on 25 (or 70 percent) of the targeted agencies, this Congress reversed years of inaction on outmoded programs that had enjoyed uninterrupted growth in their budgets. Of the 11 agencies sheltered from significant cuts or termination, all but one -- the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was tripled -- saw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while Congress has done more than its fair share to reduce government waste, the President has opposed many of these efforts by vetoing five of the appropriations bills; a sixth is stalled in the Senate, threatened by a filibuster. Because these six bills contain most of the proposed agency terminations, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to this progress in dealing with the 41 agencies cited in the January Heritage report, considerable success was achieved in dealing with scores of other obsolete programs, many of which were identified in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, the Heritage blueprint for a radical downsizing of the federal government.<sup>3</sup>  In the Cabinet departments reviewed in Rolling Back Government, 251 programs or program offices were shut down or consolidated, and another 56 were cut significantly. In addition, Congress shut down eight programs within the legislative branch. Program terminations and reductions of this magnitude, in addition to being unprecedented, are a key component of Congress's $23 billion overall reduction in discretionary spending from last year's level.<sup>4</sup>4
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is obvious that tremendous progress was made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs during the first session of the 104th Congress, but much more can be done. Congress and the President should revisit many of the independent agencies that survived, including those that were substantially reduced, and make additional cuts and terminations as appropriate. Reformers should keep an especially close watch on those agencies that are scheduled for shutdown or consolidation to guard against end runs in Congress and last-minute presidential vetoes designed to keep these unneeded programs in business. 
<P>

<b>THE CRITERIA FOR CLOSURE</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When reviewing government programs for possible phaseout and funding reductions, lawmakers in each case should assess the program's value and whether it is truly national in scope. This means asking four questions:
<P>
1) Is the service provided by another government department or agency?
<p>
2) Is the agency amenable to management efficiencies through consolidation?
<p>
3) Can the agency's responsibilities be justified in an era of competing needs and limited resources?
<p>
4) Is the agency's principal focus of regional rather than national interest?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of the wasteful replication of public services include the many different agencies and offices tasked with nuclear safety. One of these, the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiation, was allowed to go out of business last year. Among the many similar agencies that remain are the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (the largest and oldest), the newer and much smaller Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the Presidential Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear Disasters. In addition to these overlapping independent agencies, the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Performance Assessment, Office of Nuclear Safety Enforcement, Office of Nuclear Safety Policy and Standards, Office of Radiological Oversight, and Division of Transportation and Packaging Safety all perform similar functions. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While one could argue that there is no such thing as too much nuclear safety, this scattershot approach, with independent offices spread throughout Washington, means costly replication.<sup>5</sup>  More troublesome from a safety perspective is the potential for unintentional lapses and gaps in oversight because of divided responsibility, communications difficulties, and excessive overhead at the expense of safety initiatives. Typical of this problem is the recent disclosure that the Department of Energy wasted $59 million on an uncompleted "Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement." <sup>6</sup>
<P>

<b>Achieving Efficiency Through Consolidation</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even when the specific responsibilities of independent agencies are decidedly different, their functions may be sufficiently similar to allow for management efficiencies through consolidation. This can reduce costs and allow more federal financial resources to go directly to the intended beneficiaries rather than to administering bureaucrats. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of federal administrative redundancy include the scholarship funds established to honor prominent Americans. The Barry Goldwater Scholarship Foundation and the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation, while worthy in purpose, are also top-heavy with bureaucratic burdens that diminish their ability to achieve their mandated purpose. According to the President's FY 1996 budget, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation will spend $1.13 million to provide $2 million in scholarships, and the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation will spend $986,000 to provide just $1,008,000 in fellowships to students. A dollar spent on excessive administrative overhead is a dollar denied a student or scholar. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A better way to honor America's leaders would be to consolidate these scholarship programs within a single foundation or existing agency already involved in making academic grants, such as the National Science Foundation or the Department of Education. This would reduce overhead costs substantially. Given the modest size of each of these programs, it makes no sense to maintain five separate accounting departments, five mailrooms, five travel budgets, five costly executives, five executive assistants, and five versions of all the other services needed to operate a scholarship program. 

<P>
<b>Low-Priority Agencies </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other independent agencies perform functions that, while possibly interesting and important to a few, cannot be justified in an era when available government resources are far short of what is needed to satisfy more pressing national goals. If the Department of State and Department of Defense are fulfilling their missions adequately, taxpayers are entitled to ask why additional millions of dollars are spent on the Institute of Peace, the North-South Center, or the Japan-United States Friendship Commission. Apparently many Members of Congress agree, because two of these agencies were subjected to significant cutbacks last year. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, do the President and Members of Congress really need a Commission of Fine Arts, at a cost of nearly $1 million a year in salaries and administrative expenses, to advise them on matters of architecture, painting, and sculpture?  Apparently they still think so, because the 104th Congress chose to keep it fully funded for another year. Fortunately, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities were not so lucky; they were subjected to major cuts last year. 

<p>
<b>Agencies of Regional Interest </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some programs have purely regional benefits and no national impact. Examples are the several independent agencies conducting special programs for specific East Coast river basins, such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. These programs may have some significance for specific states or regions, but they provide little direct value beyond that. Congress apparently agrees, because all of these regionally focused agencies are scheduled to shut down or lose their federal financial support this year.
<P>

<center><h2>STATUS OF AGENCIES IN THE HERITAGE REPORT</h2></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Below is a brief summary of the 36 agencies identified in the January 1995 Heritage study. In each case, the review indicates what action has been taken, how much money will be saved for taxpayers over the next five years, and whether the White House has signed the necessary legislation into law.
<p>
<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Close Down</h3></center>
<P>
<b>Administrative Conference of the United States
<P>
Purpose:</b> Assists the President, Congress, and federal departments in improving the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures used within government and with private citizens.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the general agreement within Congress and the executive branch on the need for a fundamental overhaul of the way government does business and serves the public, it is apparent that the Conference has little to show for the millions of taxpayer dollars it has spent in its 30 years of existence. The Commission should be abolished in favor of more comprehensive and more promising efforts being considered in Congress or recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference and appropriated $600,000 for 1996 to cover the costs associated with the shutdown. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $9.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the legislation into law.

<p>
<b>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
<p>
Purpose:</b> Examines federal, state, and local trends, events, and programs that affect intergovernmental relations and makes recommendations as appropriate.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite its stated purpose, the Commission has never played a serious role in the debate concerning levels of government in the federal system. Key debates and decisions on issues such as revenue sharing, unfunded mandates, interstate commerce, and transport generally have been handled elsewhere as mayors, governors, Congress, and the President work together to resolve problems and develop policy.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference, and $784,000 has been appropriated to cover termination expenses and final work products.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $4.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.

<p>
<b>Commission on National Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1990 to encourage all citizens, especially young people, to engage in community service. Makes grants to states and other entities to create service opportunities for students and out-of-school youth.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America has an extensive tradition of volunteer work and charitable giving, most of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars for the federal government to encourage Americans to do what they already are doing in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> The Commission was merged last year into the Corporation for National and Community Service, which Congress has scheduled for termination this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Approximately $250 million to $300 million, based on FY 1995 spending of $54.4 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is necessary on the Commission, but President Clinton has vetoed proposed termination of the Corporation, as discussed below.

<p>
<b>National Community Service Program
<p>
Purpose:</b> As one of two main components of the Corporation for National and Community Service, this program is supposed to encourage Americans to engage in volunteer work and community service. President Clinton's AmeriCorps is part of this program and exists to pay stipends and other financial benefits to "volunteers."
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's extensive tradition of volunteer work does not require federal involvement or financial support.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to terminate the Corporation's National Community Service Program. (See next section for proposed cutbacks in other programs operated by the Corporation.)
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $2.862 billion. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Delaware River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with basin states -- Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania -- in the development of regional water and related resources. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The benefits of the Commission's activities accrue mostly to the contiguous states in the Delaware River Basin. Therefore, these states should fund the program in its entirety. There is no reason for federal taxpayers to fund costly programs of strictly regional interest and benefit.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress ended federal support for the Commission this year and has provided final payment of $343,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $4.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this bill into law. 
<p>

<b>FDIC Affordable Housing and Bank Enterprise
<p>
Purpose:</b> Offers select properties in inventory to eligible households and organizations for low-income housing. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The Enterprise competes directly with the objectives and programs of HUD, as well as with those of numerous state and local programs with a similar purpose. Experience demonstrates that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has had a difficult enough time pursuing its main purpose -- promoting the safety and soundness of banks -- and ought not to involve itself in the difficult task of attempting to house the poor. The Enterprise should be terminated or consolidated with similar housing programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to terminate the program, arguing that "[g]iven the plethora of housing programs already in existence through HUD and other federal housing agencies... the Committee questions the value of yet another program, no matter the merit of its intent." 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $82.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides Native Americans with an opportunity to obtain post-secondary education in various fields of Indian art and culture. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> It is unwise for the federal government to be in the business of directly funding studies in one culture in preference to others. Existing student loan and grant programs from other sources can be used to support post-secondary education for eligible students through accredited institutions of learning. The program should be terminated or consolidated with other scholarship funds or related programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Institute with $5.5 million this year, compared with $11.5 million last year, with the understanding that federal funding will be phased out. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $56.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which terminated the Institute.

<p>
<b>Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin
<p>
Purpose:</b> Created on behalf of the four contiguous states and the District of Columbia to promote water pollution abatement and control and manage water and land resources in the Potomac River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Responsibility for the funding and management of this commission should rest entirely with the District and the affected states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Commission with a payment of $511,000 as final year funding for the orderly transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To find a state or Indian tribe willing to host a nuclear waste site. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with other independent agencies concerned with nuclear issues, this office should be consolidated with another independent agency, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or with the appropriate division within the Department of Energy or the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Office was allowed to expire in early 1995. A number of these agencies are scheduled to self-destruct, and no specific congressional action is required. Indeed, as last year's government shutdowns indicated, most discretionary programs are of this nature.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1 million per year.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action required.

<p>
<b>Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation<P>


Purpose:</b> Performs a variety of real estate development functions, including design, land acquisition, and construction of projects related to the improvement of the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor connecting the White House with the Capitol.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Since its creation in 1972, the Corporation has invested millions of tax dollars in this one-mile stretch of road, turning the once-decrepit strip of deteriorated buildings into one of <I>Scenic America</I>'s ten "Most Scenic Byways."  Although this task was fulfilled years ago, the Corporation continues to receive substantial public funds for commercial real estate development activities best left to the private sector.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the Corporation by April 1, 1996, and has authorized the use of prior year funds to facilitate the shutdown. Real estate development in progress will be transferred to the U.S. General Services Administration. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $245 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill terminating the Corporation. 

<p>
<b>State Justice Institute
<P>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1984 to make grants and undertake activities to improve the administration of justice in the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Continued high crime rates and public disappointment in the behavior of the court system over the past several years suggest that the Institute has not much to show for its costly ten-year effort to improve America's administration of justice.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress appropriated $5 million to provide for the orderly phaseout of direct federal support. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $67.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included termination of the Institute.

<p>
<b>Susquehanna River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with affected states in the development of water and related resources in the Susquehanna River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As with similar commissions, the responsibility for funding and management should be turned over to the contiguous states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to withdraw federal support from the Commission and provided $318,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $1.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.
<P>

<b>Thomas Jefferson Commemorative Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Established to honor the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. The anniversary occurred in 1993.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite the passing of the anniversary three years ago, $31,000 was scheduled to be spent in FY 1995 and another $25,000 in FY 1996 for post-birthday events. Because it has met its stated objective, there is little or no reason for the Commission to exist.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Commission was allowed to expire, and no federal spending is scheduled after this fiscal year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $500,000.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is required to fulfill such a previously scheduled expiration.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Cut Substantially</h3></center>
<P>

<b>Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides independent advice to the President and Congress relating to the national historic preservation program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Historic preservation, including the development of appropriate policies, should be a local responsibility. The only exception might be for landmarks of national significance, and these cases can be handled by the U.S. National Park Service and its Division of Cultural Resources.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has voted to reduce the Council's FY 1996 funding by 15 percent, down to $2.5 million from last year's $2.94 million, and advises the Council to find ways to be reimbursed by government agencies for which it provides a service. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included this funding cut.
<p>


<b>Appalachian Regional Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Provides guidance and financial assistance to the 13 Appalachian states for basic facilities and support to promote economic growth in the region. Programs focus on transportation access and on community, business, and human development. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although it is one of the more costly independent agencies, there is no convincing evidence that the ARC, after more than 30 years of operation, has been effective in creating new jobs or capital investment. In practice, it serves largely as a source of pork-barrel spending for the region's politicians. West Virginia, a focus of much of the Commission's attention, is still poor and becoming poorer relative to the rest of the country. The per capita income of West Virginia's population ranked 43rd in the country in 1980 but fell to 46th by 1994, and its unemployment rate is consistently one of the highest in the country. It is time to try something new for the problems of West Virginia and other Appalachian states -- such as tax cuts, enterprise zones, school choice, and deregulation.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action: </b> Finally recognizing the failure of pork-barrel projects to spur growth, this Congress slashed the Commission's budget by 40 percent, appropriating only $170 million for 1996 compared with $282 million last year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $568.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
<p>
Purpose:</b> Advises the President and Secretary of State on arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament activities and participates in negotiations with other countries. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As a product of the Cold War, ACDA largely has fulfilled its mission by a series of nuclear, conventional, and chemical weapons agreements. For many years, ACDA has been overshadowed by other U.S. agencies, particularly the State, Energy, and Defense Departments, in its pursuit of disarmament. The Agency is outmoded and duplicative and should be abolished, with arms control issues mandated to other, more appropriate agencies.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has reduced the Agency's budget by 34 percent, cutting it from $54.4 million last year to $35.7 this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $101.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Corporation for National and Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service focused on the nation's educational, human, public safety, and environmental needs.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given America's proud tradition of volunteerism and charitable giving, much of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations, it is a waste of federal dollars to encourage Americans to do what they already do in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the largest of the Corporation's programs, the National Community Service Program, which includes AmeriCorps (see previous section). The House and Senate have yet to agree on spending for the Corporation's Domestic Volunteer Service Programs, which include such programs as VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America); the Senate has passed cuts from 1995 levels of 6 percent, while the House has reduced spending by 14 percent.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $71.5 million (Senate bill) to $154 million (House bill). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> An earlier version of this bill was vetoed by President Clinton. The appropriations bill in which these cuts were proposed is stalled in Senate.    
<p>

<b>East-West Center
<p>
Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the U.S. and the nations of Asia and the Pacific through cooperative programs of study, research, and training. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The resources and talents of the State Department, which maintains a network of embassies and consulates in Asian and Pacific nations, should be sufficient to maintain good relations with these countries. Deficiencies that remain not likely to be rectified by the cooperative programs of the Center. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Center's budget by more than half (52 percent), reducing this year's spending to $11.75 million from $24.5 million in 1995. The House actually proposed to terminate the Center; the large cut reflects compromise with Senate. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $70.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included this cut.

<P>
<b>Institute of Peace
<p>
Purpose:</b> Conducts and supports research and scholarship in the fields of international peace and conflict resolution. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although the world remains a dangerous place, responsibility for maintaining and enhancing peace should remain with the State and Defense Departments, in cooperation with Congress and the multilateral organizations to which the United States belongs and contributes. The scholarly endeavors of the Peace Institute replicate, at taxpayer expense, the efforts of academics and private research organizations concerned with international relations.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> A successful Senate filibuster against the appropriations bill that would fund the Institute makes the outcome uncertain; the House voted for a nearly 50 percent cut, while the Senate proposed to maintain funding at last year's level. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $16.1 million assuming House-Senate conferees split the difference and cut the Institute's budget by nearly 25 percent.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Legal Services Corporation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Funds private attorneys, nonprofit organizations, and state and local agencies to provide free civil legal assistance to the poor. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Financed in part by federal dollars and tasked with providing legal representation for the poor, Corporation-supported lawyers and grantees frequently have used their positions and resources to pursue political and lobbying activities. These efforts have included such things as legal action against welfare reform, Proposition 187 (California's immigration reform), and state and local tax reductions, to name just a few. Given its history of political activism, and given the substantial funding the legal services system receives from non-federal sources, taxpayer support should be ended and the Corporation privatized.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Corporation serves largely as a source of federal tax dollars for approximately 323 locally based grantees -- such as the Legal Aid Society of Central Texas and the Food Research Action Center -- that do the actual legal work. In addition to receiving taxpayers' money through the Corporation, these grantees in 1993 also received an additional $245 million from other sources, including IOLTA (Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts) funds, state and local grants, and private and nonprofit contributions. Moreover, the legal profession provides significant amounts of pro bono work for needy clients and social issues. A privatized Corporation easily could build on this extensive funding base and work with state, national, and local bar associations to secure and enhance IOLTA and other private or nonprofit funding for grantees and provide a tighter focus for their representational work.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of rapid spending growth, this Congress has achieved what many thought impossible by enacting significant cuts in the Corporation's budget, reducing it from $400 million in 1995 to $278 million this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $680.5 million.  
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included this cut.

<p>
<b>Marine Mammal Commission
<p>

Purpose:</b> Coordinates America's marine mammal policy, reviews the status of the marine mammal population, and recommends conservation steps to relevant government departments. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> No other form of non-human life, endangered or otherwise, has its own commission. This costly precedent should be terminated. Existing federal programs, such as NOAA's Coastal Ecosystems Health and Recovering Protected Species programs, are tasked to perform similar responsibilities, as is the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress passed legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 14 percent, from $1.4 million in 1995 to $1.2 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides payments for general operating support to Washington, D.C., arts and other cultural organizations. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Citizens of Washington, D.C., and visitors to the city are the beneficiaries of major federally supported arts and cultural programs well in excess of what is available in other cities. Washington's culturally rich environment would scarcely notice the loss of this $7 million taxpayer-funded program.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 20 percent, from $7.5 million last year to $6 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $8.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>
<b>National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Umbrella organization for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum Services. The NEA provides grants to and contracts with groups, individuals, and state and regional organizations engaged in or concerned with the arts. The NEH funds activities intended to improve the quality of education and teaching in the humanities.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> In recent years, Americans have had good reason to be concerned about efforts to promote government-sanctioned art, from public commissions to approve or reject architectural design, to requirements that some portion of a building's construction budget be devoted to art, to the bureaucratically approved and funded art of the NEA. The NEA should be closed down and American artists encouraged to turn their energies to winning private support for their creative endeavors rather than engaging in political grantsmanship.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Similarly, the NEH recently demonstrated its questionable judgment by producing, among other things, a breathtakingly distorted curriculum for the teaching of American history, thereby confirming the worst fears of those who argued that federal involvement in education would promote propaganda rather than the search for truth. It is time to terminate the NEH before doctrinaire bodies like the National Committee for History Standards further undermine education and the appreciation of American culture.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of escalating spending, Congress finally has made deep cuts in the budgets of the NEA and NEH. These cuts reflect a comprise between the House and Senate, with the House preferring to terminate these programs within the next two years. In the compromise plan, the NEA's budget, including its matching grant program, will be cut 39 percent from $162.3 million in 1995 to $99.4 in 1996; the NEH budget, including matching grants, will be cut by 35 percent, from $172 million in 1995 to $112 million this year, yielding potential five-year savings of $333.2 million and a total of $682.5 million over the next five years for both agencies.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $349.3 million (NEA) and $333.2 million (NEH).
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
<p>
Purpose:</b> Responsible for developing plans to meet the library and information needs of the nation, and for coordinating federal, state, and local government activities to meet these needs. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's system of libraries -- most of them locally based and supported -- is the envy of the world. Moreover, the rapid technological advances taking place within the information industries promise unprecedented access to a wealth of information at modest cost. Much of this rapid change is driven by the profit-seeking private sector, and there is little need for government involvement, financial support, or expert guidance. The federal government's greatest contribution would be to get out of the way and not try to "coordinate" the explosive innovations in information technology.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final number, if they choose to split the difference between the two positions, the Commission's spending will be cut by 30 percent, from $901,000 in 1995 to $639,000 in 1996. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.5 million (assuming final funding midway between the levels voted by each chamber)
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The appropriations bill that includes these changes is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>North-South Center</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the United States, the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada by bringing together scholars and students for cooperative study, training, and research.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> This program should be terminated in favor of long-standing activities of the State Department designed to sustain and improve relations within the Western Hemisphere. Improved commercial links, helped by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the NAFTA, and increased private contacts by business people, academics, journalists, and tourists render the Center unnecessary. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress cut the Center's budget in half, saving $2 million this year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $11 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies That Escaped Significant Cuts</h3></center>

<b>Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad
<p>
Purpose:</b> Encourages the preservation of cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings associated with the foreign heritage of the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>To reduce overhead and administrative cost, this task should be handled through the Foreign Service and cultural attaches in relevant U.S. embassies, using local contractors as appropriate.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission of Fine Arts
<p>

Purpose:</b> Advises the President, Congress, and department heads on matters of architecture, sculpture, painting, and other fine arts, particularly as they relate to the appearance of the nation's capital. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Congress already has its long-standing office of the Architect of the Capitol, whose skills, resources, and capabilities are more than adequate to the task of providing advisory services, either directly or through referral, for Members of Congress, the President, or any Cabinet head needing expert guidance and advice on the fine arts. The Commission does not create art; it reviews and judges the work of others, a role best played by the public at large at no cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level, despite the fact that the Commission's $834,000 budget is applied only to salaries and administrative expenses.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission on Civil Rights
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages in studies concerning areas in which there may be denials of civil rights, and reports on these matters to the President and Congress. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> The Commission replicates the civil rights responsibilities of the federal government's many other civil rights offices, as described in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Commission's $9 million budget by only 3 percent and has not consolidated its operations with those of any other federal civil rights offices. 
<P>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included funding for the Commission.

<p>
<b>Corporation for Public Broadcasting
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides grants to qualified public television and radio stations, to be used at their discretion for purposes related to program production and acquisition. The Corporation was established in 1968 to provide additional programming and support to the nation's non-commercial radio and television stations. Public broadcasting now includes nearly 600 radio stations and 340 television stations. This extensive nationwide system receives more than 80 percent of its support from sources other than the federal government, with contributions from subscribers and business accounting for its largest and second-largest sources of income. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The CPB now provides 14 percent of the Public Broadcasting System's total financial support, the loss of which could be offset by greater reliance on other financial sources, improved management and administrative efficiency, and the elimination of low-priority programming and grant activities. The loss of federal dollars also could be offset by recouping some of the earnings of the many profitable production companies which share the subsidy and by selling commercial air time, particularly in time slots now devoted to CPB/PBS self-promotion and self-justification. Increasingly, CPB/PBS quality and content fall short of that available on the private sector's Arts & Entertainment Network, Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, and History Channel, as well as the growing number of competitors to CNN. These networks demonstrate that quality educational programming can be maintained in a commercial format and without federal financial support.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Unlike most other federal programs, the CPB is funded two years in advance, and this year's appropriation bills deal with FY 1998 funding. Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final 1988 spending target for the Corporation, their proposals either do not involve much of a reduction or would maintain current funding: The House proposes an 8 percent cut of $20 million, while the Senate would freeze the budget at the 1996 level of $260 million. Differences will not be resolved until a Senate filibuster against the Labor/HHS appropriations bill is broken.
<p>
<b>Three-Year Savings:</b> As high as $30 million (assuming the House and Senate split the difference); as high as $750 million (if the program is terminated). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Defense Nuclear Facilities Board<p>

Purpose:</b> Responsible for evaluating the content and implementation of standards related to defense nuclear facilities of the Department of Energy. Also investigates events or practices at defense nuclear facilities that may affect public health adversely. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>The Board is one of five independent agencies concerned with nuclear safety issues, as described in the introduction to this study. It should be consolidated with one of the other independent bodies concerned with nuclear arms and energy to improve congressional and executive branch oversight at less cost to the budget.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Board's budget by only $900,000, just 5 percent less than last year's $17.9 million. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> At least $5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Japan-United States Friendship Commission</b>
<P>
<b>Purpose:</b> Makes grants to promote scholarly, cultural, and artistic activities between Japan and the United States. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the extensive business, cultural, academic, diplomatic, and political relationships between the United States and Japan, there is no shortage of interaction between the citizens and institutions of these two countries. The Friendship Commission's activities are both redundant and a waste of money.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Both houses of Congress have voted to maintain the Commission at $1.2 million, the same level of spending as last year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> To formulate plans for a memorial to FDR. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Before his death, President Roosevelt requested that any memorial to him be simple, no larger than his desk, and placed near the National Archives. Although this request was fulfilled many years ago, Congress has persisted in trying to erect something grander. It should honor President Roosevelt by adhering to his request.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Notwithstanding FDR's request, the Memorial Commission is the only one of the 36 independent agencies discussed in this study to receive an increase in its budget -- in this case an increase of more than 200 percent to $147,000.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None; instead, taxpayers face a rise in spending of as much as $500,000 over the next five years if this is sustained.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the legislation that included this increase.

<p>
<b>National Capital Planning Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Central planning agency for the federal government in the national capital. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Washington, D.C., is unique among U.S. cities in having a federally funded planning commission to help guide its development. Whatever expertise this commission may bring to bear, however the economic and social environment of Washington still continues to deteriorate. In any case, planning activities should be undertaken by the D.C. government.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress would reduce the Commission's budget by only 9 percent to $5.09 million from last year's $5.65 million. This is in marked contrast to Congress's termination of the similarly mandated Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Commission.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation<p>

Purpose:</b> Performs a number of functions intended to reverse neighborhood decline, develop housing strategies, and replicate successful neighborhood preservation strategies.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Programs of the Corporation duplicate those of HUD, particularly now that HUD has established its Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program to focus resources more precisely on impoverished neighborhoods.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to maintain last year's funding of $38.7 million despite the Corporation's duplication of HUD's $4 billion Community Development Block Grant program. Congress should revisit the issue and apply to it the same standards it applied to the now-terminated FDIC Affordable Housing Program.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board
<p>
Purpose:</b> To evaluate the technical and scientific validity of the activities of the Department of Energy's nuclear waste disposal program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the responsibilities of this Board should be consolidated with those of another nuclear safety agency or department, as indicated in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain the status quo by making no change in prior year spending.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Office of Government Ethics
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides overall direction of executive branch policies designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure high ethical standards. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Recent significant ethical lapses within the executive branch and Congress suggest that the Office has been less than effective in imposing a higher ethical standard on government officials, notwithstanding the more than $8 million it spent in the last fiscal year. The enhancement of ethical conduct should be internal to each agency, and the monitoring of ethical standards should be the direct responsibility of the inspector general and general counsel of each department and agency. This ineffective Office should be terminated.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Despite this office's ineffectiveness, Congress has reduced its budget by only 5 percent to $7.7 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.4 million.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>

<b>TERMINATION AND CONSOLIDATION OBJECTIVES FOR THE FY 1997 BUDGET</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While this analysis recommends the abolition of just 41 of the approximately 130 independent agencies, this should not be construed as endorsing the activities of the other agencies or their current levels of federal funding. These 41 agencies were chosen as best representing those that could and should be terminated. Many others should be subjected to close examination, funding reductions, fundamental reform, or abolition according to the criteria outlined in this study. In most cases, agencies excluded from the current list are of a size and significance that require more exhaustive analysis. Among these, the Small Business Administration, General Services Administration, and Federal Communications Commission are just a few of the remaining independent agencies that should be reviewed by Congress for termination, substantial cutbacks, or major reform.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, Heritage Foundation analysts systematically reviewed many of the larger independent agencies, as well as the many divisions and offices within the Cabinet agencies. That study made numerous recommendations for program termination, privatization, consolidation, and reform, and many of these recommendations were adopted by the appropriations committees when they proposed the termination of 259 programs in last year's appropriations bills. Many were not, however, and those that were overlooked during last year's attempt at budget reform should be revisited this year as potential candidates for restructuring or elimination.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In preparing to shut down the federal government in November 1995, before President Clinton's veto of the second continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating, the Clinton Administration made the customary distinction between "essential" employees, who would remain on the job, and "non-essential" employees, who would be furloughed. For the U.S. Department of Education, the Clinton Administration determined that 4,394 of the department's 4,937 employees -- or 89 percent -- were "non-essential" and would be furloughed for the duration of the budget impasse.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unwittingly, the Clinton Administration confirmed what Congress should recognize: America does not need a federal Department of Education. Congress should take the opportunity afforded by the budget process to return to states, local governments, and parents the authority and responsibility for education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 19, 1996, President Clinton submitted a budget to Congress that requested a 7.2 percent increase in FY 1997 discretionary funds for the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.<sup>2</sup>  While the Administration makes certain attempts to realize savings through consolidation and reform of redundant and outdated programs, the proposal reflects an unquestioning commitment to an institution that has failed to prove its value in reaching the President's stated goal of giving "every single American citizen the education that all of us need to compete and win in the new century."  The education establishment has failed to demonstrate any positive correlation between federal education spending and education performance. It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education, not to spend more money in the hope that programs which have not worked in the past somehow will be made to succeed with increased funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1979 at the request of President Jimmy Carter, the Department of Education is doing precisely what its severest critics envisioned: usurping local and state control of education by slowly and steadily introducing federal programs, rules, and requirements. Although the department accounts for about six percent of total public funding of education, its influence is out of all proportion to its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education is inserting itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive, it is a metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful and meddlesome domestic programs. As Chester E. Finn, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Education during the Reagan Administration, noted in recent congressional testimony:
<p><blockquote>
	The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in Washington over the past several decades. The national government has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, that Washington knows best and is taking charge.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why should the U.S. Department of Education be eliminated?  Its time has come and gone. It is time to restore common sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thanks to the Reserve Powers Clause in the Tenth Amendment, all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. Education is such a power; a federal role is both gratuitous and intrusive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time to restore federalism to its founding principles, and there is no area more fruitful than education. Despite the desperate need for reform, there is no master template--certainly not one originating in Washington--to improve the schools. States and localities are "laboratories of democracy"; reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pedagogy - -the art of teaching and learning -- is quintessentially local in nature. Indeed, it goes on at the classroom and individual level. The closer decision-making is to the student and teacher, the better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role is costly as well as intrusive, requiring an expensive and burdensome bureaucracy to manage national programs. Washington should do only those things states and localities cannot do for themselves, such as national data collection and targeted research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most alarming aspect of growing federal control of education is not administrative interference, however, but its adverse impact on academic performance, equally the product of sins of omission and commission. The increasing power of special-interest groups, the burgeoning size of school districts, the refusal of the public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of education, general permissiveness, family dissolution -- all have played a role. At no time in American history has academic performance been more important. Yet, as the federal role has increased, education performance has declined. While cause and effect are elusive, and the department's supporters assert a variety of causes to explain the decline in student performance, these changes nonetheless occurred during, and as a part of, the federal ascendancy in American education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<a href="bg1076c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates how SAT scores have declined in the last 25 years as the federal role in education has increased. Since the creation of the department in 1979, scores have stagnated: In 1980, the national average was a combined 890; in 1994, the average was 910. What appears to be a small amount of progress could be attributed to changes in methodology on the SAT, which include a shortened test and permission to use calculators. In terms of graduation rates, the 8 percent of eighth graders who failed to complete high school in 1978 rose to 12 percent in 1992. In other measures of reading, science, and math ability, there has been some measurable improvement. When compared to the scores of other industrialized nations, however, it becomes clear that measuring success against where we were 20 years ago may not be sufficient if we still consistently lag behind other industrialized parts of the world, as <a href="bg1076c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates. The United States spends more money per elementary and secondary school pupil than any other country, with little to show for such an investment (see <a href="bg1076t1.gif">Table 1</a>). How education money is spent is as important as the amount spent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even if the federal role has not been directly responsible for education decline, this is clearly not the time to do more of the same. Taxpayers should realize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to "federalize" the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of education. At least since the advent of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, federal involvement in education has been designed to make each state more like the others.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the descent to the lowest common denominator has been relentless. The inverse relationship between education performance and an increasingly intrusive federal education bureaucracy is so pronounced that it invites the most profound skepticism about any significant federal role in education. It is time for Congress to close down the Department of Education, reassign appropriate federal functions to their proper place in the national government, and return authority to those who really should be responsible for the nation's schools.

<P>
<b>THE ORIGINS OF THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<P>
<b>A Limited Federal Role</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1867, the federal government created a Department of Education to gather and disseminate statistics in order to improve the nation's public schools. The department was modeled after the Department of Agriculture, created in 1862 as a free-standing, sub-Cabinet-level federal agency, and was tasked with promoting the cause of education by publishing statistical reports and comparisons of school effectiveness. A bitter debate surrounded the establishment of the department as a free-standing agency, for although it was tasked only with data gathering and dissemination, many feared that it would grow to challenge state control of public schools. A coalition of Democrats and a wide spectrum of Republicans fought to abolish the department soon after its creation, and a compromise was reached, under which the office was moved to the Department of the Interior in 1868. The office continued to exist, but its influence was tempered by a Congress that allowed only modest increases in funding and personnel. Throughout the following century, amid several name changes and reorganizations, the agency played a carefully limited role in the development of federal education policy, with the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor departments also performing education-related functions.<sup>4</sup>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the Office of Education grew, and so did its mission. In 1947, in the <i>Everson</i> case the U.S. Supreme court set the stage for increased federal involvement in education, establishing a precedent for federal involvement in state and local school policies by limiting public support for religious schooling. Two decades later, President Johnson's War on Poverty sought to improve the quality of and access to education with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. ESEA empowered the U.S. Office of Education to aid schools in low-income areas and strengthen state departments of education.<sup>5</sup>  The office performed analyses of state and local educational trends and gained authority to enforce racial discrimination guidelines. And while the Office of Education did not control curriculum, it supported a number of curriculum reform projects -- "new math" and MACOS (Man, A Course of Study), for example -- that were both intrusive and ineffectual. As the office distributed funds at the local level, it also required evaluations of regulatory compliance. No longer was the Office of Education merely a "statistical secretary" to the nation's schools.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1970s, education groups lobbied heavily for a Cabinet-level Department of Education. The National Education Association had long supported the creation of a Cabinet-level agency but had little support from Congress. President Jimmy Carter, in an effort to keep a campaign pledge, sought its creation soon after his inauguration. Overcoming opponents, supporters of a Cabinet-level department prevailed in 1979 with the Department of Education Organization Act, which passed easily in the Senate (72 to 21) but narrowly in the House (210 to 206).<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. Department of Education was created for the least defensible of reasons: politics. The education establishment desperately wanted its own Cabinet-level department, and creating it helped cement their political ties to liberals in Congress. In turn, a more pronounced federal role would raise the visibility of education and lead to more and more federal involvement in policymaking and funding. With such a dynamic in place, state and local education would become increasingly federalized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Department increased the power of education interest groups, however, two decades of test scores show that public education has become progressively weaker and more ineffective. As Chester Finn observes:
<p><blockquote>
	It became clear that the authors want to substitute decisions made in Washington for decisions made by individual households and communities. They create new governance mechanisms and regulatory apparatus at both national and state levels. They use federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the very forms of behavior that other parts of the legislation term "voluntary."  They throw obstacles onto such promising reform pathways as school choice and private management of public schools. They transform what has been a national movement into a federal program.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education thus was not, and is not, a child of carefully reasoned policy or pressing national need. It was the product of politics and is an instrument of interest group political power. That is why it behaves as it does. The calculus is straightforward: President Carter made a political promise and kept it. After decades of existence, a cautious and careful professional association -- the National Education Association (NEA) -- became politicized in the 1970s and 1980s. Determined to create a national education presence, the NEA had one overriding agenda: "one-third, one-third, one-third."  By this, the NEA meant that each level of government -- local, state, and federal -- would provide one-third of the total dollars for education.<sup>9</sup>  It also wanted a Department of Education to increase central control of education through an agency that would be influenced by organized teachers and administrators rather than parents. In exchange for the support of the National Education Association for his candidacy, Jimmy Carter and his liberal allies in Congress delivered a Cabinet department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ironically, the department's severest critics included those who regard themselves as among American education's best friends. The concern at the time is best captured in <i>Washington Post</i> editorials opposing the creation of the department nearly 20 years ago:
<P><blockquote>
	If the House does agree to enshrine an insulated, supergraded federal educational bureaucracy in the Cabinet, the results are likely to be so costly and unhealthy for American education that many representatives, in retrospect, will be embarrassed to admit that they voted "yea."<sup>10</sup>
<p>

	We are not one-time offenders in this business.... [W]e are, in fact, hardened criminals, hopeless recidivists and probably -- why mince words?  -- incorrigibles. We have been fighting the creation of a separate Department of Education since 1953 [and] we remain adamantly opposed to the creation of this new department. We think it is an awful idea and nothing that has been said or that has happened in the last 26 years has given us reason to think otherwise -- including and especially the Carter administration's campaign in favor of it.<sup>11</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason for such a reaction was that President Carter's proposal was startling even by Washington standards. There simply was no compelling organizational reason to create a Cabinet-level Department of Education, except to usurp state and local power -- a claim not even the most ardent supporter would make in public. It was a simple political payoff, obvious to everyone. Joining the <i>Post</i> in its opposition to the new department was the Committee Against a Separate Department of Education, created by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Made up of education, research, labor, and civil rights groups from across the country, and including prominent figures such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), the committee was afraid that the new department would have a baleful effect on America's long and successful tradition of local control of education. According to Moynihan, the department was a result of a "backroom deal, born out of squalid politics."<sup>12</sup>  Gregory Humphrey, director of legislation for the AFT, likewise declared: 
<P><blockquote>
	 We believe this is a hoax. It will not result in the improvement of education anywhere. [Test scores and literacy measurements] are the things people think of when they want an improvement in education -- not who talks to the President and when, or how many assistant secretaries can dance on the head of a pin.<sup>13</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this criticism, when President Reagan proposed to abolish the department just two years later, he was barely able to find an author to carry his legislation. The abolition proposal vanished without a trace. Congressional support for a Department of Education was no stronger than when the Department had been created, but just as Congress had little energy or enthusiasm for creating the department, it could not marshal the resolve to dismantle it. The new <i>status quo</i> triumphed. 
<p>

<b>A DEPARTMENT IN SEARCH OF A JUSTIFICATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The failings of the Department of Education (and the Office of Education before it) have been sins of omission as much as sins of commission. It is not just that Department officials foisted such things as "bilingual education" on an unwilling nation; the department also forfeited tremendous opportunities. Had it been a force for a constructive new federalism, it could have partially justified its existence as a "bully pulpit" for reform and academic excellence (as it was under Secretaries William Bennett and Lamar Alexander). But for most of its 18 years as a Cabinet department, it has been simply a handmaiden of special interests. Not surprisingly, the Department of Education is a department for producers (educators), not customers (parents and children). The problem is organic and institutional, and is not simply a function of lackluster political appointments.

<p>
<b>The National Interest in Education</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a national interest in education: a compelling national interest in high quality education for all Americans, of all backgrounds and from all regions. But that interest is best served by a vigorous federal system, not by centralization. The states are and should be "laboratories of democracy"; to force them into the same mold does violence both to America's constitutional traditions and to the very nature of education. It misconceives both. If, for example, there were one best system by which to educate everyone, a uniform federal role might have some basis in logic if not in practice. The French (who invented modern bureaucracy) and the Japanese are among those who make such a claim; but among Americans, a uniform federal role, except in a carefully delineated fashion, has always been understood to be bad policy and worse practice. A robust federal system offers unparalleled opportunities to reform and improve education, state by state, community by community. As each state learns more about reform within its own borders, other states are free to learn from its reforms and avoid the pitfalls of the less successful. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The argument for state and local control of education begins with the Constitution and ends with common sense. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government, and education is quintessentially a state and local matter. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, education has been understood as a transaction between student and teacher. Everything else -- school districts, school boards, state rules and regulations, the federal role -- should be supportive, designed to assist teacher and student. Yet, as any candid observer must admit, a public school system, like any bureaucracy, tends to become insular and self-serving. The fault is not in teachers, but in the structure within which they must function. Unfortunately, the federal role reinforces this unhappy tendency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The further control is removed from the classroom, the greater the danger that teachers will be frustrated and students (and their families) shortchanged. Of all social activities (such as health care, criminal justice, housing, transportation, and economic policy), schooling is the least likely to profit from centralized control. Yet that has been precisely the goal of federal involvement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, adding a federal dimension has not solved lower-level bureaucratic problems within the system -- it has made them worse. Not surprisingly, just as "command-control" economies have failed around the globe, command-control schools are failing. At issue is a deceptively simple administrative principle: decentralization. In the world of business, this means that those who are closest to the workplace should make as many decisions as possible. In the world of public administration, it means the same. Each unit of government should do what it does best -- and only that. Higher units of government should yield as much power as possible to lower units, and must be able to defend -- in terms of efficiency or justice -- whatever functions they retain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps most important, the states have grown dramatically in their ability to deal with problems and seize opportunities. Not only have state legislatures become modernized, and state governors increasingly more sophisticated, but most states now have well-organized citizen watchdog groups and state and regional think tanks that provide oversight and policy guidance.<sup>14</sup>
<P>

<b>The Lack of Need for Federal Intervention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the Department of Education been created for compelling policy reasons, had serious problems been successfully addressed, had something "broken" been fixed, or had student performance climbed upward over the past decade and a half, perhaps some federal involvement in education could be defended. But only a weak political defense was advanced at the time, and no intellectually serious defense is being advanced now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No government agency should be allowed to continue indefinitely without having to justify itself to the people's representatives. Each one should be required to demonstrate that it is doing something worthwhile -- in other words, to convince Members of Congress that it is worth preserving. Members of Congress should ask themselves three basic questions: Would the U.S. Department of Education survive serious scrutiny if forced to justify itself?  Has it improved American education significantly?  If Congress were starting from scratch, would it create the same bureaucracy that exists today?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role in education emerged in waves, in response to crises perceived or real. In the modern era -- after the GI Bill, a program to support and reward veterans of World War II -- there were five major waves: first, under President Dwight Eisenhower with aid to higher education, a military/economic response to Sputnik; second, under President Lyndon Johnson with the Great Society; third, under President Richard Nixon with limited federal support for research and development; fourth, under President Gerald Ford with P.L. 94-142, a bill to aid handicapped children that created radical federal intrusions into the classroom by making education a federal civil right; and fifth, under President Jimmy Carter with the decision to upgrade the Office of Education within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to a separate Cabinet-level department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other programs have been added, but with the notable exception of special education, the broad contours of federal education policy were established under the Great Society. The announced reason for this was equity -- racial and economic justice. A long history of state indifference -- and even outright hostility--to the rights of black Americans finally mobilized a powerful constituency for federal intervention in education. Even though education is clearly a state and local function, both in terms of practice and in terms of policy, and as important as local control is, racial justice formed a higher claim, one that must be honored. But just as tough cases make bad law, moral fervor is no guarantee of balanced and effective legislation. As Finn notes,
<p><blockquote>
	There were genuine quantity-and-access problems at the time, and it was legitimate to enlist the national government in their solution. But the world has changed in the three decades since these programs were born and these assumptions fixed in policy. The essential nature of the education problem facing the United States is altogether different today.<sup>15</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Preempting the States.</b> Put bluntly, the task for the Carter Administration and liberals in Congress was to circumvent the Tenth Amendment, which specifically reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government. Education is such a power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The effect of this limitation is quite dramatic. Any federal role in education, insofar as it exists at all, is conditioned on one of two things: either some larger federal role, such as civil rights, or money. In the case of civil rights, the states must bend to federal law. But in all other areas -- curriculum, organization of instruction, homework, discipline policies, testing and measurement, or the hiring and firing of teachers, for example -- the amendment implies that the federal government can do no more than offer states and localities money and specify the terms. In other words, no compliance, no money; states and localities are free to refuse the funds, and Washington is free to withhold them. That is the theory. The reality, however, is that few states or localities refuse federal funds; the temptation of the "money power" has proven to be nearly irresistible.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Embedded in this broader debate is the "Mississippi problem."  Historically, the federal government treated all states equally; a rule for one was a rule for all. At one level, this is a sensible policy response in a federal system -- the equal treatment of equals. But the federal role in education was not motivated by such considerations; it was motivated by the conviction that there were vast disparities among the states that must be remedied. In this context, treating all states equally caused important problems. By default if not design, Mississippi became the benchmark. At the time of the Great Society, Mississippi was the poorest, lowest spending, lowest achieving, most racially segregated state in the nation. As the largest of the federal government's initial forays into education, Mississippi set the bureaucratic pace for everyone else: the lowest common denominator policy. Management by exception was never entertained; there would be one bureaucracy for all. And so it has remained.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No matter that some states were more sophisticated and enlightened than official Washington, or that Washington bureaucrats had no claim to superior knowledge or virtue; each state would march to the same drummer. The appeal of "free" money proved to be nearly irresistible. State after state accepted official Washington's largess, and few if any appealed to their congressional delegations to change the rules. It was one-way federalism.
<P>

<b>RESTORING THE PROPER FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one irresistible impulse of any bureaucracy is to assume power -- indeed, to usurp power -- to serve its own internal dynamic. Put slightly differently, bureaucracy is designed to institutionalize the suspension of judgment, and bureaucracies do precisely what they are designed to do. They are "one-size-fits-all" institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given the predilections of bureaucracy and the fragility of the education process, what is the compelling reason for a federal Department of Education?  Is Washington more virtuous, more competent, more equitable, more knowledgeable, more capable, more caring, more decisive, or more clever than states and localities?  Make no mistake: That is the issue. Only something of this magnitude justifies federal involvement in education.<sup>18</sup>  By way of illustration, it is clear that there is an overriding federal responsibility to guarantee the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school and out. The same is true of national data collection; Washington is better equipped to collect and display the data than any state or locality -- indeed, than all states and localities. In this case, of course, official Washington is the proxy for all states and localities. At the other end of the scale, however, is the management of classroom instruction, curriculum, and textbook adoption. In the best of circumstances, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice. To control classroom management in Washington does violence to everything that we know about education; its only justification must be political, not pedagogical. And a political justification is, on its face, indefensible.
<P>

<b>Legislative Initiatives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of the House desiring to eliminate the department generally fall into two camps: those who believe it should be eliminated entirely and those who think it should be merged with the Department of Labor and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The only bill currently under consideration is one that would terminate the department, although there may yet be a merger bill. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1883:">Back to Basics Education Reform Act</a> (H.R. 1883) sponsored by Representatives Joe Scarborough (R-FL) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), seeks to abolish the Department of Education within one year of enactment. The bill rolls all elementary and postsecondary education programs that are not terminated into two separate block grants to the states that are authorized for four years. These grants would be administered by a new Office of Educational Opportunities (OEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services, which also would run student aid programs, IDEA, and other programs not terminated or transferred elsewhere under the bill. The programs transferred to the new OEO would have their administrative accounts reduced by 30 percent, based on their FY 1995 appropriations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Abolishing the department and returning control of education to parents and to state and local governments would improve education and help to ensure that the federal government does not overregulate and interfere in an area that is fundamentally local in nature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 eliminates major portions of the federal bureaucracy, including Titles I-VII and IX-XIV. A few of the larger programs remain intact. Impact Aid, a program designed to aid local school districts educating children living on military installations, is transferred to the Department of Defense. Indian Education programs are transferred to the Department of the Interior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 is an excellent vehicle with which to accomplish this precisely because it recognizes explicitly that the "principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles (Sec. 2.1)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) belongs to the merger camp but has yet to draft any legislation. Under his proposal, which currently exists only in outline form, the department would be merged with the Department of Labor and the EEOC, with the intent that a more relevant and efficient delivery system be established in order to ensure that America's children have the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare them for the workplace of the 21st century.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This proposal is driven primarily by the need to streamline and save, with the stated end goal being to "prepare our youth for the challenges of the 21st century."  As Representative Gunderson stated in a press release earlier this year, 
<p><blockquote>
	By simply consolidating programs and eliminating duplication, we can stem the immense bureaucratic growth of these agencies and realize some savings in the process.... [I]t is not the function of this proposal to debate the merits of each program. Rather, through broad consolidation and coordination of programs, we can make dramatic cost savings and achieve a better federal education and employment system at the same time.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unlike the Scarborough bill, which uses an underlying philosophy of the proper role of the federal government in education to determine what programs will be retained and where they will be lodged, Gunderson's focuses on streamlining the delivery of existing services rather than on whether the federal government ought to be involved in them at all. Having the Department of Education emphasize "work force preparation and policy" begs the question. Parents educate their children not only for the work force, but also for life. Even if education is tantamount to "work force preparation," that does not compel a federal role in bringing about that objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Official Washington's role should be limited to doing those things states and localities cannot do for themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose. The list is short and does not require a Cabinet-level department to implement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Getting it right.</b> Congress should dismantle federal agencies that do not serve the public interest, and the Department of Education is the most visible example. Conceptually, as Bennett, Alexander, and Finn all have noted:
<P><blockquote>
	The federal government should recognize that education in America is "the constitutional responsibility of the states, the social responsibility of communities, and the moral responsibility of families";<sup>20</sup>
<p>
	"Except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the federal government should <i>never</i> impede the capacity of families, communities and states to decide how best to provide education to their children";<sup>21</sup>
<p>
	The bully pulpit is appropriate, but goals and standards must always be truly voluntary; federal funds should not be used as "carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local control; and
<P>
	The federal government should "dedicate itself to (a) fostering family responsibility and local control, (b) assisting states to fulfill their responsibilities as they see fit, (c) providing sound statistics, prompt and accurate assessment results and other information, and (d) safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination."<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Doing it right.</b> To send responsibility home where it belongs, to transfer legitimate federal functions to other federal agencies, and to eliminate what is unnecessary is the job for Congress. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The protection of the civil rights of all Americans should be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, as they are enforced in the larger society; a separate Office of Civil Rights in an Education Department is not necessary.
<p>
<li> Data collection, dissemination, analysis, and research should be transferred to a central Office of Data Collection in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<li> Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools (Title I/Chapter 1) should be made available to them as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states as part of an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
<li> College financial aid should be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services for the immediate future, and such aid should be merit as well as needs based (as it is in every other industrialized democracy). 
<p>
<li> All remaining funds should be made available as two block grants to the states, that would be gradually phased out. One block grant should be for elementary and secondary education programs and the other for higher education.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's taxpayers no longer believe in major federal solutions to problems that are quintessentially local in nature. Congress can undo the damage and restore education -- lower and higher -- to its rightful place. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Great Society and the cluster of programs that grew up around it describe the contours of the modern federal role in education. They are nothing if not large, ambitious, bureaucratic, and intrusive. While these programs were introduced for a variety of reasons, the most important was the simplest: the conviction that states and localities could neither get it right nor go it alone. Most Americans no longer believe this (if, indeed, they ever did). It is time to restore education to its rightful role and place; federal involvement has been tried and, by and large, found wanting. The principle that should guide us into the next century is simple: Devolve to states and localities the responsibility for education. That is the necessary first step. The results will be both profound and far-reaching: the restoration of federalism and the revitalization of the nation's schools.

<h3>APPENDIX </h3>
<p>
<b>DISMANTLING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Department of Education was created, a number of important programs affecting schools were not transferred from other agencies to its control; as a result, interagency coordination remained a problem. For example, Head Start was left in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), which also retained control over school lunch programs. The new Cabinet agency in fact consolidated some 25 percent of about 400 federal higher education activities and less than one-third of all educational expenditures then in the federal budget.<sup>24</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the department's limited scope, opponents who feared the growth of a federal presence in education turned out to be correct. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Department of Education had a budget over $14 billion, 7,000 employees, and as many assistant secretaries as its parent agency, HHS. Today, the department has more than doubled its budget (now over $31 billion) and has more than 240 categorical programs -- 100 more than in 1980. The range of its activities will be broadened even further if, as the Clinton Administration has proposed, it succeeds in establishing its own direct lending program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued federal involvement in education is wasteful and inefficient, and involves responsibilities best left to the states and local communities. The following analysis describes each program, identifies its key problems, and presents a series of recommendations for reform.<sup>25</sup>  Reform consists of doing one of the following in each case: (1) sending the program back to the states and local communities through an elementary and secondary education or a higher education block grant; (2) transferring the program to another federal agency that can handle the issue more efficiently; or (3) terminating the program because it has outlived its usefulness or is better handled by some other agency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
FY 1995 appropriation figures are given for most programs in order to give a sense of the size of each program and the amount of money that would be saved or transferred to block grants.
<P>
<b>OFFICE OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION: TERMINATE AND TRANSFER FUNDS
<P>
1995 Appropriation: $9.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) should be terminated and its funds turned into an elementary and secondary education block grant administered within HHS in a newly created Office of Education. 
<p>
<b>I. Education Reform
<p>
Goals 2000: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $408 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enacted in 1994, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act provided funds to states, local districts, and schools to develop comprehensive education reform plans. Under the program, states applied to the federal government for funds to be used for academic standards, model curricula, staff training, and student assessments. Goals 2000 established three new federal boards: the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), the National Skills Board, and the National Education Goals Panel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure. Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.<sup>26</sup>  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- the results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two fundamentally important ways:
Building Bureaucracies. Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board. These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of education "command-and-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington. The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct. Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18, 1995.<sup>27</sup>  This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would have become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel. Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000's state and national programs will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts, hampering efforts at grass-roots reform. Goals 2000 funding should be terminated and the money sent back to the states in the elementary and secondary education block grant to foster real reform such as school choice, vouchers, and magnet and charter schools.<sup>28</sup>

<b>School-to-Work Program: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriations: $125 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The school-to-work program, funded by the Departments of Education and Labor, was designed to "continue development of comprehensive State and Local school-to-work opportunities systems."  Federal money is to be used as seed money to bring about a more comprehensive national program. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act mandates that this program sunset by the year 2001. In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration is asking for $200 million (an increase of $75 million over FY 1995) to expand the number of states receiving full implementation grants to 43 and fund national research, technical assistance, and evolution activities. States use grants to establish partnerships representing education, industry, and labor, and to develop new assessments and accountability procedures for their school-to-work systems. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School-to-work programs have existed in various forms for some time and are an important part of preparing our nation's youth to lead productive lives. Nevertheless, both the state and national programs should be terminated. The federal government is not implementing a new idea; it is seeking to provide national leadership in developing a "coherent strategy" to help students move into the workforce out of high school. In an era of budget constraints, it is not appropriate for the federal government to take on such a task. Seed money is not necessarily the answer to the problem of developing effective partnerships between businesses and schools, and state-level partnerships with businesses to set up apprenticeship programs to bring non-college-bound students into a technologically advanced work force do not need federal oversight or funding. It is in the interest of private industry to ensure that workers are properly trained and equipped. States should make the implementation of such programs a priority and aggressively seek funding to provide their youth with a work history that enables them to succeed in today's work force.<sup>29</sup>

<b>II. Education for the Disadvantaged
<P>
Title I: Block Grant and Transfer<br>
1995 Appropriation: $7.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title I (formerly Chapter 1) funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty provides additional educational assistance to five million low-achieving students. More than $90 billion has been spent on compensatory education since the program was created in 1965. Despite this huge investment, there is no evidence of any positive effect.<sup>30</sup>  Mary Jean LeTendre, Director of Compensatory Education during the Bush Administration, admitted that if Chapter 1's performance were displayed on a heart monitor, "We'd either pull the plug or get out the clappers."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pre- and post-tests administered to the same groups of students through a Department of Education study show that little progress has been made among Title I students. Comparisons of similar groups of children by grade and poverty show that program participation does not reduce the test score gap for disadvantaged students. Indeed, Chapter 1 student scores declined between the third and fourth grades in all poverty groups.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Chapter 1 instruction typically is offered for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. However, it contributes only about 10 additional minutes of academic instruction to each child's day. The benefit of additional time spent in Chapter 1 instruction too often is diminished by missed class time. During 1991-1992, 70 percent of elementary classroom teachers reported that students missed some academic subject during Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction. Of this 70 percent, 56 percent indicated that students were missing regular reading/language arts activities during their Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another significant problem with Chapter 1 is an incentive structure that discourages reaching the very end for which the program was created. Since funds are allocated based on the number of educationally disadvantaged children in a district, as test scores rise so does the risk of losing program money. Having a large population of educationally disadvantaged children ensures funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform should be reconnecting the program to its true beneficiaries: students, not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools should be made available to poor youngsters as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with AFDC and other forms of public assistance, Title I programs are best administered at the state level. Each state has different problems and concerns in educating its population and should be given the latitude to determine policy governing the distribution of funds to help the economically disadvantaged. Communities should be able to implement programs that respond to the needs of their children without being burdened with oversight from Washington. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs from the Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education's Education for the Disadvantaged should be terminated and the funds returned to the states through an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Capital Expenses for Private School Children. 1995 Appropriation: $41.4 million.</b><br> 
Provides assistance for local education agencies that provide "equitable services" for children enrolled in religious schools.
<p>
<li><b>Even Start. 1995 Appropriation: $102 million. </b><br>
Supports family-centered educational programs that involve parents and children.
<p>
<li><b>State Agency programs for Migrant, Neglected, and Delinquent Students. 
1995 Appropriation: $350 million. </b>
Provides services to children who have moved in the last three years and to incarcerated students. 
<p>
<li><b>State School Improvement. 1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million.</b> 
Designed to help states initiate school-based change, holding them accountable for improving the education of the disadvantaged. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following Education for the Disadvantaged programs should be terminated with no transfer of funds to the elementary and secondary education block grant: 
<p>
<li><b>Migrant High School Equivalency Program and College Assistance Migrant Program. 
1995 Appropriation: $10 million.</b> 
The High School Equivalency Program exists to help low-income migrant workers gain high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. The College Assistance Migrant Program provides stipends and tutoring to migrant students in their first year of college. These programs duplicate programs administered by Federal TRIO Student Support Services programs in the Office of Postsecondary Education, and at a much higher per student cost, and therefore should be terminated.
</ul><P>
<b>III. Impact Aid: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Impact Aid provides basic support to school districts affected by federal activities. The program was established during World War II to relieve the sudden financial pressure on school districts in which enrollment increased sharply because of an influx of relocated military personnel. Impact Aid Part A compensated school districts for educating children whose families lived on federal property. Impact Aid Part B was almost exclusively for children whose parents worked on federal property but did not live there. More than 2,400 school districts received Impact Aid funds. The Impact Aid program was reauthorized and altered in 1994, and the original categories of "A" children, "B" children, Section 3(d)(2)(B), Disaster Assistance, and Construction were replaced with other forms of assistance. Payments were continued on behalf of children living on Indian lands and children living on federal property who have parents in the armed forces. The 1994 reauthorization ended payments for the other categories of previously eligible children, including "B" children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has outlived its initial purpose and should be terminated. Impact Aid is based on the erroneous premise that military bases and other federal facilities are a cost borne by local communities. This is curious, since communities as a rule lobby heavily for such facilities and complain about the losses that will result if they are closed. In truth, these facilities confer substantial benefits through job creation and the infusion of what may be millions of federal dollars into the local economy. Since local governments evidently are convinced their economies gain from the presence of federal facilities, there seems to be no reason to provide them with Impact Aid as compensation for them.
<p>
<b>IV. School Improvement Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.3 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education funds 18 small elementary and secondary programs, many of them designed to address certain perceived needs or as favors to Members of Congress. While many of these School Improvement programs have worthy goals, none can be shown to serve a purpose that cannot be achieved at the state level. All 18 programs should be terminated and a portion of the funds appropriated to the elementary and secondary education block grant proposed at the beginning of this section.
<p>

<b>Eisenhower Professional Development State Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $251 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Eisenhower Professional Development Program provides grants to the states for professional development. This program replaces the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science State Grants, which provided inservice training in mathematics and science. The underlying philosophy of the program is that "Real reform and improvement in elementary and secondary education require a teaching force that is up-to-date in the content areas and skilled in imparting knowledge to diverse populations of students. Only intensive, ongoing professional development will ensure that educators have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach children the challenging State standards."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration agrees that this program has had "minimal impact on classroom effectiveness," yet still wants to expand it to offer "professional development" in additional subjects. The Administration's request terminates funding for <i>Innovative Education Program Strategies</i> (Title VI) because, as explained the department's FY 1996 budget request, as a block grant it did little to contribute to real education reform since the money was spent primarily on such routine things as equipment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration assumes that the past failures of both of these programs can be attributed to their block grant status and the inability of states to bring about reform on their own without large-scale federal control and regulation. However, this is contradicted by current studies that attribute the programs' ineffectiveness to faulty assumptions about student performance. For example, in his exhaustive review of 113 studies that examined the relationship between teacher education levels and student performance, University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek concluded that only eight showed a statistically significant correlation between teachers' advanced degrees and student performance.<sup>34</sup>  These programs should be terminated not only because professional development is not a federal area, but also because of the overwhelming evidence of their inherent ineffectiveness.
<p>

<b>Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $476 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under this program, the federal government gives grants to the states (1) to improve cooperation between schools and the broader community so that all available resources are brought to bear on drug and violence problems; (2) to fund a broader range of local activities, including before- and after-school "safe haven" programs; (3) to target more resources to communities with the greatest drug and violence problems; and (4) to increase accountability through a greater emphasis on collection and use of outcome data. The national programs fund federal development of model programs, evaluation of state and local safe and drug-free schools programs, cooperative activities with other federal agencies, direct grants to communities with severe drug and violence problems, and campus drug prevention grants to institutions of higher education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that this program has been effective in achieving its goals, as no comprehensive audit has been completed since the program was created. Such an audit would be difficult in any event because little is known about what method works best to prevent and reduce substance abuse. A recent study by the Research Triangle Institute, for example, showed that support groups and community service groups increased in number as federal funding reached the schools, but the results are unclear because it cannot be demonstrated that such groups are the best way to combat drugs and violence.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Money under this program is sent not to areas of specific need, but to 96 percent of the nation's school districts, with many the smaller districts receiving only a few hundred dollars. Moreover, districts that do receive large sums of money are not necessarily spending it wisely. A recent audit of the Fairfax County public schools in Virginia found that the county spent $176,000 of its Safe and Drug Free Schools grant to send hundreds of parents, administrators, teachers, and local business owners to a Maryland resort for meetings described as providing "the background for people to try and intelligently solve problems."<sup>36</sup>  In Montgomery County, Maryland, administering a $548,000 grant eats up more than $200,000.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While safe and drug-free schools are a laudable goal, this federal program does little to achieve that goal and duplicates similar efforts such as the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Title XX, the Preventive Health Block Grant, and programs under the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Like education, crime and drug programs are administered best at the local level by individuals who are close to the affected community. States and communities affected by violence and drugs in their schools already are addressing these problems. Federal funding means federal strings that make it more difficult for state and local officials to do their jobs.

<b>Inexpensive Book Distribution: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A nonprofit organization, RIF (Reading is Fundamental), has been contracted by the Department of Education to distribute free and inexpensive books to areas of particular need. The $10.3 million Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, although a worthy concept, could be funded easily at the state level or by private foundations.
<p>

<b>Education Infrastructure: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $35 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created under the 1995 Improving America's Schools Act to assist local education agencies in repairing and rebuilding school facilities. The department recommends terminating funding for the $35 million program due to the administrative complexity caused by the specific requirements LEAs must meet in order to receive assistance.
<p>

<b>Arts in Education: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program seeks to promote competency in the arts by encouraging the integration of art into elementary and secondary curricula. Congress should terminate the Arts in Education Program, which should be funded by private organizations or the states. Most of the money under this program goes to just two organizations: the Very Special Arts Organization and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Very little actually reaches the nation's classrooms.
<P>

<b>Instruction in Civics, Government and the Law: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This $4.5 million program makes competitive awards for programs that educate the public about the legal system and its underlying philosophical principles. Many of the grantees have been receiving funds since the early 1980s for the same projects and should be able to continue without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>Christa McAuliffe Fellowships: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Scholarships provided by this program fund teacher projects to improve education. Such support is best kept at the state or local level, where the need for recognition of teaching excellence and innovation is more immediate.

<p>
<b>Magnet Schools Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $111 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Magnet Schools Assistance program makes grants to local education agencies that are under some sort of desegregation plan, either court-ordered or federally approved. Preference is given to agencies proposing a new or significantly revised program and innovative educational programs. Congress should phase out Magnet Schools Assistance. Like charter schools, magnet schools already are well underway in many districts and are funded and controlled best by local and state authorities.
<p>

<b>Education for Homeless Children and Youth: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The objective of this program is to ensure that homeless children have equal access to education, and to run professional development programs to "heighten awareness of the special problems of homeless children and youth."  In essence, this program helps to advocate within state budgeting processes for the allocation of other funds for the homeless population. While this may be a worthy goal, it is hardly a federal responsibility. And because much of this money is used to lobby for additional funds, little is spent on the education of homeless children. Direct services for educating homeless children can be provided better through the elementary and secondary education block grant.
<p>

<b>Women's Educational Equity: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1974, this program has sought to promote educational equity through grants to local education agencies, nonprofit organizations, and individuals and through a national publishing center. This program is very small and funds only 32 grants of $100,000 each. The program has existed for 20 years but shows little evidence of success in achieving its objectives. If states find that gender equity is a problem that needs to be addressed, studies can be funded and administered at the state or local level; this is far better than a "one-size-fits-all" solution imposed from above. The federal government has no legitimate role in such subjective matters. 
<p>

<b>Training and Advisory Services: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $21.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Training and Advisory Service Program, which supports federal Desegregation Assistance Centers (DACS), should be terminated. Most "desegregation-related" activities in the states, such as busing, have been expensive failures.<sup>38</sup>  Public school desegregation has reached the point where the federal government no longer needs to be involved in such activities.
<P>

<b>Drop-Out Prevention Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has funded local demonstrations of approaches to curtailing high school dropout rates. By law, funding was to end in 1994, but ESEA reauthorization provided for two more years of non-competitive funding of projects that had been supported in previous years. According to the department, the activity thus "evolved into a program of direct, noncompetitive assistance to incumbent grantees" and was no longer a demonstration program. The program no longer merits funding. 
<P>

<b>Ellender Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to an audit requested by Congress, significant increases in federal funding had no impact on the number of fellowships offered by the foundation; fellowships actually decreased as the federal contribution increased. Other organizations in the private sector run government education programs and are able to provide economic assistance to those who are in need. 
<P>

<b>Education for Native Hawaiians: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Native Hawaiians already are eligible to receive services from the Department of Education as long as they meet the criteria applied to all citizens. These programs duplicate those offered under Title I, as well as Special Education and other competitive grants offered by the Department. Since funding for such programs would be available to Hawaii through the elementary and secondary education block grant, separate funding is unnecessary. 
<p>

<b>Foreign Language Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Foreign Language Assistance program provides formula grants to local education agencies to encourage and improve instruction of foreign languages in areas where there is a perceived critical national interest. Currently, support is limited to instruction in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. This program was targeted for termination in the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review because it is "poorly structured to be an appropriate vehicle for the advancement of foreign language education in the schools."  The formula grants to the states are too small to have a significant impact on foreign language instruction.
<p>
<b>Charter Schools: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $20 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Charter Schools Program provides funds to "support planning and initial implementation of charter schools created by teachers, parents, and other members of local communities."  While charter schools certainly are desirable, the states do not need this funding to create them. Congress should terminate the Charter Schools Program and turn the funds over to the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<P>
<b>Technical Assistance for Improving ESEA Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $29.6 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is proposing that funds be provided to complete the phasing in of 15 regional assistance centers to help states, local education agencies, schools, and other recipients of federal funds implement elementary and secondary education programs under ESEA. This is a consolidation of services previously supplied through 48 regional assistance centers. Since the programs these centers are supposed to help administer will be turned over to the states through block grants (Title I programs), terminated (bilingual education), or transferred (Indian education), these centers no longer will be necessary.
<p>
<b>V. Indian Education (IEA): Transfer   <br> 
1995 Appropriation: $82.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs supplement the efforts of state and local education agencies and Indian tribes by providing additional funding to the Indian population. Local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to develop "comprehensive plans" for the education of Indian children apart from the plans they develop for other children. This program should sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency far better equipped to deal effectively with the unique challenges facing the Native American population. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs are similar to the Title I programs which serve all disadvantaged children. Special Programs for Indian Children include (1) a broad demonstration program for testing new approaches in such areas as early childhood education, dropout prevention, and public-private partnerships; (2) an educator professional development program to increase the number of qualified Indians involved in the education of Indians and to improve the skills of Indians already teaching; and (3) fellowships for Indians studying medicine, psychology, law, education, business administration, and natural resources. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Special Programs for Indian Adults help Indian adults acquire basic literacy, complete secondary school, and secure the education needed to enter advanced vocational programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both of these programs duplicate many Indian education programs run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Interior Department. Therefore, the entire Indian Education program, including all program funding, should be transferred to that agency.

<b>OFFICE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND MINORITY LANGUAGE AFFAIRS
<P>
Bilingual and Immigrant Education: Phase Out Over Three Years<br>
1995 Appropriation: $206.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government began funding local bilingual education programs in 1967. At that time, Congress made it clear that support should not be limited to any one instructional method; as the legislative report stated, the choice of method should be "left to the discretion and judgments of the local school districts to encourage both varied approaches to the problem and also special solutions for a particular problem of a given school."  This policy was reversed in 1974 when Congress effectively mandated that schools use "transitional bilingual education" (TBE) instructional methods, by which students are taught both in English and in their native language. In 1987, Congress loosened this restriction and allowed local governments to spend 25 percent of their bilingual education funds on "alternative" teaching methods, with 75 percent still required for TBE instruction. The federal programs assist local school districts in "building their capacity to operate high-quality instructional programs for recently-arrived immigrants and other Limited English Proficient (LEP) students."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Against the advice of local officials and many scholars, Washington continues to tie the hands of local school districts by requiring them to spend three-quarters of all their federal bilingual education funds on transitional bilingual education programs. Although federal funding is only about 3 percent of the total spent on bilingual education, the fact that the federal government favors transitional bilingual education over "alternative" teaching methods creates the impression that transitional education is the best way to teach recent immigrants and other Limited English Proficient students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the federal preference for transitional bilingual education, numerous studies have shown that TBE programs are less effective than intensive English programs. A recent study by the Board of Education of the City of New York showed that 80 percent of students enrolled in special English programs were put in mainstream classes within 2-3 years, compared with only 51 percent of students in bilingual programs. Similar results were found in a READ Institute study of the schools in El Paso, Texas. Students in an English-based program in El Paso enter regular classrooms in 3 or 4 years, whereas bilingual students take 6 to 7 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education itself has concluded that TBE programs, which involve heavy reliance on the pupil's native language, can delay English proficiency for as many as six years after instruction begins.<sup>39</sup>  This is disturbing, given that the primary purpose of these programs is to assist Limited English Proficient students to join the American mainstream as quickly as possible. Yet the bilingual education establishment continues to push TBE, which has proved to be both a source of jobs and a pipeline to the federal Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although there remains intense debate over which bilingual teaching methods are most effective, a consensus is emerging that local school districts are best able to tailor their programs to meet the needs of their foreign students most effectively. Notes Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers: "The fact is that there is no proven method of bilingual education that guarantees English fluency. And I don't think that Uncle Sam, or anybody else ought to be shoving a particular message down anybody's throat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As this $261 million program is phased out, local school districts should be permitted to use the money to develop the programs they deem most appropriate and effective in teaching English as a second language. This would restore the program to its original mandate of providing short-term federal funding to develop "special solutions" for Limited English Proficient students.<sup>40</sup>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government has an interest both in ensuring that those who are disabled have access to quality education and in helping the states to achieve that goal. Therefore, the following programs would remain intact and be housed in HHS:
<ul><p>
<li> Special Education,

<b>OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL AND ADULT EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Vocational Education program funds are used by states to support family literacy, vocational education, and job training, and to help adults complete a secondary education. Grants are allocated to the states according to a formula under which each state receives $250,000, with the remaining funds distributed in proportion to the number of persons age 16 years or older who have not completed a high school education. Basic grants integrate academic and vocational education and are allotted to states according to a formula based on state income, with an adjustment based on state per capita income. Currently, over $1.4 billion is spent on vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 17 vocational and adult education programs duplicate 154 employment training programs administered by 14 different federal agencies. In an effort to ameliorate this situation, the Clinton Administration rescinded 1995 funding for the Community-Based Organizations and Consumer and Homemaking Education Programs. Under the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal, programs administered by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education would be combined and broken down into two sets of programs: state grants and national programs. There would be separate state grant and national programs for vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs would be consolidated under the Clinton-proposed state grants for vocational education:<p><ul>
<li> Tech-Prep Education ($108 million);
<li> Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions ($2.9 million);
<li> State Councils ($8.8 million); and
<li> Permanent Appropriation (Smith-Hughes Act) ($7.1 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
State Literacy Resource Centers, Workplace Literacy Partnerships, Literacy Training for Homeless Adults, and Literacy Programs for Prisoners are Adult Education programs that fund relatively few programs in only a handful of states. All these activities are best handled by state and local governments, which are closest to those who are being served. These programs would be merged into adult education state grants in the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget request. The Administration correctly argues that a single state grant "would permit states to establish their own program objectives based on their own unique needs, and would give states the flexibility to use federal funds for a range of activities... aimed at achieving those objectives." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research, technical assistance, and data collecting functions for adult and vocational education would comprise the national programs under the Clinton budget request.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Combining these programs into state and national programs makes sense, but not at the same level of funding. Funding for vocational education and adult education should be cut by 50 percent. Vocational education funds should be combined with the elementary and secondary education block grant and adult education funds with the higher education block grant, described below in the section on the Office of Post Secondary Education. Sufficient funds should be appropriated for research, data systems, and grant management at the federal level. The national program should be housed in the Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>
<b>OFFICE OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Programs currently administered by the Office of Post Secondary Education should be transferred to the Office of Education at the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs under Student Financial Assistance should be transferred to HHS, along with certain reforms, cuts, and terminations. Higher education categorical programs should be consolidated into a higher education block grant to be administered by HHS.
<p>
<b>I. Student Financial Assistance  <br>  
1995 Appropriation: $7.6 billion</b>
<p>
<b>Pell Grants: Transfer to HHS<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Pell Grant program provides grant aid to low and middle-income undergraduate students. Unlike most other federal scholarship programs, it is the department's most "need-focused" student aid program. This proposal terminates most other merit-based scholarship programs in order to focus resources on need-based grant programs such as this one. Pell Grants should be sent to HHS along with other student financial assistance programs.
<p>
<b>Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants: Block Grant<br>
1995 Appropriation: $583 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SEOG program, like the Pell Grant program, provides assistance to undergraduate students with financial need. Funds are allocated to institutions, however, based on statutory formula, and institutions match 25 percent. Students with exceptional need and Pell Grant recipients are given priority by the awarding institutions. This need-based program should be terminated and its funds included in the higher education block grant, enabling states to award money to institutions as they see fit.
<p>
<b>State Student Incentive Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $63.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SSIG program provides dollar-for-dollar matching funds as an incentive to the states to set up need-based postsecondary student grant assistance. Since 1972, all 50 states have set up their own undergraduate need-based programs. The original objective of this program therefore has been met, and federal funding is no longer necessary.  (Elimination of this program also was recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.)
<p>
<b>Federal Perkins Loans<br> 
1995 Appropriation: $176 million and
<p>
Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.1 Billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students receive federal student loans primarily through three programs: Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Federal Direct Loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Approximately 2,700 participating institutions currently administer Perkins Loans. Borrowers are charged 5 percent interest during principal repayment and no interest during in-school, grace, and deferment periods. The annual maximum amounts a student can borrow under the program are $3,000 for undergraduates and $5,000 for graduate and professional students. The cumulative maximum is $30,000 for combined undergraduate and graduate or professional study. The federal government currently pays $18 million annually to cancel loan obligations of borrowers who go into "public service employment," such as law enforcement, nursing, or teaching in Head Start programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the FFEL program, a student borrows money at a capped rate from private lending institutions. Banks making FFEL student loans have the loans insured by state and private nonprofit institutions, known as "guarantee agencies."  The federal government, however, reinsures these loans and is ultimately liable for up to 98 percent of defaulted loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The FFEL program offers four types of loans:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
1) Stafford Loans are subsidized, low-interest loans based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest while the student is in school and during certain grace and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
2) Unsubsidized Stafford Loans also are low-interest student loans. However, under this program, the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
3) PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. The maximum interest rate for PLUS loans is higher than for Stafford or Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
4) Consolidation Loans allow borrowers with multiple student loans who meet certain criteria to combine their obligations and extend their repayment schedules. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All FFEL loans, except Consolidation Loans, have variable interest rates. The rate is capped at 8.25 percent for Stafford and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and 9.00 percent for PLUS Loans. Today, these variable rates are tied to the 91-day Treasury bill rate; beginning July 1, 1998, rates will be tied to the government borrowing rate (currently the 10-year Treasury bill rate).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These loan programs should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Education and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the following reforms should be instituted, both to reduce the cost of these programs and to cut defaults:  
<p>
<b>Reform #1: Eliminate the Perkins Loan Program.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program is relatively small and exists largely to supplement the larger FFEL and Direct Loan programs. It easily could be eliminated or merged into these larger programs, reducing overhead and duplication. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program also authorizes borrowers to have all or a portion of their loans canceled in exchange for service as a teacher, staff member in a Head Start program, volunteer in the Peace Corps or VISTA, law enforcement or corrections officer, nurse or medical technician, or family service agency employee. Yet there is no shortage of individuals interested in serving in these careers, some of which pay salaries and offer many rewards. There is no need to continue to forgive these loans for all individuals.
<p>
<b>Reform #2: Eliminate in-school interest subsidies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students should be required to accrue interest on loans while attending school, with no payment of this accrued interest until after they leave school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal student loans are virtually an entitlement for college- or trade school-bound students, with most funds aiding students from middle-income families. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of all college students are receiving subsidized federal loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempts over the past decade to scale back the eligibility for student loans have failed because of strong middle-class support for the program. But the program actually subsidizes members of the middle class with one hand while taking taxes from them with the other. Recipients of the loans, moreover, gain considerably at the expense of Americans who did not go to college. College graduates can expect average lifetime earnings about $600,000 higher than those of non-graduates, and many students who do not need loans borrow up to the hilt to obtain money for non-education purchases at below-market rates. The result: Those who do not graduate end up subsidizing those who do by giving them a passport to higher earnings. Taxpayer subsidies to college students at the very least should expire when they join the work force. Borrowers who have completed or quit college should pay lenders market interest rates on their student loans without further assistance from the government.
<p>
<b>Reform #3: Link loan eligibility to continuous academic achievement.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Student loan eligibility should depend on continuously satisfactory academic progress toward degree completion, with all students required to have a high school diploma before becoming eligible for a loan. Enforcement efforts should be increased to verify that students receiving federal assistance are still in school and working toward a degree, and objective standards, such as the student's retaining at least a C average for the entire academic program, should be introduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taxpayers should not be financing the college education of students who are failing their courses. A publicly funded loan is an honor and privilege, not an entitlement, and students receiving federal loans must be given incentives to study hard and graduate. Students today can obtain loans even without graduating from high school, which merely adds to the probability of default. Moreover, they need only maintain a C average by the end of their second year of study.
<p>
<b>Reform #4: Include home equity in the determination of eligibility and modify the simplified needs test.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Higher Education Act of 1992 eliminated house and farm assets from consideration in determining a family's ability to pay for post-secondary education, thereby making it easier for many students to obtain Stafford loans. The Act specifies formulas by which to calculate a family's need for Stafford loans. The amount the family is expected to contribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax formula. In effect, need analysis "taxes" family incomes and assets above amounts assumed to be required for a basic standard of living. The definition of assets excludes house and farm equity for all families, and all assets for applicants with incomes below $50,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
House and farm equity should be included in the calculation of assets to determine a family's need for financial aid for post-secondary education. In addition, the threshold below which most families are not asked to report their assets should be lowered to its previous level of $15,000. Families whose houses appreciated during the 1980s are financially better off than they would have been if they had not owned a house then. Moreover, not counting this equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, the needs test is used to determine which students enjoy subsidized interest. Revising the needs test would target subsidies more precisely to those who need them.
<p>
<b>Reform #5: Require lenders to share the risk of guaranteed student loan defaults.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by reducing the standard federal re-insurance from 98 to 90 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), conducted by the Education Department's Planning and Evaluation Service,<sup>41</sup> found that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Defaulters were four times more likely than non-defaulters to begin their postsecondary education without a high school diploma. Of this group of defaulters, approximately 40 percent had not received a general educational development (GED) certificate.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely as non-defaulters to have dropped out of their postsecondary program.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely to be unemployed or underemployed (earning less than $10,000) than non-defaulters at the time repayment was scheduled to begin.
<p>
<li>Defaulters had fewer and smaller loans, which indicates that they attended postsecondary institutions for shorter periods or went to relatively inexpensive institutions. This statistic may be explained in part by the fact that a significantly larger percentage of defaulters attended trade or vocational schools with programs lasting two years or less. On average, 72 percent of private vocational/trade school students receive federal aid as compared to 40 percent of students attending public undergraduate institutions.<sup>42</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If lenders were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more cautious in making loans for institutions with high student default rates. The federal government should cover only 80 percent on defaulted loans. This reform would give lending institutions an incentive to take greater care in scrutinizing institutions and collecting loans.
<p>
<b>Reform #6: Increase the default risk shouldered by loan guaranty agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by changing the current guaranteed loan program's guaranty agency reinsurance on defaulted loans from 98/88/78 percent, depending on the annual level of defaults, to 95/85/75 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent reinsurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 45 guaranty agencies, which include USA Funds, California Student Assistance Commission, and America Student Assistance, have been too quick to turn defaulted loans over to the Department of Education and the taxpayers. If guaranty agencies were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more diligent in their collection efforts before turning responsibility for a defaulted loan over to the federal government.
<p>

<b>Work-Study: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work-Study program provides grants to participating institutions to pay up to 75 percent of the salaries of needy undergraduate or graduate students working part-time, typically in on-campus jobs. The remaining 25 percent of student earnings is provided by the school or other employer. Funds are allocated to institutions according to a statutory formula, and individual grant amounts are determined at the discretion of institutional financial aid administrators. To the extent feasible, participating institutions are required to place Work-Study students in employment situations that complement their academic studies. They also are required by statute to use at least five percent of their Work-Study allocations to support students working in community service activities. The federal government currently spends $617 million annually on Work-Study.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In most cases, CWS students are employed by colleges -- for example, in food service, administrative offices, and libraries, or as teacher's aides. Thus, the federal government is subsidizing the employment expenditures of these institutions. Expecting taxpayers to defray the labor costs of well-endowed institutions like Harvard University, which receives over $2.9 million in federal work-study grants, reveals just how poorly conceived a program CWS really is. 
<P>

<b>Federal Direct Student Loan Account: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Direct Student Loan program, recently renamed the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, was authorized by Congress in 1992 as a "pilot" program. It was expanded by Congress in 1993, however, from a pilot program to a "transition" program. Now the Administration plans to replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, with the Direct Student Loan program. Under the Direct Loan program, unlike the FFEL program, the federal Treasury borrows money and then lends it directly to schools, which in turn lend it to the students. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary impetus for implementing it is cost: Replacing the current system with direct lending is supposed to lead to billions of dollars in savings. All current indications, however, are that it will not produce such savings.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Direct Lending centralizes control of post-secondary education lending in the Department of Education and creates the potential for huge, unconstrained overhead costs. Despite talk of reducing bureaucracy by switching to Direct Lending, the Department of Education is hiring over 500 new employees to administer these programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when phase-in is completed. The federal government is funding the rapid expansion of this controversial program through an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not only does the Direct Student Loan program add to a growing bureaucracy, but it also adds to the national debt. Instead of allowing capital for student loans to be provided by private sources, the federal government now must borrow money to fund those loans. Several noted economists have warned that the Direct Lending program will add billions to the federal debt without saving a dollar. For example, Dr. Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, cautioned federal lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" when Congress was debating the program. Penner predicts in an economic analysis that direct lending may add $70 million to the federal debt by 1998, with financing costs that could erase any theoretical budget savings.<sup>44</sup>  Penner's concerns are supported by two other recently issued reports, one conducted by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and another by economist Dr. Perry Quick of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.<sup>45</sup>  All three studies conclude that any alleged savings associated with one direct lending program are highly unlikely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Estimates of the costs of the Direct Lending program change constantly. In 1993 when it was enacted, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.<sup>46</sup>  The most recent CBO report, however, takes into account the Credit Reform Act as amended by the 1996 Budget Resolution. The amended Credit Reform Act includes long-term administrative costs, and the CBO now projects that the program will save a mere $115 million over the next seven years. Eliminating the program entirely would save $1.5 billion in outlays over the next seven years.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, government-run loan programs historically have had higher default rates than programs run by the private sector. A government-run monopoly like direct loans is unlikely to improve on the quality of service in the FFEL program. More important, the Direct Loan program is not subject to provisions terminating the eligibility of schools with high default rates -- which understandably are very enthusiastic about the prospect of direct loans.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the Direct Lending Program fails to provide the savings it promises, it should be eliminated. Our student lending policies are not perfect, but nationalizing the program is not the answer.
<p>
<b>II. Higher Education Programs
<p>
Federal TRIO Programs<br>
1995 Appropriation: $463 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, potential first-generation college students to enter and complete college. These support programs target federal grant recipients and other disadvantaged students, working in tandem with federal grant programs focused on eliminating financial barriers to post-secondary education. Funds from this program should be included in the higher education block grant and sent back to the states in the same manner as Title I funds for elementary and secondary education.
<p>
<b>Aid for Institutional Development (Title III): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $230 million</b>
]<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, there are seven separate programs that support the operations and endowments of a few institutions of higher education. The Clinton Administration is requesting the same funding ($143 million) in FY 1997 for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, along with a $40 million decrease in Aid for Institutional Development Part A (Strengthening Institutions) as part of a two-year phaseout. The Administration also proposes to eliminate the Endowment Challenge Grant general "endowments" program while preserving the HBCU set-aside portion of the program. The Administration argues that the federal government can support the general improvement of institutions more efficiently by increasing the investment in student aid; tuition revenues from a student receiving financial aid may be used for "developmental" purposes, as well as for endowment-building activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is unfair to the large majority of both public and private post-secondary institutions for the federal government to single out a few institutions for substantial amounts of federal aid. Many of the schools receiving this aid are financially secure and do not need special treatment. 
<p>
<b>III. Other Post-Secondary Education Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to Aid for Institutional Development, the Department of Education funds over 29 small post-secondary programs that address a range of issues and activities. Most have achieved their original purposes, either largely or completely, or could be supported more efficiently by other funding sources. In its budget request for FY 1997, the Clinton Administration recognizes the need to eliminate many of these programs because they duplicate other programs, have achieved their purposes, or are supported more appropriately with non-federal funds. However, all of the following small post-secondary programs should be eliminated:
<p>

<b>Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $17.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support projects with competitive grants that "enhance postsecondary education quality and cost effectiveness," according to the department. Current funding covers about 200 new and existing awards. The pursuit of education quality and cost-effectiveness should be the goal of all institutions of higher learning seeking to attract students; the federal government does not need to provide such an incentive. This program also supports exchange programs with European Community and NAFTA countries, activities that are available at the institutional level without federal funding. FIPSE should be terminated, with a portion of its funding transferred to the higher education block grant.
<P>
<b>Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development<br>
1995 Appropriation: $500,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides support for the preservation of Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Native Art. Such funding is provided more appropriately by state and tribal governments. Moreover, funds are available for this purpose from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<P>
<b>Eisenhower Leadership Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations to develop leadership skills in students. The department, following National Performance Review recommendations, is requesting no additional funds for this program in FY 1997. Activities promoted by these grants already are included in the curricula of post-secondary institutions' education programs. There is no need for federal involvement.
<p>
<b>Minority Teacher Recruitment <br>
1995 Appropriation: $2.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program administers two types of grants: partnership grants to institutions of higher learning to recruit and train minority teachers, and teacher placement grants to help state departments of education develop programs to help train minority students to become teachers. While minority teacher recruitment reflects a valid and current need, this program is too small to have an impact on a national scale. Only 13 small awards were given in 1995. Research should be done at the state level to determine what programs would best serve this interest, as there is little evidence thus far that giving money to these programs brings minority individuals into the profession who would not already have been there. 
<p>
<b>Minority Science Improvement <br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program grants money to institutions that primarily serve minority communities to encourage advanced study in science. Funds for advanced study are available through student financial assistance; money does not need to go directly to institutions for such purposes. This program should be terminated, with a portion of its funds transferred to the higher education block grant. States are better able to determine for themselves how best to encourage high-quality engineering and science studies at the institutional level.
<p>
<b>Innovative Projects for Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 million </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and higher education institutions to encourage students to participate in community service. While this is a commendable goal, it is neither education-related nor a federal responsibility. In addition, it is too small to have an impact at the national level. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>International Education and Foreign Language Studies<br>
1995 Appropriation: $58.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
IEFLS funds graduate and undergraduate foreign language and area studies programs. This program should be terminated with a portion of funds put into the higher education block grant. States would be encouraged to use a portion of this grant to fund language activities.
<P>
<b>Institute for International Public Policy<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support the Institute for International Public Policy of the United Negro College Fund, designed to increase minority representation in the Foreign Service. This program is a direct grant to an institution performing a function outside the federal role in education.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Education<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds the demonstration of cooperative education, but over 700 post-secondary institutions currently operate programs combining work experience with academic study without federal support. Federal support is no longer needed. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Law School Clinical Experience<br>
1995 Appropriation: $14.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to provide clinical experience to law students that is best provided by non-federal sources such as law schools themselves. In addition, schools already have the incentive to provide clinical experience to attract students since its inclusion in the curriculum is so highly regarded. As recommended by the National Performance Review and the department's FY 1997 proposed budget, this program should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Urban Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.0 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds higher education institutions that serve as a resource for urban areas attempting to solve urban social and economic problems. These issues are addressed more appropriately by other federal agencies, however. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $10.2 million in non-competitive federal construction grants has been provided to Bethune-Cookman College to construct this fine arts center. Any additional financing that might be required is available through private sources. This program is therefore unnecessary. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Academic Facilities<br>
1995 Appropriation: $24.2 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program gives aid to institutions of higher learning for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of academic facilities. These institutions, however, should be responsible for funding their own projects. Providing such funds is not a federal responsibility, and this program should be phased out as soon as previously awarded grant and loan obligations are met. A portion of these funds should be sent back to the states in the higher education block grant.
<p>
<b>Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $300,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HBCU Capital Financing Program provides federal guarantees for private sector bond financing for the repair and construction of facilities at HBCUs. As with Aid for Institutional Development, providing such assistance to a select group of higher learning institutions is not a federal responsibility. Financing of this sort can and should be secured without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to "forge new Federal-State partnerships" aimed at encouraging disadvantaged youth to pursue higher education. The FY 1997 department budget proposes that this program be cut, since the current budget situation precludes adequate funding. While a worthy endeavor, reaching out to disadvantaged youth is best done at the local level. In addition, Pell Grants and other loan programs already encourage this.
<p>
<b>IV. Higher Education Scholarship Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education maintains several merit-based scholarships that do not focus on providing access to higher education for those who are economically disadvantaged. Most are small, categorical programs that are difficult to maintain and have high overhead costs. In addition, over $30 billion is already available to those who need money for higher education. Therefore, each of the following scholarship programs should be terminated:
<p><ul>
<li>National Science Scholarships ($4.4 million);
<li>National Academy of Science, Space and Technology ($2.0 million);
<li>Douglas Teacher Scholarships ($14.6 million);
<li>Olympic Scholarships ($1.0 million);
<li>Teacher Corps ($1.9 million);
<li>Women and Minority Participation in Graduate Education ($5.8 million);
<li>Harris Fellowships ($20.2 million);
<li>Javits Fellowships ($7.8 million);
<li>Byrd Honors Scholarships ($29.1 million);
<li>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($27.3 million); and
<li>Faculty Development Fellowships ($3.7 million).
</ul><p>

<b>School, College, and University Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created to forge partnerships to foster student readiness for the workforce. It is a relatively small program that duplicates functions of other federal and state-funded job training programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.

<p>
<b>Legal Training for the Disadvantaged (CLEO)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides disadvantaged individuals with a basic understanding of our legal system. Non-federal sources now account for 40 percent of this program's total funding; the department believes this would continue even if federal funding was withdrawn, in addition to which aid would continue to be available through student financial assistance programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>V. Howard University: Phase out funding<br>
1995 Appropriation: $204.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Howard University is a federally chartered black college in Washington, D.C. Despite its federal charter, Howard is a private institution with over 13,500 students. The university's programs are tailored to enhance the opportunities of minorities in professional fields. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1995 Congress appropriated $206 million for Howard University -- over $15,000 per enrolled student. This appropriation was approximately $13 million above both the 1994 funding level and the Clinton Administration's request. Direct appropriations for Howard were first authorized in 1867. In 1988, Congress and the Department of Education directed Howard University to develop a plan for financial self-sufficiency; ten years later, that plan still has not been developed fully, and Howard remains one of the most highly subsidized private universities in the nation. Academic subsidies cover roughly two-thirds of the cost of educating Howard's students, enabling the school to charge less than the average for state-supported public institutions. These students receive still more subsidies through federal student aid programs. Moreover, 20 percent of its student population is made up of foreign students who enjoy a federal subsidy equal to that of their American counterparts, yet come from families who generally have not paid taxes to finance the school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to raising tuition for foreign students, another way for Howard to move toward fiscal independence would be to build up its endowment. The Howard University endowment has increased annually, due both to federal contributions and to private contributions from friends and alumni. The university should increase its efforts to solicit contributions from alumni and friends, as other institutions do. A five-year phaseout would give Howard the time and the incentive to build up its resources and endowment, as it promised Congress it would do ten years ago. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following reforms and phaseouts should take place over the next five years:
<p>
Phase out subsidies for:
<p><ul>
<li>Academic Programs (1995 Appropriation: $158 million);
<li>Endowment Program (1995 Appropriation: $3.5 million); and
<li>Research (1995 Appropriation: $4.6 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Require Howard University to raise tuition for foreign students by at least 50 percent to offset the current federal subsidy toward their education.
<p>

<b>OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT<br>
1995 Appropriation: $324 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is tasked with providing national leadership in the areas of educational research and statistics. Its stated mission is to promote excellence and equity in American education by:
<p><ul>
<li>  Conducting research and demonstration projects funded through grants to help improve education;

<li> Collecting statistics on the status and progress of schools and education throughout the nation; and

<li> Distributing information and providing technical assistance to those working to improve education. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, OERI has grown into a bloated bureaucracy with many programs that easily could be turned over to the private sector or eliminated altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI was re-authorized under the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994. The Clinton Administration's 1997 funding request would support the research and development programs of five new National Research Institutes, the National Education Dissemination System, the statistics and assessments activities of the National Center for Education Statistics, and the creation of a National Library of Education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 Act authorized the Assistant Secretary for OERI to support activities to increase the participation of minority researchers and institutions. The law authorized funds for the operation of regional educational laboratories to provide technical assistance, promote education reform, and assist rural education. OERI also operates more than 15 categorical programs with budgets ranging from $800,000 to $83.2 million. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI's budget should be cut in half, and the agency's statistical, research, and assessment functions should be consolidated in the Census Bureau. Library and technology programs should be cut and sent back to the states as part of the elementary/secondary education and higher education block grants. 
<p>
<b>I. Statistics, Research, and Assessment<br>
1995 Appropriation: $32.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The statistical functions of OERI, which build knowledge about education, should continue to collect data on education reform and progress. But the Census Bureau performs similar functions in a far less politically charged environment. OERI's essential functions have become increasingly partisan and bureaucratic in recent years. In 1994, H.R. 6 (the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) alone created several new bureaucracies which operate under OERI, including five new National Research Institutes, a new National Education Dissemination System, and a new National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board. While the federal government should collect and disseminate information, it should not be in the business of setting reform priorities for state and local education agencies. The research, statistics, and assessment functions therefore should be consolidated in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<b>II. Improvement Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the small programs operating within OERI were recommended for elimination by the Clinton Administration in its National Performance Review. These functions either can be performed by the private sector, are new programs that are unnecessary or redundant, have outlived their original goals and purposes, or were created to benefit a special interest group. In addition, these small programs either do not need separate funding or receive substantial funding from non-federal sources. They should be eliminated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has recommended eliminating the following small programs in its FY 1997 request: 
<p><ul>
<li> 21st Century Community Learning Centers ($750,000), coordinated services projects that provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to social, health, and education services.

<li> National Writing Project ($3.2 million), a grant to the National Writing Project, a nonprofit educational organization that offers training programs in the effective teaching of writing. This program has received federal funds for many years and has been amply demonstrated as a strategy for improving the teaching of writing

<li> National Diffusion Network ($11.7 million), a general school improvement program that disseminates activities about programs that work well. 
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Several other programs not recommended for termination in the department's budget request, including the Star Schools Program ($25 million) and International Education Exchange ($3 million), can and should be handed over to the states or the private sector. For example, the Star Schools program was enacted in October 1988 to equip small primary and secondary schools in remote areas across the country with classroom instructions via live satellite transmissions. This service is being provided by state institutions and by commercial industry. Private industry also provides help, through donations of computers and laboratory equipment as well as cash assistance, to the very types of disadvantaged schools that the Star Schools program is designed to help. Exxon Corporation, IBM, and General Electric alone have spent millions of dollars on pre-college education to improve student training in computers, mathematics, and the sciences. These private initiatives are far more promising than a federal program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Ready to Learn Television grant ($7 million) goes to Public Broadcasting specifically for the Children's Television Network, the makers of Sesame Street. This program existed without federal funding until 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fund for the Improvement of Education ($37 million) supports school recognition activities and various research projects. The information gained from research projects funded by this program is intended to benefit all states and aid the cause of reform. School recognition is best administered at the state or local level. With the elementary and secondary education block grant, a state can institute its own recognition activities. The research dissemination activities of this program will be handled by the research, statistics, and assessment offices sent to the Census Bureau.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These remaining programs can be cut because their purposes can be accomplished perfectly well within research and assessment programs: 
<P><ul>
<li>Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science Education Consortia ($15 million), which supports grants to operate regional organizations that put together math and science instructional materials and train teachers and administrators in teaching methods and assessment;

<li>Eisenhower Professional Development National Activities ($21.4 million), which funds national activities for teacher skill development in core subject areas; and

<li> Javits Gifted and Talented Education program ($9.5 million), which funds demonstration activities intended to improve the ability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the educational needs of the gifted.
</ul><p>
<b>III. Libraries</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The administration's FY 1997 budget request eliminates all categorical library programs and proposes instead that legislation be enacted to authorize a program of public library assistance state grants. Public libraries, however, should be free of federal involvement and funded at the local level or privately. These programs therefore should be eliminated:
<p><ul>
<li>Public Library Services ($83.2 million);
<li>Public Library Construction ($17.4 million);
<li>Interlibrary cooperation ($18 million);
<li>Library literacy programs ($8 million);
<li>Library Education and Training ($4.9 million), which can be financed through student financial aid; and
<li>Library Research and Demonstrations ($6.5 million). Other funds are available to fund demonstrations and disseminate findings through the Research division of OERI transferred to Census.
</ul><P>
<b>IV. Educational Technology</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department has requested $357 million for educational technology for FY 1997. This is part of a new initiative designed to "leverage substantial new investments in computer equipment, the development of educational software, and the training of teachers in the use of educational technology."  States have demonstrated, however, that they do not need federal involvement to give their students "technology rich" learning environments. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple have forged state partnerships to accomplish this. The money should be given to the states through the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<p>
<b>DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT</b>
<p>
<b>Eliminate all funding for Departmental Management while abolishing the Department of Education.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $865 million of the Department of Education's $31 billion FY 1995 budget was dedicated to Discretionary Salaries and Expenses ($520 million) and permanent costs ($345 million). Permanent costs include Direct Loan Servicing and Other Costs, Guaranty Agencies and Other Transition Costs, and Federal Payroll Costs: Direct Loans and Transition. The $520 million authorized for salaries and expenses pays the costs of the staff, overhead, contracts, and other activities needed to monitor and administer the over 240 programs operating within the department, including the Office of the Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights. The Clinton Administration has requested about the same level of funding for FY 1997, $506 million in discretionary authority and $355 in permanent budget authority. The increase in mandatory budget authority is due mainly to the costs of administering the Direct Student Loan program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the abolition of the Department of Education, HHS will take over administration costs of programs housed in that agency.

<p>
<b>Office for Civil Rights</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary staff functions of this office are to investigate discrimination complaints, conduct compliance reviews, monitor corrective action plans, and provide technical assistance. It mainly handles disability and equity issues. The functions of this office should be moved to the Department of Justice, which already handles many education-related issues. Civil rights enforcement is more efficient and effective when consolidated in one central office, separate from the potentially conflicting agendas of separate agencies.

<title>The Folly of Raising the Minimum Wage - Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>THE FOLLY OF INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><br>
Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<p>
(Updating <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1033, "Why Raising the Minimum Wage Is a Bad Idea," May 17, 1995.)
<p>
Backgrounder Update No. 275<br>
April 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress once again is debating an increase in the minimum wage, this time from $4.25 an hour to $5.15. Although proponents argue that declining real wages require an increase to provide a decent living wage for low-income workers, a minimum wage hike in fact will harm unskilled Americans by destroying entry-level job opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  Further, it will do nothing to increase the income of nonworking families, while raising prices for both the poor and non-poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decreeing an increase in the minimum wage does not address the underlying cause of stagnant wages: slow productivity growth. Before raising the minimum wage, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question: Should it be illegal for Americans, young or old, to work at even a part-time job for $4.50 or $5.00 an hour?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While proponents make emotionally appealing arguments for raising the minimum wage, these arguments are misleading. To be sure, increasing the minimum wage will help some low-income workers, but it will have the opposite effect for many more Americans. It is also an inefficient way to boost the income of poor households. Among the reasons:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying over 200,000 entry-level job opportunities by 1999.</b> The minimum wage is an uncompassionate tax by which some low-wage workers increase their earnings while others lose their opportunity to earn anything at all. Raising it will effectively prohibit people from working unless their skills are worth at least $5.15 per hour.
<p>
<li><b>Raising the minimum wage generally does not help low-income households.</b> The reason?  Over half of the increased income from minimum wage jobs would go to youth and spouses living in families that are well-off, rather than to poor minimum wage workers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, because almost half of minimum wage workers work <i>voluntarily</i> part time, many working only part year, 90 cents more per hour will not substantially increase their annual income but could cost them their jobs.
<p><li><b>Increasing the minimum wage does not help poor families because most do not have anyone working at the minimum wage.</b><sup>3</sup>  Of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour.
<p>
<li><b>Hiking the minimum wage will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the higher cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages.</b> Taxpayers will also be asked to shell out billions more for ineffective government training programs because the higher minimum wage has priced unskilled Americans out of the job market.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a manufacturing to a global service economy, competition has increased, and more American women are working than ever before. Employers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and taxes that have slowed productivity and limited real wage growth. But instead of addressing the impediments to wage growth imposed by government, proponents prefer to blame employers for stagnating wages and curry favor with voters by proposing another hike in the minimum wage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Imposing another mandate that raises prices and destroys entry-level job opportunities, however, is not a compassionate or sensible response to the problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of hiking the minimum wage, Congress and the Administration should focus on removing the barriers to productivity and wage growth that they have imposed on the private sector. Specifically, Congress and the Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Cut payroll taxes.</b> Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are largely shifted to workers in the form of lower real wages.<sup>5</sup>  Cutting payroll taxes will directly increase take-home pay.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the capital gains tax.</b> This will reduce investment disincentives, increase wages by raising productivity, and increase small business formation and associated job opportunities.
<p>
<li><b>Balance the budget.</b> This will increase total domestic saving, lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in labor productivity.
<p>
<li><b>Increase the skills of the future workforce.</b> What is needed is fundamental change aimed at improving basic education through school choice and enabling local educators to strengthen core curricula, improve discipline, and set high expectations.
<p>
<li><b>Increase the skills of the current workforce.</b> Enable employers to offer minimum wage apprenticeships that permit businesses to pay the minimum wage as a combination of cash and tax-creditable education.
<p>
<li><b>Enact significant regulatory reform.</b> The explosion of new regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital, creating barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs. The regulatory bureaucracy needs to be rolled back and job-killing labor regulations eliminated.
</ul><p>
<b>INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE WILL DESTROY JOB OPPORTUNITIES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vast majority of economists accept that raising the minimum wage will mean fewer job opportunities for lower-skilled workers. Using one of the nation's leading models of the U.S. economy, Heritage economists have estimated the effect of raising the minimum wage 90 cents an hour over the next two years on entry-level job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>  According to the Heritage analysis:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A 90 cent increase will cause employers to create over 200,000 <I>fewer</I> entry-level jobs each year by 1999, after which the impact declines. The rise in the minimum wage will increase the unemployment rate by at least 0.1 percentage points in 1998.
<p>
<li>Prices will be at least 0.2 percentage points higher through 1998 as employers pass their increased costs on to both poor and non-poor consumers.
<p>
The minimum wage hurts unskilled Americans the most. A recent study by David Neumark at Michigan State University reveals that the significant negative effects on the employment prospects of unskilled teenagers are masked by their replacement in the work force by more highly skilled teens.<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in the minimum wage proposed by President Clinton would increase the number of unskilled teens who are neither in school nor at work by almost 20 percent. Moreover, there is evidence that teens may actually drop out of school earlier in response to a higher minimum wage. 
</ul><P>
<b>FACTS ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS MISSING FROM THE DEBATE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For the most part, the 3.7 million workers who work at or below the minimum wage can be broken down into two broad groups.<sup>8</sup> 
<p><ul>
<li><b>About half are teenagers or young adults age 21 or less</b>, and most (68.2 percent) of these young workers live in families with incomes two or more times the official poverty level for their family size.<sup>9</sup>  The average family income of a teenage minimum wage worker is around $47,000. Only 12 percent of these young workers live in poor families. 
<p>
<li><b>The other half are workers ages 22 and up.</b> More of these workers live in poor families (27 percent or 367,000 have family incomes below the poverty level) or near poverty (44 percent have family incomes less than one and one-half times the poverty level). However, even among this half of the minimum wage population, 39 percent live in families with incomes two or more times the poverty level, and the average family income of minimum wage workers ages 25 to 61 is around $25,000.
<p>
<li><b>Only 23 percent of minimum wage workers were the sole breadwinners in their families in the previous year.</b><sup>10</sup>  The wage and salary earnings of 56 percent of minimum wage workers account for 25 percent or less of their families' total wage and salary income.
<p>
<li><b>Only 16 percent of minimum wage workers are full-year, full-time employees.</b> Thirty-three percent are part-year, part-time employees, and almost half (48.5 percent) are <I>voluntary</I> part-time workers.<sup>11</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Almost 40 percent of the sole breadwinners earning the minimum wage are voluntary part-time workers,</b> while only 18.8 percent of all minimum wage workers are family heads or spouses working full time.<sup>12</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is incorrect to portray entry-level minimum wage jobs as lifetime dead-end jobs. Instead they should be recognized as opportunities for most people to establish a track record of work and a springboard to better paying jobs. More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>13</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job will receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers will be earning 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>14</sup>  George McGovern put it best when he said, "We forget that too often a job -- any job -- is the best training for a better or more specialized job."<sup>15</sup> 
<p>
<b>THE MINIMUM WAGE DESTROYS ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND INCREASES GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before raising the minimum wage, Congress must ask itself two fundamental questions: Should it be illegal for Americans, young or old, to work at even a part-time job for $4.50 or $5.00 an hour?  And does the federal government have the right to destroy the economic freedom of families by telling parents that their young son or daughter may not work this summer for $4.50 an hour, or that a senior citizen may not work part-time for $5.00 an hour next year? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents defend a minimum wage increase by declaring it to be a moral issue and a moral imperative -- not just an economic or political consideration. The minimum wage, however, epitomizes government paternalism at its worst. It presumes that politicians are morally justified in destroying some people's jobs in order to inflate other people's wages. The American principle of economic freedom has been replaced by the principle of "government knows best."  Decreeing a higher minimum wage without mandating that every American be given a job just knocks the bottom rung off the economic ladder and denies millions their opportunity to begin pursuing the American Dream. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The state of Oregon, in a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court defending its 1917 minimum wage law, revealed the actual implications of such laws: "If Simpson [a woman thrown out of work by the Oregon law] cannot be trained to yield output that does not pay the cost of her own labor, then she can... accept the status of a defective to be segregated for special treatment as a dependent of the state."<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government must share the blame for stagnant wages. Over the years, more and more mandates, higher and higher taxes, and overregulation have shackled the economy, limited productivity, and stagnated real wage growth.<sup>17</sup>  Employers do not -- indeed cannot -- unfairly keep down the wages of their lower-skilled and entry-level employees. Employers, as well as workers, operate within a competitive labor market in which wage rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers -- less the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with employing a worker. But instead of addressing the impediments to wage growth imposed by government, proponents prefer to blame employers for stagnating wages and curry favor with voters by proposing another hike in the minimum wage. Imposing another mandate that raises prices and destroys entry-level job opportunities, however, is not a compassionate or sensible response to the problem.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Raising the minimum wage appeals to the sense of decency and compassion of Americans. But it would be a mistake. Increasing the minimum wage would impose significant costs, primarily on those unskilled Americans a minimum wage hike is supposed to help. It also would raise prices for both the poor and non-poor. It would destroy entry-level job opportunities that otherwise would have been created, and although it could raise some workers' family incomes above poverty, it would do so at the cost of denying jobs to many more workers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To raise the standard of living of minimum wage workers without imposing these costs, Congress should focus on policies that would raise worker productivity while reducing government-imposed labor costs on employers.

<h3>WARNING TO NORTH KOREA: STOP PROVOCATIONS AND TALK PEACE WITH SOUTH KOREA</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 273<br>
April 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
(Updating <I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 236, "Clinton's Korea Policy Falls Short: A Call to Congressional Action," January 13, 1995, and Asian Studies Center <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 133, "The Clinton Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End Street?," November 4, 1994.)
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On three different occasions this past week, communist North Korea sent armed troops into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the border separating the North from South Korea. These provocative moves directly violate the 1953 Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the Korean War. They also raise questions about North Korea's intentions. At risk is not only the security of America's ally, the Republic of Korea, but the safety and security of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. These hostile steps come at a time when the Clinton Administration continues its flawed policy of providing economic benefits to North Korea and improving political relations with its government in the absence of any improvement in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Bill Clinton will visit South Korea on April 16. He will be stopping over on his way to the Japan summit to meet briefly with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. While on Cheju Island, off the peninsula's southwestern tip, President Clinton, in close coordination with President Kim, should make it clear to Pyongyang that unless North Korea takes immediate steps to reduce tensions, the U.S. will curtail its current policy of upgrading U.S.-North Korean relations and bolstering the North's failing economy.
<p>
<b>Pyongyang Attacks the Armistice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

North Korea's recent military moves are a direct attack on the 1953 United Nations-brokered Armistice Agreement that ended hostilities of the Korean War. The Armistice established a Military Armistice Commission (MAC) to maintain the cease-fire, serve as a military channel of communication, and investigate violations of the Armistice. The MAC, too, is sanctioned by the United Nations. The Armistice also established the existing DMZ and the Joint Security Area (JSA) which straddles the border. The JSA is a small, circular compound where the MAC meetings and occasional North-South negotiations have taken place over the years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has taken steps to undermine the functions of the MAC. It refuses to attend scheduled MAC meetings, thus closing the only channel for military communication along the world's most heavily armed border. On April 4, Pyongyang declared that it "shall give up its duty, under the armistice agreement, concerning the maintenance and control of the military demarcation line and the DMZ."  The next day, several hundred heavily armed North Korean soldiers entered the North's side of the JSA and carried out what appeared to be combat training drills. Similar incursions took place on April 6 and 7. These actions are serious violations of the Armistice agreement. Each side is limited to only 35 troops in its sector. Another violation occurred when on April 7 North Korean troops carried rifles, machine guns, and mortars into the Joint Security Area. Soldiers in the JSA are restricted to sidearms only.
<P>
<b>The North's Quest for a Peace Treaty with the U.S.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Pyongyang openly admits that this deliberate destruction of the existing Armistice structure is aimed at a long-standing goal: convincing the U.S. to sign a bilateral peace treaty with the North. Pyongyang hopes that such a treaty would cut Seoul out of the military settlement and pave the way for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. The Clinton Administration rightly insists that the U.S. will never sign such a deal. Since the U.S. fought in the Korean War under the U.N. banner, it should not be attempting to negotiate with North Korea on its own. The only sensible replacement of the existing structure is a peace treaty negotiated and signed by North and South Korean governments.
<p>
<b>U.S. Flexibility Encourages North Korean Belligerence</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has chosen this bold and provocative course of action because the Clinton Administration's Korea policy is weak and misguided. The foundation of Clinton's policy is the "Agreed Framework" of October 1994. Negotiated in an effort to stop the North's menacing nuclear weapons program, the Framework offered certain benefits to the North, including gradual improvement of trade and political ties with Washington, a $50 million-per-year fuel oil supply, and the construction of two nuclear reactors in the North worth about $5 billion. Washington is working with about a dozen allies to raise money to support the deal, but Seoul has pledged to pick up most of the tab. In return, the North agreed to freeze its current nuclear program, thus preventing it from amassing any more weapons-grade plutonium. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, the Clinton Administration backed down on its earlier insistence that Pyongyang immediately provide a full accounting of the plutonium it has produced. Inspection of its fuel storage sites, which the North is obligated to permit under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has been delayed for years to come. In the meantime, the North may be constructing nuclear bombs secretly with the enriched fuel it currently possesses. Even the Clinton Administration admits that the U.S. has no way of detecting such a covert program. The North was pleased with the deal since it offers lucrative benefits yet allows it to keep its nuclear card. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under the Agreed Framework, the North also promised to engage in dialogue with the South and make progress toward tension reduction. But Pyongyang has refused to do this. In fact, as the events of recent days indicate, tensions are as high as ever. The North's million-man army maintains its forward deployment. Its large stockpiles of chemical weapons are of grave concern to U.S. military commanders. The North has a growing missile arsenal which is capable of striking all parts of South Korea.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Agenda While in South Korea</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's Korea policies have failed to protect America's interests on the Korean Peninsula: the reduction of military tension along the DMZ. The North's recent provocations are disturbing evidence not only of its contempt for the Armistice, but for Clinton's Framework agreement as well. While in South Korea on April 16, President Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Express strong U.S. condemnation of the North's actions and reiterate Washington's commitment to the defense of South Korea.</b> The U.S. should bolster U.S. forces in South Korea with AWACS radar aircraft and temporarily deploy one more aircraft carrier to the 7th fleet in the Pacific. These additional forces are necessary to deter the North from undertaking real aggression against the South.
<p>
<li><b>Clearly state that the U.S. will never consider a bilateral peace treaty with the North.</b> President Clinton should remind the North that, in the Reconciliation Agreement ratified by the North and South in 1992, the two sides pledged to negotiate a North-South peace agreement. Clinton should demand that the North abide by this commitment.
<p>
<li><b>
Press Pyongyang for immediate initiation of substantive, high-level talks with Seoul.</b> The 1992 North-South Reconciliation Agreement is a detailed document outlining practical steps toward easing political and military tensions between the two sides and could serve as a blueprint for future dialogue. The North has refused to implement this agreement and instead has focused its efforts on improving its ties with the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>
Remind Pyongyang that the U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord explicitly links tension reduction with the political and economic benefits offered to the North.</b> President Clinton should warn Pyongyang that if it continues to violate both the spirit and letter of the Framework, it will put at risk further implementation of the Framework agreement.
<p>
<li><b>
Discuss with Seoul the appointment of a seasoned American negotiator as a special envoy to jump-start the tension reduction process.</b> A special envoy could seek regular contacts at the highest levels of Pyongyang's secretive and insular ruling elite. He could make clear to the North that the U.S. and South Korea will no longer tolerate the North's provocations. If this message is not hammered home to Pyongyang forcefully and regularly, the North will continue to underestimate America's resolve and misjudge its intentions.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now that the Cold War is over, Pyongyang no longer has China and the Soviet Union standing in the wings prepared to back its military aggression. Nevertheless, apparently oblivious to this fact, North Korea is threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. needs to act now to send North Korea a message: stop the military provocation, live up to its agreements, and start talking peace with Seoul.

<title>The Challenge of Taiwan's Democracy For the United States and China - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY FOR THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 272<br>
April 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
(Updating Asian Studies Center <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 139</a>, "China's Threats to Taiwan Challenge U.S. Leadership in Asia," March 6, 1996; <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup269.html"><I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 269</a>, "China's Missile Diplomacy: A Test of American Resolve in Asia," March 12, 1996; Asian Studies Center <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 140</a>, "How to Bring China and Taiwan Into the World Trade Organization," March 22, 1996.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For the first time in 5,000 years of China's history, a Chinese people have directly elected their leader. This impressive exercise in democracy took place on March 23 in the Republic of China on Taiwan with the election of President Lee Teng-hui. Equally impressive, however, has been the pace of political evolution in the ROC that has transformed a one-party authoritarian system into a multi-party democracy. The direct popular re-election of President Lee was the capstone in a ten-year process of liberalizing national politics and developing democracy on Taiwan, and took place even as China was conducting a campaign of military intimidation against Taiwan. Democracy on Taiwan is of great political and strategic importance. Policymakers in Washington cannot ignore the reality of Taiwan's democracy when dealing with mainland China.

<p>

<b>The Road to Democracy on Taiwan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the ending of martial law in 1987 and the legalization of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party, the democratic transformation of Taiwan has spread across the political landscape at the local, county, provincial, and national levels. In 1992, Taiwan held the first full election of its law-making body (the Legislative Yuan);<sup>1</sup> in December 1994, ROC citizens directly elected Taiwan's provincial governor for the first time. The growth of democracy also involved amending the constitution of the Republic of China in 1994 to allow for the direct election of the president.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taiwan's democratic transformation culminated in a four-month span from December 2, 1995, when ROC citizens for the second time elected members to the Legislative Yuan, to March 23, 1996, when they went to the polls to elect their president directly for the first time.
<p>
<b>The March Election</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 23, 1996, over 10.7 million of Taiwan's 14.3 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the first direct, democratic election of the president of the Republic of China. Incumbent President Lee Teng-hui won re-election overwhelmingly, with 54 percent of the vote. Former political prisoner and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Peng Ming-min came in a distant second with 21 percent of the vote, and New Party candidate Lin Yang-gang and independent Chen Li-an received under 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Winning 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race with 76 percent voter participation earned President Lee Teng-hui an overwhelming mandate to push forward his platform of greater "dignity, vitality, and grand development" for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although overshadowed by the presidential election, elections for the Third National Assembly also were held on March 23. In the National Assembly, the ROC institution charged with managing constitutional reform, the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) maintained its slim majority with 54 percent of the 334 seats. The formerly independent seats were nearly equally divided between the DPP and the New Party, with slightly more going to the DPP. The DPP improved its representation in the assembly from 12.6 percent to 29.6 percent, while the New Party went from zero to 13.7 percent representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the elections of December 1995 and March 1996, the KMT maintains a slim majority in both the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and thus will have to form coalitions in order to conduct the business of government. In the National Assembly, Taiwan's constitutional democracy will have to deal with the political agenda of Taiwan's evolving loyal opposition. The DPP has campaigned for constitutional amendments to eliminate the National Assembly and the office of Taiwan's provincial governor. The KMT opposes these changes, but supports less drastic measures such as extending Legislative Yuan terms from three to four years.

<b>China's Missile Diplomacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing could not have made the contrast between the two Chinese systems more clear. On one side was the PRC -- a communist, one-party, authoritarian state. On the other, a thriving democracy. The PRC threatened the ROC with three military exercises in the three weeks leading up to and during Taiwan's democratic election. The exercises interfered with international commerce and threatened investors' confidence in Taiwan. Almost daily, Beijing shrilly charged President Lee Teng-hui with using "false" democracy to establish a dictatorship on Taiwan. The Chinese also accused Lee of wanting to split Taiwan away from the motherland. Similarly, China warned the United States that it would pay a high price, more dear than in Korea and Vietnam, if it intervened in the Beijing-Taipei dispute -- China's internal affair. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Beijing's military intimidation proved ineffective and counterproductive. The elections took place as scheduled and Lee's margin of victory exceeded expectations. In fact, China's military exercises may have contributed greatly to Lee Teng-hui's overwhelming victory. Many analysts predicted that Lee would have difficulty winning a majority in a four-way race, especially given the good showing of the DPP and New Party in the Legislative Yuan election last December. Partly because of China's missile diplomacy, this turned out not to be the case.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's use of force also failed to accomplish its international objective: to reconfirm to the world that Taiwan is China's internal affair in which the U.S. should not interfere. While the "one China" policy remains official U.S. policy, the PRC's show of force provoked joint resolutions from Congress that urged a stronger commitment to Taiwan's defense than even the former U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty allowed.<sup>2</sup>  That pressure from Congress almost certainly played a role in the Administration's decision to send two aircraft carriers to the vicinity of Taiwan to monitor Beijing's "war games."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's military threats forced Washington to be less ambiguous in its commitments to Taiwan. Previously, the Clinton Administration had maintained that the use of military force to protect Taiwan would depend on circumstances and developments. The dispatch of two carrier battlegroups sent a less ambiguous message. It implied that the U.S. was prepared to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan under current circumstances. In addition, Beijing's heavy-handed tactics soured China's image in the eyes of the American public and policymakers, making it more difficult for the U.S. to pursue its policy of "constructive engagement" with China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the March crisis, Beijing asserted its resolve to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring independence. The U.S. demonstrated its resolve to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan. And Taiwan demonstrated its resolve to move forward with political liberalization, even in the face of Beijing's military threat. In this standoff Taipei was the clear winner, Beijing the clear loser, and Washington fell somewhere in between. Taiwan stood up to Beijing's threats, garnered favorable world-wide headlines, and elicited further demonstrations of support from the United States. By contrast, Beijing soured global public opinion with its irresponsible display of military force and provoked a stronger than expected military response from the United States. In Washington, the Congress and media pushed a reluctant Clinton Administration into a stronger position vis--vis China and Taiwan. 
<p>

<b> A New Strategic Environment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now that the Taiwan elections are over, it is time for the U.S. to take stock of its positions and policies toward China and Taiwan. Ever since 1950, when President Truman sent the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait at the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. has been part of a strategic triangle with the PRC and the ROC. For 46 years America's aim has been to prevent either the PRC or the ROC from using non-peaceful means to resolve the question of Taiwan's status. This triangular relationship survived near nuclear crises in the 1950s and changes in diplomatic recognition in the 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise of democracy on Taiwan changes this triangular relationship and forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance. Economic and political freedom on Taiwan amplify the lack of similar freedoms in China. Taiwan has proven that free enterprise and democracy are compatible with and desirable in a Chinese society. Taiwan's rapid progress leaves many Americans impatient for similarly rapid change on the mainland. For the U.S., democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking improved relations with China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For China, democracy on Taiwan takes away Beijing's self-proclaimed ability to speak for the people of Taiwan. Beijing no longer is able to extend a hand of friendship to the people of Taiwan while slapping its leader in the face. It is increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people, while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese people who elected him.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan for several reasons. Democracy makes the government of Taiwan less predictable and harder to control, since it now must respond to the electorate's competing interests or be voted out of office. Democracy on Taiwan also increases the sympathy of the world's other advanced democracies for Taiwan. Moreover, Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan because it contrasts so strikingly with the leadership selection process on the mainland. In fact, it strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. What if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative?  The answer no longer can be that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Taiwan, democracy is also of great strategic importance. Fifteen years from now, Taiwan's hostile neighbor will be economically and militarily capable of dominating it, and possibly conquering it. Democracy is more important to Taiwan's strategic defense than any weapon system it could acquire. It makes Taiwan much more likely to draw support from the U.S. and other developed democracies in the event of any real threat from the mainland.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, though, democracy on Taiwan challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan. Reunification can take place only within a political system in which the government is responsive to the interests of the governed, not where the governed are beholden to the dictates of the government. By proving that democracy is possible and desirable in a Chinese society, Taiwan opens the door for Beijing to adopt such a system to protect the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
<p>

<b>What Is At Stake</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At stake in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship is peace and stability in Asia. American interests in this relationship range from freedom of navigation on the high seas, to control of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, to the development of democracy and free enterprise in Chinese society, to access to the markets of America's sixth and seventh largest trading partners -- the PRC and the ROC, respectively. In order to best serve these interests, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue.</b> For the Chinese themselves to resolve Taiwan issues, as posited in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqu, they must meet face to face to negotiate.<sup>3</sup>  Beijing suspended Taiwan's primary channel of communication with the mainland last July in response to Lee Teng-hui's visit to the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. should use its ability to communicate with Beijing to encourage Beijing and Taipei to restore this forum for the discussion of fundamental issues in cross-Strait relations.
<p.
<b><li>Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.</b> Washington should lend its support to Taiwan's membership in international commercial and cultural organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria for membership in the WTO, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its entry, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<P>
<b><li>Urge Beijing to allow Taiwan to play an appropriate role in the international system.</b> Beijing must work with Taiwan to evolve an appropriate role for Taiwan in the international system. Taiwan is a separate, autonomous, and prosperous region which can and should play a role in international affairs. Taiwan is simply too large and important as a trading nation for either Beijing or Washington to ignore. Beijing must accept this reality. All international economic and cultural organizations, whether they technically require sovereignty or not, should be mutually agreeable. The successful examples of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should be followed to allow both Beijing and Taipei to participate in international organizations.
<p>
<b><li>Sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, especially strategic missile defense.</b> Washington should continue to sell arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan in accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Given recent threats from Beijing, the U.S. should assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile defense system.
<P>
<b><li>Avoid linking MFN and Taiwan issues.</b> Washington should carefully consider the unintended consequences of any actions taken against China, such as revoking most-favored-nation trade status or applying unilateral sanctions, as they may indirectly harm Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention U.S. workers and consumers. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle rests are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the U.S. and other markets. Revoking MFN could cut Hong Kong's gross domestic product in half, deal a serious blow to Taiwan's economy, and jeopardize the 200,000 high-wage American jobs that depend on U.S. exports to China.
<p>
<b><li>Urge Taipei to avoid cross-Strait conflict and provocation.</b> Taipei must know that the U.S. wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the people of Taiwan to seek political and economic freedom and a greater role in world affairs. However, Taipei must understand that any unilateral action to determine the status of Taiwan, including a unilateral declaration of independence, is counter to the U.S. interest in peace and stability in Asia. Taipei must work with Washington and Beijing to ensure its security, and to protect its economic prosperity, by reasonably avoiding conflict and provocation.
<p>
<b><li>
Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement.</b> There is little chance of peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status if one party is negotiating with a gun pointed at its head. One possible way to defuse the tension could be for Taipei to pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time and for Beijing to respond by renouncing the use of force for that period of time. The U.S. could add credibility to a cross-Strait armistice agreement by endorsing it.
<p>
<b><li>
Engage in preventive diplomacy.</b> Beijing clearly misread the Taiwan electorate and miscalculated the international response toward China's missile diplomacy. To prevent such misunderstanding and miscalculation from occurring again, the U.S. must improve communication with Chinese leaders at the highest level. The U.S. should promptly and clearly inform Chinese leaders of the likely response Beijing's actions will provoke in a democracy where elected leaders must respond to constituent interests and public opinion. In Beijing a better understanding of America's democracy will help build stronger relations with the U.S. and the American people. Improved Sino-American relations are not only in the interest of China and the U.S., but of Taiwan as well.
</ul><p>


<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy. Despite a firestorm of military and rhetorical threats from Beijing, the electoral process in Taiwan functioned freely and fairly. Over 600 visiting journalists witnessed the triumph of democracy in Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election was truly an historic event. Leaders in Beijing, Taipei, and Washington now must assess the strategic implications of democracy on Taiwan. A new balance must be established in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship. Central to a new equilibrium must be a new international role for the Republic of China. This role should comport with Taiwan's standing as an economic powerhouse and mature democracy. Also central to the new balance should be an increased dialogue allowing Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work out their differences. As they do so, both should accept not only the need for maintaining peace and stability, but also the fact that democracy now exists in the Republic of China on Taiwan.

<title>AFL-CIO To Impose New "Taxes" On Its Members - Heritage</title>

<h3>AFL-CIO TO IMPOSE NEW "TAXES" ON ITS MEMBERS</h3>

By Charles P. Griffin<br>
Deputy Director, Government Reform Project<p>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1068.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1068</a>, "Oregon Election Previews AFL-CIO's Political Plans," February 7, 1996)<br>
Backgrounder Update No. 270<br>
March 14, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bgup270.gif">Chart 1</a>: Average Spending Against House Incumbents
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase its political muscle, the AFL-CIO has announced plans for two new union "taxes," including a more than one-third increase in per-member levies on constituent unions, to fund organized labor's 1996 partisan election activity. The new fees -- levied by the AFL-CIO on its members --  will finance the federation's previously announced $35 million campaign against the current Congress. This year alone, the additional income from these new charges will exceed $75 million for an organization whose annual budget was only $65 million last year. And despite the fact that 40 percent of union members voted Republican in the 1994 elections, the federation apparently intends to spend 100 percent of the new funds opposing GOP candidates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put its 1996 political expenditures in perspective, the AFL-CIO expects to spend seven times its usual campaign budget and three times more than it has ever spent in any previous election year.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, when the $35 million budget is allocated among the 75 targeted districts -- predominantly Republican freshmen, according to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney -- the average per-district expenditure is $467,000. In the 1994 election cycle, by contrast, the average challenger spent $239,000. Moreover, the $35 million figure represents only the AFL-CIO's planned political activities. Individual unions within the federation, as well as unaffiliated unions, will likely conduct additional election efforts.
<p>

<b>36 Percent Increase to be Ratified at March 25 Convention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While meeting during the last week of February at a posh resort in Bal Harbour, Florida, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and his Executive Council decided to increase by more than one-third the fees it imposes on union members. Member unions currently are assessed 42 cents per member per month. The new assessment will increase this by 15 cents to 57 cents per member per month. It is expected that this will raise $25 million of the $35 million needed for the federation's 1996 political efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 25, 1996, the AFL-CIO will hold a special convention in Washington to ratify this extraordinary increase. (The Executive Council decided this new fee exceeded the amount they could approve on their own.) The intent of the new fundraising effort is clear:  AFL-CIO leaders plan to endorse President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the same meeting.

<p>
<b>AFL-CIO Cuts $375 Million Credit Card Deal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As if a 36 percent increase in members' fees was not enough to finance the AFL-CIO's expensive 1996 political agenda, it also was announced in Bal Harbour that the federation had cut a new credit card deal. The AFL-CIO has an "affinity card" with the federation's logo that is marketed to union members by a bank. In return, a portion of the fees paid by union members for credit card use is paid to the federation. Under the terms of the new agreement with Household International, the AFL-CIO will receive at least $375 million in profits over the first five years, with a special $50 million signing bonus payable in the next few months.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the AFL-CIO has attempted to portray this new agreement as good for workers, the bank presumably could offer better terms to union members if the federation were not receiving such large payments. If a bank acting alone diverted credit card profits to other ventures, Sweeney and his allies no doubt would complain of "corporate greed."  When the AFL-CIO does the same thing to advance its own political ambitions, it apparently is virtuous.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the leadership of the AFL-CIO basked in the sun in Bal Harbour, Florida, they decided to impose two costly fee increases on its hardworking rank-and-file members. It is unfortunate that the federation's new leadership has placed such a strong and costly emphasis on partisan political gamesmanship. Just this year, over $75 million will be taken from rank-and-file union workers -- of varying political views -- to support the federation's endorsement of Bill Clinton and its campaign against congressional Republicans. These new union "taxes" will be used, in effect, to oppose real tax relief for all American workers.

<title>With Liberty and Justice For All - Heritage Lecture</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 560 </b><p><h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Educational Programs</a></h2><hr> <h3>With Liberty and Justice <I>For All</I></h3>

By Ward Connerly<br>
April 30, 1996
<p><blockquote>
<I>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</I>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-one words tightly compressed into one sentence, a sentence that is more universally known and more often repeated in America than any other.
<p>
<img src="lect560.gif" align=left alt="Ward Connerly with Dr. Matthew Spalding, Director, Lectures and Educational Programs"><caption><b>Ward Connerly with Heritage's Dr. Matthew Spalding</b></caption><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is hardly a day that passes that I do not recite that pledge -- in public or in private -- at least half a dozen times. How many hundreds of times has each of us recited those words?  Do we reflect on the meaning of the words embodied in that sentence, or is it like so many other things we say during the course of our days, giving little thought or commitment to what is meant?  "Have a nice day."  "Good to see you again."  Perfunctory words of life.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But this pledge is no ordinary sentence. It is a definition of American democracy and a constant reaffirmation of our dedication to the fundamental principles of that democracy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You flatter and honor me today by this opportunity to share what I believe is the significance of that pledge, to visit with you and discuss the meaning of American citizenship, America's passion for fairness, matters relating to that delicate subject of race, and why I believe the time is at hand for us to pursue a new course with regard to what we call "affirmative action."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When we become citizens of this nation, at birth or otherwise, we get a warranty. That warranty is supposed to honored by every government franchise in every village and hamlet of this nation. It is not transferable, and it is good for the life of the vehicle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are guaranteed the right to vote; the right to due process; the right to be free, not to be enslaved, as long as we conduct ourselves in accordance with the laws of our nation; and the right to equal treatment under the law, regardless of our race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. These are rights which attach to us as individuals, not as members of a group.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This warranty has not always been honored for some of us. Because of the color of our skin or the place from whence we came, some of us were denied the right to vote; we were enslaved; we were denied due process; and the equal treatment granted to others was not ours to enjoy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In my lifetime, I can give testimony to America's meaner instincts and their consequences upon my life. To reflect upon this nation's past, with my racial background, it is tempting to mock that pledge, to devalue the warranty, and to be embittered by those who would urge me to forget the past. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One need only invoke a few memories to become enraged and to feel entitled to all of the preferences that can be presented:
<p><ul>
<li>Rosa Parks relegated to the back of the bus,
<p>
<li>Drinking fountains for "whites only,"
<p>
<li>Restrooms for "men," "women," and "colored,"
<p>
<li>George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse door saying "segregation now, segregation forever,"
<P>
<li>Images of black people being hosed in the streets simply because they demanded that the warranty be honored,
<p>
<li>And my thirty-year-old uncle being called "boy" by a ten-year-old white kid.
</ul> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because we were treated like animals, there are some who say "America owes us."  But the past is a ghost that can destroy our future. It is dangerous to dwell upon it. To focus on America's mistakes is to disregard its virtues. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This nation has a passion for fairness. That passion is evidenced in our Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, in executive orders, in court decisions. But most of all, it courses through the arteries of our culture. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is the centerpiece of virtually all of our religious faiths.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That great American pastime -- baseball -- is a reminder of the intensity of our passion for fairness as we exhort the crowd to "kill the umpire" if he makes what we consider an unfair call. As we drive home at the end of the day, our hands gripping the steering wheel, our bumper kissing the one ahead, when to our right a vehicle speeds along the curb and merges ahead of us at the moment when an opening appears, our passion for fairness surfaces. The protrusion of one of our fingers signals our belief that one of the rules of fairness has been violated. In every sport I can think of -- baseball, basketball, football, tennis -- one is expected to play between the white lines. To do otherwise is unfair and carries a penalty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our passion for fairness seeps out of every pore of our existence. Great leaders understand that passion. In his early days, when members of his own church were urging him to "cool it," Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. appealed to America's sense of fairness and morality. It was Dr. King's appeal to fairness that resonated throughout the land and inspired Americans of all races and colors to travel to the deep South and to put their lives on the line in defense of what they considered the right thing, the fair thing to do.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has its roots in that passion for fairness. When President Lyndon Johnson explained affirmative action to the nation, it is significant that he said, "You can't bring a man to the starting line who has been hobbled by chains and expect him to run the race competitively."  Fairness dictated that the nation pursue affirmative action to compensate black Americans for the wrong that had been done. Affirmative action was a technique for jump-starting the process of integrating black Americans into the fabric of American society, for changing the culture of America from an exclusive society into an inclusive one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe affirmative action was meant to be temporary. It was meant to be a stronger dose of equal opportunity for individuals, and the prescription was intended to expire when the body politic had developed sufficient immunity to the virus of prejudice and discrimination. It was not meant to be a system of preferences that would harm innocent people. The rationale for affirmative action thirty years ago was a moral one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Three decades later, affirmative action is permanent and firmly entrenched as a matter of public policy. It has its own constituency that is prepared to defend its continuation at any cost, not because of any moral imperative, but because it has become the battleground for a political and economic war that has racial self-interest as its centerpiece.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action, as most of us originally understood the term, enjoyed the support of a majority of Americans. Many Americans still support this concept as long as it does not involve preferences. Preferences, on the other hand, were wrong at the outset and are wrong today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has become a system of racial preferences in my state. Jobs are solicited with explicit acknowledgment that we want a woman or an African-American or a Hispanic for this position. Contracts are set aside for certain groups, with the taxpayers paying what amounts to an affirmative action tax. This is the result of contractors who set up shell minority and women-owned businesses to front for white-owned businesses in order to benefit from the minority set-asides.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wealthy sons and daughters of underrepresented minorities receive extra points on their admissions applications to the university, based solely on their race, while higher-achieving Asians and whites from lower-income families are turned away from the university. Families are forced to mortgage their homes to send their children out of state to an institution comparable to Berkeley and UCLA. A racial matrix is used at most of our campuses which establishes a racial pecking order that distributes extra points on the basis of one's racial background.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When this nation began its use of affirmative action decades ago, America's racial landscape was rather clear. There was the dominant white majority and the oppressed black minority. Today, we have several dozen racial and ethnic categories in California. There is no dominant majority and there is no oppressed minority. Within a few years, the group which will numerically be the largest is Hispanic. Our racial tensions are no longer just black and white. They are black and Korean, black and Hispanic, white and Hispanic, Russian and Hispanic. Every conceivable racial conflict is present and lurking somewhere beneath the surface in California. How, then, do we decide who among us should receive a preference?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A direct product of our diversity is the emergence of a whole new set of racial configurations and problems which defy the old racial order. Yet affirmative action operates as if the old order was still in place, as if our racial dilemma was still black against white.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end of affirmative action will be difficult for black Americans. It is our nature not to be trusting of the goodwill of whites. It is instinctive for us to harbor the belief that our rights will only be as secure as the amount of ammunition issued to the federal troops to protect us. Well, it is time to let the troops go home and to place our faith in the American system of democracy, in America's passion for fairness. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 It is time for black Americans to enter the arena of democracy instead of seeing ourselves as spectators. <I>This</I> is our land, not Africa. The blood and sweat of black Americans can be found in the pot of democracy in just as great a quantity as that of others. It is time for black Americans to accept America proudly as their land, the land of opportunity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To black Americans, I say look through the windshield at America's opportunity, not through the rearview mirror at this nation's mistakes. Resist the temptation to believe that our nation owes us a debt. Let us take the initiative to say that the debt has been paid and the books are closed. And the Republican Party should say, "Come home to your party; you have been gone too long."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant phenomenon in my state is the growing political influence of Hispanics. As the emerging numerical majority, many Hispanics see affirmative action as their passport to college, jobs, and contracts. Many see affirmative action as a tool that has benefited black Americans, and they now believe it is their turn to be the preferred minority. They see it as the express lane to a better life. I urge them not to pursue this strategy. It is corrosive and dangerous. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked why it is that California, one of the most multiracial states in the nation, is the first to begin the process of dismantling affirmative action. The answer is twofold: First, because California is a window of the future, we often experience events before other states. Second, it is precisely because of our diversity that we know how destructive affirmative action can be of fundamental democratic values of self-reliance, individualism, and equal opportunity for all.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
California is as close as any society on the face of the Earth to being that promised land where racism is considered repulsive and has no place. But this promised land can become a battle zone if we allow the continued tribalization of California.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can point with pride to the fact that the mayor of one of America's favorite cities, San Francisco, is a black man: Willie Brown. The mayor of one of the largest cities in the nation, Los Angeles, for years was a black man: Tom Bradley. Our two United States Senators are women. The mayor of our state capital is Hispanic: Joe Serna. Although I as a Republican don't always agree with the political judgment of my fellow Californians, I believe no one can dispute their egalitarian impulses. As one looks at <a href="http://www.ca.gov">California state government</a>, for example, the conclusion is inescapable: Equal opportunity is now inbred. The cabinet of Governor Wilson is nearly equally divided among men and women, and it only takes a casual meeting with any of them to confirm that raw talent, and not affirmative action, is the basis of that fact.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am terrified at the prospect of what can become of us if we maintain our existing preference policies. In police departments, in fire departments, in middle-class homes throughout California, there is a growing perception that if I am white, I and my kids will not have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter where it comes from, if anyone among us believes the warranty is not being honored, we have a duty to investigate the legitimacy of their complaint and to make it right if their complaint is proven to be valid.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout this debate, you will hear about blacks being stopped in white neighborhoods, about white women clutching their purses as black men approach, about the difficulty of black men getting a taxi in urban centers late at night, about the glass ceiling, about the lack of role models, about the percentage of black males in prison, and about the shortage of women in the Congress. All of these complaints warrant our attention, but none of them, no matter how true, justifies a suspension of that warranty that I talked about.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are those who say that racism and sexism are not dead in America, and they are correct. But racism and sexism in our society do not justify our government giving a preference to Jose over Chang because Susan's father discriminated against Willie's father fifty years ago. Not in America.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you are a student of history, you know that every now and then, the opportunity to alter the course of human events presents itself. Such is now the occasion for the people of this nation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every now and then, the challenge confronts us to step out from among the crowd to perform extraordinary acts. Such is the moment for the Republican Party.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge is to end the corrosive system of racial preferences that has evolved in our nation, a system that has the potential to fatally damage the most fundamental values of our democracy, and to do so in a way that does not unleash the meaner instincts of some and the fears of others. The opportunity is to resume that noble journey of building an inclusive family of Americans in which men and women of all races and colors can work and play in harmony, with mutual respect and expecting nothing more than an equal opportunity to compete, and from that competition to build that more perfect union of which our forefathers dreamed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vehicle for this journey is the California Civil Rights Initiative. This initiative is simple and direct: No government agency shall discriminate against anyone on the basis of race, sex, or national origin, and no government agency shall give anyone preferential treatment for any of those reasons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two days ago, I appeared on a talk show with Congresswoman Maxine Waters. She argued that the California Civil Rights Initiative will create divisiveness. That may be true, but we are not the ones creating the divisiveness. Those who cling to the notion that preferences must continue are the ones responsible for dividing our society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the student who works hard for four years to earn a 4.0 grade point average only to be denied admission to Berkeley or UCLA in favor of someone with a 3.0, merely because UC wants racial diversity, whether she thinks we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the poor Vietnamese student who is turned away from Berkeley or Irvine, despite his high grades, in favor of a wealthy underrepresented minority whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he is satisfied with the explanation that we are getting too many Asians at those campuses.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the daughter of a third-generation Chinese-American family whether she thinks we are being divisive when we say that it is unfair for applicants who are in this country illegally to get a preference over her.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the parents of James Cook, one of only two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins University in 1994 only to be denied admission to UC San Diego medical school because he is white, whether they think we are being divisive. Ask them and thousands of other middle-class families, who are forced to take out $80,000 to $100,000 second mortgages on their homes to send their kids out of state to college because racial preferences prevent them from being able to attend UC, whether they think we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the high-achieving black or Chicano student who works hard and gains entry to college solely on the basis of his merit, but who then must endure the nagging question of whether he was admitted because of affirmative action, whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he thinks it's fair that his accomplishments are devalued.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Do we not believe it was divisive when those from an earlier period said that slavery is immoral and should be ended?  Was it not divisive when our nation's people fought among themselves over this very issue?  Was it not divisive when we sent troops into Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, to protect the rights of people like Rosa Parks and James Meredith to ensure their right to sit wherever they wanted on the bus and to attend a college that wasn't segregated?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, those were divisive times. But the seeds of division are planted not by those of us who seek to eliminate racial and ethnic preferences; they are planted by those who believe that our skin color and gender and how we spell our last name should entitle us to the harvest of diversity -- college admission, government employment, and contracts. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friend and ally throughout this experience has been <a href="http://www.ca.gov/gov/governor.html">Governor Pete Wilson</a>. When I first brought the fact to him that the University of California was engaged in an offensive system of racial preferences, the governor unhesitatingly said, "Let's fix it."  When our opponents accuse us of being divisive, the governor is correct when he says that sometimes the only way to resolve issues in a democracy is through the ballot box. That is why this initiative is so important.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I find it interesting that a nation which claims to have the heart to solve an ethnic war in Bosnia shouldn't have the stomach to prevent one here at home. If there is any lesson that we can learn from the rest of the world, it is that America's experiment with democracy will fail if we divide our people into racial enclaves and allocate jobs, contracts, and college educations on the basis of group identity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We often hear about the "angry white male."  If anyone is discriminated against because of his or her color, they have a right to be angry. And we should all share that anger, not belittle or rationalize it by citing glass ceiling statistics. As individuals, none of our rights are secure when the fruits of our society are allocated on the basis of group allotments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yogi Berra once said, "When you reach a fork in the road, take it."  Well, try as we might, we can't take his advice. We must make a conscious choice. We can continue down the path of numerical parity, racial preferences, and a continuing preoccupation with the concept of race. We can continue perpetuating the outdated premise on which racial preferences are based: that blacks, women, and other minorities are incapable of competing without a handicap. Or we can return to the fundamentals of our democracy: the supremacy of the individual, equal opportunity for the individual, and zero tolerance for discrimination.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As a Republican, I want my party to be known not just as the party that eliminated the deficit and concerned itself with the fiscal health of our nation. I want us to be remembered as the party that stood fast in support of the proposition that racial preferences are a social deficit that has to be eliminated, that true equality of opportunity cannot be compromised, that the next generation should not have to inherit the task of solving the horrible problems that affirmative action is creating. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not worried about the skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Aryan Nation. In our time, we have discredited them and their brand of racism. Now we must fight those who, in their own way, peddle a form of racism and bigotry that is just as destructive of democratic principles as the bigots of yesteryear.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You know, it pains me to say that within the past year, I have experienced more hate from my fellow black Americans than I have seen in the previous 55 1/2 years of my life. For example, a black state senator, Diane Watson, recently said that I want to be white, that I consider myself colorless, that I have no racial pride -- all because my wife is white and because I oppose racial discrimination and racial preferences.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one thing that I have learned from this experience is that bigots come in all shapes and colors. Despite their physical differences, they have one thing in common; they all reside in the same intellectual sewer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The senator is right about several things. First, I do want to be colorless in the eyes of my government. I thought that was a goal to which we all subscribed. Second, I am lacking in racial pride. I have self-pride. I am proud to be an American. I am proud to be a Rotarian. I am proud of my family. I am proud to own my own business. But I am racially indifferent, not racially proud.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Those who proclaim pride in their color or race trouble me, unless they have earned that color lying on the beach or in front of a sun lamp. To any of you who want to travel down that road of racial pride, leave me out of the vehicle. But I urge you to be attentive for those signs which read, "slippery road ahead."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And so, my friends, we find ourselves poised at this moment in the life of a great people, trying to define the character of our nation. Throughout America, we are restructuring our institutions. Our nation is desperately trying to embrace policies which place greater reliance on the rights and responsibilities of individuals. The debate about affirmative action must be seen in that context.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This issue will define the political parties in our nation for generations to come. The challenge for Republicans will be to convince all Americans that preferences are not in the national best interest, that a preference for some means a loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness for others. We have to convince black Americans, a group which has become addicted to the drug of a powerful central government, that their rights can be no more secure than anyone else's when we empower government to make decisions about people's lives on the basis of a government melanometer which measures melanin levels. None of our rights are secure in a game of racial self-interest.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will never abandon my faith that America can become Ronald Reagan's "shining city on the hill," a society in which a person's gender or race or ethnic background are irrelevant in the transactions of their government. Let us not mourn the death of affirmative action. Instead, let us proclaim our belief that the spirit of equal opportunity, which affirmative action engendered, has become a permanent feature of America's social, economic, and political landscape. Let us have faith in our own sense of fair play.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On February 27, 1860, in his Cooper Institute address, President Lincoln urged his party to hold fast to their beliefs: "neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government, nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why do I take the position I have?  Because it is my duty as an American citizen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked if I would do it over again, knowing what I know now about the loss of privacy, the personal insults, and the occasional negative stories. My response is: "in a heartbeat."  This is the price of citizenship in a democracy. This is the fee which democracy exacts from each of us. If you don't have the courage of your convictions, then you forfeit the best that a democracy has to offer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Please indulge me in this moment of personal pride, as a citizen who has no political aspirations, who derives no economic benefit from this effort, in sharing with you the fact that I have taken the best blows that the opposition has been able to deliver, and I am still in the ring and on my feet.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it too presumptuous of me to say that one person can indeed make a difference?  Is it too naive of me to consider my experience as a reassurance that democracy works, that the republic for which it stands is a value worthy of our aspirations and dedication?  Is it wrong for me to think that the Pledge of Allegiance obligates me to believe and act upon my belief that the pursuit of liberty and justice for all is a duty for all of us?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I hope you will agree with me that those propositions are not presumptuous and naive.

<h3>Beyond Rhetoric: A Renewed U.S. Commitment To Hemispheric Free Trade</h3>

By Cresencio Arcos<br>
April 8, 1996

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Italian adventurer Amerigo Vespucci landed on the eastern coast of South America, he never could have imagined that the entire Hemisphere one day would carry his name. Nor could he have envisioned what we see today -- that after 500 years of starkly different histories among its many nations, the Hemisphere finally may be finding a common future. There is, however, no guarantee that Vespucci's Americas will realize their full potential. In fact, it is more accurate to say there are far more roadblocks ahead of us than those we have already cleared away. History may well look back on the '90s in the Americas as a decade of opportunities lost. I strongly hope this is not the case, but recent events do not engender confidence that we are well on the road to a robust commercial and economic integration of the Americas. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This is all the more frustrating given that the U.S. has the power and the influence, if it wishes to use them, to be a force for positive change in the Americas. Our market dwarfs all others in the Hemisphere, and is arguably more open than any other country's, with perhaps the exception of Chile's in some areas. This huge U.S. market is extremely attractive to Latin American countries and can give us enormous leverage in opening markets in the region. However, we are on the verge of losing this strategic advantage by shirking our role as the natural leader in promoting economic liberalization.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It does not have to be this way. There is still time for the U.S. to alter its course and reassert itself. But in order for us to do that, we must take an honest look at what has gone wrong and how to fix it. First, a look at what has gone wrong. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Contrary to the many accounts that the vision of the Summit of the Americas (in reference to the Hemispheric Summit in Miami in 1994) is being fulfilled, the Hemispheric trade agenda is in a holding pattern. That nothing of tremendous substance came out of the Cartagena meetings should be of no surprise. In fact, that they even agreed to meet again next year to continue the dialogue should give us great cause to celebrate. There are several reasons why the Hemispheric trade agenda at this moment appears to be a rudderless ship, being pulled here and there by the daily tides: the peso crisis in Mexico, election year politics in the U.S., and the increased influence of Brazil in promoting a Hemispheric trade regime different from the NAFTA.
<p>
<b>U.S. RETREAT AFTER NAFTA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Coming off an all-time high from the negotiation and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we perhaps overlooked the fact that there would be bumps in the road and occasional setbacks. So when the peso crisis hit Mexico in December 1994, the free trade opponents like Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan said it only showed that they were right all along -- Mexico was just waiting to trick the U.S. into signing the NAFTA so it could devalue the peso and flood the U.S. with Mexican goods. Of course, it didn't show that at all. In fact, without a NAFTA the U.S. would have seen its exports to Mexico drop by over 50 percent, like it did in 1982 when Mexico devalued, instead of the 17 percent drop we experienced last year. But the Perot/Buchanan accusations were superficially appealing, and so they stuck, and politicians in the U.S. began to worry about coming out too strongly in favor of trade in the Americas. Then the economic situation in Mexico deteriorated rapidly and the U.S. came to their aid as the leader of a $48 billion loan guarantee package. This had the unintended consequence of splitting the free trade coalition in Congress (many of the supporters of the NAFTA were opposed to the loan guarantees), and placing the Clinton Administration in the unenviable position of defending the loan guarantees during an election year in which the vast majority of Americans opposed the loan package. From that time forward it was apparent that we would see little if any action from Congress or the White House to advance the FTAA until after the elections, in 1997. When the election cycle kicked into high gear several months ago, it became even more apparent that free trade would be under attack when Pat Buchanan made trade the focus of his political campaign. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With the U.S. stepping back, a political vacuum was created in the Hemisphere. This vacuum has now been partially filled by the ascendance of the Brazilians, who favor a "go slow" approach to an FTAA. They believe that NAFTA-styled free trade would hurt Latin American countries, and instead have proposed a South American free trade agreement first, which would then be able to negotiate with the U.S. on much more so-called favorable terms. I say so-called favorable, because that type of a trading regime most likely would not be favorable to U.S. businesses, nor do I believe it would be favorable to South American economies in the long run. It would, however, most likely be favorable to the economic interests of the status quo that I will describe later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, as much as I am worried about the Brazilian initiative, I am far more troubled by the lack of U.S. leadership. After all, we are the ones holding most of the cards, and we cannot blame the Brazilians for pursuing their own interests once we have stepped back from the table. And although U.S. retrenchment may be understandable given our domestic political situation, we must realize this carries a price: namely, that Latin American countries will not unilaterally open their markets without reciprocity from the U.S. Ironically, the "opening" the U.S. needs to make is rather minor, given our already low tariffs and non-tariff barriers. But without providing a secure market for Latin American goods under a NAFTA-styled trade agreement, we will not be able to wrest political concessions from our Hemispheric trading partners. Why?  Because the commercial status quo is so hard to change. We only need to look at our own textile or agricultural industry to be convinced of that. 
<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL NATURE OF TRADE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Let's be honest, free trade is not good for everyone. It is not good for monopolies and it is not good for those seeking special favors or protections through government laws or regulators. Just to give you one example from my own industry. Up until just a few years ago, most local, long distance, and international telephone services in foreign countries were owned by government monopolies. In several countries in Latin America that still is the case. These monopolies produce poor service at high prices and reap windfall profits for doing so. In contrast, in Chile today telecommunications service is good, prices are down, and competition flourishes. In Argentina, competition in local service has also increased service, while its monopoly service for international long distance continues to keep prices well above market rates. So why don't the other Latin American countries quickly adopt the Chilean model?  Because there is more money to be made, and more political interests to be protected, by keeping things as they are. This rule works in Argentina and Mexico just like it works here in the U.S. In other words, although global competition may encourage market liberalization, the decision to open markets or keep them closed ultimately is a political one.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is neither good nor bad that market liberalization depends on politics. It is only bad when we fail to realize trade in this political context, and then wonder why our policies are ineffective. In other words, leaders in Latin America cannot place some of their protected industries in jeopardy under a free trade pact unless they can at the same time provide their competitive industries with access to our markets. The same political dynamic applied to President Clinton and Bob Dole when they sought passage of NAFTA. So if our agenda to create an FTAA by 2005 is seen in Latin America as harming more political and commercial interests than it helps, it will most likely be unacceptable. This is what is happening now. As Latin American politicians have come to believe we will not provide them the political cover they need -- consistent entry into the world's largest market through accession to NAFTA -- they have either postponed or withdrawn plans to make concessions to open their markets to our products and businesses.
<p>
<b>FOUR KEY AREAS OF U.S. TRADE POLICY </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assuming we can once again commit ourselves to this agenda, there are four areas on which we need to focus our efforts as we attempt to create an FTAA. They are: 1) intellectual property rights, 2) procurement, 3) competition policy, and 4) services, and a fifth issue that covers all of them -- transparency. Let me describe the challenges we at AT&T and U.S. businesses face in each area. 
<p>
<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although most of the debate of IPR has centered on the pharmaceutical company, there is much more at stake. Lax or nonexistent enforcement of intellectual property rights robs U.S. businesses of billions of dollars worldwide. The growing U.S. software and entertainment industries and what could be termed its emerging "information-based" industries are not protected in many Latin American countries. Although some Latin American countries believe they are benefiting from this lax enforcement, they are undermining a respect for property rights in general, and that will ultimately undermine the growth of their own nascent technology-based industries.
<p>
<b>Procurement</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Procurement of government services plays a much larger role in Latin American economies than it does in the U.S., with some Latin American governments controlling directly or indirectly the majority of the spending power in the country. And although the issue of procurement in the trade arena has generally dealt with how government contracts would be awarded, the telecommunications industry is particularly interested in a broader definition. The telecommunications industry is such a highly regulated field that its very existence depends on a clear and concise regulatory regime in the awarding of government contracts -- that is, in the awarding of concessions for the right to provide a wide range of telecommunications services. Our trade negotiators must attempt to remove any barriers that would prevent U.S. businesses from getting a fair chance in bidding on these "contracts." 
<p>
<b>Services</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The services industry in the U.S. employs far more workers than any other sector of the economy. And a larger percentage of our exports are now in services. Over 20 percent of exports to Latin America are in services, and that number would be much higher if we were provided all the protections our industries are provided here in the U.S. In Latin America many services industries, like telecommunications and financial services, still are considered "strategic," and as such are controlled by the government. In many Latin American countries, foreign investment is limited to a minority stake. For example, Brazil is liberalizing its telecommunications industry by allowing competition in cellular phone services. However, it is limiting foreign investment in those projects to 49 percent. If it maintains that restriction, it will limit the ability of AT&T and other U.S. companies to invest; but it will also limit the ability of the Brazilians to have the most advanced and well capitalized telecommunications system available. Lifting all restrictions on foreign investment would truly be a win/win proposition for both parties. A Brazilian official recently mentioned that his government might change this limitation. This is encouraging, and we hope the changes are made, but the U.S. would be in a much better position to influence the outcome if it were actively engaged in the process. 
<p>
<b>Competition Policy</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Competition policy is perhaps the most important area of interest. It was finally included as a legitimate subject of inquiry at Cartagena, when a working group was formed to study its implications. Broadly defined, competition policy is a set of principles that will foster competition at the local as well as international level. One of those principles is the creation and protection of long-term property rights, including contract rights. This requires a judicial process where contracts are respected and enforced. Contracts that extend beyond a five-year period are rare in Latin America, and you will hardly ever find contracts beyond ten years. This is mainly because businesses and people in the region have little confidence that their governments will respect property rights over the long term. In the case of AT&T, we have had an ongoing problem with contractual obligations we have entered into with various government or private sector monopoly phone companies. In international telecommunications, calls traditionally have been delivered by international carriers, like AT&T, which must hand off telephone traffic to the monopoly carrier in the foreign country. The payments regime for these "hand-offs" is known as the accounting rates process. Historically, accounting rates have not reflected market rates, with monopoly foreign carriers reaping windfall profits. AT&T and other U.S. foreign carriers are in the process of renegotiating contracts with these foreign carriers to get these rates down, but many of these carriers use their monopoly position to violate their contract rights or discriminate against U.S. carriers in violation of prior agreements. We should include strong provisions for the respect for property rights and the adjudication of property rights disputes in any trade agreement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Another aspect of competition policy deals with the elimination of monopolies. In the case of accounting rates, monopoly carriers have the power to reduce the profitability of AT&T and other U.S. carriers, and thus the ability of our companies to create wealth and jobs here in America. Monopoly foreign telecommunications carriers also raise the prices for U.S. customers who end up subsidizing the programs of the foreign monopolies, such as lower domestic rates in the foreign country. The result is often poor quality and limited services for both U.S. and Latin American customers. U.S. carriers must pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually in settlement payments to these Latin American carriers, with few benefits flowing to the customer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As liberalization occurs in Latin America, competition policy will play an even larger role as the regulatory issues become more complicated and subtle. The telecommunications industry is a perfect example of this. As foreign governments allow competition in international long distance, the big issue now is how will the costs for interconnection into the local network be decided. In Mexico, we see this very process going on today. AT&T and the other international carriers are preparing to enter the Mexican long distance market. We are asking to interconnect with the local monopoly at what we believe is a cost-based rate. However, there is a great disparity between what the long distance carriers believe is a cost-based rate and the current position of the telephone monopoly. We obviously don't agree on what the rate should be at this time, but that is why competition policy becomes so important. As markets are liberalized, businesses become ever more susceptible to market pricing, and so our cost structure must realistically reflect what the market demands. AT&T CEO Bob Allen has taken some harsh criticism recently about his decision to lay off thousands of workers in what people are describing as heartless and unnecessary. But as economist and <I>Washington Post</I> writer James Glassman said recently, AT&T must change because it cannot survive with its old monopolistic structure -- it is no longer a monopoly. We fight for market share on a daily basis against companies like MCI and Sprint that continue to grow. As competition in telecommunications increased here in the U.S., it became imperative to operate the company on a cost-based structure. In fact, critics five years from now may well say the restructuring was not radical enough. Consequently, since most U.S. businesses work under these exacting conditions of the market, we must insist that equal competition exists in the countries with which we will be trading under an FTAA. So our trade negotiators must insist on including mechanisms in any future FTAA
 that will limit the discretion of governments to impose political criteria on what needs to be a cost-based, market-driven process. In this particular case, that would mean establishing a clear set of rules and standards for cost-based interconnection fees. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To show how active U.S. engagement can make a difference in this particular area, we can look to Mexico. Because of our close relationship with Mexico through NAFTA, Mexico has recently announced it will follow an FCC-styled bidding process for the allocation of PCS services throughout Mexico. This process establishes a clear set of rules and procedures for bidding, and requires an open process.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is one other area that tends to influence all commercial activities in Latin America, but does not clearly fit into any of the categories above. That is the issue of transparency. Until all government decisions are open to public scrutiny there will always be room for corruption and behind-the-scenes deals. This environment may help a select few businesses with the right connections, but it harms the economy overall and it is extremely inefficient because it injects uncertainty into the commercial transaction. This way of doing business has serious costs for U.S. businesses. The Department of Commerce recently concluded that since 1994 there have been over 100 instances of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth roughly $45 billion. Foreign firms that bribe win bids approximately 80 percent of the time. U.S. trade negotiators must establish clear and concise rules of commercial conduct when governments are involved, and we must insist on opening up the process to public scrutiny. 
<p>
<b>REVIVING THE TRADE AGENDA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So how do we bring about these very difficult changes in Latin America?  We do it through active and aggressive engagement. We do it by showing the American people why we need Hemispheric free trade to remain internationally competitive. We do it by showing how free trade can be a win/win for those who are not seeking special favors from governments. We don't do it by folding our hands and talking a good line about how everyone wins under free trade. We don't do it by failing to reward those countries, like Chile, that have done their utmost to open their markets. Chile is the crown jewel of Latin America. Many sectors of its economy are more open than ours. Its international telecommunications industry is so competitive, there have been times this year when it was cheaper to call from New York to Santiago, than from New York to Los Angeles. It has a strong democracy and a flourishing middle class. What kind of message do we send to the rest of Latin America when we fail to even engage Chile in negotiations? 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What happened in Cartagena was inevitable given the direction of our current trade policy. But that direction can be altered with sufficient political will. One thing is certain. Good intentions by the U.S. are not enough. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

I met with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in Nicaragua last week. I believe he is committed to free trade in the Americas, as is U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, but personal commitment is not enough. The forces against Hemispheric integration are simply too strong. And much more is at stake here than Hemispheric integration. U.S. global leadership rests on our ability to create a trading model at home, that we can then export to the rest of the world. Imagine how much more influence we would have with our Asian trading partners if we had just concluded a Hemisphere-wide, comprehensive, NAFTA-style FTAA?  The benefits would be enormous for U.S. businesses and the world economy as a whole.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But the reality today is that our trade agenda is still in a holding pattern. I sincerely hope we can remove the obstacles from the runway before we run out of gas.

<title>Eight Good Reasons to Continue MFN for China - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>EIGHT GOOD REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 449<br>
April 30, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent crisis in the Taiwan Strait has reignited the annual debate over whether to continue China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. As the debate heats up, Washington policymakers should consider carefully the reasons why continuing MFN for China serves U.S. interests. While granting MFN status does not solve all of America's problems with China, revoking it causes more problems than it solves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are eight prinipal reasons why Congress should approve an extension of MFN status for China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #1:</b> Revoking MFN will harm those America wants to help. Discontinuing MFN status for China would harm U.S. workers. The U.S. exported over $12 billion of goods and services to China in 1995, and American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #2:</b> Revoking MFN would threaten U.S. business and investment. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated that China will require nearly $750 billion in new investments to fund new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies should be getting the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment. The result will be American jobs lost to competitors overseas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #3:</b> Revoking MFN would jeopardize economic reform in China. The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of one quarter of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to encourage the further opening of China's economy and society. To be sure, MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but at least it keeps China open to influences and pressures from the outside world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #4:</b> Revoking MFN would harm the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong. The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong is heavily dependent on investment and export production in China. Abandoning MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. It also would harm Taiwan's economy. Billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by current tensions with China. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by countries the U.S. seeks to support -- Hong Kong and Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #5:</b> Revoking MFN will not improve human rights conditions in China. History shows that China is far more oppressive against its people when isolated from the outside world. This was clearly the case during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #6:</b> Revoking MFN will not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction. China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The MTCR monitors and controls missile components and capabilities, while the NPT is a framework for control and reduction of nuclear weapons. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan and criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to such unstable regimes as those in Pakistan and Iran. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. The U.S. must investigate the recent allegations of missile sales to Pakistan, and it has every right to ask China to explain itself. If such sales have taken place, American law dictates that technology and commercial sanctions be imposed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be specific and targeted on the responsible Chinese enterprise, to avoid jeopardizing unrelated U.S. activities in China, rather than targeted on all U.S.-financed projects in China, as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial transaction with China. In this area, MFN is simply the wrong tool.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #7:</b> MFN is not special treatment. MFN trade status is a fundamental principle on which the World Trade Organization operates. The WTO is the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. MFN is the normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries. In the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, it is the foundation of basic international commercial relations. Discontinuing MFN to China is tantamount to imposing trade sanctions on China. Such sanctions should be imposed only when a country poses a special threat to American security. As difficult as China now is, it does not present such a threat.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #8:</b> Revoking MFN would set the U.S. on the road to confrontation with China. Abandoning MFN for China would lead to Beijing's isolation, making it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States and its allies to deal effectively with nuclear weapons proliferation, unfair trade practices, and human rights violations, China must be engaged, not an enemy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even though the U.S. should continue MFN trade status for China, however, it should not ignore Beijing's recent bellicose actions against Taiwan. To demonstrate displeasure with Beijing's missile diplomacy against Taiwan, and to reward Taiwan once it meets economic criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization, the U.S. should expedite Taiwan's bid to join the WTO ahead of the PRC. In the past, China has insisted that the PRC should accede to the WTO ahead of, or at the same time as, Taiwan. The U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for Taiwan's entry into the WTO, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China, but it would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. Most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<title>What the New Farm Bill Will Mean to State Economies and Farmers - Heritage</title>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The agriculture legislation recently enacted by Congress and signed into law (P.L. 104-127) by President Clinton marks the most dramatic change in U.S. farm policy since the current command-and-control programs were created during the Depression. Today's system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new legislation was based on bills first debated last year by Congress: the<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2195:"> Freedom to Farm Act</a> (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), and proposals advanced by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) during the consideration of balanced budget legislation. These bills called for sweeping changes in American agriculture policy to create freer markets, reduce subsidies, and generally permit farmers to run their businesses to take advantage of market opportunities rather than comply with bureaucratic regulations. The bills also were in line with calls for fundamental reform voiced by many farmers and research organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation. In <I>Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, Heritage analysts proposed last year that Congress immediately end all supply control programs, phase out subsidies, and end other restrictions on farmers.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
P.L. 104-127, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996, eliminates federal government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction programs. Farm subsidies for these crops are to be replaced by steadily decreasing, but fixed, "market transition" payments. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the FAIR Act failed to reform the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Allegedly an environmental program, the CRP actually has functioned more as a supply control program, more often than not paying farmers to take potentially productive land out of use. The CRP at least should have been reformed to allow farmers to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. The FAIR Act also failed to reform the sugar and peanut programs, which continue the archaic policy of restrictive allotments and quotas that gouge American consumers; nor did it eliminate the milk market orders which force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these shortcomings, the new farm legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous new opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of this restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston, using an econometric model of the agriculture economy developed last year by Heritage, the new law will mean:
<p><ul><b>
<li>Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li>Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<P>
<li>Taken together, the agriculture community as a whole thus will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion of income. 
</ul></b> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This increase in agriculture activity will have a "multiplier" effect on other industries, leading to a total economic boost to the nation of $74.6 billion between 1996 and 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The states in which farmers will be at least $1 billion better off over the next seven years are:
<P><center>
<table border tr valign="top">

</table></center>
<p><center>
<h3>APPENDIX: <br>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</h3>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2002) under the Freedom to Farm Act, based on historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that, overall, about 95 percent of ARP and 50/92 land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each year through 2002 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2002 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in Freeing America's Farmers, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only 0.5 percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crops they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product would be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson point specifically to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that customers spend more when trade expands.<sup>2</sup>

Despite a flow of good economic news in recent months, many Americans are concerned about their economic security, stagnating family incomes, and less money in their paychecks after taxes. They have a sense the economy is performing below its full potential and do not accept President Clinton's claim that the economy is the "healthiest it has been in 30 years."<sup>1</sup> 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A comparison of the current economic expansion and the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months suggests that they are right. The economy is failing to perform as well as similar expansions, and over the past three years the job opportunities and real earnings of many Americans have declined.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the current recovery, for example:
<P><ul>
<li><b>The gross domestic product</b> has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.<sup>2</sup>  Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><b>Total employment</b> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li><b>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs</b> has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li><b>Real median family income</b> actually has declined 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average increase of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers</b> have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent during the November 1982 to July 1990 expansion.<sup>4</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, the economy is experiencing modest growth, but other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for many Americans in recent years. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Since September 1993, real average hourly earnings have stagnated and real average weekly earnings have declined 1.5 percent.</b><sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.</b><sup>6</sup> Over the same period, real hourly compensation (combined wages and benefits) has not increased significantly.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs</b> in the 12 months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<li><b>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet.</b> In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<li><b>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.</b><sup>10</sup>  The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.
<p>
<li><b>From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.</b><sup>11</sup> From March 1991 to March 1995, the first four years of the current expansion, manufacturing employment slowly increased (52,000 total new jobs). Over the past year, however, it declined by 1.8 percent.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. Graded on a curve, the economy gets a "D" for below-average performance when compared with other expansions. It is not quite failing, but it clearly is not performing up to its potential.

<h3>BILL CLINTON AND JAPAN: GETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT</h3>

April 11, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will visit Japan on April 16-18 to meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The major purpose of his trip will be to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance. Challenges now facing both the United States and Japan in Asia, from tensions on the Korean Peninsula to China's increasingly aggressive conduct toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, make a reaffirmation both timely and necessary. It is even more necessary because for the better part of the Administration's first two years, Bill Clinton's Japan policy has put this critical relationship at risk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration came into office committed to forging a new U.S.-Japan relationship. Its Japan policy, however, was based on a number of miscalculations. The first was that security issues could be de-emphasized in the U.S.-Japan relationship after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was the over-emphasis placed on reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Trade policy, originally viewed as but one part of an overall Japan strategy, quickly expanded in time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Administration's approach to Japan. In effect, Japan policy became an extension of the 1992 campaign theme, "Its the economy, Stupid."  Seeing Japan through a mid-1980s time warp as an immutable economic juggernaut, the Clinton team was committed to applying intense external pressure to get its way. The final miscalculation was that, in the post-Cold War world, this pressure could be applied with little collateral political damage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, the Administration was wrong across the board. Security in today's post-Soviet world remains important, as North Korea's quest for nuclear weaponry and China's aggressive behavior toward Taiwan have reminded Americans and Japanese alike. Moreover, Japan's economy was not immutable. By 1993, it was undergoing significant structural change, the result of a five-year recession brought on by the collapse of its wildly inflated late-1980s economy and a skyrocketing appreciation of its currency, the yen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While in Tokyo, President Clinton will try to take credit not only for improved U.S.-Japan economic relations -- in particular, the reduction of America's trade deficit with Japan -- but for the improving security relationship as well. This will be credit not deserved. After damaging U.S.-Japan relations with the threat of a trade war, the President saw his mistake and corrected course. Better late than never. But solving a problem which the President himself caused is hardly the best way to conduct foreign policy.
<p>
<b>ECONOMICS IN COMMAND</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration got off on the wrong foot early in dealing with the Japanese. Downplaying the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance, the Administration quickly placed economics and trade at the top of its agenda with Tokyo. The centerpiece of its strategy was its New Economic Framework, a combination of economic and trade policies hastily cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993. In effect, the New Economic Framework was an attempt to manage trade with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Through a series of negotiators the Clinton Administration attempted to pressure the Japanese government into accepting targets for American exports to Japan. The Framework negotiations essentially were geared to redeeming the President's promise to produce results in such politically sensitive sectors as computers, telecommunications, automobiles, and auto parts. Fearing that failure to meet such quotas would make Japan a target for trade sanctions, Tokyo refused to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

From the outset, the Framework talks were acrimonious, marked by a high degree of suspicion, mistrust, and unprecedented personal animosity. They did not improve with age. At the February 1994 summit between Bill Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese found that they could and did say "no" to the Administration's demands for managed trade. By the spring of 1995, the Administration was poised for a trade war with Japan, threatening a 100 percent tariff on the import of Japanese luxury automobiles unless Tokyo relented and signed up for managed trade.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In both countries, the media duly reported on and expanded on the tactics and personalities of the negotiators and their countries. In both countries, the media retreated to familiar stereotypes -- the untrustworthy, scheming Japanese versus the unreasonable, demanding Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the end, trade agreements were signed but none contained enforceable quotas. Typical was the conclusion of the auto parts negotiations. Two days after insisting that the government of Japan had to be part of an agreement to guarantee compliance of Japanese auto companies, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to back down. To underscore the extent of the Administration's retreat, the Japanese negotiator, Ryutaro Hashimoto, now Japan's Prime Minister, made clear at a joint press conference that Kantor was speaking solely for himself with regard to expectations for growth in American exports to Japan. The Japanese government, he emphasized, was not guaranteeing the deal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton set out to build a new U.S.-Japan relationship. But by placing economics at the center of his Japan policy, he short-changed the vital U.S.-Japan security relationship. And by resorting to threats of a trade war, the President caused a significant erosion in Japanese support for relations with the U.S. In short, his policies have been counterproductive for the strategic interests of the U.S.
<p>
<b>ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS AND JAPAN'S ECONOMIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration is claiming that its trade policies are responsible for the recent decline in Japan's trade surplus with the United States. This is political spin of the highest order and represents a striking example of the logical fallacy known as <I>post hoc ergo propter hoc</I> (literally, "after this, therefore because of this"). The root causes for this decline are to be found not in Washington, but in the impact of global economic forces operating on Japan. In reality, a substantial appreciation of the yen and high Japanese production costs are the main causes of America's declining trade deficit with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The major factor driving down Japan's trade surplus is the soaring value of the yen. In Japan, this is known as <I>endaka</I>, which means an increase in the value of the yen against other currencies. From 158 yen = $1 in April 1990, the yen appreciated to a high of 79 yen = $1 in April 1995. Today, it stands at approximately 108 yen = $1, still substantially higher than it was in 1990. The appreciation of the yen has had a double effect: While making Japanese exports more expensive, it also has made imports cheaper. And Japanese consumers have responded to market signals by buying more imports, including those from the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Imports began to surge in April 1993. Japan's imports climbed by 22.3 percent in 1995. Semiconductors and electronic devices went up 66.6 percent, while automobile imports grew by 40.6 percent. Meanwhile, internationally, Japan's now higher-priced exports grew more slowly, by 12.0 percent, while exports of American-bound automobiles actually fell by 13.9 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <I>endaka</I> also is causing Japanese manufacturers to restructure fundamentally the way they do business. Under unrelenting pressure to cut costs, Japanese firms are beginning to open their traditional clubby business networks, known as <I>keiretsu</I>, to foreign suppliers. American and other foreign venders are now aggressively marketing their components to Japanese firms.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, Delphi, a General Motors parts subsidiary, hired Nissan and Toyota executives who then persuaded their former employers to designate Delco batteries as "authorized" parts for automobiles made by these Japanese companies. Consequently, Nissan and Toyota dealers now stock Delco batteries. In another instance, Tenneco, a <I>Fortune</i> 500 corporation with interests in automotive parts, energy, packaging, and shipbuilding, recently reached agreements with Toyota and Japan Energy to carry U.S.-made Monroe and Rancho shock absorbers at Toyota's 5,000 affiliated garages and at Japan Energy's 6,000 gas stations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To stay competitive, Japanese manufacturing firms are closing plants in Japan and moving to lower-cost production sites in the United States, Britain, and Southeast Asia. For example, Toyota is now investing billions in new plants, not in Japan, but in the U.S., Britain, and Thailand. While shedding jobs in Japan, Fujitsu, a leading Japanese electronics manufacturer, is building semiconductor plants in Oregon and Britain. Increasingly, Japanese firms are supplying overseas markets through local production rather than exports. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) estimates that in 1995 the value of goods produced by Japanese companies overseas exceeded the value of their exports for the first time in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, "reverse imports" -- products made abroad by Japanese firms and then exported for sale to Japan -- are becoming common in America. For example, Honda is now a net exporter of motor vehicles to Japan. In 1995, Honda exported some 45,000 Accord coupe, Accord wagon, and Civic models from North America to Japan. In sum, cost-conscious Japanese corporate decisions, not U.S. government policy, are driving down Japan's trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By attempting to manage trade through quotas or targets, the Administration's trade policy was playing directly against economic forces that are working to transform, open, and deregulate Japan's economy. Trade quotas, both to expand imports and to restrain exports, empower the Japanese bureaucracy to decide which firms must buy more of a targeted import and which firms must be prevented from making profitable sales overseas. Such an expansion of governmental control would reregulate rather than deregulate Japan's economy.
<p>
<b>POLITICAL COSTS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's trade war with Japan from 1993-1994 took a political toll on the U.S.-Japan relationship. According to polls conducted by the United States Information Agency in June 1995, during the auto and auto parts negotiations, 39 percent of Japanese respondents saw trade conflicts as eroding the alliance, while 30 percent saw the alliance as strong. By contrast, in May 1992, 43 percent saw the alliance as strong despite trade frictions. In the same June 1995 poll, 51 percent considered relations as "poor" and only 41 percent viewed them as "good."  In January 1996, 48 percent thought the relationship in "poor" shape.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Certainly, progress needs to made in opening and deregulating Japan's market. But, as the above polls make clear, the Administration's approach of using external pressure to force internal economic change in Japan has been counterproductive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Against this background, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen last September triggered the most serious crisis in the U.S.-Japan security relationship in decades. Calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Okinawa dominated Japan's political public debate in October. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 With the Okinawa crisis still smoldering, the President did not help matters when he canceled his November state visit to Japan to deal with the budget battle in Washington. Shortly before that decision, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, warned that cancellation would be a "body blow" to the alliance. In Tokyo, Japanese government officials noted that the cancellation was met with a dangerous indifference by the Japanese media and public, reflecting exasperation in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Shortly thereafter, the President in similar circumstances found time to visit Ireland and Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin. The Japanese media and political elite were quick to contrast the President's political priorities.
<p>
<b>ENDURING STRATEGIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the end of the Cold War, the alliance with Japan remains critical to American national interests. Today, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is the centerpiece of Asia's security system and the foundation of its economic dynamism and prosperity. This is of direct and immediate consequence to the security and economic well-being of all Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As John Dori of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center has pointed out, U.S. exports to Asia in 1994 grew at a rate of 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion, the steepest increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the region purchased over $45 billion more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 million more than Europe as a whole. And exports to Asia mean jobs for Americans. In 1994 more than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to exports to Asia, with 428,000 jobs being created in 1994 alone.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The United States also has enduring strategic interests in Asia. For over a century, the U.S. has worked to prevent a single power from dominating the region. Today, America's alliance with Japan enhances its ability to keep Asia open to U.S. influence. Forward-deployed U.S. forces in Japan have helped to deter aggression against allies and friends in the region. Recognizing the importance of this U.S. presence to Japan's security, the government of Japan contributes close to $5 billion annually in support for U.S. forces stationed in that country. Japan's effort in this regard represents the most generous host nation support of any of America's allies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The strategic importance of the U.S. force presence in Japan was recently demonstrated. In mid-March, President Clinton ordered the deployment of the USS <I>Independence</I>, home-ported in Yokosuka, Japan, to waters near Taiwan at the time of the Republic of China's presidential elections. This strategic importance has also been evidenced by America's continuing ability to deter a possibly nuclear-armed North Korea from attacking South Korea, a U.S. ally, and reunifying the Korean Peninsula on communist terms. And a strong U.S.-Japan alliance will enhance America's ability to deal with China as it emerges as a great power in the first quarter of the next century.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton's Japan policy has ill served the relationship once defined by Ambassador Mike Mansfield as the United States' most important "bar none."  Were it not for the dedicated work of officials in the Pentagon, most notably Joseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, there is no telling how far the free-fall in the relationship would have taken the alliance. Fortunately, these officials recognized the damage being done by the Administration's trade tactics, and in 1994 began the long, arduous task of returning the Administration's focus to the strategic centrality of the alliance. This is what has brought Bill Clinton to Tokyo. Better late than never.

America's students still are not performing at a satisfactory level, and Americans are not getting a solid return on the investment of their tax dollars in the nation's schools, according to the latest assessment of achievement. After 15 years and $328 billion in federal spending, the U.S. <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> is contributing little, if anything at all, to student success in reading.<sup>1</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The recently released findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) final 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States show most of America's students are not meeting a proficient achievement level in reading.<sup>2</sup>  The 1994 NAEP reading examination is the nation's report card in reading. The 1994 test was administered to nearly 140,000 students in public and private schools nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NAEP report reveals student reading and comprehension achievement levels in grades 4, 8, and 12 between 1992 and 1994, as well as achievement levels within various subgroups of the student population. The report uses three achievement levels to rank the results: basic, proficient, and advanced.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While 4th and 8th grade students showed slight declines in performance, there was a significant decline in the reading performance of students in grade 12 (see <a href="fyi94c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Between 1992 and 1994, notes the report:
<p><ul>
<li> There was a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the proficient level;<p>
<li> There was also a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the basic level; and<p>
<li> There was a significant increase in the percentage of twelfth graders performing <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regionally, the results were equally discouraging. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Every region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) had significant declines in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>at or above</I> the proficient level; and<p>
<li> Every region had an increase in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 NAEP final report also accounted for the reading performance of six population subgroups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian.<sup>4</sup>  Consistent with previous NAEP reports, there were large differences in performance by race and ethnic subgroups (see <a href="fyi94c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). In nearly every ethnic and racial subgroup there were significant declines in reading performance. While there were significant decreases in the reading performance levels for white, black and Hispanic twelfth grade students, white students had the largest decreases. Fewer white twelfth graders in 1994 achieved at least <I>the basic level of reading performance</I> than achieved that level in 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Breaking down student performance by gender, the 1994 NAEP results show that female students generally outperformed male students in all three grade levels (see <a href="fyi94c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). According to the report: 
<p><ul>
<li> Between 1992 and 1994, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade males <I>at or above</I> both the proficient and basic levels. There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade females <I>at or above</I> the basic level. There was also a significant increase in the number of male and female twelfth graders who performed at or below the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the most discouraging results are the differences in the performance levels between poor students participating in the Title I program, the Federal Education for the Disadvantaged program "(formerly called Chapter One)," and non-Title I participating students (see <a href="fyi94c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Although there were no corresponding data on Title I participation for 1992, the 1994 results show that the low-income students enrolled in the Title I program are being left behind the rest of America's students. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Across all three grade levels, of those students participating in the Title I program, there were significantly fewer students performing <I>at or above each of the reading achievement levels.</I> 
<p>
<li> Of all students performing <I>at the below basic level</I>, Title I students are performing below the basic level at a larger proportion than non-Title I students. The percentages of Title I students who performed <I>below basic</I> ranged from 59 percent at twelfth grade to 80 percent at fourth grade.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Clinton's Secretary of Education, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/04-1995/naepwrd.html">Richard W. Riley</a>, argues that congressional efforts to dismantle the existing federal bureaucracy and channel funds back to the states, localities, teachers and parents would set back efforts to improve education.<sup>6</sup>  The results of the 1994 NAEP reading examination are yet another indicator that the current approach to education is not working. More money, more bureaucracy, more regulation, and more federal intrusion clearly are not improving America's academic performance.

<h3>NATO EXPANSION: MYTHS AND REALITIES</h3>

By  W. Bruce Weinrod<sup>1</sup>
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Committee Brief No. 23
<br>
March 1, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Momentum for the admission of new members into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is increasing. NATO may well invite
new members to join the alliance before the turn of the century.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The case for admitting new members to NATO is persuasive. An expanded
NATO will reinforce peace and freedom In Europe and thus will
support important U.S. interests and objectives. However, crucial
decisions related to NATO expansion have yet to be made. Little
information is available about the specifics of NATO expansion,
and U.S. public and congressional debate on whether NATO should
expand has just begun. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Examining the details of the NATO expansion process and its implications
for U.S. interests is both inevitable and necessary. Some critics
of NATO expansion have raised objections which are spurious, misleading,
or inaccurate; others have raised legitimate concerns which deserve
consideration. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the process of NATO expansion to be successful, the American
public and Congress will have to sort through the myths and realities
of the issue. NATO enlargement raises two broad and interrelated
sets of issues: whether NATO expansion as such is a good idea
and (assuming NATO expansion occurs) how the expansion process
can best proceed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>SHOULD NATO EXPAND?</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics suggest that there exist no real security threats justifying
an increased NATO membership. Therefore, the argument goes, there
is no reason to expand. But NATO expansion is important, not primarily
to defend against an imminent attack, but rather as a deterrent
against potential future security threats and an insurance policy
against uncertainties.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bringing in new members would send a signal to any potential aggressor
that it would pay a substantial price for any expansionist ambitions
against nations which have become a part of the larger Western
community of nations. An expanded NATO also would reinforce the
post-World War II effort to envelop Germany in a broader European
framework and would make it highly unlikely that the region to
NATO's immediate east would emerge as an unstable geopolitical
vacuum between Germany and Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As it did for many Western European nations in the early post-World
War II years, NATO can reinforce the consolidation of free political
and economic institutions in the emerging but fragile democracies
of Central Europe. The alliance can do this by providing an overarching
security umbrella and a clear symbol that such nations are being
welcomed as part of the West.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In any event, while Western Europe is indeed safer and more secure
after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the rest of Europe contains
instabilities of concern. Most important, if a resurgent extreme
nationalist leadership in Russia were to appear, it would be easier
to deter if NATO already had formalized membership for nations
between Russia and Western Europe.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>&quot;New Lines&quot; and European Stability</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A major contention of critics of NATO expansion is that adding
members to NATO inevitably will create &quot;new lines&quot; of
instability in Europe between members and non-members. The argument
is that nations not invited to join NATO (it is generally assumed
that nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would
be admitted first) would be discouraged and alienated from NATO
and the West. As a result, these uninvited nations might join
rival alliances or take other actions which would increase geopolitical
instability.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This will not necessarily happen. But in any event, the most important
new lines in Europe already have been created as a result of the
dissolution of the Soviet empire. Adding new members to NATO would
only reflect the new geopolitical realities demonstrated in the
preferences of many nations to NATO's east for close political,
economic, cultural, and security ties to the West<sup>3</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate NATO objective should be the ending of lines and
the extension of the free society throughout Europe. However,
from a Western security perspective, if dividing lines are to
exist in the near term, it is preferable that these lines be as
far to the east as practicable. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concern has been expressed that admitting new members into NATO
will have a negative impact on Russia and its relationship to
the West. These critics note comments such as President Boris
Yeltsin's September 6, 1995, statement that NATO expansion &quot;would
plunge Europe into the flames of war&quot; and a remark by General
Alexander Lebed (a potential 1996 candidate for Russian President)
that it &quot;would mark the beginning of World War III.&quot;<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Overheated Russian rhetoric, however, should be kept in perspective.
Moscow has changed its position on important NATO-related issues:
After initial opposition, Russia acquiesced in NATO bombing in
Bosnia; and Russia joined the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP)
after a lengthy period of hesitation. Further, there are forces
in Russia which view NATO expansion as a positive development
for Russia itself; and even among those opposed to NATO expansion,
there are many realists who understand, as the influential Council
for Foreign and Defense Policy puts it, that &quot;even in the
case of enlargement, the military threat is not likely to increase.&quot;<sup>5</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another argument is that NATO enlargement would undercut reform
forces in Russia and provide a catalyst for the advancement of
extreme authoritarian nationalist factions and their anti-Western
agenda. However, if authoritarian nationalists come to power again
in Russia, it will be due not to increased NATO membership, but
to more fundamental systemic factors inside Russia. For example,
the issue of NATO expansion was not even a marginal reason for
the strong showing of Communist and other anti-Western factions
in the December 1995 Russian Parliamentary elections. The reality
is that the issue of NATO expansion can have only a marginal effect
on whether democracy prevails in post-Communist Russia and on
Moscow's international role.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If authoritarian nationalists take power, their attitude towards
the West will not be shaped primarily by whether NATO expands.
For such ideologues, the West is the adversary not because of
what it does, but because of what it is and what it stands for.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics oppose NATO's enlargement now but suggest that expansion
could be appropriate if and when Russia posed a renewed threat
to the West. However, expanding NATO when no threat exists would
be a much smoother and more positive action because enlargement
in the context of a reassertive Russia inevitably would be criticized
as &quot;destabilizing&quot; or &quot;provocative.&quot;  Further,
it would prove more difficult for NATO members to agree on enlargement
should Russia be seen as a renewed threat.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A democratic Russia should accept NATO enlargement for two principal
reasons: first, it will encourage the consolidation of democracy
in neighboring nations, which in turn will reinforce democracy
in Russia; and second, it will make unlikely the kind of regional
instability to Russia's west which would divert attention away
from domestic reform.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The West, sensibly, is treating Russia constructively as it did
Germany after World War II, rather than vindictively as it did
after World War I. It is up to Russia to respond positively to
that wise policy. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Security Obligations and Cohesiveness</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of NATO expansion suggest that by taking on new security
commitments, NATO may be drawn into numerous ethnic or other sub-regional
disputes. NATO need not make this a primary mission. NATO can
avoid such an outcome by constraining the ability of newly admitted
members to draw NATO into localized disputes, and by developing
clear criteria for the use of military force.<sup>6</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has been argued that should NATO grow, its cohesion and sense
of common purpose inevitably will dissipate; that a larger NATO,
exacerbated by significant cultural and geopolitical differences,
will become unmanageable; and that reaching agreement between
new and old members on important issues will prove difficult<sup>7</sup>.
 But while increasing an organization's size may present challenges
to cohesiveness, NATO's experience with past enlargement is instructive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, when NATO's membership was being decided in the late
1940s, the original European members initially rebuffed U.S. efforts
to include Norway, Iceland, and Portugal out of concern that these
nations were geographically too distant, and that Iceland and
Portugal's &quot;Europeanness&quot; was questionable. Later, some
European NATO members initially opposed admitting Greece and Turkey
because they were &quot;distant geographically and culturally
from the West.&quot;<sup>8</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These and similar concerns have proved groundless. Despite sharp
policy differences which have arisen occasionally over the years,
NATO in fact developed a real sense of cohesiveness which has
enabled it to develop a consensus on actions ranging from the
deployment of nuclear-armed missiles in Europe during the 1980s
to active cooperation with the international response to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait to the deployment of a multinational force
in the former Yugoslavia. This cohesiveness reflects the emergence
of a common democratic security culture among NATO nations which
has enabled even traditional rivals Turkey and Greece to work
together, albeit uncomfortably at times, for common NATO objectives.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's new structure allows for some difference of perspective
among members, since the alliance already is developing mechanisms
which would allow a sub-group of NATO members to take military
action. Nonetheless, NATO may need to consider procedural mechanisms,
at least for a transitional period, to provide assurance that
new members cannot block important NATO decisions<sup>9</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Enlargement inevitably will bring new perspectives into NATO.
But the significant benefits of expansion, including the expansion
of the common democratic security culture eastward, easily can
outweigh the inevitable disagreements which will occur.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Implications for Military Effectiveness</b> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It also has been suggested that adding members could dilute NATO's
military effectiveness. Enlarging NATO obviously would raise challenges
for NATO's military structure and capabilities. Even at NATO's
current size, assuring effective military coordination among different
military forces requires considerable effort. Issues which the
alliance will need to address include coordination of multinational
force formations, interoperability of military equipment, maintenance
of effective communications among different military forces, and
overall quality of military forces.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These challenges cannot be resolved fully in the very short term,
and there will not always be smooth interaction between current
NATO forces and those of newer members whose quality varies greatly
at this point. After all, NATO's Cold War defense structure was
developed over many years. However, such concerns can be assuaged
if NATO works with potential new members to address military requirements,
although no nation should be admitted until it satisfies specified
NATO military standards<sup>10</sup>.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A separate but related concern is that in taking on new commitments,
NATO will be overextended militarily. Again, a review of NATO's
past is helpful. For example, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were
uncomfortable with bringing Italy into NATO because it might overextend
NATO's abilities in the Mediterranean region<sup>11</sup>.  In fact, Italy's
membership has proved to be a significant military plus for NATO.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another concern is that the presence of former or current Communists
in senior government positions in new member nations could serve
as a Trojan Horse and present security problems for NATO and its
members. Security leaks to Moscow are of particular concern. 
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Former Communists indeed are making a comeback throughout the
former Warsaw Pact nations. This is legitimate cause for worry,
although this trend may reverse itself over time. The solution
is simple: NATO should monitor this matter very carefully, and
refuse to admit a new member if there is a genuine security problem.
Of course, it also should take appropriate measures to ensure
the security of vital military information and intelligence.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Political Institutions and Practices</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some have suggested that former Warsaw Pact nations should not
be admitted to NATO because their domestic institutions are still
not fully democratic. However, in the past, NATO has not made
democracy an absolute criterion for membership. Rather, it balanced
strategic necessity with political concerns. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Portugal, Turkey, and Greece, for example, were admitted to NATO
at a time when they were not democracies. They were admitted because
of their perceived military benefit against a clear Soviet threat.
Spain, on the other hand, was not admitted for many years because
perceived military advantages were considered not sufficient to
override its non-democratic political system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are hopeful signs of political progress in many former Communist
nations, and a return of pre-1989 communism among potential Central
European applicants for NATO membership is most unlikely. Nonetheless,
the possibility of reversion to authoritarian rule cannot be ruled
out, and it is not fully clear at what point some of the nations
interested in being considered for NATO membership will consolidate
their democratic political experiments. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Further, with no immediate direct security threat to NATO, political
standards can be made a higher priority. Indeed, as a practical
matter, it would likely prove difficult to obtain endorsement
of NATO member legislatures for new members whose governments
are not clearly democratic.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, NATO will need to balance the geopolitical benefits of expansion
with respect to a specific country against any domestic political
flaws. For example, Slovakia's location separating Poland and
Hungary argues for its admission to NATO on practical military
grounds along with those other two nations. However, its domestic
practices at present clearly do not meet democratic standards.<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alliance should apply political criteria with some flexibility.
This is because the prospect of NATO membership, as well as the
fact of membership, may well have a positive impact on the domestic
politics of potential new entrants. NATO membership played a positive
role in stabilizing fragile European democracies after World War
II, and also helped Spain through a shaky transition period to
democracy. Admission of emerging democracies such as Poland and
Hungary could well have a similar impact.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, while NATO need not and should not admit new nations solely
in order to reinforce democracy, admission to the alliance nonetheless
has the potential to produce this important side benefit. <BR>
<BR>

<b>
<P>
Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's growth would likely have significant financial costs not
only for NATO itself, but also for member nations and any new
admittees. Most of these costs would be associated with enhancing
military capabilities.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At this early point, calculations of financial costs must be provisional
and depend greatly upon assumptions about such matters as the
threat perceptions, military strategy, and force structure of
potential new members and NATO itself. Nevertheless, approximate
costs, assuming differing levels of military forces, have been
estimated.<sup>13</sup>  These totals assume an implementation period of 10
to 15 years, although there will be continuing costs after this
period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A least expensive option of around $20 billion would focus on
enhancing self-defense for new members by upgrading relevant military
capabilities, combined with NATO logistics and communications
support. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second approach costing around $20 billion to $30 billion would
include a buildup by new members combined with giving NATO a meaningful
capability to project air power. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even more capable option costing around $50 billion would include
the same new member buildup, combined with in-region infrastructure
and a NATO air and ground force designed for power projection
into the region (to include a 10-ground-division, 10-air-wing
NATO regional capability); for around $35 billion, a more modest
version of this option with a less ambitious version of this military
package could be assembled.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Establishing a classic conventional military capability with NATO
air and ground forces actually deployed in the new members' region
could cost considerably more than $50 billion.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs are significant. Current NATO members, including the
U.S., would have to contribute equitable financial shares. But
the new members themselves would have to balance requirements
for economic development with the need for military-related expenditures,
and thus make real sacrifices during a difficult period of economic
development.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, financial requirements should be viewed in context.

Over a multi-year period, and broken into shares from NATO nations
and new members, the costs to all parties should be manageable.
A plausible estimate for a U.S. contribution would be an expenditure
of around $1 billion to $2 billion per year for 10 to 15 years.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If expansion is in America's and the West's interests, the costs
should be manageable and acceptable as a modest supplement to
what the U.S. already spends for its own security and that of
its allies.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and U.S. Interests</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A secure, stable Europe whose nation-states have free political
and economic systems is very much in America's national interest;
and bringing qualified and appropriate new members into NATO makes
this more likely.<sup>16</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. influence and leadership in Europe also can advance American
interests. Indeed, it is likely that admission of new members
would enhance U.S. influence in NATO. This is because the views
of those nations most likely to be offered membership parallel
those of the U.S. on most important security issues.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE PROCESS OF NATO EXPANSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if NATO expansion is a good idea in principle, there are
a number of important practical issues which will have to be addressed
and resolved for the process of expansion to succeed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Initial Invitation List</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A number of nations have indicated an interest in joining NATO.
In the short term at least, only a few will be considered seriously
for membership. These nations include the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland. Slovakia is also mentioned (these four nations together
are referred to at times as the &quot;Visegrad Group&quot;). If
Austria, Sweden or Finland &#173;&#173; all new members of the
European Union (EU) &#173;&#173; were to seek membership, they
would likely go to the top of the list.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the moment, the Czech Republic is closest to meeting likely
NATO standards for membership, while Poland and Hungary are making
progress. Slovakia is less likely to be invited at first because
of questionable domestic political practices. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Any other admissions to membership probably would be some years
away. Plausible future candidates might include Slovenia, Bulgaria,
and Romania. Baltic nations may meet eligibility criteria as well,
but concern about Russian reaction could inhibit NATO's approach.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Pace of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some who accept the principle of NATO enlargement nonetheless
would prefer a very slow pace. One rationale is that expansion
might have a negative impact on Russian policy and give anti-Western
candidates in the June 1996 Russian presidential elections a campaign
issue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, it makes no sense for Russia to be a determining factor
in the timing of NATO enlargement. Under such logic, expansion
could be delayed indefinitely because for the foreseeable future,
the possibility of a negative Russian reaction will always exist.
Indeed, it seems more likely that the longer the enlargement process
is dragged out, the more potential there is for problems with
Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. leadership is important in catalyzing NATO enlargement, and
the pace of expansion should not be constrained artificially.
In addition, NATO itself can expedite the process by, for example,
appointing an Assistant Secretary General to deal with expansion-related
issues, as well as with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council
(NACC) and Partnership for Peace (PFP).<sup>17</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Criteria for Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that, either implicitly or explicitly, NATO will
apply political and economic membership standards. Plausible domestic
political requirements for prospective members include democratic
institutions and practices; a market economy; the rule of law
along with institutional and legal protection for minority rights;
and civilian democratic control of the military, intelligence
agencies, police, and internal security forces. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legitimate concern exists that NATO might lose its leverage for
domestic reform once a nation is admitted to membership. Thus,
pressure for continued reform must be maintained after the admission
of new members. Indeed, entry into NATO (along with pressure from
the European Union) can be a positive force for political change.
Spain's admission to NATO in 1982 very likely helped reinforce
and consolidate its nascent democratic institutions; and NATO
membership undoubtedly was a factor in the consolidation of democracy
in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO in any event has the option of developing procedures for
the suspension or even expulsion of a member whose domestic or
international policies fall fundamentally short of NATO expectations.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>International Aspects of Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can ask new members to meet certain foreign policy standards.
For example, new members could be required to renounce all territorial
claims on other nations. NATO could also insist that new invitees
(for example, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) implement
trans-regional cooperative endeavors, such as common security
planning at a sub-regional level.<sup>18</sup>  For its own part, NATO could
formalize its already implicit policy of not becoming involved
militarily in a dispute among NATO member nations. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO also might require agreement from new members to submit any
disputes with other NATO nations to international arbitration,
and new entrants could be asked to shape their militaries for
defensive missions only.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO certainly should expect commitments from prospective members
to assist anti-terrorism efforts, to participate in countering
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their delivery
systems, and to prohibit the export of arms or militarily applicable
technology to rogue nations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Military Criteria for New Members</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should expect that new members will contribute to its overall
military capabilities and, conversely, will not undermine its
military effectiveness. How each new member should comply with
these standards remains to be decided. NATO could require, for
example, that new members agree to join its integrated military
structure (this is important because this structure fosters smoother
and more efficient military operations). New members also could
be required to strengthen very quickly &#173;&#173; in line with
NATO standards &#173;&#173; the military capabilities of selected
military units, and to work for operational military compatibility
with NATO forces over the longer term.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New members could be required to make their territory and military
facilities available for NATO use, and otherwise support NATO
military requirements, without any unilateral constraints on NATO
activities. Moreover, new members could be required to keep their
military forces and planning open to view by NATO allies, and
to assure the protection of intelligence information.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The structure of the military forces of new members will be a
crucial factor in determining the effectiveness and costs of military
cooperation between new members and NATO. Also important will
be the need to determine exactly how NATO's forces would be structured
and deployed in peacetime, as well as at a time of crisis or conflict,
to fulfill NATO security commitments to new members.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Military force structure options for new members range from Swiss-type
civilian-based forces to a large standing army. Possibilities
must be weighed in the context of such factors as perceived national
interests and potential military threats, the relationship of
national armed forces to NATO's military structure, costs, and
other factors. It also would be advantageous for NATO if new members'
forces can contribute in a militarily significant way to any future
Persian Gulf-type conflicts.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At a minimum, force structure decisions by prospective members
should be taken within the context of maximizing regional (Central
or Eastern European) military cooperation and strengths, and also
within the context of extensive consultations with NATO. For example,
shared arms production and military purchases and assistance should
be pursued in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of military
capabilities and achieve military economies of scale. Defense
cooperation and co-production arrangements (arrangements by two
or more nations to join in researching, developing, or producing
a technology, system, or weapon), either among prospective new
members themselves or with other NATO members (including the U.S.),
can reinforce this approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, the military forces of likely new members will not
come close to meeting NATO's standards and requirements for many
years. Since full operational integration will not be feasible,
a realistic shorter-term objective would be to assure that the
troops of the old and new members work together as smoothly as
possible. Ways in which this might be accomplished include developing
an integrated air defense network, conducting NATO military exercises
on new members' territory, prepositioning military supplies; and
deploying aircraft to bases on new members' territory at regular
intervals (called &quot;dual basing&quot;).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, NATO's own evolving strategies and military
capabilities need to undergo further changes in order to accommodate
a larger NATO. These changes include: <BR>

<P><ul>
<li>Continuing revisions in NATO's forces and command structures and
planning processes, both to streamline NATO's military structure
and to establish command units specifically responsible for the
territory of new members; <BR>

<P>
<li>Adapting NATO's forces so that sub-groups of NATO nations, such
as the Western European Union (WEU) or ad hoc coalitions, can
utilize NATO's military resources when appropriate;<sup>19</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li>Further developing multinational formations (military units composed
of personnel from more than one nation), which will be even more
challenging when new members are involved; <BR>

<P>
<li>Reviewing the role of nuclear deterrence in post-Cold War Europe,
a continuing requirement even with NATO's current membership,
because nuclear strategy inevitably will be affected by the addition
of new members; and<BR>

<P>
<li>Assessing and implementing air and theater missile defenses which
take new members into account.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>

<P>
<b>Reassuring Uninvited Nations</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion may cause at least some short-term sense of exclusion
or resentment among those not invited in the first round of admissions.
The reaction of uninvited nations could range from bruised feelings
to an interest in making alternative security arrangements, and
momentum for internal reform in such nations could be slowed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should seek to defuse such possibilities. For example, it
can make clear that expansion is a process and that NATO remains
open to new members even after the first new admissions. The alliance
also should increase the involvement of such nations in enhanced
Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council political
programs and meetings while encouraging their interaction with
other European organizations, such as the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU),
as well as bilateral programs.<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can point out that the PFP framework already provides a <I>de
facto</I> equivalent of NATO's Article Four security relationship
to PFP participants. While Article Five addresses the defense
of members' territory against armed attack, Article Four calls
for consultations against more general security threats against
a member.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the alliance can also reinforce efforts to link relevant
NATO members more closely with nations that are not invited to
join initially. For example, Scandinavian members can work more
closely with Baltic nations, and southern region members can develop
closer links with Balkan and Mediterranean countries. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Sequence of Admission</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sequencing of new admissions could have an impact on the reactions
of those nations not invited to join. NATO will still have to
decide, for example, how eligible nations should be admitted &#173;&#173;
whether individually or in groups &#173;&#173; and in what order.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inviting nations in groups rather than individually could avoid
the tensions caused by admitting some nations before others which
also are eligible. At the same time, some suggest it would be
best not to invite all eligible members at the same time in order
to establish that admitting new members is a process rather than
a one-time event.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is too early in the expansion process to suggest which approach
is most appropriate. All that can be said at this time is that
if NATO chooses not to invite all eligible nations together, it
will need to explain clearly its rationale for implementing the
first wave of admissions in phases. NATO also needs to provide
a realistic assessment to those nations whose prospects for entry
are minimal or nil.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and Non-NATO Institutions</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The growth of NATO will occur within a context of multiple European
institutions. Most important is the Western European Union, which
is linked to the European Union. All WEU members also participate
in NATO, while the EU has several members who are not NATO members.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The WEU has defense obligations to its members and is considering
admitting new members. Further, the WEU might assume defense obligations
for all EU members. If the WEU admits new members before NATO
does, or if it assumes an obligation to defend all EU members,
then current WEU (and NATO) members will be taking on new defense
obligations to nations which are not NATO members. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has important implications for NATO. WEU nations could become
embroiled in a conflict in order to defend a non-NATO member of
the WEU &#173;&#173; Austria, Sweden, and Finland recently have
been admitted, and other nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic,
and Hungary have applied for membership &#173;&#173; or a non-NATO
member of the EU. These WEU nations, if counterattacked, might
then seek to invoke NATO commitments for their own defense. This
would mean, in particular, that the U.S. could be called upon
to help defend NATO members in a conflict originally involving
an attack on a non-NATO WEU member even though NATO had no obligation
to defend the WEU or EU nations which were attacked. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid such situations, NATO would have to coordinate
its expansion process with that of the WEU and the EU. Ideally,
nations should become members of both groups at around the same
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion should proceed on its own merits and terms. However,
as part of the enlargement process, NATO should hold out to Moscow
the possibility of a positive or even formal relationship if Russia
pursues responsible policies. For example, the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council, whose members include all NATO nations and
all former Warsaw Pact nations and ex-Soviet republics, could
be given an enhanced role and responsibility for considering European
political and security issues (including Russian involvement in
neighboring nations) and developing responses to security problems.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the short term, NATO should pursue a dual approach. Russian
participation in the PFP should be developed through such means
as security consultations and humanitarian relief training exercises
in order to demonstrate the positive aspects of a new relationship
with the West. At the same time, NATO should advise Moscow that
any renewed expansionism will end such activities and result in
contingency planning against such a Russian approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO remains, as always, a defensive and transparent alliance.
Any reasonable Russian concerns can be addressed; and a NATO-Russia
relationship can be institutionalized, up to and including a NATO-Russia
agreement defining the terms of the relationship, if Moscow accepts
the reality that NATO can expand. Of course, should Russia come
under the control of extreme nationalist and expansionist forces,
NATO will need to adopt appropriate measures in response.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Ukraine and NATO Enlargement</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ukraine is an especially important part of the European geopolitical
equation. Without control of Ukraine, it would be much more difficult
for an expansionist Russia to threaten the West directly. Although
independent, Kiev still remains sensitive to Russian concerns
and thus far has been ambivalent about NATO membership.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A fundamental Western objective should be to assure that Ukraine
is not reincorporated into a revived Russian empire. NATO, as
well as NATO nations acting bilaterally, will need to make Ukraine
a top priority for economic assistance, strengthened political
relationships, and security assistance. All this should be implemented
with a sensitivity to the challenges posed by Ukraine's balancing
act between the West and Moscow. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Financial Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most costs incurred by NATO expansion will be to meet military
requirements. Current NATO members will have to contribute to
the costs of expansion, with the U.S. providing a reasonable financial
share. In addition, there should be significant economic assistance
from the European Union for economic development so that new members
can allocate sufficient resources to improving military capabilities.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, new members will have to demonstrate a significant
financial commitment, which will be a challenge in view of their
still early stages of economic development. Creative arrangements,
including loans, grants, and even barter arrangements, need to
be explored. NATO nations also should consider the sale or lease
of excess military items to new members.<sup>21</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, NATO funding for common infrastructure facilities,
such as military bases and storage facilities, can be allocated
to new members. Costs for military items may be lowered by developing
co-production arrangements and taking advantage of economies of
scale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The American debate over NATO enlargement, in a fundamental sense,
will be over the proper U.S. international role in the post-Cold
War world and the continuing relevance of NATO to U.S. interests.
If America wishes to protect its security interests beyond the
Western Hemisphere and help shape the international environment,
and if it is to continue as an international leader, NATO enlargement
will further those objectives. The enlargement of NATO also will
advance the consolidation of peace and freedom throughout Europe,
the expansion of NATO's common democratic security culture, and
the protection of U.S. interests in that region and elsewhere.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the arguments raised against NATO expansion are specious
or based on inaccurate or exaggerated concerns. At the same time,
there are reasonable questions and concerns about how NATO expansion
would work. These concerns must be addressed satisfactorily by
NATO and by candidates for membership. In particular, prospective
members, as well as NATO member nations, will have to contribute
their fair share, financially and otherwise.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The continuing importance of NATO is clear. Not only are nations
clamoring for admission, but long-standing member France has decided
to reinvigorate its participation in the alliance.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has brought in several new members since its inception.<sup>22</sup> Admission of new members at this point would not be a radical
change, but rather a natural progression in NATO's steady growth
over the years. Opening the alliance to new members would ratify
the expansion of freedom's borders and the reality that new entrants
already are a part of the West.<BR>

<p><blockquote>
"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated 
Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget 
deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be 
taken from another program."
</blockquote><p>
--Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

<a href="cb22t1.gif">Table 1</a>: "Additional State Medicaid Obligations...1996-2002"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid, the health care program 
serving the nation's poor, has transpired without adequate attention paid to the 
effect of the program on state finances. If significant reforms in Medicaid are 
not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the 
proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to the program. 
And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the 
rate for total state spending, the states will be forced either to increase taxes or 
to divert money from other programs, such as education and crime control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicaid is a state-administered 
program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments 
jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a 
statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower 
per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 
83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The cost of Medicaid to the federal 
government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid 
costs will almost double by 2002.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the financial impact on the 
federal government of generally unrestrained Medicaid growth is alarming 
enough, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless 
growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid that 
forces them either to raise taxes in order to maintain spending for other 
programs or to reduce state expenditures for non-Medicaid programs. States 
can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal 
rules requiring that certain levels of coverage (entitlements) be provided to 
certain populations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To examine the probable future 
budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend of 
total Medicaid spending using certain assumptions to forecast the state share 
of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002.<sup> 2</sup>  This 
analysis resulted in two sets of findings:  first, the additional costs to the states 
if no changes are made in the Medicaid program and, second, the additional 
costs stemming from President Clinton's proposed "per capita cap" reforms in 
Medicaid. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level 
Medicaid burden if Congress either does nothing or adopts the President's 
proposal. These projections of state spending incorporate expected changes in 
state economic activity, in the size of the eligible population, and in the trend 
of federal Medicaid transfers to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These forecasts of future state 
Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton 
Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally recognized 
economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 
47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between changes in 
historical Medicaid spending and fluctuations in the states' economic activity 
and Medicaid-eligible populations. In four cases, however, the relationship 
was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in 
spending; these states are North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming. 
<a href="cb22t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the 
states are to meet their projected Medicaid expenditures.
<p>
<b>Estimated Additional Costs Without Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Between 1995 and 2002, if no 
reforms are enacted that address the costs of entitlements and the composition 
of covered groups, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money 
on Medicaid. Total state spending over this period is projected to be $1,700 
billion, of which $1,011 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if 
CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between 
federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote 
an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among 
the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 17 percent of its 
revenues to the health care program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="cb22c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of 
state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 
1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. 
These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion 
by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid 
by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the 12-year period 
between 1990 and 2002. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some individual states will be 
particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $18 billion in 
new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 
1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $17.3 billion; Florida, 
$12.9 billion; Pennsylvania, $11.6 billion; and Texas, $7.2 billion. If these 
states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California 
will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $246 per year; New York, 
by $370; Florida, by $374; Pennsylvania, by $362; and Texas, by $177.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This rapid growth in the states' 
Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level 
Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes 
support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation 
infrastructure (see <a href="cb22c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state 
Medicaid spending to grow at a rate of 7.5 percent, while total state spending 
should grow at a 6.4 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid 
means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other 
state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will 
continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-
2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8.4 percent rate, while 
total state expenditures are expected to grow by an average of 5.8 percent.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Effects of the "Blue Dog" Democrat Plan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Democratic "Blue Dog" plan to 
reform the federal Medicaid program, the principal elements of which have 
been advanced by the Clinton Administration in its seven-year budget 
proposal, would increase the federal fiscal burden on the states by an 
estimated $47.4 billion over the next seven years. This new fiscal burden has 
been described as "one of the biggest and most expensive unfunded [federal] 
mandates ever"<sup> 3</sup> and, over the seven-year period 1996-2002, 
would amount to $4.4 billion in California, $3.7 billion in Florida, $3.4 billion 
in New York, $3.2 billion in Pennsylvania, and over $2.9 billion in Texas. 
Overall, this unfunded federal mandate would exceed $1 billion in 16 states. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First proposed by a group of 
Democratic House members earlier this year,<sup>4 </sup> this plan would 
further challenge the fiscal resources of the states by maintaining all the 
existing program mandates which the federal government imposes on the 
states<sup> 5</sup> while simultaneously reducing the federal government's 
contribution through the mechanism of a "per capita cap" on the federal share 
of the program. Under the "Blue Dog" plan, the per capita cap limits the 
amount of federal medical assistance that states would receive for each 
Medicaid recipient. Any expenses that exceed this limit would be the sole 
responsibility of state and local taxpayers. Because the full array of federal 
Medicaid mandates would remain in effect, states would not be able to offer 
innovative, and less expensive, health care options to Medicaid recipients. 
Overall, the per capita cap would shift an estimated $47.4 billion of mandated 
Medicaid spending from the federal to state governments over the next seven 
years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would probably respond to 
this shift in one of three ways:  1) enact dramatic tax increases; 2) reduce state 
spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other important 
state functions; or 3) some combination of the above. Indeed, the proliferation 
of Medicaid mandates during the late 1980s and early 1990s has already 
forced the states to reallocate their resources to Medicaid. According to the 
National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending has 
doubled from approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall 
state spending since 1987.<sup> 6</sup>
<p>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Heritage Foundation and 
Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic 
activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the 
additional funds states would need to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our baseline estimates assume no 
change in current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid 
transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this 
program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of the 
state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and 
economic change. We used this as the basic structure for future Medicaid 
spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These baseline forecasts of state 
Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher 
federal expenditures on Medicaid projected by the Congressional Budget 
Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) 
spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $58 billion over the period 1996 
to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each 
state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the 
seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would 
be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated 
by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of 
taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the principal goals of government regulation is to protect the public and save lives. But how efficiently does today's system of regulation achieve that goal?  Federal agencies are criticized increasingly for imposing ineffective, costly regulations on individuals and businesses that do little to improve public health and safety. The criticism ranges from accusations of poor-quality science being used to estimate the magnitude of health risks, to the growing trend of agencies to regulate purely hypothetical health risks that likely pose no danger whatsoever. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year due to the current command-and-control system, chiefly by squandering billions of dollars on eliminating risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The traditional rhetoric of those who support the current regulatory system -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is simply wrong. Well-intentioned regulations can kill. Alarmists have succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would "roll back protection" -- for example, that women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e.coli</I> bacteria. This is untrue. A reformed system would allow us to devote more resources, not less, to the types of activities which we know save lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress has been unsuccessful in its efforts to frame the issues clearly for Americans. But, rather than passively allow the assertions of alarmists and regulatory extremists to go unanswered, reformers can and should seize the moral high ground in the debate over risk regulation. They should point out that their reforms and solutions actually will save more lives. In effect, they can help Americans get "more bang for the regulatory buck."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Reformers must understand and effectively communicate five simple truths about risk regulation to convince the public that regulatory reform will result in more protection, not less:
<P><ol>
<b><li>Not every risk is avoidable.</b> While eliminating every risk from life is desirable, it also is impossible. People make decisions every day regarding the types of risk they choose to face, and accidents do happen. A 100 percent risk-free, accident-free society is an impossible goal, and it is unwise for regulators to act as if it were achievable.<p>

<b><li>All risks are relative.</b> Almost everything we do every day carries some degree of risk. But some risks obviously are greater than others. Some risks may sound catastrophic while actually being relatively trivial because the likelihood of harm is so low. For example, many Americans still fear airplane flight despite clear evidence it is one of the safest modes of transportation available. By contrast, commonplace everyday risks such as driving to work pose a greater health hazard because they occur more frequently and the chance of accidents is greater.
<p>
<b><li>Wealthier is healthier.</b> Higher incomes increase living standards which, in turn, improve health and increase life expectancy. As the standard of living improves, overall public health and safety improves. Conversely, actions which lower living standards typically increase risk and shorten life expectancy. Thus, the more burdensome the regulations, the greater the drain on the economy and on the prosperity and health of Americans. This cost must be balanced against any benefit from a regulation.<p>

<b><li>Regulations can have adverse side effects, thus creating more risk and less protection.</b> While some regulation saves lives, some federal regulations actually cost more lives than they save by discouraging innovation, decreasing incomes, destroying economic output and job opportunities, and creating other new risks in pursuit of policy objectives. For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations meant to guarantee the safety of drugs or medical devices often delay the release of these products, placing millions more lives at risk.
<p>
<b><li>More lives would be saved if risks were prioritized.</b> If federal regulators identified and prioritized risks more effectively, as many as 60,000 additional lives could be saved each year.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These truths constitute the foundation of how to talk about risk regulation. This study is intended to help policymakers communicate in clearer terms the problems underlying today's system of risk regulation and describe a framework for reform.
<p>
<b>LIFE AND RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

We face risks every day of our lives. It is risky to eat, breathe, and walk down the street. Tragedy can strike from unknown and improbable sources. The world is full of risk, and no one is free from its dangers. But we also put ordinary risks in perspective. Even though people are constantly exposed to potentially dangerous circumstances, few decide to live in seclusion merely to avoid a slight chance of harm. While people wisely avoid unacceptable risks, they also wisely ignore or take only minor precautions against the vast majority of potential dangers facing them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Common sense tells us that risk is a relative matter. All other things being equal, less risk is better. But not all other things <I>are</I> equal -- sometimes it is better to accept small amounts of risk because the rewards are so great. In fact, humans do this every day when they risk poisoning by eating food or taking medicine or when they drive to work. The reason: Even with reasonable government protections and private precautions, there is a risk. But while the possibility of, say, food poisoning, remains real, usually it is very small and the alternative is unacceptable to most people. People calmly accept commonplace risks everyday. Life is a series of prudent trade-offs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, this is not understood by government bureaucrats who continue to craft regulations with the goal of eliminating all risk from society. These regulators, in an effort to be cautious and "safe," often impose great economic burdens on those they regulate to eliminate the slightest risk of death or injury. Even the smallest element of risk in society typically is deemed intolerable and unacceptable. The enormity of the cost often is irrelevant to regulators as they pursue a "zero-risk" or "no-risk" society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk trade-offs and opportunity costs.</b> While these policymakers are well-intentioned, they ignore the important point that risk is neither created nor eliminated in a vacuum. Every action has consequences. Any attempt to decrease or eliminate risk will entail a corresponding trade-off. Every action taken by an individual or organization means that other opportunities are closed off. Economists refer to these lost opportunities as opportunity costs. More specifically, the opportunity cost of a given action refers to the forgone benefits that could have been obtained by employing resources in an alternative way.<sup>1</sup>  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>On an elementary level, most people enjoy watching television as well as reading books or magazines, but understand there is a trade-off between the two at any given time. The opportunity cost of watching television is the lost chance to read.
<p>
<li>On a more complex level, the opportunity cost of prohibiting a business from hiring and paying workers at whatever wage they can afford may be an overall loss in employment and income for the economy.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<li>Likewise, federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which require increased fuel economy in American automobiles, undoubtedly have saved fuel. But this has come at the expense of many thousands of lives lost, because auto companies were effectively forced to manufacture much lighter-weight cars to meet the fuel economy standards, and these cars were not heavy enough to protect drivers and passengers as well in accidents.<sup>3</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In each case, a trade-off is made, although the trade-off may not be consciously understood. Consequently, opportunity costs are incurred. Such costs can range from very expensive to fairly trivial; hidden to visible; extremely complex to easily understood. Whatever their magnitude, there are real costs and trade-offs associated with every regulatory decision.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In an important new book, <I>Risk vs. Risk</I>,<sup>4</sup> John Graham, Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and President-elect of the Society for Risk Analysis, and Jonathan Baert Weiner, Associate Professor in the School of Law and the School of Environment at Duke University, develop a conceptual framework (referred to as "Risk Trade-off Analysis" or "RTA") to help policymakers and the public better understand the nature of risk trade-offs. Graham and Weiner argue that the best way to understand the dangers inherent in the risk assessment process is to plot on a chart the relationship between "target risks" and "countervailing risks."  Target risks are those risks that regulations are designed to reduce. A countervailing risk is the unintended and undesirable consequence that results from attempts to reduce the target risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, consider Graham's and Weiner's hypothetical example of how someone might go about reducing the risk of a headache. To alleviate the target risk, the headache, the sufferer could take several aspirin. While taking several aspirin usually will lessen the headache, it often comes at the cost of a countervailing risk -- a severely upset stomach. As the chart below reveals, if the recommended remedy for the target risk is merely to take several aspirin while ignoring any side effects, improvements can be made along the target risk axis. Yet alleviating the target risk may increase the risk of severe stomach problems, moving us backwards on the countervailing risk axis. Thus, both types of risks must be acknowledged so that the proper balance can be struck or alternative treatments found to remedy the target risk without creating heightened countervailing risks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Risk Trade-off Analysis, as developed by Graham and Weiner, simply draws attention to the inevitable trade-offs policymakers face when attempting to eliminate target risks. Actions taken to alleviate target risks may come at the expense of heightened countervailing risks. When legislators and regulators ignore the opportunity costs of such trade-offs, the results can be unfortunate and even deadly. A clear case of this is the CAFE standard mentioned earlier. Increased fuel economy in cars (the target risk) was achieved, but at the expense of increased highway fatalities (the countervailing risk).
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Graham and Weiner provide many other examples of how RTA can be used to examine inefficient risk analysis:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Regulations aimed at decreasing solid waste in landfills from disposable diapers can decrease this target risk by encouraging increased use of washable cloth diapers.</b> Yet this produces a countervailing risk: more air pollution created by increased energy-intensive washing and household pickup services by high-polluting trucks.
<p>
<li><b>Banning the pesticide EDB may have eliminated the very slight cancer risk it posed, but only at the expense of a more dangerous cancer-causing fungus left on the food</b> that used to be treated with the pesticide.
<p>
<li><b>In 1991, Peru suffered a massive outbreak of cholera, which killed 7,000 people and afflicted over 800,000 others. This was caused by Peru's decision to ban the chlorination of drinking water, based on American risk studies</b> that had shown there might be a slight chance of developing cancer due to chlorine. But the chances of cancer death from chlorinated water turned out to be far less than the risk of death due to a contaminated drinking supply.
<p>
<li><b>Asbestos abatement efforts actually pose a greater risk to human health than non-action, since the substance has been shown to be virtually harmless if left alone.</b> Thus, regulations requiring asbestos removal not only have wasted scarce public health dollars, but also have placed workers removing it and others at greater risk from dust stirred up once it was agitated.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clearly, as shown by these examples, if Congress ever hopes to fix the grave problems of the current risk assessment and management systems, it must be aware of the opportunity costs that are inextricably entwined with all risk regulation trade-offs. While the benefits of some regulations may outweigh the cost, more often they do not. And that means lives are lost unnecessarily. Why is this the case?
<p>
<b>How Well-Intentioned Regulations Can Cost Lives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Attempting to save lives by trying to eliminate every risk from life actually can increase the overall death toll for many reasons. The primary reason: Avoiding one risk necessarily implies accepting others. Even in the United States, with a gross national product of $7 trillion, there are limited resources that can be devoted to reducing risk. At the very least, policymakers should acknowledge that saving lives by taking one action precludes using those same resources to save other -- and perhaps more -- lives. In many cases, if the private resources used in complying with federal mandates were left to the individuals affected, or used in other ways in the economy, Americans would benefit more. The country cannot afford to eliminate all risk, since trying to do so can reduce safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Supreme Court Justice Stephan Breyer noted in his 1993 study of risk regulation, <I>Breaking the Vicious Circle</I>, while it would be wonderful to eradicate every last bit of risk from life, trying to "go that last mile" can be pursued "to the point where it brings about more harm than good."<sup>5</sup>  Few additional gains are made in terms of public health and safety when such a strategy is followed, Breyer argues, since "[r]emoving that last little bit can involve limited technological choice, high cost, devotion of considerable agency resources, large legal fees, and endless argument."<sup>6</sup>  To better understand Justice Breyer's point, critics of the onerous current system must learn to speak in terms of "wealthier is healthier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Assuming the moral high ground: Why a higher standard of living keeps people safer.</b> Increasingly, academics, expert analysts, and even government officials argue that large increases in regulatory spending can result in more lives lost than saved. But while true, this is counter-intuitive for most people. After all, regulation ostensibly is designed to protect people, and this usually would be true if the benefits of regulation existed in a vacuum with no costs, including opportunity costs. Regulation neither exists in a vacuum nor necessarily corresponds with more protection; yet it always entails costs. When the cost of well-intentioned risk regulations is a corresponding decrease in the overall economic welfare of average citizens, the net result can be lost lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is an old saying that health is wealth. The converse is also true: Wealth is health. As <a href="tp13c2.gif">Chart 2</a> and <a href="tp13a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> suggest, comparing average national income levels to life expectancy and infant mortality in 132 surveyed countries reveals a strong correlation. More children survive and adults live longer in countries with higher incomes. Why does this occur?  There are many reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One reason is that increases in economic production make possible innovations such as medical technology, antibiotics, weather-resistant shelter, and safer modes of transportation. These factors in turn increase life expectancy. Another is that wealthy, robust economies encourage job creation, which also lowers deaths by reducing the ranks of unemployed workers, who suffer from higher mortality rates. Moreover, increased wealth extends life expectancy for those already fully employed by giving them opportunities to buy better food and shelter, purchase more health insurance, drive safer cars, and otherwise live a less stressful life. Furthermore, a healthier population produces even more wealth, so the wealth-health cycle becomes self-perpetuating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These advances have done more to reduce the very real everyday risks Americans face than the great majority of risk regulations currently on the books. Despite "Chicken Little" claims by some alarmists, life is getting less risky all the time. The easiest way to see this is to compare turn-of-the-century life expectancy figures with today's. Total life expectancy in the year 1900 was just 48 years; today, it is 76 years. This remarkable 60 percent jump is due primarily to the ever-increasing standard of living enjoyed by Americans over the span of this century. Steadily rising incomes have allowed individuals and families to make ongoing investments in risk-alleviating measures that increase their health and that of their families. In fact, two scientists in the early 1980s estimated that for every 1 percent change in income, mortality is reduced by approximately 0.05 percent.<sup>7</sup>  Again, wealthier is not only healthier, but highly risk-reducing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is also worth noting that these large gains in human health and longevity occurred just as rapidly before the onset of most federal regulatory programs in the early 1970s as they have since. In fact, from 1900 to 1969, life expectancy at birth rose by an average of 0.8 percent per year (see <a href="tp13c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). By way of comparison, from 1970 to 1990, life expectancy grew by only 0.3 percent per year. Policymakers need to ask themselves how these amazing gains were made prior to 1970 without federal health and safety rules. The answer, of course, lies in the wealth-health phenomenon.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Regulation: The other side of the story.</b> Regulations, including those that ostensibly are supposed to reduce risk, can cause fatalities whenever they destroy wealth, confiscate property, or discourage employment and product innovation. This should be taken into account whenever a regulation is proposed. Jobs are lost and wealth is destroyed when output is restricted, resources are used inefficiently, or entrepreneurialism in general is discouraged. Product innovation likewise is suppressed whenever government too strictly regulates the development, distribution, and use of products with life-saving potential.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Several recent regulatory and judicial decisions support this concept. For instance, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has noted that for each additional $7.5 million increase in the regulatory burden imposed on Americans, one human life is lost.9  According to OIRA, the reduction in economic activity due to the burden of regulation itself actually increases risk because living standards are reduced, and this causes mortality rates to rise. This increased mortality, however, reflects only the heightened risk caused by the economic effects of regulations and is separate from reduced risks that could be achieved by devoting expenditures to other uses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using this estimate:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $119 billion</b> to avert just one death under an OSHA-based formaldehyde occupational exposure limit, 331 new drugs could be developed and brought to market.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $168 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based benzene regulation, 3,064 police officers could be placed on the street.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $653 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based dichloropropane water standard, 4,353 new fire trucks could be purchased -- equivalent to 10 per congressional district.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The late risk expert Aaron Wildavsky made clear exactly why regulation can have such counter-productive effects. He explained that the quest for a no-risk society through overzealous regulation "is the highest risk of all"<sup>13</sup> because it prohibits or interferes with the enormously beneficial trial-and-error process that weeds out unsafe products or processes and replaces them with superior alternatives. As Wildavsky noted in his influential work <I>Searching for Safety</I>, proponents of a no-risk society demand "trial <I>without</I> error," which in reality is more deadly, since "[i]f you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all.... [I]f trying new things is made more costly, there will be fewer departures from past practice; this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards.... [E]xisting hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Those who support the current regulatory system apparently want policymakers and the public to believe that thousands of pages of new rules and hundreds of additional bureaucrats would do more to improve human health and safety than more police on the beat, more fire trucks in local communities, or more pharmaceutical drugs on the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In summary, because regulatory policy often requires that private resources be employed in sub-optimal ways, enormous costs are imposed on businesses and individual Americans alike.<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, as critics of the current system can now argue, these costs may often include the loss of human life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>A real world example: CLIA.</b> Take the case of CLIA, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Despite little evidence that any serious problems existed with current laboratory testing methods, Congress became fixated on a few highly unusual cases in which laboratory testing error contributed to the death of a patient. Congress felt that even a single fatality caused by testing error was one death too many. With truly noble intentions, legislators set out to insure lab tests would be perfectly safe from that point forward -- again, the creation of a "no-risk" society was the theme. Yet, despite these good intentions, the results have been less than encouraging and have placed the lives of average Americans at even greater risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The eight-page law led to 1,600 pages of regulations as well as thousands of pages of additional guidelines. Faced with enormous paperwork costs and threatened with fines for non-compliance with this needless paperwork, tens of thousands of small private medical practices have been forced to stop administering basic patient tests or have shut down their operations altogether.<sup>16</sup>  As a result, the cost of routine laboratory tests for things such as strep infection, cholesterol levels, pregnancy, and Pap Smears has risen dramatically. With fewer patients (especially those who are poor) therefore able to obtain basic clinical tests, the overall quality of care has been reduced, and more lives are now at risk than before CLIA was passed. Good intentions have led to disastrous results. Thus, like many other regulations whose stated purpose is to reduce risk to society, CLIA is likely costing more lives than it is saving.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This real-world example provides several important lessons that apply to all risk regulation:
<P><ul>
<li><b>First, it illustrates that every regulation involves trade-offs and corresponding opportunity costs, including the cost of human life.</b> In the case of CLIA, trying to make labs completely safe is placing individuals at even greater risk.
<p>
<li><b>Second, it shows that "two wrongs don't make a right."</b>  A few chance accidents do not justify overzealous regulatory initiatives that actually create more problems than they solve. Again, it is not possible to avoid every single risk in life, and attempting to do so can lead to more harm than good.<p>

<li><b>Third, and most important, as economists Richard J. Zeckhauser and W. Kip Viscusi note, "When thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improvements in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress and a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private forbearance."</b><sup>17</sup>  Innovation, trial and error, acquired knowledge, and the corresponding benefits of progress and wealth expansion are the true keys to a safer, healthier society -- not a more onerous regulatory regime.
<p>
<li><B>Finally, where command-and-control tactics are used, whether by the FDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the EPA, or other regulatory agencies, fewer lives are being saved than many policymakers and average Americans have been led to believe.</b> In many cases, as with CLIA, lives may be lost because countervailing risks are being ignored.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When federal policymakers accept the validity of regulations such as CLIA without carefully considering the costs they impose, they fail to understand that resources are being used inefficiently and people often are dying as a consequence. Tammy O. Tengs of Duke University summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost."<sup>18</sup>  With federal regulatory spending growing without restraint,19 the conclusion is clear: The pursuit of a "no-risk" society through expensive and inefficient federal regulatory activity is killing Americans.
<p>
<b>How to Manage Resources Better to Reduce Risk</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The central question facing policymakers and regulators is how to obtain "more bang for the buck" when trying to reduce risk. Since economic resources in society are scarce, it is essential that policymakers examine the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to reduce risk. This requires a common reference point to measure benefits. In the scholarly literature on risk analysis, this is often done in terms of how many "life-years" are saved by a particular measure. Assuming an average woman's life span of 80 years of age, a measure that prevented her premature death at age 50 would save 30 "life-years."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In examining the cost-effectiveness of various kinds of risk-alleviating measures, recent studies using life-year analysis generally have grouped the measures into three categories: 1) medicine and medical treatments, 2) fatal injury reduction efforts, and 3) toxin control. Although rules and methods can be found in each category that save lives very efficiently, medical treatments typically generate the greatest life-year benefits for the least cost while toxin control measures produce few benefits at the highest   cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What generally saves the most lives?</b>  The most cost-effective way to save lives generally is to increase medical treatment and, to a somewhat lesser degree, to curb fatal injuries. Trying to save lives by regulating pesticides or other toxins, on the other hand, generally uses up far more resources and saves fewer lives -- meaning that shifting resources from toxin regulation to medical testing on balance typically would save lives. While it is true that some toxin regulations do save lives (for example, restrictions on the release of nuclear wastes), most do not fit into this category. A seminal study that recently surveyed 587 risk-reducing methods, programs, and rules reveals that the median cost per life-year saved -- or extending a single life by one year -- for toxin control measures is $2,800,000. In contrast, the median cost per life-year saved is $19,000 for medical treatments and $48,000 for fatal injury reductions.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just how cost-<I>ineffective</I> are the great majority of these toxin control measures?  To put the numbers in perspective, Graham notes, "the median toxin control program costs 58 times more per year of life saved than the median injury prevention program and 146 times more than the median medical program (see <a href="tp13c4.gif">Chart 4</a>)."<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is ironic since, intuitively, most policymakers and ordinary Americans assume that toxin control is perhaps the most cost-effective method of reducing risk. Many Americans generally have come to believe that federal regulations banning or severely curtailing the use of products that sound very dangerous are extremely cost-effective and represent wise public policy. It turns out that nothing could be further from the truth. For example, the following list of five federal toxin control regulations reveals the enormous costs that would have to be incurred by society in trying to save just one life-year for each of these regulations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If citizens were forced to incur these expenses to save one life-year per regulation, and if the regulatory costs for these five regulations were totaled, it would cost society roughly $189 billion for just five life-years saved. By way of comparison, spending $189 billion on developing new life-saving drugs typically would allow an additional 526 new drugs to be developed and brought to market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It should be noted that this does not mean the nation is now actually spending $189 billion to alleviate the risk posed by these five toxins. Rather, this is how much would have to be spent to save just five life-years. The numbers are extraordinarily large precisely because the risks being regulated are so small, perhaps even illusory. In reality, the nation now spends much less on implementing these five rules but does not buy five years of life for that amount.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Current policies = 60,000 extra deaths per year.</b> As noted earlier, an important new study by Tammy Tengs estimates the magnitude of this resource misallocation. In her doctoral dissertation at Harvard, Dr. Tengs notes that from a survey of 185 life-saving interventions: 
<P><blockquote>
	 Results indicate that we incur opportunity costs of approximately $31.1 billion, 60,200 premature deaths, or 636,000 years of life lost every year in order to maintain our present pattern of investments in these 185 life-saving interventions. At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars. This could be accomplished by simply attending to the cost-effectiveness of investment options.<sup>22</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Dr. Tengs notes, "[W]e pay a large price for this pattern of investments and policy makers would be well advised to examine whether retaining the status quo results in non-survival benefits that are worth the cost and loss of human life."<sup>23</sup>  John Graham observes bluntly, "This perverse pattern of investment amounts to 'statistical murder' of American citizens. Policy makers need to ask harder questions about whether our public health and environmental protection dollars are well spent."<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The bottom line:</b> If the current pattern of regulation and structure of costs continues, risks actually will increase for average Americans.
<p>
<b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given this misuse of resources and the corresponding costs of current federal policies and priorities, policymakers and regulators should reconsider how to reduce real risks to Americans. The aim should be to provide more protection at less cost. A better distribution of scarce societal resources to achieve this goal would:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Improve risk decision-making and minimize inefficient federal spending.</b> Risk assessment methods need to be improved (for example, by using sound science), and agencies need to establish a clear distinction between assessing risks and deciding how to manage them. Federal agencies should work closely with the scientific community to improve risk assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy decisions about how risk should be managed to influence how risk is determined. When a risk is identified, a policy decision is made about how to handle it. If certain federal toxin control efforts produce little or no benefit for society, however, they should be abandoned, since they waste resources that could be used better elsewhere. Other programs, such as fatal injury programs, also would be scrutinized to ensure that resources could not be used better elsewhere, such as for medical treatments.
<p>
<b><li>Require that decisions about how to manage risks be made with due consideration for scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns.</b> In those cases where governmental solutions are viewed as inevitable, regulators should be required to take into account all possible outcomes and potential side effects of their actions. Scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns all must be given due consideration in this process. Moreover, Congress should demand that regulators meet stringent standards of proof before allowing them to overrule individual action and choice. External peer review mechanisms and judicial review opportunities also should be established to guarantee accountability. Proper prioritization of serious risks will aid in this process.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Encourage market-based solutions that produce incentives to reduce risk.</b> Achieving a wealthier citizenry would do more to decrease risks and reduce mortality than most public programs. Better use of market pricing and strict enforcement of property rights claims through the common law system would produce risk-alleviating incentives. For example, by applying property rights to water usage in Scotland, river users have reduced pollution by others in the waterways since they have an economic incentive to conserve and keep clean the natural resources they now own.<sup>26</sup>  Fundamental reform of tort law that results in a fairer compensatory system and better deters harmful conduct without over-punishing behavior also would help achieve this goal.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Improve both public and private risk information efforts.</b> The public needs to understand the types of familiar risks they face everyday, such as being struck by lightning, and how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as exposure to a particular chemical in the community. This would ensure that individuals possess the maximum amount of information to make wise, safety-conscious decisions on their own. For example, smoking, alcohol abuse, poor dietary standards, sun tanning, dangerous recreation activities and vehicles, and other potentially hazardous lifestyle habits are among the most risky activities engaged in by most Americans, according to experts. However, government regulation is rarely the solution and traditionally has not been the approach in these areas. An informed citizenry, with the liberty to make personal decisions, is the optimal goal.
<p>
<b><li>Give states and localities the flexibility to target resources more effectively to address the risks they face.</b> States and localities can target resources more precisely to the needs of their communities, such as sanitation, hazardous waste cleanup, and traffic safety. Moreover, they are more likely to know and be more responsive to the unique needs and concerns of their citizens than are distant federal regulators. Restricting federal efforts to clearly interstate and national concerns in those cases where private, state, and local efforts fail would be a much more effective division of responsibility.
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Eliminating every risk from life is impossible. But in pursuit of the mirage of a "risk-free" society, regulators oftentimes pursue quixotic and unattainable goals that place the lives of ordinary Americans at even greater risk. The traditional rhetoric surrounding the debate over risk -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is fraudulent. Regulations can kill, especially when they are formulated as a rash response to hypothetical risks and divert resources from other activities that would reduce real risks. The new rhetoric of risk regulation must be based on sound science, prioritization, and an understanding of the wealth-health trade-offs government regulations force on society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, not all federal risk regulations can be eliminated. But those that regulate illusory risks can and should be eliminated. Moreover, other regulations that alleviate small amounts of risk often can be crafted in better ways or carried out at the state or local level to ensure that they are cost-effective and truly beneficial. Obviously, there is no one panacea that policymakers can rely on in determining whether federal intervention is necessary. Judgment is needed. But if the proper tools and concepts are applied consistently when contemplating legislation or regulation of risk, those judgments would be much more sound than they are today. In the end, many more Americans would live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

"Opportunity benefits," on the other hand, focuses on the beneficial results that could have come about if a different path had been followed. <I>Ibid</I>., p. 39.<p>
<li>Although almost all risk experts agree this relationship holds over the long run, the short-run effects of economic wealth and personal health are disputed. That is, as "permanent income" (average income over the long run) increases or decreases over time, health risks and mortality generally decrease. See generally Wildavsky, "Richer Is Sicker Versus Richer Is Safer," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> , pp. 59-75. However, fluctuations in "transitory income" (short-term income changes during business cycle upturns and downturns) do not always exhibit a similar correlation. In fact, some scholars have noted that a perverse relationship exists between health/mortality risks and short-term increases in income brought on by improving economic conditions. For example, some ailments such as heart attacks, accidents, and cirrhosis tend to increase with improving economic times since they often are the result of an increased tendency and ability among individuals to consume greater quantities of luxuries that may have adverse health effects. See John D. Graham, Bei-Hung Chang, and John S. Evans, "Poorer Is Riskier," <I>Risk Analysis</I>, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1992), pp. 333-337. In general, though, these are health risks that individuals accept despite the side effects associated with them. More important, permanent income is generally a more important gauge of overall societal well-being and is hurt by federal policies that generate enormous costs and produce few benefits.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait is among the most important
challenges for American foreign policy in early 1996. Ever since
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the
United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating
Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of
force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and
even larger maneuvers are underway as Taiwan moves toward its
scheduled March 23 presidential election. China continues to reserve
the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare
independence. If a military clash were to occur, even a limited
one, tremendous damage would be done, both to Taiwan and to U.S.-China
relations. Failure to deter conflict also would be regarded in
Asia as a failure of U.S. leadership.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At stake in Taiwan is not only the peace and security of the region,
but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. With a population of
only 21 million, the ROC is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner,
right behind China itself. After martial law ended in 1987, the
ROC embarked on political reforms that soon will transform Taiwan
into a full democracy. Last December, free and fair elections
were held for the ROC Legislative Yuan<sup>1</sup>; and this March 23, Taiwan
will hold its first direct presidential election. The ROC is the
first full democracy in the history of the Chinese people. Taiwan
is thus a model for political reform on the mainland.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In response to the ROC's growing international stature, China
has mounted a campaign of diplomatic pressure and military intimidation
against Taiwan. On one level, these threats are directed at political
forces in Taiwan calling for independence from China<sup>2</sup>. But they
are aimed also at Taiwan's emerging democracy. Beijing's threats
have been reinforced by demonstrations of force, including large-scale
military exercises and tests of nuclear-capable missiles near
the ROC. These actions have not depressed the democratic enthusiasm
of the people of Taiwan, but they have weakened business confidence
on the island. Even larger military exercises will be held in
the days leading up to the March 23 presidential election.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bill Clinton's failure to respond adequately to Chinese saber-rattling
in the South China Sea and against Taiwan fosters an impression
of American weakness. Several statements by Clinton Administration
officials to the effect that the U.S. will not defend Taiwan if
attacked are potentially even more destabilizing. Hard-liners
in Beijing have been encouraged to step up dangerous military
pressure against Taiwan. President Clinton therefore must take
strong but measured steps to convey to Beijing America's clear
interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Congress can
play an important role as well in reaffirming America's traditional
bipartisan support for the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Thus, the
Administration and Congress should:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
<li>Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
The perception that the U.S. would not respond to a Chinese attack
will only embolden Beijing.<BR>

<P>
<li>Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully.<BR>

<P>
<li>Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. China should be told it may face economic sanctions,
ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a
full U.S. economic embargo, and that the U.S. does not rule out
using force to defend Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li>Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li><B>Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act. These may include advanced air-to-air missiles,
conventional submarines, and missile defense systems. <BR>
</B>
<P>
<li><B>Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by
deploying missile defenses. </B>China's demonstrated willingness
to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan underscores
the need to defend U.S. forces in Asia from this threat. <BR>
</ul><BR>


<P>
<b>GROWING DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN: THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN ELECTIONS</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan is the foremost lawmaking branch of the ROC
government. The December 2 Legislative Yuan elections represented
a milestone in the democratic reform process begun by former President
Chiang Ching-kuo when he lifted martial law in 1987. The elections
emphatically demonstrated the deepening of Taiwan's own democratic
political culture. Today, Taiwan's democracy includes aspects
common to all advanced democracies: competitive multi-party competition,
professionally managed and transparent voting procedures, effective
public debate, and citizen faith in the election process. This
faith was illustrated by the impressive turnout of 67.65 percent
of Taiwan's 14.2 million voting-age citizens. This occurred without
compulsory voting laws. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The elections preserved the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party's narrow
majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan. The KMT won 85 seats,
but its total declined by 11 seats. The main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) made only modest gains, from 50 to 54.
Meanwhile, the New Party, a recently formed conservative party,
went from 0 to 21 seats. Because party discipline in Taiwan is
lax, the KMT will have to form coalitions in order to conduct
the business of government. Thus, the results of the election
offer prospects for the development of a culture of compromise,
a necessary element common to all advanced democracies.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The December 2 elections were judged universally to be fair and
democratic. On election day, an observer team organized by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> visited several polling stations in Central
Taipei, witnessing voting procedures that Taiwanese appeared to
regard as routine. There was little tension because the procedures
were well known. Confidence in the secrecy and security of the
ballots is well established. That evening, the Heritage delegation
visited the National Vote Tallying Center, where computerized
tallying produced national results well before 10:00 p.m. There
were no accusations of fraud to challenge the integrity of the
process. University of Florida Professor James Robinson also noted
that &quot;Taiwan at present compares favorably with its democratic
peers in conducting fair elections.&quot;<sup>3</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan elections were dominated by domestic issues.
Political and economic issues included criticism of KMT &quot;money
politics,&quot; a perceived slowdown in the economy, accusations
of government corruption, veterans benefits, and the personalities
of the candidates. In contrast to previous elections, many observers
noted that vote-buying was much less a problem in this election.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Independence and Intimidation. </B>China's military intimidation
played a lesser role in the December elections than many expected.
Some have noted that the impressive gains made by the New Party
(NP) and the defeat of one-third of the Democratic Progressive
Party's incumbents reflect opposition to Taiwan independence.
The NP strictly opposes independence and criticizes the KMT for
covertly seeking it, while the DPP advocates independence from
China despite Beijing's repeated threat to invade Taiwan if this
were to occur. In the middle of the spectrum between the NP and
the DPP, the KMT wants peaceful unification with a reformed mainland
over the long term but, in the interim, seeks to expand Taipei's
international recognition short of formal independence. The Heritage
delegation concluded that domestic issues played a far greater
role in voting preferences than did the independence issue. The
delegation also concluded that China's military threats did not
sway the Taiwanese people significantly. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE MARCH 23 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The democratic process begun by the legislative elections last
year will be consummated this year by the presidential elections
on March 23.<sup>4</sup> The front-runner in this election is KMT incumbent
President Lee Teng-hui. Lee is the first native-born Taiwanese
to become President and has followed his predecessor, President
Chiang Ching-kuo, in advancing democratic reforms. Lee has opposed
the DPP on the issue of independence from China but has sought
vigorously to raise Taiwan's international status by seeking to
join international organizations like the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the World Trade Organization, and the
United Nations. President Lee also has pressed for greater diplomatic
support from the United States. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lee will face three opponents in the election. Peng Ming-min of
the Democratic Progressive Party is a former political exile and
is regarded as the intellectual godfather of the pro-independence
movement. Two other candidates come from factions of the KMT.
Lin Yang-kang, former President of Taiwan's Judicial Yuan, is
supported by the New Party, which opposes both independence and
Lee Teng-hui. Also running on an independent ticket is Chen Li-an,
former President of the Control Yuan, a government watchdog body.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CHINA'S THREAT TO PEACE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last year, China has deliberately increased tension in
the Taiwan Strait. Beijing views Taipei's attempts to gain admittance
to the United Nations and President Lee's private visit to the
U.S. last June as efforts to advance the cause of an independent
Taiwan. However, China's leaders have an even greater fear: A
free and democratic Taiwan stands as a threat to the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party's political dictatorship. Thus,
Taiwan's democracy and place in the world stand as important issues
in China's own ongoing political transition. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Threats of Missile Strikes. </B>Since 1994, China has mounted
three major military exercises near Taiwan. In September and October
1994, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted combined air,
land, and sea exercises on Chou Shan Island, about 60 miles south
of ROC-held Quemoy Island. At the time, Assistant Secretary of
State Winston Lord described these exercises as &quot;the most
expansive... that China has conducted in 40 or 50 years.&quot;
In June and July of last year, the PLA conducted a similar series
of exercises near Taiwan. These exercises concluded with the firing
of four 1,125-mile range DF-21 and two 375-mile range M-9 missiles
to an area about 100 miles north of the ROC.<sup>5</sup> Both missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads. These tests
mark the first time China has used missiles to threaten an opponent.<sup>6</sup>
Finally, right before the Legislative Yuan elections, in late
November, Chinese President Jaing Zemin personally presided over
large-scale combined-arms amphibious and airborne assault exercises
designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan. These exercises involved
about 20,000 troops, in addition to about 40 ships and 100 aircraft.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China has scheduled more exercises for 1996 and has been deploying
forces to Fujian Province, across the strait from Taiwan, for
large-scale military exercises planned for late February.<sup>7</sup> These
exercises may involve up to 100,000 troops and China's most modern
combat aircraft, the Sukhoi SU-27 and J-8II jet fighters.<sup>8</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Beijing also has threatened to use force against Taiwan. Before
the December Legislative Yuan elections, China used the Hong Kong
press to discuss the possible invasion and occupation of one of
the ROC's offshore islands, followed by a naval blockade of the
Taiwan Strait. These threats were designed to compel Taipei to
begin reunification talks on Beijing's terms. Even more alarming,
former Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles
Freeman, following meetings in China, reportedly has told the
Administration that while China &quot;prefers negotiation to combat,&quot;
it &quot;has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan
consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China does not have the capability to invade and conquer the ROC,
but it does have the capability to do significant harm. Last November's
amphibious exercise involved only a single PLA division, but the
effort required civilian ships to support the PLA Navy.<sup>10</sup> However,
the PLA can cause substantial damage to Taiwan by mining ports,
undertaking a limited blockade with its five nuclear-powered and
45 conventional-powered attack submarines, and conducting a terror
campaign with conventional missile strikes. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; To counter Chinese submarines, the ROC Navy has only two modern
conventional submarines. Moreover, the ROC lacks anti-missile
systems, and China conceivably could take Quemoy or Matsu, small,
fortified islands near the coast of China, albeit at heavy cost
to its invading forces. Even such limited PLA action might lead
to air battles that would reduce the number of ROC combat aircraft.
In addition to any physical damage, such a limited campaign against
Taiwan could depress public and economic confidence. Shipping
insurance rates would skyrocket, and foreign investors would be
deterred. ROC officials estimate that after the PLA missile tests
last July, capital flight amounted to $5 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Unification By Force? </B>The PRC is stepping up its efforts
to intimidate the ROC, but it may be preparing for a more decisive
confrontation with Taiwan early in the next decade. In a speech
on January 30 Premier Li Peng, the second most powerful Chinese
leader, said that &quot;During the period of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan [years 1996 to 2000] the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau. Therefore, settling
the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese
people.&quot; Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that
the &quot;the important role to be played by the Army in taking
back Taiwan&quot; was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting
Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. This meeting reportedly also endorsed military modernization
plans, including a decision to build China's first aircraft carrier.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China indeed is modernizing its armed forces. Beijing has purchased
four advanced Kilo-class conventional submarines from Russia that
are far more capable than the older Soviet-based submarines currently
used by China. The PLA Navy is building modern missile-armed destroyers
and frigates. Reports of a pending deal in which China may buy
over 70 advanced Russian SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> fighters, which
will entail co-production of this aircraft, indicate the PLA could
have over 100 of this type in about five years.<sup>12</sup> This aircraft
has superior range and may be armed already with AA-11 <I>Archer</I>
air-to-air missiles, which would threaten the U.S. F-16s the ROC
plans to put into service in 1997<sup>13</sup>. Moreover, China may be seeking
to purchase Russian or Israeli AWACS early warning and air-combat
management aircraft, which would be essential in establishing
air superiority over the Taiwan Strait.<sup>14</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>WHY THE ROC DESERVES STEADFAST AMERICAN SUPPORT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though Washington ended formal diplomatic relations with Taipei
in favor of Beijing in 1978, a long-standing bipartisan consensus
in the U.S., expressed in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, has
supported strong informal ties with the ROC. There are three reasons
why maintaining strong relations with Taipei is in America's interest.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #1:</b> The ROC is America's seventh largest trading partner,
following immediately behind the PRC. In 1995, trade with the
ROC totaled $47 billion. While Taipei maintains a $5.8 billion
trade surplus with America in manufactured goods, the U.S. had
a surplus of $1.5 billion in the export of services in 1994. Taipei
has a good track record of responding to U.S. concerns about trade
barriers, though differences still exist in the areas of intellectual
property rights protection, access to banking and insurance markets,
and some tariffs. Nevertheless, The Heritage Foundation has rated
Taiwan's economy as the eighth freest in the world, right behind
the U.S.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #2:</b> The Republic of China's transition to full democracy
reflects America's own commitment to democracy. When democratization
is completed after the country's first direct presidential election
in March, the ROC deserves to be considered a democratic ally
of the United States. The persistence of the Taiwanese people
in building their own democratic institutions and traditions despite
internal and external pressures is a testament to their courage
and determination. The American people traditionally have admired
democracies and often have come to their aid when threatened.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #3:</b> Taiwan's democracy could have a positive influence
on China. China is experiencing a critical leadership transition
as President Jiang Zemin seeks to consolidate his power as Deng
Xiaoping fades from the scene. Over the last decade, Deng's economic
reforms have produced double-digit economic growth and expanded
economic freedom. Taiwan is well placed to advance this trend.
Despite the deep-seated political antipathy of China's leadership
toward Taiwan, both sides have rapidly increased their economic
and personal interaction in recent years. ROC-PRC trade now exceeds
$20 billion annually, and millions of Taiwanese have visited the
mainland for business and family reasons. The success of Taiwan's
democratic reforms could influence mainland attitudes toward political
reform in a positive way as more mainlanders learn how Taiwanese
enjoy both political freedom and economic prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>STRENGTHENING DETERRENCE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring China from taking military action against Taiwan will
be a major test of American leadership in Asia. Since 1979, three
American Presidents have provided the leadership necessary to
protect U.S. interests in cross-straits relations. That China
now feels emboldened to threaten military action against Taiwan
indicates that it senses political weakness in Washington. This
is understandable because the Clinton Administration has failed
to make clear to Beijing that its military moves are unacceptable.
When China occupied Philippine-claimed reefs in the South China
Sea in February 1995 &#173;&#173; causing alarm throughout Southeast
Asia &#173;&#173; the Clinton Administration did not issue a statement
of &quot;concern&quot; until the following May. When China &quot;tested&quot;
six nuclear-capable missiles only 100 miles north of Taiwan last
July, the Clinton Administration again did nothing but issue a
mild statement of &quot;concern.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration may have contributed to the uncertainty
in another way. In the October 30, 1995, issue of <I>U.S. News
&amp; World Report</I>, an unnamed State Department official discounted
the possibility of direct U.S. military action if Taiwan was attacked,
saying that &quot;we would not be in a position to react with
force. We would not elect to do that I'm sure.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Others in
the Administration have coined the term &quot;deliberate ambiguity&quot;
to describe U.S. policy in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
Late last year, former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye
told Chinese officials that &quot;we don't know and you don't
know&quot; how the U.S. would respond to an attack against Taiwan.<sup>17</sup>
Is it any surprise that, only three months later, Beijing is readying
another series of large military exercises designed to intimidate
Taiwan? <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The United States cannot afford to continue this policy of timidity.
President Clinton and Congress must work together to rebuild confidence
in American leadership and strengthen deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. They should:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
Perhaps the most important message that Washington can send Beijing
is a forceful reaffirmation of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
It was the intent of Congress in 1979 that the U.S. maintain the
ability to ensure that Taiwan's defense needs were met and that
China understand America's interest in a peaceful resolution of
Taiwan's future. The elements of the TRA which convey this intent
are:<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
Sec. 2 (b): It is the policy of the United States &#173;&#173;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish
relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation
that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by
other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and
of grave concern to the United States;<BR>

<P>
(6) to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or
the social or the economic system, of the people of Taiwan. <BR>

<P>
Sec. 3 (a):... the United States will make available to Taiwan
such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability.<BR>

<P>
(c) The President is directed to inform the Congress promptly
of any threat to the security or the social or economic system
of the people of Taiwan and any danger to the interests of the
United States arising therefrom.<BR>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should remind China that these sections
of the TRA convey the clear intent of the American people. The
Administration also should make clear that the U.S. retains the
option to come to Taiwan's defense if it is attacked.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The TRA is a critical element in Washington's ability to deter
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. However, it is the Clinton Administration's
consistent weakness in the face of aggressive Chinese behavior
which threatens to undermine the value of the TRA. The Administration
should emphasize to Chinese officials that the TRA is a U.S. law
that guides American policy. To strengthen this message, early
in this legislative session, Congress should pass a joint resolution
reaffirming the TRA. Furthermore, it should insist that the Administration
fulfill its obligations under the Act, including its responsibility
to report to Congress any threats to the security of Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully. To bolster confidence
in Taipei, the Administration and Congress should acknowledge
Taiwan's emerging democracy. A former President or former Secretary
of State should be asked to lead the U.S. delegation to the inauguration
of the new ROC President. Taiwan's evolution toward democracy
belies the notion promoted by some Asians that democracy is not
suited to the Asian character.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At the same time, Washington should privately urge both Beijing
and Taipei to resume the cross-straits dialogue which began in
1991 but was suspended last year. Washington should make clear
to both sides that they bear the main responsibility in resolving
their differences. Nevertheless, Washington should stress regularly
to Beijing that, given Taiwan's democratic evolution, blatant
threats will prove increasingly counterproductive.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. The Clinton Administration should warn China privately
of the consequences that would follow direct military action against
Taiwan. The Administration should warn China that, depending on
the degree of damage it inflicts on Taiwan, it could expect sanctions
ranging from the ending of most-favored-nation trade status to
a total trade embargo with confiscation of all Chinese assets
in the U.S., and that the U.S. will not rule out using force to
defend Taiwan. China also should be told that these sanctions
would likely receive wide support in the U.S. Congress and that
the U.S. will lead a vigorous campaign to press other allies to
join them. Finally, China should be told that if it attacks Taiwan,
the U.S. will undertake a fundamental reevaluation of its relations
with China, in which policies of economic and political &quot;engagement&quot;
could give way to policies that focus on China's breach of the
peace. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan. The Clinton Administration
should order an aircraft carrier task group to be on station in
international waters near Taiwan during the period before and
after the March 23 election. This would demonstrate the U.S. commitment
to deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait and to maintaining
freedom of the seas.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act. It has been U.S. policy since 1979 to sell the ROC defensive
weapons sufficient to deter Chinese attack. As a response to China's
acquisition of the SU-27 from Russia in 1991, the Bush Administration
sold Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters in 1992. Should China's growing
military capabilities again threaten to tilt the military equilibrium
in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. should be prepared to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons to redress the balance. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's purchase of additional SU-27s and its intention to co-produce
many more of this aircraft are troubling in this regard. The F-16's
combat range and weapons already are inferior to those of the
SU-27. Washington should provide the ROC advanced armaments for
the F-16, such as the advanced medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAM missile,
giving ROC F-16s a technological margin that ensures deterrence.
In addition, the U.S. should allow U.S. shipbuilders to sell conventional
submarines to Taiwan. The U.S. is the only country willing to
supply this sorely needed defensive system to the ROC. Likewise,
in view of the PRC's missile tests near Taiwan last July, it is
essential that the U.S. offer Taiwan advanced versions of the
Patriot missile defense system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Should China attack Taiwan, the U.S. should be prepared &#173;&#173;
consistent with the TRA &#173;&#173; to resupply rapidly the ROC's
military weapons and munitions stocks. If China follows through
on threats to impose a naval blockade, the U.S. may have to supply
naval ordnance and replace ROC frigates that are lost. A naval
blockade also could lead to air battles, and the U.S. should be
prepared to advance delivery of F-16s and, more important, to
resupply combat missile stocks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by deploying
missile defenses. To deter China, the U.S. as soon as possible
should deploy not only theater missile defenses in Asia, but also
a national missile defense system to protect Americans. China's
willingness to use short-range nuclear-capable missiles to terrorize
countries in Asia was demonstrated by its missile tests 100 miles
north of Taiwan last July. Since then, Chinese officials reportedly
have told former Assistant Secretary Charles Freeman that China
may use conventionally armed missiles to terrorize Taiwan. Another
official stated that U.S. leaders &quot;care more about Los Angeles
than they do about Taiwan.&quot; Freeman reportedly viewed this
statement as a thinly veiled Chinese threat to use nuclear missiles
against the U.S. if it intervened to help protect Taiwan. Thus,
it is essential that the U.S. accelerate development and deployment
of theater anti-missile systems like the Navy's Upper Tier and
the Army's THAAD missiles. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats also make imperative the deployment of a national
missile defense system to defend Americans. As it threatens Taiwan
with missile strikes, China also may threaten the U.S. with nuclear
blackmail in the future. China is building up its nuclear missile
arsenal to include mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles.
A national missile defense system must be deployed to counter
this threat.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats against Taiwan are designed primarily to intimidate
the people on the eve of their first direct presidential election.
But they also stand as a challenge to the United States. Since
the 1950s, successive American Presidents have met this challenge
by ensuring adequate deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. But by reacting
timidly to China's military provocations in 1995, and even suggesting
that the U.S. would not come to Taiwan's assistance if attacked,
the Clinton Administration is undermining deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should begin immediately to reverse
this record of weakness. It should take steps to ensure that China
understands that the United States will not tolerate an attack
on Taiwan. Congress and the President should reaffirm the Taiwan
Relations Act, which will reassure Taiwan and warn China of U.S.
resolve, while urging both Beijing and Taipei to seek a peaceful
solution to their differences. If Beijing persists in its threats,
Washington should be prepared to deploy U.S. naval forces to help
deter Chinese military action against Taiwan. In the worst case,
if China does attack, the U.S. should be prepared to resupply
ROC military forces. Washington also must not rule out using U.S.
forces in Asia to help defend Taiwan.<BR>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades ago, the federal government nationalized one of the most important natural resources in existence. If this resource had been oil, coal, lumber, or steel, the American people would have been outraged. Yet this resource -- the electromagnetic wireless spectrum -- was simply unknown to most Americans, so few knew or cared. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the seven decades the federal government has held and parceled out the spectrum, many important and highly innovative technologies have been derived from it: AM and FM radio, broadcast television, cellular telephony, and satellite-delivered television, to name just a few. But the grossly inefficient and highly bureaucratic system of federal spectrum management also has slowed the introduction of many of these technologies by prohibiting or discouraging competition in the use of this valuable resource. In addition, the holders of wireless spectrum licenses have been denied the freedom accorded other types of communications technologies. For example, radio and television licensees continue to be denied First Amendment protections equal to those of print technologies, such as newspapers and magazines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A comprehensive bill deregulating much of the telecommunications industry was passed recently by Congress and signed by President Clinton this February. But this new law focuses primarily on wireline industries and issues (such as telephony and cable television) and ignores many equally important issues within the wireless sector of the industry (including cellular, satellite, and television broadcasting).<sup>1</sup>  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) did manage to force a last-minute debate over a portion of the bill that would give away large portions of the spectrum to a broadcast industry making the transition from analog to digital television. Dole argued that this giveaway would constitute "a big, big corporate welfare project"<sup>2</sup> because it sacrificed as much as $70 billion in potential revenues at a time when Americans are being asked to tighten their belts to help balance the federal budget.<sup>3</sup>  While this provision was not changed, Senator Dole's efforts did force supporters of the bill to offer to hold hearings in the future on legislation to reverse this misguided policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the defective spectrum management system left unaddressed in this round of telecommunications reform is to be remedied, Congress must do more than simply pass legislation auctioning off the spectrum now set to be given away at no cost to the broadcast industry. While auctioning the broadcast spectrum is a crucial first step, effective spectrum reform legislation will require Congress to go much further and:
<p><ol>
<li><b> Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b> Current holders of spectrum should be granted an absolute property right in their current allocation, not just licenses to use the spectrum as regulators see fit. Giving industry this flexibility would result in more efficient and innovative use of the spectrum resource.
<p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), the two federal agencies responsible for managing the spectrum, should be required to allocate and auction off as much of the spectrum as possible. Congress should specify that any new spectrum property for which there is a competing claim, including spectrum recently set aside for the broadcast industry, must be sold in an auction process. This will guarantee more rapid deployment of the spectrum to new users who value it most highly.
<p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are accorded equally to all media.</b> Electronic media and technologies that utilize the wireless spectrum traditionally have been held to different standards under the First Amendment. This must change, especially as the lines between technologies begin to blur. There is no justification for treating speech that is transmitted electronically any differently from the printed word.
<p>
<li><b> Transfer all remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to the courts, private entities, and an independent body.</b> Once spectrum privatization is complete, there will be no need for continued oversight by either the FCC or the NTIA. Coordination problems can be handled by the courts, private industry coordination organizations, and a small administrative body if needed.
 </ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If Congress fails to improve the current telecommunications reform with comprehensive wireless reform, it will have failed to deregulate the entire industry. This means wireless technologies and industries will remain overregulated relative to wireline industry, and placed at a competitive disadvantage. The practical result of this distortion will be to blunt efficiency and entrepreneurship. The result: fewer new jobs and more costly and more limited services for the consumer.
<p>
<h4>WHAT IS "THE SPECTRUM," AND HOW IS IT MANAGED TODAY?</h4>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"The spectrum," as it is generally known, is made up of "radiated electromagnetic waves (radio waves) [which] permit the transmission and reception of information over a distance -- even through empty space -- without the use of wires."<sup>4</sup>  In essence, a collection of these waves, which vary in strength and frequency, can constitute a single channel along which distinct information can be transmitted. If much information is to be sent at once, a channel requires more spectrum space -- or "bandwidth" -- to be transmitted. For example, a broadcast video signal requires more bandwidth than a cellular voice signal. However, certain channels can be used to deliver many different types of signals, and also can be used by different parties in different geographical areas. For example, a television channel in Washington, D.C., can be reused in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other metropolitan areas. As spectrum experts Charles L. Jackson and Dale N. Hatfield note, "[T]he radio spectrum resource can be shared by many simultaneous users by taking advantage of its frequency, time and space dimensions."<sup>5</sup>  In other words, because the transmission distance for most spectrum frequencies is limited, the same channel can be used by different carriers in different locations if they are far enough apart. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain channels may even be used within the same region to deliver multiple types of signals simultaneously through a process known as "spectrum sharing" or "overlay."  Digital compression technologies facilitate this process by squeezing more space out of the same spectrum channel so that it may be used by more than one entity. Spectrum experts often speak of the "digitalization" of spectrum as a major breakthrough because it will expand significantly the number of spectrum uses and users as bandwidth becomes more abundant.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Older and less efficient analog transmission technologies still dominate much of the spectrum, however. Analog technologies utilize wave modulations that are susceptible to interference problems. Digitized transmission, on the other hand, breaks down waves into numbers and codes that can be encoded and decoded to transmit information. As this process becomes increasingly sophisticated, signals can be sent much more clearly, rapidly, and efficiently than analog signals.
<p>
<b>A Short History of Spectrum Management in the United States </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the early decades of this century, the wireless spectrum was left unregulated. As both public and private use of the spectrum grew, however, government officials became concerned about what has been labeled "chaos in the spectrum."  In other words, policymakers feared that unregulated use of this new and important resource would cause signal quality to deteriorate to a point where no one would be able to communicate effectively. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After numerous complaints from the U.S. Navy about such interference, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912. This granted the federal government the ability to allocate licenses among users for specific spectrum allocations. The entire process was geared to assuring military users the best parts of the spectrum, leaving private users with nearly useless channels. Things grew worse during World War I, when the Navy took control of the entire spectrum. Although the Navy was forced to relinquish control in 1919, the Department of Commerce retained licensing power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This licensing power was limited. For example, the Department of Commerce could not charge for use of a license or restrict use once a license was granted. Not surprisingly, spectrum users began applying for as much of the spectrum as they possibly could, knowing there was no cost associated with doing so. This led to genuine interference, or "chaos," problems within the spectrum, leading to demands by policymakers and industry officials for more legislative intervention. Economist Jora R. Minasian aptly noted in 1975 that this interference "was not due to any inherently particular technological characteristics of radio emissions, but to the fact that rights to use of the frequency spectrum, rights of radiation, were ill-defined."<sup>7</sup>  Sixteen years before Minasian wrote these words, Nobel economist Ronald H. Coase pointed to the same problem in a famous 1959 article on the Federal Communications Commission. 
<blockquote><p>
	 [T]he real cause of trouble was that no property rights were created in these scarce frequencies. A private-enterprise system cannot function properly unless property rights are created in resources, and, when this is done, someone wishing to use a resource has to pay the owner to obtain it. Chaos disappears; and so does the government except that a legal system to define property rights and to arbitrate disputes is, of course, necessary. But there is certainly no need for the kind of regulation which we now find in the American radio and television industry.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Professor Thomas Hazlett of the University of California-Davis notes that the legitimate chaos evident during the 1921-1923 period, when calls for government control were multiplying, "was, in essence, an outcome of government control: over 500 broadcasters were... bunched up all at the same point on the spectrum to which they had been directed by the Commerce Department, and operations were not always perfectly synchronized."<sup>9</sup>  Minasian agrees: "No attempts were made prior to May, 1923, to assign a separate channel to each station, or to provide geographic separation of the stations operating on the same channels, or to provide mutually exclusive times of operation. The wave lengths were assigned to all in a group.... This policy, coupled with a liberal policy for issuing licenses to amateurs, resulted in interference.... "<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Radio Act of 1912 and the administrative decisions that flowed from it had two main effects. First, it encouraged military use of the spectrum at the expense of private broadcasters, leaving them little room to operate effectively. Second, it failed to create a private marketplace in spectrum rights that could have solved the ensuing interference and chaos problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these impediments, property rights in the spectrum were developing. Professor Hazlett explains that while federal regulators, legislators, and industry officials worked together to pre-empt the institution of a property rights regime, some judges were taking steps to establish property rights. As an illustration, Hazlett points out that in one 1926 court case, <I>Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves Broadcasting Station</I>, "the classic interference problem was encountered, litigated, and overcome, using no more than existing common-law precedent."<sup>11</sup>  In this case, Judge Francis S. Wilson adjudicated a dispute between two broadcasters who faced an interference dilemma. Judge Wilson argued that once an entity had established a presence in a given allocation within the spectrum that user had a <I>de facto</I> property right in that allocation. By establishing this common law precedent to protect property rights in the spectrum, the decision effectively rendered the interference problem moot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some immediately recognized the power of this precedent-setting decision and welcomed it. Others, in the industry and in government, feared that it meant they would not be guaranteed a comfortable, ologopolistic market setting (that is, a non-competitive market in which both the regulator and the regulated entities were satisfied with control of entry and comfortable market share, respectively).<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hazlett suggests this was not an accident. During Herbert Hoover's tenure as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s, large incumbent broadcasters worked with Hoover to establish a "public interest" paradigm of federal regulation and control of the spectrum to replace the emerging common law, property rights-based paradigm. Basically, Hoover and the large broadcasters argued publicly that, despite the clear failings of past legislative efforts and the potential property rights solution developing in the courts at the time, only federal regulation of the spectrum could eliminate the chaos that existed during this period.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This pressure eventually led to the adoption of the Radio Act of 1927, giving the federal government complete operating control over and ownership of the spectrum. Under the 1927 Act, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was established and given the power to grant three-year licenses in exchange for certain public service requirements. Licenses would be granted (and revoked) in accordance with "the public interest, convenience, or necessity."  No more specific definition of what constituted "the public interest" was given.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Hazlett notes, the creation of the FRC and the public interest paradigm was the answer to broadcasters' prayers: "[I]t immediately grandfathered rights for major broadcasters, while eliminating marginal competitors and all new entry."<sup>13</sup>  Furthermore, Hazlett notes that the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> argued at the time what should have been evident to everyone: "The point seems clear that the Federal Radio Commission has interpreted the concept of public interest so as to favor in actual practice one particular group. While talking in terms of the 'public interest, convenience, and necessity' the commission actually chose to further the ends of the commercial broadcasters."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, little has changed since the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> printed these words in 1935. When the Federal Communications Commission was formed in 1934, the FRC was folded into the FCC along with its public interest powers.<sup>15</sup>  Throughout the years, the agency has developed highly haphazard, inflexible, and inefficient techniques to manage the spectrum resource.
<p><b>The Spectrum Scarcity and Interference Myths</b><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before discussing the pitfalls of the current regulatory approach, it is important to debunk the myths used to justify the disastrous spectrum management techniques employed by the FCC since its inception. These myths are (1) that the spectrum is scarce and (2) that private ownership would create interference problems. Both arguments are fatally flawed.
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Scarcity Myth.</b> The scarcity of the spectrum is irrelevant and cannot serve as a credible basis for federal ownership and management.<sup>16</sup>  As Coase has explained: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]t is a commonplace of economics that almost all resources used in the economic system (and not simply radio and television frequencies) are limited in amount and scarce, in that people would like to use more than exists. Land, labor, and capital are all scarce, but this, of itself, does not call for government regulation. It is true that some mechanism has to be employed to decide who, out of the many claimants, should be allowed to use the scarce resource. But the way this is usually done in the American economic system is to employ the price mechanism, and this allocates resources to users without the need for government regulation.<sup>17</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The scarcity rationale is even more irrelevant today as digital technologies move America into an age of "boundless bandwidth" and "spectrum surplus," as technology visionary George Gilder is fond of saying.<sup>18</sup>  "Why have... gloomy, scarcity-based forecasts proved so wrong?"  asks Gilder."  Because in each case, advances in microchip design tools, integration of more transistors on single chips, improved design of radio frequency systems and new antenna technology led to the creation of better systems at higher frequencies. "<sup>19</sup> Lawrence Gasman, president of Communications Industry Researchers and author of <I>Telecompetition</I>, agrees: "With lower-power communications, data compression, and practical communications at high frequencies, spectrum may still be scarce, but it is not as scarce as it once was, and it is becoming less scarce all the time."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Interference Myth.</b> The interference justification for federal spectrum management is equally flawed. As Hazlett cogently points out:
<blockquote><p>
	Economists, political scientists, and lawyers generally agree that the interference rationale for licensure in "the public interest" is nonsensical. The interference problem is widely recognized as one of defining separate frequency "properties"; it is logically unconnected to the issue of who is to harvest those frequencies. To confuse the definition of spectrum rights with the assignment of spectrum rights is to believe that, to keep intruders out of (private) backyards, the government must own (or allocate) all the houses.<sup>21</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas G. Krattenmaker and Lucas A. Powe, authors of <I>Regulating Broadcast Programming</I>, concur: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]nterference, like scarcity... is a bogeyman. All resources are subject to interference in the sense that their value will decline if everyone attempts to use them at once. This is why governments recognize property rights (which include the right to exclude others from using) in resources exchanged through the marketplace. Interference will... destroy the value of any resource, but usually the government does not choose to displace the market to prevent interference. Two people cannot comfortably sit at the same time in the same desk chair. Yet this fact has not led government to parcel out the right to sit in a chair. Rather, ownership of the chair is taken to confer authority to exclude others from sitting in it, no matter how eager they may be to do so.<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To illustrate the absurdity of both the scarcity and interference rationales for asymmetrical regulation of the broadcast industry, the authors further note: 
<p><blockquote>
	 It was as though Congress, having realized that paper is scarce and that "interference" occurs when two or more people write simultaneously on the same sheet of paper, had declared that the government owned all the paper in the United States. A Federal Paper Commission would then be necessary to decide how much paper would be available for (say) books and how much for (say) wallpaper. The Commission would further choose who was permitted to engage in book publishing.<sup>23</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Recent court and FCC decisions support these sentiments. In the 1986 case <I>Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC</I>,<sup>24</sup> Judge Robert Bork, writing for a majority of the D.C. Circuit Court, argued that spectrum scarcity was a "universal fact" of economics and therefore could not serve as a valid basis for lesser First Amendment treatment of broadcasting. Likewise, in the FCC's 1987 <I>Syracuse Peace Council</I><sup>25</sup> decision revoking the Fairness Doctrine, the agency argued that when "analyzing the appropriate First Amendment standard to be applied to the electronic press, the concept of scarcity . .. .. is irrelevant."<sup>26</sup>  The Commission went on to note that "We believe the function of the electronic press in a free society is identical to that of the printed press and that, therefore, the constitutional analysis of government control of content should be no different."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the scarcity rationale nor the interference rationale for federal spectrum management can be used credibly to support the continued socialization of spectrum or its special regulatory treatment.
<p>
<b>"Zoning" Delays Introduction of New Technologies </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the fact that neither scarcity nor interference can serve as legitimate justification for federal spectrum ownership, the FCC continues to employ the same outmoded spectrum management techniques it has used for the past seven decades. As use of the spectrum grew and new technologies developed, the FCC began to partition the spectrum into various blocks called allocations. Within each spectrum allocation, the FCC specifies how that particular block of spectrum may be utilized. FM radio, for example, is allocated a block of spectrum between 88 mhz and 108 mhz, and the commercial paging block is found between 931 mhz and 932 mhz. Broadcast television, satellite dish television, and cellular telephony all have similar block allocation arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within each of these block allocations, the FCC then subdivides the allocation geographically. These subdivisions, known as allotments, are important because they enable spectrum to be reused in many different geographic areas. After the agency divides the spectrum into allocations and then subdivides it into geographic allotments, it parcels out specific spectrum assignments in the form of spectrum licenses. These licenses provide a specific legal right to use the spectrum, but only for the listed use. In other words, a television broadcaster is licensed only to broadcast video programming; it cannot offer cellular, paging, or other types of communications services even though there may be a large potential market for these services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, this system has proven extraordinarily inefficient and time-consuming. As the Congressional Budget Office notes:
<blockquote><p>
	Block allocations take a long time to establish, and once established are difficult to change. Difficulty in responding to changes in technologies and consumer preferences can leave parts of the spectrum underused. In some instances, a limited allocation of spectrum gives license holders control over prices and accompanying high profits or rents. Accordingly, the radio spectrum is not distributed among different users in an economically efficient way. Under the block allocation system there is no smooth path that permits spectrum to move easily from lower to higher value services.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This parceling system has not changed fundamentally since the FCC began managing the spectrum in the 1920s. In essence, the FCC is "zoning" the spectrum, to borrow the terminology of real estate land management. Those firms lucky enough to receive a license must be content with a single use; innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Worse yet, the assignment and licensing process is prone to the same criticisms economists level against all government licensing schemes. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation working group recently found, "Across-the-board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized by procrastination, equivocation, and seemingly endless delay. Unnecessary delay, ultimately found to be in the public interest, imposes enormous costs on the industry and the national economy."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>30</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, such costly delays have been the norm, since licenses have been doled out to the industry through "comparative hearings" in which applicants for a license must demonstrate their worthiness to FCC bureaucrats. "Comparative hearings can be long, burdensome, and inflexible. Years can elapse as lawyers present the merits of each side," notes Citizens for a Sound Economy Vice President James Gattuso. 
<blockquote><p>
	Perhaps worse, even after this costly procedure [estimated to cost about $130,000 for the applicant and another $5,000 for the FCC<sup>32</sup>], it is often difficult or impossible for the Commission to determine which applicant will best serve the "public interest."  The Commission may find itself not only trying to decide which applicant is most sincere in its expressed desire to serve the public, and which has the financial resources to do so, but also may have to pass judgment on the applicant's entire business plan to determine it would meet the needs of consumers.<sup>33</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the Commission must engage in <I>de facto</I> industrial policy to distribute licenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem was not alleviated when Congress authorized the FCC in the 1980s to begin using lotteries instead of comparative hearings to distribute licenses. Thought to be a cheaper and more rapid way to expedite licenses to the industry, lotteries simply awarded them randomly to a lucky few among the thousands of applicants. In fact, note Evan R. Kwerel and John R. Williams at the FCC's Office of Policy and Plans, "Because the cost of applying was low and the licenses were quite valuable, large numbers of applicants chose to enter the FCC lotteries. For example, there were nearly 400,000 applications for cellular licenses -- so many that the shelves broke at the FCC processing center in Gettysburg."<sup>34</sup>  Furthermore, as noted by Jonathan Blake, a partner at Covington & Burling and former President of the Federal Communications Bar Association, "because lotteries were every person's chance for a big payoff and winners routinely sold their licenses as soon as possible to real operators, it was soon observed that lotteries led to private auctions. In turn, this led to the question: why shouldn't the government conduct the auctions?"<sup>35</sup>
<p>
<b>The Auction Alternative Becomes Reality in the 1990s</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the FCC and Congress began to realize that the problems associated with comparative hearings and lotteries demanded a solution. In 1993, Congress finally gave the FCC authority to auction certain commercial uses of the spectrum, although certain types of spectrum were excluded, most notably broadcast spectrum. In general, auctions present a less costly and more efficient allocation mechanism. 
<ul><p>
<li> As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 1992, "Compared with other methods of assignment... auctions are faster, less costly to society, produce more federal revenues, and are more likely to place licenses in the hands of the applicants who value them most."<sup>36</sup> 
<p>
<li>As Peter C. Cramton of the University of Maryland notes, "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative hearings."<sup>37</sup> 
<p>
<li>The superiority of auctioning over alternative allocation mechanisms is perhaps best described in the most recent <I>Economic Report of the President</I>: "When the government does not auction off but simply assigns spectrum licenses for free, it is giving away public resources worth billions of dollars. But more than revenue is at stake. Auctions can help promote economic efficiency, by ensuring that spectrum is deployed in the highest-return uses, including emerging growth industries that entail innovative technologies and services."<sup>38</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As of early February 1996, spectrum auctions have brought in over $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury. As a recent headline in <I>The New York Times</I> says, "The Sky Seems to Be the Limit."<sup>39</sup>  More important, however, hundreds of spectrum properties have been assigned much more rapidly than would have been possible using comparative hearings or lotteries.
<p>
<b>The Resistance to Auctions </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the enormous success of auctions, Congress continues to allow certain spectrum uses to escape the auction process. Specifically, due to an exemption built into the original 1993 auctioning authority, services that do not collect "compensation from subscribers," such as broadcasting, are exempted.<sup>40</sup>  The broadcast industry, which has lobbied Congress intensely to win and keep this provision, does not want auctions to be applied uniformly to all new uses of spectrum because it would force broadcasters to pay for additional spectrum licenses they are set to receive free of charge from the FCC in the near future as part of a plan put in place a few years ago by the Commission. 
<P>
<b>The Taxpayer Cost of Limits on Auctions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The value of the spectrum to be given away has been estimated by the FCC to be somewhere between $10 billion to $70 billion. Yet the recently passed Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not alter this plan by demanding auctions. Instead of making tens of billions available for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief through auction of this spectrum, Congress will force Americans to shell out more of their own money to pay down the national debt while broadcasters receive a free handout of spectrum assets. Worse yet, by giving additional spectrum away to broadcasters, Congress will not equalize the treatment of communications providers; in practice, it will create a highly uneven telecommunications playing field.<sup>41</sup>  The unfairness of this giveaway is summarized by <I>Los Angeles Times</I> columnist Michael Schrage: "Do we give farmers free farmland when they want to grow new kinds of crops?  So why should the FCC give spectrum to broadcasters who want to grow new business?"<sup>42</sup>  Schrage argues it would be "like giving the Baby Bells and the cable companies `free' fiber optics as they rewire America."<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although this blatant example of corporate welfare became an issue during the waning days of the battle over the comprehensive telecom bill early this year, it did not prevent the legislation's eventual passage, although Senate Majority Leader Dole did hold out for promises of hearings and introduction of a bill this year to rectify this situation.
<P>
<b>Why Auctions Alone Are Not Enough</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is important to note that auctions alone cannot solve the "zoning" problem discussed above. As Hazlett notes, "while auctions can distribute licenses in a relatively low-cost manner, they do nothing to distribute spectrum more efficiently. The federal government still micromanages markets, protecting the interests of incumbent licensees and doling out entry rights to new players only after years of frustration and struggle."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, while it was wise of Congress and the FCC to move forward with auctions in 1993, Congress should not have allowed the FCC to limit the use of auctioned spectrum merely to personal communications services (PCS) uses. Instead, winning bidders should have been given the right to use purchased spectrum however they wished. Likewise, if Congress decides to reverse its current position and go forward with auctions of additional broadcast spectrum licenses, it should not require the FCC to box winning bidders into providing certain types of digital broadcast programming that may be technologically irrelevant in a few years. Achieving maximum efficient use of the spectrum resource means granting full flexibility in use to winning bidders -- in fact, to all spectrum users.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sum, the FCC should not be selling licenses at all. It should be selling property rights. Licenses traditionally have restricted use, while property rights would define boundaries within which owners could use their allocations in any way they thought economically efficient and profitable. Moreover, a regime of auctions and property rights could encourage a number of alternative uses for many spectrum licenses, unlike the current system, which is too rigid to allow innovative alternatives to develop freely. As Coase explained in 1959:
<blockquote><P>
	Quite apart from the misallocations which are the result of political pressures, an administrative agency which attempts to perform the function normally carried out by the pricing mechanism operates under two handicaps. First of all, it lacks the precise monetary measure of benefit and cost provided by the market. Second, it cannot, by the nature of things, be in possession of all the relevant information possessed by the managers of every business which uses or might use radio frequencies, to say nothing of the preferences of consumers for the various goods and services in the production of which radio frequencies could be used.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-six years later, Peter Pitsch, an adjunct fellow at the <a href="/pff">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a> and former chief of staff at the FCC, testified before Congress that this was still the case: "[T]he FCC like other central planners lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. [D]etermining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly beyond the abilities of the administrative process."<sup>46</sup>  In addition, Pitsch notes that this problem has grown worse with time since, "In the case of spectrum, the information required to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development has created a raft of new uses for wireless communications and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed."<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<h4>SIDE EFFECTS OF FEDERAL SPECTRUM MISMANAGEMENT: THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" STANDARD AND CONTENT REGULATION</h4>
<hr> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic costs associated with federal spectrum mismanagement are high. Equally as damaging, however, is the degree to which federal regulators have used their authority to intrude on licensees' ability to operate freely once they have received their allocations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As mentioned earlier, when the Radio Act of 1927 became law, federal regulators were given the power to issue licenses if they found it was in the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."  This meant that regulators were given broad discretion when determining who would receive a license and how they could use that license. Unfortunately, the term "public interest" has never been clearly defined. As Coase noted over 35 years ago, "The phrase... lacks any definite meaning. Furthermore, the many inconsistencies in Commission decisions have made it impossible for the phrase to acquire a definite meaning in the process of regulation."<sup>48</sup>  More recently, critics have pointed out that regulation in the "public interest" has come to mean whatever regulators want it to mean at a given time.<sup>49</sup>  Hence, the "public interest" or "public trustee" model of regulation that sprang up around broadcasting gave regulators the ability to exert unusual influence and require that special demands be met as a condition of license renewal.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, using the public interest rationale as a defense, in 1949 the FCC instituted the inappropriately named fairness doctrine. This doctrine required radio and television broadcasters to "afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of public importance."<sup>51</sup>  Instead of promoting the discussion of conflicting views and free speech in general, however, the fairness doctrine stifled it. In fact, over the span of its 40-year existence, it has been used as a tool of blatant political intimidation and influence backed by the threat of license revocation for failure to comply with the political whims of the day.<sup>52</sup>  The Reagan Administration FCC repealed the doctrine in 1987, citing First Amendment concerns and the fact that program diversity (informational, educational, religious, and entertainment fare) had increased steadily over time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the public trustee model has allowed the FCC both to demand that broadcasters restrict the amount of commercial airtime during children's viewing hours and to require that they air greater amounts of children's programming. Congress made this worse when it passed the Children's Television Act of 1990, which encouraged the FCC to expand regulations demanding a certain minimum number of hours of children's programming.<sup>53</sup>  Despite the noble intentions of policymakers and regulators intent on improving broadcast quality, these efforts have proven futile, even counterproductive. Because the public trustee social compact between broadcasters and regulators is kept intact by noble-minded but ineffective rules, industry competition is discouraged. If Congress continues to be content with half-hearted efforts to squeeze the most out of this regulatory arrangement, broadcast quality will never improve substantially. It is only greater competition within the field of video programming, not more restrictive social compacts and regulations, that can ensure improvement in the overall quality of broadcast fare over time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Making a Mockery of the First Amendment.</b> Even worse, such rules create an unfortunate schism within communication jurisprudence by ignoring First Amendment protections. Although most government attempts to impose prior restraints or requirements on speech constitute a <I>prima facie</I> violation of the First Amendment's mandate that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"<I>54</I> holders of spectrum allocations do not enjoy similar speech protections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Basically, once federal regulators rejected property rights and chose instead the public interest paradigm, they found it easier to regulate the electronic press (such as television and radio) in ways they could not regulate the print press (such as newspapers, magazines, and newsletters). As Krattenmaker and Powe argue, "by adopting public ownership of the spectrum and administrative control over its uses, Congress chose a legal regime for broadcasting that differs radically from the law that governs every other mass communications medium in the United States. Congress thus put its imprimatur on the twin myths that scarcity and interference are phenomena unique to broadcasting and that scarcity and interference necessitate administrative control of the quality of broadcasts."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequently, although the print press traditionally has been accorded strict First Amendment protection from government efforts to manipulate speech and content, the electronic press has been accorded only secondary rights.<sup>56</sup>  First Amendment scholar Timothy Dyk notes that "it is reasonably clear that none of the programming rules or policies [applied to broadcasters] would be constitutional if applied to the print press."<sup>57</sup>  Timothy Dyk points to a number of cases that have invalidated legislative attempts to demand access to print media.<sup>58</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, Krattenmaker and Powe contend that content regulations such as the fairness doctrine, the Children's Television Act of 1990, and other similar rules should be repealed because "no proffered distinction for treating broadcasting differently from print justifies a different regulatory regime. Accordingly, all content regulation of broadcasting that could not be similarly applied to print or other mass communications media properly ought to be regarded as impermissible under the First Amendment."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regulators like to pretend they do not violate First Amendment standards. They argue that they are only operating within their statutorily defined powers to issue and renew spectrum licenses under the public interest standard they have sworn to uphold. Yet the license renewal process itself gives the government the ability to censor by threatening license revocation or fines. Although this is rare, it has occurred. It is the equivalent of regulatory extortion and flies in the face of traditional First Amendment thinking, because the government has no more right to demand certain types of speech than it has to restrict them.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A final and equally unacceptable justification for differential First Amendment treatment of broadcasters is that an individual or firm must obtain a license from the FCC before starting a broadcast station, whereas this is not the case with newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and the like. Yet, as mentioned above, licensing itself represented the first unjustifiable intervention by government into this arena and therefore cannot be used credibly to justify further mischief by federal regulators. If a property rights regime had been allowed to develop, no differential treatment would be allowed by the courts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, even if one accepts that there might be some role for the government in licensing spectrum, it does not follow that government should regulate its use as it now does. As noted legal commentator and newspaper columnist Bruce Fein says, "A lawyer needs a license to practice law, yet the government does not force a lawyer to spend equal time defending clients of opposite views. It is patently absurd to suggest that a license requirement in an industry is enough to allow the taking away of First Amendment rights."<sup>61</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hence, it is only the continuing belief in the scarcity rationale of federal spectrum management that continues to prop up this unconstitutional house of cards. If this rationale were rejected by the courts, all content regulations would likely fall as well. Although the scarcity rationale has been cited numerous times by the courts and Congress to justify content regulation of electronic media,<sup>62</sup> given the combination of its technological irrelevance and the recognition by the courts and many academics that it fails to justify broadcasting's unique treatment, it obviously no longer serves to justify content regulation.<sup>63</sup>
<p>
<h4>FOUR STEPS TO A FREE MARKET IN SPECTRUM</h4>
<hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If policymakers want to bring an end to this disastrous system of spectrum management, piecemeal reforms will not help. Only radical reform can succeed. The four key components of comprehensive and revolutionary spectrum reform are as follows:
<ol><p>
<li><b>Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b>
<blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current holders of spectrum should be granted full flexibility to provide whatever type of service they want, however they want, whenever they want to consumers. There is no justification for continuing the rigid zoning restrictions on spectrum use that have evolved through seven decades of bureaucratic mismanagement. Americans are being denied access to countless innovative goods and services simply because spectrum holders have no incentive or ability to offer them. Although the opportunity costs associated with such rigid regulations are unquantifiable, it is reasonable to assume the U.S. economy is losing billions of dollars of economic activity. Providing full spectrum flexibility therefore will guarantee an increase in jobs, exports, and overall economic output. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, as long as spectrum remains a quasi-socialized public resource, it cannot be allocated efficiently or put to the best possible use. In essence, government cannot manage something as complex as the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently because bureaucratic processes are not suited to the task. What is needed, beyond flexibility in use, is a proven allocation mechanism that allows more effective utilization of the spectrum resource. A property right in the spectrum is the answer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to granting full flexibility in use, Congress could privatize the wireless spectrum by giving current holders a property right in their allocation. This means spectrum holders would no longer lease their allocation from the federal government, but instead would own it outright -- able to use it (or sell it) as they see fit. This also means that all arbitrary federal regulatory oversight of the spectrum would end. Federal regulators would be responsible only for enforcing technical trespass violations and disputes that arose between adjoining holders of spectrum.<sup>64</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Auctions should be applied across the board to every spectrum use for which there is a mutually exclusive claim or that has not yet been allocated by the government. Congress should create the following three-step process by which spectrum can be allocated more effectively and auctioned off to move toward a property rights regime:
<p><blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 1: Efficiently assign and allocate underutilized spectrum.</b> Currently, much of the spectrum managed by the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration is undistributed or underutilized.<sup>65</sup>  Large and valuable parcels that could be deployed for private sector use by the FCC, and especially by the NTIA, are lying dormant or are hoarded by less efficient users. Congress should demand that unallocated private-sector spectrum and underutilized public spectrum be allocated immediately. In essence, any time a party files for claim to such spectrum, that party should be granted the right to use it as it sees fit. However, when competing claims for the same spectrum allocation exist, or when the public sector refuses to give up spectrum, the following two steps will be necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 2: Mandate that auctions be used where any competing claim for spectrum exists.</b> For all potential uses of spectrum for which there are competing claims, auctions should be utilized to allocate the spectrum. Firms would file plans of their bidding proposals with the FCC and then post bonds proving they have enough capital to bid credibly for the given allocation. The Commission also could establish competitive bidding rules (as it did in past PCS auctions) to ensure that bidding collusion does not take place. These auctions would not be limited to one-time events, but would be ongoing as spectrum claims developed and multiplied.<sup>66</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This policy should be employed for all new mutually exclusive claims for use of a particular spectrum allocation. This includes the rights to the second six-megahertz digital channel that broadcasters have requested. Although pressure from broadcaster groups will make it difficult politically to support such an auction, it would be fundamentally unfair for Congress to give such valuable property away while others are forced to compete for their desired spectrum in the open market. In addition, once broadcasters have been given complete operating flexibility, they can use their current six-megahertz allocation to convert to digital television however and whenever they feel it is appropriate. Furthermore, broadcasters and others can borrow against the value of their spectrum to raise funds to purchase any new spectrum they feel is needed to do business. Finally, the auction of this spectrum should not be restricted to any specific type of use, whether it be broadcasting or even more sophisticated digital types of transmission. Congress should make it clear to the FCC that the spectrum being auctioned can be used for whatever purpose buyers desire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 3: Provide incentives for the public sector to release additional spectrum.</b> Most important, Congress must disgorge much more spectrum from the public sector. One way to facilitate this process without demanding full knowledge of what they are doing with their spectrum is to create a simple incentive mechanism that would give agencies holding the spectrum a cut of the auction proceeds. For example, if the Department of Defense knew that it had been warehousing sizable portions of spectrum that it could afford to release, it might do so voluntarily if it knew it would receive, say, 15 to 25 percent of the auction proceeds. Beyond such incentives, Congress may find it necessary to demand that certain blocks of public spectrum be released immediately to the FCC for private auction, just as it was for previous PCS auctions.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are provided equally to all media.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For over six decades, unconstrained spectrum regulation in the name of the "public interest" has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily is in the public interest rarely is truly in the best interests of consumers. The reason is simple: Regulators, not consumers, are making the decision. Congress should scrap this fraudulent public interest paradigm entirely. If, however, lawmakers insist on continuing to rely on public interest FCC oversight, they should define the standard clearly in law. The new definition should focus on three specific criteria:
<p><blockquote><ul>
<li> The maximization of consumer welfare via the broadening of the general scope of individual decision-making within telecommunications markets;
<p>
<li>The utilization of market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever possible; and
<p>
<li> The full protection of First Amendment rights and equal First Amendment treatment of all communications media, whether print or electronic.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This "consumer welfare" standard would serve the interests of all Americans. It would guarantee that the federal bureaucracy is not in a position to manipulate and coerce spectrum holders into doing things they do not wish to. On the other hand, it would ensure that no spectrum holder is able to capture the regulatory apparatus and use it to exclude competitors.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Transfer remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to an independent body. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once the previous steps have been taken, the need for spectrum oversight by the FCC or the NTIA will be minimized. Because the NTIA soon may be abolished, all spectrum management should be removed from it immediately. Once property rights are established, remaining spectrum responsibilities (enforcement of technical trespass or nuisance violations) could be handled just as effectively by a smaller Spectrum Coordination Council or Board. The Board or Council would sit in the executive branch and be made up of no more than approximately 50 spectrum engineers, economists, and lawyers. The courts would play an important role in the adjudication of spectrum disputes, and private industry groups would be responsible for a large portion of self-regulation, as they are now. Finally, the Board or Council would represent American interests in international meetings or disputes over spectrum allocations so that all remaining authority over such global issues can be transferred from the Department of State.
<p></ol>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4><hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades of federal spectrum ownership and management have met with predictable failure. While virtually all other resources have been left to private owners to manage in America's free enterprise system, spectrum has remained a quasi-socialized resource. The result: Other resources have been deployed and utilized far more efficiently and effectively while spectrum innovation and entrepreneurialism continue to be held captive by federal regulation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spectrum socialism should end -- and must end -- if the United States hopes to remain on the cutting edge of wireless innovation. Policymakers must look beyond their myopic focus on older wireline industries and find new ways to encourage entrepreneurship in the wireless arena. Property rights in spectrum will guarantee such a result, since only by granting spectrum holders full flexibility and ownership in their allocation can policymakers expect to witness such a dramatic transformation. Unleashing the spectrum is the only way to ensure that this transformation is successful and the communications revolution is complete.

<li>    This should not be surprising. "Responsible for the continued provision and improvement of service, [the regulatory commission] comes increasingly and understandably to identify the interest of the public with that of the existing companies on whom it must rely to deliver goods."  Therefore, "When a commission is responsible for the performance of an industry, it is under never completely escapable pressure to protect the health of the companies it regulates, to assure a desirable performance by relying on those monopolistic chosen instruments and its own controls rather than on the unplanned and unplannable forces of competition."  See Alfred E. Kahn, <I>The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions</I> (Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 1971), p. 46.<p>
<li>    Hazlett, "The Rationality of U.S. Regulation of the Broadcast Spectrum," p. 154.<p>
<li>    Quoted in <I>ibid.</I>, pp. 157-158.<p>
<li>    Many decades later, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) assumed responsibility for the management and allocation of all spectrum utilized by the federal government.<p>
<li>    The scarcity rationale was developed primarily through a series of court cases and FCC decisions over the past six decades. Most notably in <I>NBC v. United States</I>, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), <I>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</I>, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), and <I>CBS v. FCC</I>, 453 U.S. 367 (1981), the Supreme Court argued that scarcity made broadcasting a unique business and that this demanded special treatment to guarantee "the public interest" would be served. Yet the courts also noted similar restrictions on the print medium would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. See <I>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</I>, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). Likewise, recent court cases have held that cable television must be accorded more strict First Amendment protections than broadcast, even though cable is also an electronic medium. See <I>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 567 F. 2d 9 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <I>Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC</I>, (8th Cir. 1978); <I>Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 768 F. 2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1985). These cases all were heard by lower courts, however, as the Supreme Court has refused continually to hear such cases. This is due most likely to the fact that the Court realizes technological innovation continues to obliterate traditional media boundaries, making court decisions based on the scarcity rationale increasingly confusing and unjustifiable.<p>

<li>    This does not mean, however, that broadcasters put up a serious fight to end the public trustee paradigm. In fact, on one hand they speak of its importance to ensure that viable competitors are kept out of their market, while on the other they cite its intrusiveness as an excuse to produce mediocre programming. As Henry Geller, fellow at the Markle Foundation, notes, "A broadcaster loves to be considered a public interest figure. Broadcasters generally want the economic benefits of being a public fiduciary without having to meet the burden of adhering to public interest content regulation."

<li>    While granting property rights may seem like nothing more than a natural extension of providing full flexibility in use, an important difference exists. Full flexibility could be granted to spectrum users while they continue to lease their allocation from the federal government.

Therefore, bureaucratic meddling could remain a serious problem, especially with regard to content regulation.<p>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere. With both eyes focused firmly on domestic U.S. politics, the Administration has dropped trade expansion from its Latin American policy agenda while adopting a more aggressive stance not only against illegal immigration from Mexico, but against drug trafficking in the Americas.<sup>1</sup>  However, the Administration is not alone in its retreat from free trade. In Congress, some longtime free traders from both parties are also backpedaling from trade expansion and from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Populist proponents of protectionism have tapped into voter anxieties about the health of the U.S. economy and job security by misrepresenting NAFTA as the cause of the Mexican peso crisis, declining manufacturing wages in the U.S., rising illegal immigration from Mexico, and increased drug trafficking.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At one level, the Clinton Administration appears to understand the importance of foreign trade to the U.S. economy. The President's foreign policy team continues to extol the importance of free trade to America's economic interests. For example, Richard Brown, the White House coordinator for the Summit of the Americas, claims that the Administration has not retreated from the goal of completing negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Brown also insists that the President has not given up on obtaining fast-track negotiating authority to include Chile in NAFTA<sup>2</sup>.  In practice, however, free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton Administration. During the past year, President Clinton has:
<ul><P>
<li>Reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996. The delay in Chile's admission to NAFTA has damaged America's credibility and leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<li>Violated key provisions of NAFTA. For example, the Administration postponed indefinitely the implementation of provisions to permit the circulation of Mexican trucks in U.S. border states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dropping the ball on trade with Latin America is merely part of a larger problem with the President's Latin American policy. The Clinton Administration has never possessed a coherent vision of America's economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1993, bowing to pressure from American unions and environmental activist groups, the President delayed NAFTA's approval for a year while labor and environmental side agreements were imposed on Mexico and Canada. The Administration's invasion of Haiti in 1994 and secret immigration agreement with Cuba in 1995 likewise were undertaken in response to domestic political pressures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The damage is done. The task for American policymakers now is to correct the current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible. U.S. relations with Mexico must be repaired, NAFTA must be strengthened, and America must regain its dominant role in the process of hemispheric trade liberalization. To achieve these policy goals, the U.S. government should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Comply with NAFTA.</b>The U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA obligations on schedule. By cheating on NAFTA, the Clinton Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future.
<p>
<li><B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico. </B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico. These include such issues as currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's foreign debt, immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
<li><B>Expand NAFTA.</B> Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. NAFTA must grow to remain vibrant and alive. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile and other countries would maintain the momentum for expanding free trade in the Americas and beyond, including at a later time Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
<li><B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </B>The creation of a currency board in Mexico would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA.
<p>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development.
<P>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States.
</ul><p>
<b>THE TRUTH ABOUT NAFTA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994, Mexico has been suffering its worst economic and political crisis in more than a century. The peso's meltdown sank the myth of Mexico as the standard-bearer of economic reform in the Third World. The &quot;200,000 net new jobs&quot; promised by the Clinton Administration have not materialized, and the U.S. is running a trade deficit with Mexico estimated at $15.83 billion for all of 1995.<sup>3</sup>  Instead of a prosperous partner, Mexico has become a financial ward of the U.S. government. As a result, many Americans now believe that NAFTA caused the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nothing could be further from the truth. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency. A series of political shocks in 1994 caused a sustained run on the peso by nervous Mexican and foreign investors<sup>4</sup>.  But instead of raising domestic interest rates and cutting public spending, the Salinas administration sharply increased public spending and used the country's international reserves to support an overvalued peso. As a result, the peso collapsed. Moreover, it was the devaluation of the peso that crashed the Mexican economy and cheapened the value of Mexican exports. These cheaper Mexican exports account for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious. Thanks to NAFTA, those who favored returning to a closed, statist economy were kept at bay while President Zedillo was able to keep the country on course to capitalist democracy. NAFTA is still the best guarantee that Mexico will become a true capitalist democracy and prosperous trading partner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and U.S. Competitiveness. </b>NAFTA is the best way to stimulate America's growth and competitiveness. Mexico is America's fastest-growing export market and third largest trading partner, as well as a key factor in the international competitiveness of many U.S. industries that have established manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico since the 1960s. These plants enable U.S. manufacturers to compete against low-wage manufactures from China and other Asian countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate 2.5 times greater than U.S. export growth to the rest of the world<sup>5</sup>.  From 1987 to 1993, 48 of the 50 states expanded their merchandise sales to Latin America and the Caribbean, with Mexico absorbing the largest absolute share each year; 17 states expanded their exports to Mexico and Latin America by more than 200 percent during this period, and 15 recorded export growth of more than 100 percent. The biggest state exporters to Mexico and Latin America are Texas, Florida, California, Michigan, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana<sup>6</sup>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America each year, with Mexico absorbing more than half of the total. These exports represent 19 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports and support nearly 1.96 million U.S. jobs. During the first year of NAFTA's implementation in 1994, U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada climbed rapidly. Merchandise exports to Canada, America's largest trading partner, grew by more than 13 percent to $114 billion, while exports to Mexico increased over 22 percent to $51 billion. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.8 percent during 1995 as a result of the peso crisis but at the end of the year still remained well above the total for 1993, the last year before NAFTA went into effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Production-sharing operations along the U.S.-Mexican border, known as <I>maquiladoras</I>, are an important competitive strategy for many American firms competing in the U.S. domestic market with goods made by low-cost Asian producers. For example, products assembled in Mexico's <I>maquiladora</I> industries from U.S.-made components accounted for 48 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and America's National Security</b>. NAFTA is very important to U.S. national security. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are perceived increasingly as threats to this security. By a very large majority, Americans want their government to control and reduce illegal immigration and stop the flow of illegal drugs entering the U.S.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the Mexican peso crisis fanned the American public's concern that the U.S. is being overwhelmed by a flood of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 3 million Mexicans enter the U.S. illegally each year.<sup>9</sup>  More than 80 percent of the cocaine brought into America is transported through Mexico by Mexican drug cartels. Mexican police investigators have disclosed that drug traffickers penetrated the highest levels of the Salinas Administration. Drug-related corruption is widespread within the PRI, Mexico's ruling party, especially at the state level. The police, courts, and military also have been corrupted by Mexican drug traffickers whose operations generate profits in excess of $30 billion a year. 
<P>
NAFTA is America's most valuable foreign policy tool in managing these security threats on its southern flank. In addition to accelerating Mexico's transformation into a capitalist democracy, NAFTA is a foundation on which to develop effective cross-border agreements to deal with the twin threats of illegal immigration and drug trafficking in both countries. With NAFTA promoting closer economic ties between the U.S. and Mexico, governments in both countries will face increased pressure from their respective constituencies to work out effective solutions for cross-border problems that hinder trade, economic growth, and competitiveness.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and Democracy in Mexico. </b>NAFTA is an important anchor for reform in Mexico. The closed, one-party system that spurred Mexico's economic development and guaranteed the country's political stability for over six decades is coming apart at the seams. A pluralist democracy is emerging, but the old statist regime will not surrender quickly or quietly. On January 12, 1996, 255 of the 298 representatives of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) publicly called on the government to &quot;abandon neo-liberalism and grant priority to action against poverty and unemployment.&quot;<sup>10</sup>  Similar demands are being made by other groups, including the left-wing PRD, small and medium business, the rebels in Chiapas, consumer debtor organizations, and farmers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these pressures, President Zedillo has stood firm on Mexico's commitment to market-oriented policies, free trade, and compliance with NAFTA. Zedillo's main political priorities are to encourage the growth of a pluralist and open democracy, establish the rule of law, reform Mexico's judicial system, and eradicate widespread police corruption at the national and local level. Without NAFTA, Zedillo's chances of advancing these political reforms would be very poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>NAFTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas. </B>NAFTA is the foundation upon which the U.S. can negotiate free-trade agreements with other Latin American countries. Latin America is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and the U.S. has been one of the principal beneficiaries of that growth. For over six years, Latin American governments have pursued aggressive policies to liberalize trade. As a result, America's exports to other countries in the Western Hemisphere (including Canada) have increased over 50 percent since 1990, growing from $137 billion to nearly $207 billion in 1994 and creating 1.4 million new jobs for American workers. Overall, two-way trade between the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere jumped over 44 percent between 1990 and 1994, from $292.8 billion to $423 billion. U.S. exports to Latin America accounted for one-fifth of total U.S. exports during 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, for free trade between the U.S. and Latin America to continue growing, NAFTA must be expanded quickly to other countries in the Western Hemisphere, starting with Chile and Argentina. It also should be expanded to include countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore that want to liberalize trade faster than currently envisioned by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NAFTA is the linchpin of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup>11</sup>  It assumes that the best way to achieve both sustained economic development and stable democracy is to expand international trade. The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade and NAFTA without reservations, providing the U.S. an unparalleled foreign policy tool for the expansion of free trade, the consolidation of democracy, and the reaffirmation of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere. NAFTA is also the benchmark trade agreement for the creation by 2005 of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). As long as NAFTA's expansion remains stalled, the U.S. has no effective Latin America policy.
<P>

<b>MEXICO HAS NOT TURNED THE CORNER</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration claims that the worst of the Mexican crisis has passed. Mexico's external accounts are once again in balance, exports soared in 1995, the peso has risen, inflation is slowing, and interest rates have eased from their peak levels of 80 percent to 100 percent in early 1995. Moreover, Mexico has raised over $6 billion from international capital markets since the peso collapsed, and the Zedillo government is meeting the deadlines for repaying the money it owes to the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). <sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, the Clinton Administration's claim that Mexico has &quot;turned the corner&quot;<sup>13</sup> is premature. The Mexican economy contracted between 6 percent and 8 percent during 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz admits that 1995 was the worst year for Mexico since the revolution<sup>15</sup>, although he also projects that the Mexican economy will grow 3 percent in 1996. Yet most private analysts forecast slower growth, more devaluation, and higher inflation because Mexico's banking system is still very weak. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican government already has spent $6.5 billion to bail out the banking system and may have to spend another $10.9 billion during 1996 to keep the system afloat.  In all, the cost of bailing out Mexico's banking system could add up to $20 billion, or more than 12 percent of Mexico's GNP for 1995. Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank, estimates that 30 percent of the Mexican banking system's debts are non-performing.<sup>17</sup>  Moreover, the system's problems may be worse than they appear to be, because Mexican banks book only the interest on past-due loans and not the entire loan, including the principal, as U.S. banks are required to list in their accounting.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another problem for the Mexican economy is the political weakness of President Zedillo. Two national polls conducted in November 1995<sup>19</sup> found that three-quarters of Mexico's voters approve of Zedillo's honesty and commitment to democracy but they give him poor marks on political leadership and ability to manage the economy. Two-thirds of the respondents in both polls disapproved of how Zedillo was governing the country, and over 80 percent said that he should change his cabinet. More than half of those surveyed felt the first two ministries to be changed should be the Finance Ministry and the Trade and Industrial Development Ministry. Compared to a similar poll conducted three months earlier,<sup>20</sup> the November poll indicated less confidence in Zedillo and increasing discontent with how he is managing Mexico's difficulties.
<p>
<b>A MEXICAN FREE-MARKET SOLUTION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's $50 billion bailout has not halted Mexico's downward spiral of devaluation, depression, and eventual default. Clinton ignored the principles of free trade when he went to the aid of the Mexican government. The main beneficiaries were Wall Street speculators and Mexican banks and companies owned by business leaders close to the Salinas regime and the ruling PRI. Moreover, the Administration's decision to bail out Mexico with $20 billion from the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund effectively underwrote the cost of refinancing the Mexican government's entire short-term debt without a U.S. congressional appropriation. Clinton's failed attempt to rescue Mexico also created a moral hazard: It signaled foreign governments and private investors that mistakes caused by political incompetence and corruption will be underwritten by American taxpayers through the U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of correcting the structural causes of the Mexican peso crisis, President Zedillo is repeating the errors of the Salinas administration. The policies of Finance Minister Ortiz are indistinguishable from those pursued by Pedro Aspe, his predecessor during the Salinas government. Pressured by the U.S. Treasury and the IMF, the Zedillo administration is following policies which are destroying Mexico's economy. The Zedillo government is doing everything it can to maintain the Wall Street fiction that Mexico is an investment-grade economy. At bottom, Zedillo's economic policies are intended to keep Mexico safe for portfolio investment, not to promote the sustained export growth that constitutes the only escape route from Mexico's current economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central problem is that Mexico's financial technocrats refuse to consider a fixed exchange rate policy to achieve price stability. Since the peso's collapse, Mexico's central bank has implemented a floating exchange rate regime that allows the country's monetary authorities broad discretionary power to manipulate monetary and currency exchange policies. The problem with this policy is that Mexico's central bank lacks the credibility and international reserves to sustain itself without continued loans from the U.S. government and the IMF.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To achieve price stability under its current floating exchange rate, the Bank of Mexico will have to impose a relatively tight monetary policy and high interest rates. Inevitably, this will be accompanied by very slow economic growth. A sluggish Mexican economy would depress export earnings and foreign investment, making it more difficult for the government to service its foreign debt obligations. Slow economic growth also would fuel increased political turmoil, a revival of statist economic prescriptions, and more illegal migration to the U.S. This could weaken support for NAFTA in both countries and increase cross-border tensions over sensitive issues like drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Only Mexico can devise lasting solutions for the Mexican crisis. NAFTA is vitally important to Mexico's future economic prosperity and democratic stability, but it is only part of the equation. Mexico has yet to go the full distance to capitalist democracy. Moreover, it has yet to devise an effective economic model capable of delivering the sort of sustained growth Chile has managed to achieve since 1985. Natural resources, human capital, and access to technology are not the problems. Mexico has all three in abundance. Missing, however, is the bold, imaginative leadership capable of conceiving and executing a strategy to complete Mexico's transition to capitalist democracy. Ideally, such a strategy would involve five goals:
<p>
<b>1.) Restore confidence in Mexico by stabilizing the currency. </b>This requires replacing the Bank of Mexico with a currency board.<sup>21</sup>  To achieve sustained export growth and price stability, Mexico needs a sound monetary system, which a currency board would provide. The Bank of Mexico's floating exchange rate may be the favored option of Mexico's financial authorities, but it is fundamentally unsound because it allows arbitrary, discretionary control over Mexico's monetary and exchange problems. The principal goals of a currency board would be to fix the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and to eliminate the broad discretionary power (and lack of accountability) of Mexico's financial authorities to manipulate monetary and exchange policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The establishment of a currency board would stabilize the peso virtually overnight and restore confidence in Mexico. It would do so by instituting a non-discretionary, rules-bound, and totally transparent currency exchange regime. A currency board would prohibit public spending above levels that threaten reserves, stimulate more foreign direct investment, and insulate the peso from political interference and bureaucratic tinkering, in addition to quickly reducing inflation and interest rates, thereby spurring an increase in real long-term productive investment in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have used currency boards. In all cases, these boards have produced stable currencies that keep inflation at substantially low levels. No currency board has ever devalued its local money against its reserve currency. Argentina has been using a variant of the currency board since 1991. In every country where a currency board has been established, governments have succeeded in killing the deadly virus of high inflation, lowering local interest rates to manageable levels, and encouraging direct foreign investment in the local economy. The creation of a currency board in Mexico would be the first step in a Mexican free-market solution for the Mexican crisis.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
<b>2.) Break Mexico's addiction to foreign debt. </b>This means restructuring Mexico's banking sector. Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the bailout of Mexico's private banks will cost the equivalent of 12 percent of the country's 1995 GNP.<sup>23</sup>  Debt relief programs created by the Zedillo administration will not work under the current floating exchange rate because higher inflation from the ongoing devaluation of the peso caused by the banking crisis, along with the continuing need to cheapen Mexico's exports, will cause Mexico's domestic debts to increase more rapidly than the ability of debtors to repay them. Moreover, Mexico cannot increase its borrowings from the IMF because it already has exceeded, by a factor of nearly 20, its allowable credit ceiling under existing IMF rules. Complicating matters even more, in November 1995 the Clinton Administration rejected a formal Mexican request for more financial assistance to bail out the banking system.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, the Zedillo government may be tempted to print more pesos to rescue the banks, driving up inflation and keeping interest rates at high levels. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A currency board would create the stable price environment that Mexican banks need to recapitalize and restructure their domestic credit portfolios. Bad debts could be winnowed out of bank portfolios and written off. Collectable consumer and corporate debt could be restructured and securitized,<sup>25</sup> creating a secondary market where domestic debt paper could be traded at a discount. However, the government also should lift all remaining limits on ownership of banks and other commercial enterprises.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<B>3.) Promote sustained economic growth. </B>A key to achieving this goal is liberalizing Mexico's national oil industry.<sup>27</sup>  The Mexican government owns 100 percent of the country's oil and natural gas industry. On February 12, 1996, the Mexican government announced its new energy program for the next five years. The plan is a restatement of Mexico's traditionally anti-market, monopolistic approach to energy development. <sup>28</sup> Jesus Reyes Heroles, president of the state oil monopoly <I>Petroleos Mexicanos</I> (Pemex), predicts that Mexico will attract $6.3 billion in foreign investment in petrochemicals, power plants, and natural gas companies. However, declared Reyes Heroles, no private investment will be permitted in upstream exploration, production, and refining of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Mexico, a better alternative would be to follow the example of more efficient and successful state-owned oil companies. A good model is <I>Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA),</I> which is implementing a mixed-economy expansion program to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.<sup>29</sup>  Without giving up ownership of Mexico's oil and gas reserves, Pemex could contract with small private operators to exploit older and smaller oil and gas reservoirs that are uneconomic for Pemex to operate commercially. In addition, Pemex could enter into long-term associations with large international oil companies to find and develop major oil and gas reservoirs which Pemex is not financially or technologically capable of exploiting by itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As oil and gas export earnings increase, part of the incremental profits could be reinvested in the expansion and modernization of Mexico's oil industry, and part could be deposited directly to the accounts of Mexican workers in privately managed pension funds. Such a strategy would represent a true &quot;nationalization&quot; of the Mexican oil industry, since it would transfer real oil wealth directly to workers and their families, creating a fast-growth domestic savings industry to finance Mexico's economic development with internal savings rather than with crippling external debt. 
<p>
<b>4.) Increase disposable income. </b>Mexico's income tax rate should be cut and income thresholds increased. The top tax rate of 35 percent takes hold at very low levels of income. To spur investment, Mexico should extend its current zero percent capital gains tax rate on large stock exchange companies to all investments.<sup>30</sup>

<p>
<b>5.) Create better legal and political institutions for economic growth. </b>This requires both judicial and political reform. The rule of law and transparent democratic institutions are essential for the well-being and prosperity of successful capitalist democracies. President Zedillo has pledged massive overhaul of the judicial and political systems in Mexico, but efforts on both fronts are not progressing quickly, largely because of increased political discontent and resistance to change fueled by the current economic depression.
<p>
<b>REASSERTING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America is dangerous. The Clinton Administration is projecting an image of retreat. In Mexico, still struggling to overcome its economic difficulties and recover its political stability, there is widespread concern about the depth of Washington's commitment to NAFTA. Throughout Latin America, political leaders trying to promote unpopular free-market reforms are questioning the sincerity of the Clinton Administration's pledge that the U.S. would lead the process of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. The longer America's policy drift continues, the greater the risk that hard-won economic and democratic reforms will be stalled or even rolled back in some countries. Moreover, if Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide. To regain the initiative in Latin America, the U.S. government should: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Comply with NAFTA. </b> The Clinton Administration should respect NAFTA's provisions and timetables for implementation. By cheating on NAFTA, the Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future. Permits for Mexican trucks to circulate in the U.S. border states should be issued without further delay if the vehicles comply with all technical, safety, and legal requirements as stipulated in NAFTA.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico.</B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico, including currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's public-sector debt, illegal immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and other countries. </B>Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. Thus, NAFTA should be expanded to include Chile, and later to include Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chile is a beacon of economic prosperity and democracy for all of Latin America. It has set the standard for success in the region by achieving average growth rates of 6 percent annually every year since 1985, along with inflation of less than 8 percent, unemployment of 5 percent, and savings and domestic investment of 27 percent of GDP. Postponing Chile's admission to NAFTA would slow hemispheric trade integration and weaken American leadership.<sup>31</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Asian countries also should be considered for NAFTA membership. Some members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, are willing to liberalize trade at a much faster pace than is currently envisioned by APEC and may wish to negotiate free trade agreements with the U.S. as quickly as possible. Instead of a series of separate bilateral pacts, incorporating Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore into NAFTA would make sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </b>The current Mexican experiment with a floating exchange rate will fail eventually.<sup>32</sup>  The U.S. should encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board that would fix the peso's exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. The creation of a currency board would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA. Under a currency board, if a run on the peso occurred, the worst that could happen would be the total dollarization of Mexico, since trading would take place in U.S. dollars while the currency board held the stock of Mexican pesos.<sup>33</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development. There is no moral hazard in forgiving Mexico's entire public sector foreign debt, since it will never be repaid in full anyway. Moreover, writing off the public-sector's foreign debt would free Mexico from the IMF's destructive clutches.<sup>34</sup>  The IMF's record in Mexico, an IMF borrower since 1976, has been impoverishment, indebtedness, and dependency.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>For many years, America's war on drugs in the Western Hemisphere has concentrated on the Andean drug trade, with special emphasis on Colombia, while largely ignoring the closer threat of Mexican drug traffickers. However, since the mid-1980s, 19 distinct drug cartels have emerged in Mexico.<sup>36</sup>  President Salinas himself admitted that the annual flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs through Mexico totals some $100 billion annually. The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States. The U.S. and Mexico should begin talks to enhance cooperation in apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican peso crisis weakened support in America for NAFTA, damaged U.S.-Mexico relations, and halted further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Americas for at least the next two years. Moreover, the crisis in Mexico is not over yet: Clinton's $50 billion bailout of the Zedillo government kept Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debt obligations in 1995, but Mexico's downward economic spiral was not reversed. The economic policies of the Zedillo government will not achieve the structural reforms that Mexico needs to avoid another currency collapse. The market's recent surge of optimism in Mexico's recovery therefore may prove to be very short-lived.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the Mexican crisis continues, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow. Conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking easily could displace cooperation on trade and investment. More crisis in Mexico also will fuel opposition in both countries to NAFTA and free trade, possibly delaying NAFTA's implementation in North America and derailing its expansion to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>The Economist</I> argues that NAFTA is one of the principal factors responsible for &quot;a second Mexican revolution,&quot;<sup>37</sup> and asserts that Mexico's successful transformation into a stable capitalist democracy depends on its becoming &quot;more like America.&quot;<sup>38</sup>  More than that of any other country in Latin America, Mexico's future is tied, for better or worse, to the future of the United States. However, the American goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), based on NAFTA's expansion to all democratic countries in the Western Hemisphere, depends on the quick return of economic and political stability to Mexico. As long as the crisis continues in Mexico, it will be difficult for any U.S. Administration to rebuild bipartisan congressional support for NAFTA's expansion and regain public trust and support for free trade. The U.S. needs to work with Mexico, through NAFTA, to help end this economic crisis.

Although McCaffrey's appointment did not cause any reaction in the U.S., throughout Latin America it was widely seen as a sign that the Clinton Administration plans to militarize the hemispheric war on drugs.

In 1988, the U.S. and Canada signed a Free Trade Agreement that later would serve as the foundation for NAFTA. The Bush Administration's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, launched in 1989, outlined a blueprint for creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA); the first step in achieving the goal of a hemispheric FTAA was the negotiation of the NAFTA with Mexico. When the Clinton Administration was inaugurated in 1993, the NAFTA talks between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada already had been completed. Clinton delayed NAFTA's implementation until 1994 while unnecessary labor and environmental side agreements were negotiated with Mexico and Canada. Moreover, at the Summit of the Americas, Clinton reaffirmed long&#173;standing U.S. policy that NAFTA should be the standard for creating a hemispheric FTAA.
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 29, 1996, the Mexican government repaid the U.S. Treasury $1.3 billion in short&#173;term swaps issued under the U.S.&#173;Mexico Framework Agreement announced by the Clinton Administration on February 21, 1995. In all, $13.5 billion in U.S. funds was disbursed to Mexico from the ESF, of which $10.5 billion in medium&#173;term swaps remains outstanding. The ESF, created by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, has been used since the 1973 demise of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime to intervene in foreign exchange markets and finance short&#173;term loans to developed and developing countries. As of early 1995, the ESF held about $25 billion. The ESF is not financed with regular appropriations from Congress, so it &quot;borrows&quot; from the Federal Reserve when it needs additional funds. These loans are &quot;warehoused&quot; at the Federal Reserve, where the Treasury stores its foreign currencies in exchange for dollars that must be repaid later.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the congressional budget process is notorious for missed deadlines, this fiscal year's effort to craft a budget for the federal government has set records for delay. At a time when both Congress and the President should be well along in developing a budget for FY 1997, they have yet to agree on spending for FY 1996. Nearly halfway through the current fiscal year, in other words, Congress and the White House must try to complete two budgets in a time frame that has proved inadequate for one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year, the congressional budget process, with its complicated procedures, proved to be woefully ineffective in securing enactment of the ambitious agenda of the 104th Congress. But it did prove to be a highly effective weapon in the hands of a President determined to protect the status quo. Observers and participants concede a first-round victory to President Clinton, who has attempted to postpone the second round by arguing, along with some of his allies in Congress, that a national debate on last year's budget issues should be deferred until the upcoming presidential campaign, which should serve as a referendum on Congress's agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should ignore this suggestion that it relinquish its constitutionally mandated fiscal responsibilities. Instead, it should rejoin the budget struggle with a strategy that takes advantage of the impressive legislative accomplishments of the first session and the original intentions of the congressional budget process. This means focusing more intensely on timely completion of the appropriations and authorization process, and any necessary enabling legislation, as the primary mechanisms for crafting and enacting the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By doing this, Congress could divide its far-reaching agenda into functional components, debating each issue on its individual merits rather than as part of a larger package in which important reform issues are lost in controversy over out-year deficit targets. This approach also would allow Members to separate components of the budget that are controversial from those that are not, thereby limiting the President's ability to hold government hostage to his own political agenda. In addition, recognizing that Congress must complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets in a very limited period of time, Congress should adopt a biennial budget that embodies the key reforms developed during the last session. 

<p>
<b>A SIX-POINT PLAN FOR BUDGET VICTORY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following six point strategy would allow Congress both to adopt two-year budgets and to enact its reform agenda in the limited time available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) </b>Adopt a biennial budget strategy during this session. This would allow Congress to complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets, meet dual spending targets in those authorization and appropriation bills either vetoed or not yet signed by the President, and pass the legislation needed to change entitlements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2.)</b> Place greater reliance on individual authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation, completed on schedule, as the primary vehicles for fiscal and legislative reform. This contrasts with the current strategy of depending on continuing resolutions or omnibus reconciliation bills. By constructing a budget using authorization and appropriation bills, and if necessary segmenting the 13 individual appropriations bills into an even greater number of functional accounts, Congress would focus the debate more sharply on the profound policy differences involved and prevent the President from using these disagreements to block reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3.)</b> Build upon last year's considerable legislative accomplishments in such areas as welfare, Medicare and Medicaid reform, and discretionary programs. Last year, Congress enacted major reforms in several policy areas to improve the operation of federal programs. When folded together in giant budget bills, these accomplishments were blocked by President Clinton. These same bills should be split into separate bills. Along with existing but unsigned appropriations bills and related legislation, they should be amended to extend spending authority and program changes over a second year and sent separately to the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4.)</b> Use the breathing room available under this budget strategy to remedy deficiencies in budget-related House and Senate bills either now being considered or already passed but not signed into law. Congress should use the current impasse as a second chance to reconsider its performance in such areas as transportation, housing, privatization, and devolution -- areas in which last year's authorization and appropriation bills often fell short of promised reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5.)</b> Lawmakers must keep focusing on why they were elected -- to cut the budget and reform government. Talk of "CBO scoring" for "front-loaded glide paths," "growth from baseline," and "reconciliation" is the language of staff, not leadership. Americans want the budget cut because they know their hard-earned money is financing waste, redundancy, and obsolescence.  Lawmakers must take every opportunity to explain their programs and accomplishments in the same vivid terms that convinced voters to entrust them with the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6.)</b> Adopt an appropriate division of labor within the leadership. This is needed to ensure that individual committee work products are timely and conform to overall congressional objectives. It is needed also to make sure that leadership is not so thinly spread over every issue. 
<p>
<b>The Need to be Better Prepared</b>
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heady with success from passing key elements in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyic.com:80/conservative/contract.html">Contract With America</a> and adopting a balanced budget while fundamentally reforming welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare, Congress was caught unprepared by the President's veto strategy to defend the status quo. Congress relied too heavily on an omnibus reconciliation process and on comprehensive continuing resolutions as substitutes for a set of separate authorization and appropriations bills. Congress presented the President with an all-or nothing package covering so many significant issues that it was devoid of meaningful policy content. The President accepted the challenge by holding the government hostage, thereby allowing the news media to reduce the debate to sound-bite-friendly statements about Yellowstone sleigh rides and tickets to the Statue of Liberty. Lost was any serious discussion of the need to restore the viability of Medicare, reform the destructive welfare system, and boost the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The three-time failure to achieve success with the all-or-nothing strategy has left many in Congress demoralized and confused, with lawmakers assuming they can achieve little this year. But this need not be the case. A different approach to budget process could allow Congress to turn its impressive collection of legislative initiatives last year into law this year.
<p>
<b>Building on Last Year's Accomplishments</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The key to restarting the process is to recognize that the first session of the 104th Congress was remarkably successful in passing legislation that would fundamentally reform many of the government's most troubled programs. After decades of empty promises, it was this Congress that finally confronted the welfare and Medicaid mess, passed the necessary legislative remedies, and sent them to the President. Similarly, the financially collapsing Medicare program was overhauled to give seniors far more choices than any previous Congress or President had even considered. These reforms did not become law. The only reason: because President Clinton refused to sign them. Likewise, in many of the discretionary accounts, scores of wasteful and obsolete programs were terminated or cut back substantially, and some of these terminations were signed into law by the President.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This agenda should be pursued aggressively during the second session of the 104th Congress in a debate which sets out clearly the choices that must be made -- a focus lacking during the latter part of 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To do this, Congress should move immediately to construct a biennial budget resolution for the combined 1996 and 1997 fiscal years, using last year's resolution as the base and including whatever corrections might be needed to reflect spending, taxing, and economic patterns already underway. With this accomplished, Congress should move swiftly to complete the drafting (mostly by refining earlier bills) and passage of the authorization and appropriation bills and other legislation needed to turn the hundreds of decisions embodied in the budget resolution into law. Most of these authorization and appropriations bills, like the budget resolution, should cover at least two years.
<P>
<b>Speed Up the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should stop using omnibus reconciliation bills and continuing resolutions as its primary vehicles in advancing fiscal and policy objectives. Instead, as intended by the Budget Act, it should rely on the timely completion of authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation to implement spending decisions contained in the budget resolution. Under the Budget Act (as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990), the House Appropriations Committee must report out all of its bills by June 10, and the House must complete action on them by June 30. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Last year, however, the House passed only two of 13 appropriations bills by the June 30 deadline. Eight more were passed in July, and the remainder in August and September. Similar delays occurred in the Senate, and the first appropriations bill was not sent to the President until eight days before the start of the new fiscal year. By the time the new fiscal year had begun, only two appropriations bills had been cleared for the President's signature. Legislation to reform major entitlements also was not completed until after the fiscal year began.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When passage of spending bills is delayed until after the start of the fiscal year, the need to avoid a government shutdown forces Congress to rely on a single omnibus reconciliation bill or comprehensive continuing resolution to enact its agenda. This, in turn, allows the President to hold the entire government hostage to his own plans and avoid an open debate on the issues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the recent past, the reconciliation process and related legislation often were used as a substitute for the appropriations process, partly because it is easier to deal with a single omnibus bill than with 13 or more separate pieces of legislation. While this approach may work when Congress and the President are in general agreement on key issues, however, the process tends to exacerbate differences when they are not. Reliance on premature reconciliation bills also is a factor in keeping Congress from completing action on appropriations bills in advance of the relevant fiscal year, forcing it to pass continuing resolutions or some other form of omnibus legislation to keep government open while budgets await approval. Indeed, persistent delay in getting these bills completed before the start of the fiscal year was one of the many reasons Congress passed the Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.
<P>
<b>Rely on the Appropriations and Authorization Process, As Improved and Intended</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By avoiding omnibus reconciliation bills and ambitious continuing resolutions, Congress places the burden of fiscal responsibility where it was intended to be placed and where it resided for nearly two centuries before enactment of the 1974 Budget Act:<sup>2</sup>  on the authorization and appropriations process. By relying on the timely completion of appropriations bills and necessary legislation within the schedule mandated by the Budget Act and avoiding dependence on a single bill to effect substantive policy and fiscal changes, Congress would follow more closely the original intent of the Act.3  But, as noted above, such bills seldom have been completed and signed into law by the start of the fiscal year. With just a month to go before reaching the mid-point of FY 1996, only eight of the 13 bills have been signed by the President, and the one covering the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services has not even been completed, thanks to a threatened Senate filibuster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House and Senate leadership promise that this year's appropriation committee performance will be swift and timely. Such promises have been made at the start of every session in living memory, but with little result. This year, they actually could mean something. Paradoxically, one reason for optimism is that with so few of last year's appropriations bills and related legislation signed into law, subcommittees of the appropriations and authorizing committees need only rewrite and edit the bills that already have been completed, adding an additional year of spending so that they cover two years instead of just one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To accelerate the process, out-year spending projections in the FY 1996 budget resolution could serve as a preliminary basis for the FY 1997 portions of the appropriations bills until the new FY 1996/FY 1997 budget resolution is passed on or before the April 15 deadline. This process also would include all of the authorization bills and companion legislation needed to accomplish fundamental reform of the entitlement programs. The bills covering Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform are just as necessary and as valid today as they were last year when rejected by the President as parts of a single omnibus bill or as separate pieces of legislation. They should be separated into individual bills, then modified as appropriate and resubmitted to the President in a process designed to draw clear distinctions between Congress's reforms and the President's embrace of the status quo.
<p>
<b>Conduct a National Debate on Separate Issues</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The main advantage of swiftly following the budget resolution with separate authorization and appropriations bills and legislation to alter entitlements is that Congress and the President then could conduct a clear debate in each policy area. When everything is lumped into a reconciliation bill or continuing resolution, issues of fundamental change, and the reasons for them, get lost in an angry debate over lines on a chart and out-year deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By separating the budget into 13 or more appropriations bills and any number of other bills needed to reform program operations, Congress can engage the President directly in a debate over differences in policy on a program-by-program basis and challenge the President more effectively in his defense of the status quo. Instead of creating an environment where the President can talk about hungry children while rejecting a reform of Medicare, separating bills into their functional components would permit Congress to compare what it wants to achieve through welfare reform with existing inner-city squalor in federally funded public housing projects. Further, separating bills in this way would allow lawmakers to talk about the reforms themselves, rather than about back-loaded baselines and seven-year CBO projections. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 This strategy would allow lawmakers to draw vivid and clear distinctions between abuses that exist and the reforms they know the nation both wants and needs. The successful strategy used in the House last January to pass comprehensive regulatory reform can serve as a model to involve the public in a debate that otherwise might become obtuse and technical. Medicare, Medicaid, federal job training programs, deplorable conditions in public housing projects, and obsolete agencies are just some of the costly targets of opportunity that should be brought to the attention of a public still eager for reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 In implementing this strategy, there is no reason why Congress has to limit itself to its traditional 13 appropriations bills. Without challenging any committee's current jurisdiction, appropriations bills could be subdivided more finely into functional areas that lead to clearer debates on policy differences, at the same time denying the President and a minority in Congress the opportunity to hold one program hostage to another. For example, the National Park Service, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and any other programs likely to trigger intense debate could be brought forward as separate bills rather than as subsections of a single "Department of Interior and Related Agencies" bill. Likewise, the single appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and State could be sliced easily into three or more components, while separate bills covering each of the major entitlement reform initiatives could be brought forward and debated on their merits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Added to this agenda should be similarly comprehensive reform legislation for areas of government which last year were not subject to nearly the degree of reform that many of the social welfare programs and independent agencies experienced, leaving the majority in Congress vulnerable to charges, for example, of ignoring costly "corporate welfare" programs. Only limited changes were imposed on the troubled public housing industry or on the transportation, public power, and agriculture interests, to name just a few. These costly deficiencies should be remedied during the second session and within the combined FY 1996/FY 1997 resolution and related authorization/appropriations process.
<p>
<b>Managing the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By promising to complete the appropriations/authorization process in a timely fashion, Congress has set for itself an ambitious goal -- one it has failed to fulfill during much of the recent past, including the last session of Congress when so much was at stake. Is Congress up to the task of performing this well?  It may be able to do so, but only if changes also are made in the management of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Specifically, the House and Senate leadership should stick with issues more appropriate to leaders and leave the complicated technical details to others. By defining duties and responsibilities more clearly, the leadership could take full advantage of the efficiencies that arise from an effective division of labor by organizing members into issue teams, drawn from the relevant committees, and assigning to these teams the responsibility of advancing each of the key policies. These teams would focus on such cross-cutting issues as welfare reform or the termination of wasteful programs, championing them in debate on behalf of the majority. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, because it has yet to complete its work on many of the appropriations bills and most of the entitlement reforms for the FY 1996 budget, Congress also will need to produce and defend a series of interim continuing resolutions to keep government operating, at the same time advancing whatever incremental reforms can be brought along for the ride. Perhaps another task force, drawn from the leadership and the budget, tax, and appropriations committees, could be formed to fulfill this duty while the leadership and key committee chairmen develop and implement a comprehensive biennial budget with promised reforms.

The practice of using reconciliation bills as the chief vehicle for change began in 1981 with the enactment of President Reagan's program for economic recovery, but has proven to be not very effective when there are major policy differences between Congress and executive branch.

<title>Key Changes Needed In the Governors' Medicaid Proposal - Heritage</title>

<h3>KEY CHANGES NEEDED IN THE GOVERNORS' MEDICAID PROPOSAL</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 89<br>
March 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The congressional leadership is drafting comprehensive Medicaid reform legislation based on a recent outline proposal endorsed unanimously by the National Governors Association (NGA). But unless the legislation differs sharply from the governors' outline in some critical details, it will be a disaster rather than a reform, preserving some of the worst features of today's Medicaid program while opening the door to another state-led raid on the U.S. Treasury. To avoid this, the legislation must make two crucial changes in the governors' plan: It must limit the categories of Americans guaranteed benefits and, even more important, must not include an open-ended state entitlement to "umbrella" funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The outline preamble calls explicitly for an end to the entitlement status of Medicaid and for the establishment of a block grant system of financing. But a close reading of the fine print in the governors' plan shows that the reverse is true. The plan actually sets out a federally defined list of guaranteed benefits for a large "guaranteed population" that would have an entitlement to these benefits. Moreover, the plan does not simply transform Medicaid into a block grant program, with a specific determination of the maximum amount of federal funds each state will receive (at a higher percentage than is typical today); that capitated amount will be only part of the funds flowing to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan also contains an "umbrella insurance" provision to provide guaranteed additional money to states in the event of unanticipated growth in the eligible population. It states explicitly that "[t]hese funds are an entitlement to states and are not subject to annual appropriations" by Congress. Thus, state officials, who have shown themselves adept in the past at squeezing huge amounts of federal money out of the fine print of federal Medicaid law, would have unencumbered power to raid the federal treasury. Even the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which strongly opposes devolution of control to the states, warns that the umbrella mechanism "may create incentives for states to 'game' the system and consequently may result in substantial, unintended federal cost."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Keeping the Status Quo.</b> As drafted, the governors' outline retains a comprehensive list of government benefits for Medicaid's "guaranteed" populations.<sup>2</sup>  The groups eligible for this entitlement include: 
<p><ul>
<li> Pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children to age 6, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children ages 6 through 12, to 100 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Elderly who meet Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and resource standards; and
<p>
<li> Persons with disabilities as defined by the state in their state plan. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of the 33.4 million Medicaid recipients in 1993, pregnant women and children living on income up to 133 percent of the government's official poverty level accounted for 71 percent, or 23.7 million, of the eligible population. Generally, these recipients also get cash assistance under other major welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supple- mental Security Income (SSI). By mandating states to continue coverage for these individuals, as well as those falling into the two other major categories (elderly and disabled), the governors simply retain the mandatory entitlement features of Medicaid for the vast majority of existing beneficiaries -- features that have contributed to the explosive financial pressures on the Medicaid system. Given the uncapped status of the insurance umbrella, the governors' plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and costly entitlement feature of Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In maintaining a federal definition of which individuals will be guaranteed benefits, the governors seem also to have tied their own hands in reforming their own welfare programs. Since most welfare recipients are categorically entitled to Medicaid benefits, there would remain little incentive for individuals to seek employment with generally more limited insurance through the private sector. Worse, the governors will have neither true flexibility in administering Medicaid nor the ultimate authority in determining how best to provide quality care for their resident poor. It is to help meet the anticipated costs of maintaining federal eligibility and benefits requirements that the governors included an insurance umbrella provision, which will help them shift costs back to the federal taxpayers. That also is the flaw from the federal taxpayer's point of view.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Deficit Dangers.</b> The governors know that the current level of spending growth in Medicaid is unsustainable. While few consider the governors' proposal a step toward fiscal responsibility, the insurance umbrella described in their outline almost certainly would add to the federal deficit. The purpose of the umbrella is understandable: to protect individual states from unanticpated costs due to changes in the growth of their eligible populations. But it is crafted as an uncapped, open-ended entitlement "reserve" fund upon which the states can draw in emergencies, and the outline contains no measures to control federal spending once the provision is triggered. This directly contradicts both the principle and goal of a federal block grant program, and it would allow creative accountants in state government free rein to manipulate eligibility requirements and service levels to shift as much of their costs as possible to categories of people who would qualify for umbrella funds. Past experience with Medicaid shows that they would do so.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rules and Mandates.</b> The nation's governors rightly criticize the red tape of Medicaid mandates with which states must comply in order to get federal matching funds. Moreover, these congressionally imposed requirements hamper state governments' ability to design and implement cost-efficient programs that target medically needy persons. Ironically, the governors' proposal still includes federally defined mandates; even though states would be given much more flexibility, these federally mandated eligibility and benefit requirements would supersede their own authority to decide how best to care for their poor residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The costs associated with federal mandates have not gone unnoticed by this Congress, which has sought to tackle the growing financial burden of an unreformed Medicaid program (an effort vetoed by President Clinton). While the overall cost of the program is rising rapidly, the federal share alone is projected to reach approximately $100 billion in FY 1996. Similarly, states are dedicating a growing percentage of their budgets to providing their residents access to health services. According to an analysis prepared for The Heritage Foundation, if no reforms in the Medicaid program are enacted, the states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money between 1995 and 2002 just to maintain the system as it is today.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO FIX THE GOVERNORS' PLAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the governors' proposal calls for much-needed flexibility and a long-overdue block grant approach to financing Medicaid, the NGA's plan itself would not pare back the entitlement feature of Medicaid sufficiently, and the umbrella feature, as currently designed, almost certainly would lead to an uncontrolled hemorrhaging of federal funds. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the governors' plan is to be turned into legislation that actually reforms Medicaid and introduces sensible spending control at the federal level, two crucial changes are necessary. Without them, the plan should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of the costly open-ended entitlement status of today's program. These two essential changes are:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The guaranteed populations and benefits -- the entitlement -- should be sharply limited, and focused on politically weak groups traditionally ignored by the states, such as the homeless and those with severe mental illness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not an entitlement to states. States do need protection from unanticipated changes that would make them vulnerable under a strict block grant, but this should be in the form of a fund voted on each year and distributed according to a formula devised by Congress to meet specific problems. It should not be a blank check to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then Medicaid, like other federal programs, will require more, not less, fiscal discipline. In reforming Medicaid, lawmakers must make sure that the precise legislative language does not create a legal loophole for state officials who have acquired expertise in "gaming" the Medicaid program at the expense of federal taxpayers.

<h3>YET ANOTHER SHAM WELFARE REFORM:<br>
EXAMINING THE NGA PLAN </h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The National Governors' Association (NGA) is proposing a new welfare reform plan, and Congress has initiated hearings on the governors' proposal. Unfortunately, this proposal, crafted by NGA bureaucrats and borrowing significant elements from President Clinton's welfare reform schemes, is another blueprint for flawed welfare reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of Congress should realize that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements of the Contract With America proposed by conservatives in the fall of 1994. The Contract contained a solid, comprehensive welfare reform based on three themes:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A national goal of reducing illegitimacy</b> and establishing a number of modest national policies to advance that goal;<p>

<li><b> National work requirements</b> for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) recipients; and<p>

<li><b> Greater flexibility to state governments</b> in the operation of welfare programs.<sup>1</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House/Senate conference bill passed by Congress, and vetoed by President Clinton on January 9, retained these three basic elements of reform, albeit with the pro-marriage provisions weakened. But the NGA plan effectively eliminates the first two principles of reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decision makers enticed by the NGA's "bipartisan" reform package would do well to remember history. America supposedly ended welfare just eight years ago, when Congress in 1988 passed a comprehensive "bipartisan" reform which promised to replace welfare with work. This so-called reform, also predominantly shaped by the NGA, turned out to be a sham:  Daycare spending soared; welfare caseloads skyrocketed; even today, almost no welfare recipients are required to work. With the NGA bureaucracy again in the lead, history is about to repeat itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan is heavily flawed in four key aspects.
<p>
<b>1) The plan abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy.</b> NGA officials have completely misdefined the real goal of reform. Their plan explicitly abandons the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy, which was the number one welfare reform plank in the Contract With America; the shift is so complete that the governors' policy declaration does not mention rising illegitimacy even as a minor social problem, let alone propose a reform structure to deal with it.
<p>
<b>2) The plan eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients.</b> The plan drawn up by the NGA bureaucracy completely guts the work requirements from the House-Senate conference bill and substitutes bogus requirements designed to deceive the public while preserving the status quo. The work requirements in the NGA plan are far weaker than those in the Democratic alternative bills supported by President Clinton, S.1117, introduced by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) in the Senate, and the amendment to H.R. 4 introduced by Representative Nathan Deal (D-GA) in the House. In fact, under the NGA plan, no welfare recipients will be required to work.
<p>
<b>3) The plan has a pervasive anti-marriage bias.</b> Since the NGA bureaucracy rejected reducing out-of-wedlock birth rates as a reform goal, it is not surprising that the plan is indifferent, or effectively hostile, to marriage throughout. To the extent it modifies the conference welfare bill passed in the House and Senate, the NGA plan systematically discriminates against marriage. Further, it would penalize financially those states which pursue a pro-marriage welfare strategy and reward those which concentrate on the narrow goal of providing job-training and employment to single mothers.
<p>
<b>4) The plan embodies the Clinton Administration's "reform" structure.</b> The NGA plan incorporates many major elements of President Clinton's anti-dependency plans. As such, the governors' proposal encourages states to pursue the least efficient strategies for reducing welfare dependence and penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.
<p>

<b>ABANDONING MARRIAGE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most important element of any reform plan is the goal. If the goal is set properly, all other elements eventually will fall into place. If the nation sets the wrong goal, no amount of tinkering will help. The number one goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage and reduce illegitimacy. All else is secondary. Setting a clear, paramount goal of reducing illegitimacy also serves a public education function:  It frames the debate, alerts Americans to what is truly important, and establishes social expectations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' proposal is a failure because it sets the wrong goal. NGA officials declare that there are three "crucial elements" of real welfare reform:
<p><ul>
<li> Providing more government-funded daycare;
<p>
<li> Increasing child support payments from absent fathers; and 
<p>
<li> Imposing time limits and work requirements (with gaping loopholes) for welfare recipients.<sup>2</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise in illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not even merit a concerned comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the NGA.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, over the last year, the focus of the welfare debate has undergone a radical metamorphosis, from combating illegitimacy to providing public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of illegitimacy, the NGA plan instead appears as a preparation for a future in which marriage plays a sharply diminishing role in America, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the needs of an ever-growing population of single-parent families. The triumph of liberals on this aspect of the debate has been complete:  Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government daycare is "in." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan, borrowing heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails neatly with the interests of America's enormous welfare bureaucracy:  an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will trim the growth rate in welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social service spending in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed version of welfare reform, the Republican-controlled Congress has committed itself to spending nearly half a trillion dollars, over the next seven years to subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, daycare, job training, and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA welfare reform plan will distort these priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.

<P>
<b>The Crisis of Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But decisive action to deal with the collapse of the family is urgently needed. Last year, nearly one-third of American children were born out of wedlock. Even worse, the illegitimate birth rate continues to rise relentlessly -- by about one percentage point each and every year. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihan's warning was vilified at the time, but the breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ominously, the illegitimate birth rate among whites now is edging toward 25 percent -- almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised his alarm. The white family is teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The collapse of marriage and the concomitant rise in illegitimacy together form the number one problem facing America; family collapse is the root cause of other social problems, such as poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure.<sup>4</sup>  Some reasons why:
<p><ul>
<li>Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those born to couples who remain married. 
<p>
<li>Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out-of wedlock themselves than are girls from intact non-welfare families. 
<p>
<li>A boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as likely to engage in crime as a similar boy who is poor but living with a father and a mother.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is unneeded:  If left alone, the governors will tackle the problem on their own. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. By refusing to acknowledge or mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out of wedlock and raised in government-supported daycare centers. This is not reform. It is a national disaster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage. But the governors have formally stated that promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is not a meaningful part of their reform plan. If the House and Senate adopt the governors' plan, they will have agreed with them and will have abandoned even token efforts to stem the rise of illegitimacy and decline of marriage in American society.
<p>

<b>THE NGA'S SHAM WORK REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly 90 percent of Americans believe that welfare recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. In response to this public pressure, the U.S. welfare establishment has a simple solution:  sham work requirements that create the illusion that beneficiaries must work while, in fact, few actually do. For example, as part of the 1988 welfare reform (the Family Support Act) the public was told that "welfare will be replaced by work."  But the NGA opposed real work requirements. As a consequence, the reform, enacted by a nearly unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate, was a sham. Daycare funding exploded, AFDC caseload grew by some 30 percent, and today only some 2 to 3 percent of AFDC recipients actually are required to work. History is about to repeat itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A major provision of the conference bill passed by Congress is a requirement that some AFDC recipients must work.5  Section 407 of the bill requires certain percentages of the AFDC caseload to work for benefits and provides a fairly tight definition of work. However, even these work participation requirements have loopholes. For example, up to 20 percent of those counted as working can be in vocational education instead.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The following table shows the nominal work participation rates in the conference bill and the real rates, once loopholes are taken into consideration. 
<center><P>
<table border>
<tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Nominal Participation Rates</th><th>Real Participation Rates</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>1996</td><td>15%</td><td>10.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1997</td><td>20%</td><td>14%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1998</td><td>25%</td><td>17.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1999</td><td>30%</td><td>21%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2000</td><td>35%</td><td>24.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2001</td><td>40%</td><td>28%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2002</td><td>50%</td><td>35%</td>
</tr></table></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, in the typical state, some 10 percent of AFDC recipients already are employed, voluntarily, in part-time jobs and can properly be counted toward the state work requirement rate. This means that, in the typical state, only 25 percent of AFDC recipients would be required to work by 2002.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even this rate is far too high for the NGA. While the NGA proposal nominally accepts the work participation rates from the conference report, the plan actually includes a cavernous loophole which effectively obliterates all work requirements. The NGA proposes to count routine caseload turnover toward the work participation rates, so any AFDC recipient who ever obtained work and left AFDC could be counted toward the participation requirement. It is important to note that there always has been a considerable turnover in the AFDC caseload. Hundreds of thousands of recipients obtain jobs and leave AFDC in any given year as an equal or greater number of persons enroll. This routine turnover occurs even when total AFDC caseloads are rising rapidly. The governors wish to be given credit for this automatic turnover and to portray the status quo as successful reform.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By claiming credit for individuals who have obtained a job and left AFDC during the last 24 months, a governor could automatically obtain a work "participation rate" of roughly 40 percent without in any way altering the existing welfare system.<sup>8</sup>  Nearly all states would be able to meet their work requirements for the next seven without the least change in the status quo. Thus, the NGA bill is almost a perfect repeat of the bogus 1988 reform. Once again, complicated sham work requirements will be substituted for the real thing.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration is enthusiastic about counting normal caseload turnover as "work."  Very similar "credit for turnover" provisions played a key role in the Democratic alternative reform legislation rejected earlier this year in the House and Senate. Congressional Republicans at the time denounced these provisions as a crude effort to deceive the voters. It would be ironic if a Republican-controlled Congress now embraced the same deception.
<p>

<b>BUT ISN'T ENDING AFDC ENTITLEMENTS THE KEY TO REFORM?</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is true that the NGA plan does end the entitlement status of AFDC and eliminates many of the unnecessary restrictions in the existing AFDC code, thereby giving greater flexibility to the states.<sup>9</sup>  Replacing automatic entitlement funding with block grants also imposes greater fiscal discipline on each state. Under the current entitlement system, when a state expands its AFDC caseload, it gets an automatic increase in federal AFDC funds. If a state shrinks its caseload, its federal funding is cut. If the current automatic entitlement funding mechanism were replaced by a block grant system, each state would be given a fixed amount. Since the block grant amount would not expand automatically if a state's AFDC caseload grew, a block grant funding system would give states a greater incentive to curtail caseload growth.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current entitlement nature of AFDC is objectionable and should be eliminated. However, eliminating entitlement status alone is not reform, or even a small part of reform. The impact of eliminating the entitlement nature of AFDC has been greatly overrated. Under the current funding system, states must match federal AFDC funding in the state (generally the state pays 40 to 50 percent of total AFDC costs within the state). Thus, states always have had a strong financial incentive to curtail AFDC caseload growth; this, however, has not prevented the program from swelling to the point where one out of five children receives benefits each year.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been recent efforts to exaggerate the importance of ending AFDC's entitlement status. For example, it has been claimed that ending the entitlement status and "block granting" were the only welfare goals of the Reagan Administration. This is misleading. A hallmark of welfare policy under President Reagan was the effort to establish national work requirements for welfare recipients. Bills to accomplish this aim were introduced year after year during the Reagan presidency.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, eliminating AFDC entitlements would have only a modest effect on reform. Other far more significant factors in shaping reform at the state level are the overall framing of the welfare debate and the shaping of public expectations; the actual goal of reform in the minds of decision makers; the momentum of past policies; the vast influence of the state welfare bureaucracies; and the explicit goals, incentives, and requirements established by the federal government.<sup>10</sup>

<p>
<b>OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE NGA PLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan would create a huge performance incentive fund, costing roughly $6 billion over the next seven years. This fund -- a central feature of the Clinton reform strategy -- would provide cash bonuses to states which have higher rates of AFDC mothers obtaining jobs. This is a very limited and illogical measure of success. For example, increasing marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births would have far more beneficial effects on children and society than merely increasing employment of single mothers. But the NGA plan is indifferent or hostile to the issues of illegitimacy and marriage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the more limited perspective of reducing welfare dependence, the NGA plan is illogical. 
Welfare dependence can be reduced by six means:
<p><ul>
<li> Reducing illegitimacy;<P>
<li> Reducing divorce;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among women who have had children out of wedlock but have not yet enrolled in welfare;<P>
<li> Encouraging single mothers to take jobs before they enter AFDC;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among welfare mothers; and<p>
<li> Having welfare mothers obtain jobs.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employment of welfare mothers is, in fact, the least effective of these six mechanisms for purposes of shrinking dependence, reducing child poverty, and enhancing the well-being of children. However, employing welfare mothers is the mechanism which least disrupts the ideological status quo and it is attractive to the huge welfare bureaucracy, whose material interests require a growing population of welfare recipients needing more and more services, such as daycare and training. Hence, despite its irrationality, the employment of welfare mothers remains the almost exclusive focus of the NGA plan. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan thus is narrowly focused on the least effective means of reducing dependence and the one which is least beneficial to children. Under the proposal, states which concentrate on other aspects of reform would bear a heavy financial penalty. But by encouraging states to focus on the least effective and least desirable means of reducing dependence, the governor's plan actually will slow the reduction of welfare dependence.<sup>11</sup> 
<p>

<b>Rewards for Bogus "Success" </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA's focus on "exits from welfare," borrowed from the Clinton Administration, is illogical. The evidence indicates that serious work requirements have their strongest impact not by encouraging people to leave welfare, but by reducing the number of persons who bother to apply for welfare in the first place. Similarly, a state which restricts welfare entry to the truly needy (those who are the least able to support themselves) almost certainly will have proportionally fewer "exits" from the welfare caseload than would states with more liberal entrance standards.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The entire notion of measuring success in welfare by caseload exits makes no sense. It is like measuring success in the war on drugs not by a decline in drug use, but by an increase in the number of persons passing through rehabilitation, or judging the nation's health by counting the number of successful exits from hospitals -- a criterion which might be popular among hospital administrators but would make no sense for society at large. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, there is little relationship between "employment exits" and the level of welfare dependence or caseload size. In the NGA plan, there is no requirement that "successful" states actually lower caseloads. States would be rewarded for "success" even when their caseloads were consistently growing. If, for example, the NGA "performance incentive fund" had been created seven years ago, states automatically would have been rewarded with billions for "success," year after year, while their AFDC caseloads were growing between 25 and 30 percent. Unfortunately, the creation of bogus measurements of successful reform is no accident -- such measures are a key element in the welfare industry's strategy to forestall real change.
<p>
<b>Anti-Marriage Bias</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the limited perspective of promoting welfare exits, the NGA plan is inconsistent. The NGA bureaucrats would reward states when a single mother gets a job and leaves welfare, but give no reward if a mother marries and gets off welfare -- even though the marriage is far more effective in reducing long-term dependence and poverty. In keeping with the prevailing ideology of the nation's welfare establishment, the NGA plan is heavily biased against marriage and focused on obtaining employment for single mothers.
<p>
<b>No Real Money for Reducing Illegitimacy </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vetoed House-Senate conference bill did contain a fund to reward states which reduced illegitimacy without increasing abortions, and the NGA plan retained this. However, it is useful to compare this illegitimacy reduction bonus fund with the NGA's "performance incentive fund," which rewards the employment of AFDC mothers. The performance incentive fund rewards states on a comparative or relative scale; states would be ranked, and states with higher employment records relative to other states would be given substantial bonuses. Such a comparative reward system creates automatic winners; cash incentives will be paid out automatically under the plan even if the overall level of real performance remains the same or deteriorates. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, the illegitimacy ratio bonus fund is linked to absolute -- not relative -- performance, so a state must achieve a real reduction in its illegitimacy ratio (the proportion of births which are out of wedlock) in order to receive a reward. The requirements are very difficult to achieve -- so much so that little or no bonus money actually will be paid from this fund. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA thus has adopted very tough absolute standards for rewarding illegitimacy reduction but lax comparative standards for rewarding employment. Yet the latter standards guarantee winners. Consequently, under the NGA plan, little or no money would be paid to reward states for efforts to reduce illegitimacy, while $6 billion in rewards would be given automatically for efforts to employ welfare mothers. Once again, the NGA's relentless bias against promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is apparent. 

<p>
<b>Large Increases in Mandatory Day Care Funding</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The House-Senate conference bill increased federal daycare funding by $2 billion over seven years. The NGA plan would require another $4 billion. Overall, this means that federal daycare funding would be increased by a third. States would be required to spend all the increased funds on daycare even if they would prefer to spend it on other services to the poor.
<P>
<b>Family Cap </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conference bill prohibited states from using federal funds to give higher welfare benefits to women who have children out of wedlock while already enrolled in AFDC; states could choose to "opt out" of this restriction by enacting specific legislation. The governors' plan eliminates the family cap provision entirely. As under current law, states could have a family cap if they wish, but there is no legal impetus for them to do so.<sup>12</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The family cap is not only sound policy; it is widely supported by the public. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."<sup>13</sup>  The popularity of the family cap is so great that the Clinton Administration does not publicly oppose the policy. Nor did the White House cite the inclusion of the family cap provision as a reason for its veto of the House/Senate conference bill.
<p>

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Contract With America advanced three principles of welfare reform:  promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy, requiring work, and increasing state flexibility. The NGA plan abandons the first two of these principles despite the fact that they are supported overwhelmingly by the public. Real welfare reform must carry out the principles of the Contract.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Restoring a sensible debate on marriage and illegitimacy is crucial. This issue has been trivialized or ignored by those pretending it is merely a question of whether the family cap provision in the House/Senate conference bill should be retained or eliminated. In reality, conservatives have proposed nearly a dozen national measures aimed at reducing illegitimacy. Many were included in the Contract With America. But in each case, they have been resisted by the Washington establishment and, one by one, they have been whittled away. What is now required is a complete reorientation of the debate back to the topic of illegitimacy, and the establishment of multiple measures to deal with the problem. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to produce real reform, the following ten steps are needed.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1)</b> The leadership of the House and Senate should assert publicly that reducing illegitimacy is the key goal in welfare reform and should commit to an ongoing effort to use the "bully pulpit" to raise concern about the collapse of marriage in society.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2)</b> The family cap provision of the conference bill (with the opt out clause) should be retained in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3)</b> The illegitimacy reduction bonus fund established in the conference bill is a good idea and should be retained. However, the criteria for successful performance are so strict that even those states which make serious attempts to reduce illegitimacy will be unlikely to achieve them. Of course, incentive bonuses which are nearly unobtainable are not likely to have much effect on state plans and activities. The success criteria for this fund should be softened to give states a more realistic opportunity to obtain the bonuses. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4)</b> The NGA performance incentive fund rewards only employment by welfare mothers, even though this is the least effective and least desirable way of reducing dependence. The fund should be altered to reward a composite score of all of the following:  a reduced illegitimacy rate, reduced divorce rate, reduced AFDC application rate, increased AFDC employment exits, and increased AFDC marital exits. Moreover, states should be rewarded only if caseload and illegitimacy actually are declining.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5)</b> States should be given the option of providing food commodities rather than food stamp coupons to AFDC mothers and retaining any resultant savings for other anti-poverty efforts. By reducing the attractiveness of the welfare life-style, this policy has the potential to greatly reduce future out-of-wedlock births.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6)</b> The amount of funding in the conference bill's abstinence program should be increased from $75 million to $200 million per year in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>7)</b> Each state should be required to submit a plan showing how it intends to reduce illegitimacy. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>8)</b> Within the existing AFDC program, a new set-aside fund should be established providing $300 million per year for states to devise their own programs to reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion (with firm evaluations required).
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>9)</b> The work requirements in the conference bill should not be weakened or undermined through the governors' proposal to count employment exits. Performance goals should not be linked to exits in any way, since the best reform schemes will reduce enrollments rather than increase exits. The hourly work requirements for AFDC recipients, especially AFDC-UP fathers, should not be reduced.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>10)</b> Under the bill, daycare funds could be spent only for daycare even if the governors wish to use them for other services for the poor. This "lock in" of the daycare money should be eliminated in future legislation.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On the crucial issues of work and illegitimacy, the NGA plan resembles the Democratic alternative bills introduced in the House and Senate much more closely than it does the original Contract With America. Indeed, the work requirements in the NGA plan actually are weaker than those in either Democratic bill.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The welfare "reform" proposed by the National Governors' Association is, in reality, an anti-reform. The NGA has abandoned the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy. Instead, NGA officials call for a massive investment in government daycare for an expanding population of single-parent families. The NGA seeks to abolish the work requirements in the conference bill passed by the House and Senate and to substitute sham requirements in their place. The bill is biased against marriage. The NGA has adopted a reward and incentive system which has as its exclusive goal the employment of single mothers despite the fact that this is the least effective means of reducing dependence and improving children's well-being.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sham reforms such as that proposed by the NGA are very harmful. By creating the illusion of reform, bogus reform reduces public pressure for change and thereby helps to preserve the existing system. The bogus welfare reforms of 1988, created in large part by the NGA, delayed action on real reform for nearly a decade. This sad mistake should not be repeated.

<li>Statement on "Welfare Reform" as adopted by the governors on February 6, 1996.<p>
<li>In an February 29, 1996, article in the <I>Washington Times</I>, entitled "Can Welfare Reform Survive Friendly Fire?"  Robert Carleson maintains that the National Governors' Association did not ignore the catastrophic rise in illegitimacy. Carleson cites "findings" contained in the welfare legislation passed last year by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton. The findings say that illegitimacy is harmful. It is important to note, however, that these findings are merely rhetorical and are not linked to policy. It is true that the NGA, as a practical matter, used the conference bill passed by Congress as a textual base and amended it to produce its own proposed policy. But one can be quite certain that no governor actually looked at the huge conference tome, and it would be very surprising if any governor was aware of the few paragraphs of legally irrelevant "findings" buried deep within the 650-page conference document. Certainly no one at the NGA seems to have regarded these forlorn paragraphs as important. All one need do is listen to the NGA's own words. In its official statement of policy, reducing illegitimacy is not mentioned as a goal or "crucial element" of reform, and the NGA, of course, makes not the slightest reference to the "findings" on illegitimacy. <p>
<li>See Patrick F. Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation <I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 19, June 29, 1994. See also Patrick F. Fagan, "The Real Root Causes of Violent Crime:  The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1026, March 17, 1995.<p>
<li>Some of the "work" requirements in the conference bill are illusory; for example, individuals who have received AFDC for over two years are required to "work," but a state may count one hour of job search per year as "working."  These "requirements" are very similar to the cosmetic provisions of the sham reform of 1988. However, the work provisions of Section 407 of the bill are quite different, and for the first time in the history of AFDC, require a certain percentage of recipients actually to work <p>
<li>Another loophole permits states to subtract women with children under age one from the denominator for purposes of calculating their work participation rate. Such women comprise about 10 percent of the AFDC caseload; excluding them from the caseload count effectively cuts the required work participation rates by 10 percent.<P>
<li>It is important to understand the distinction between routine caseload turnover and net caseload reduction. With caseload turnover, a certain number of persons leave the welfare rolls but an equal or greater number enter; the total size of the caseload remains the same or increases. With net caseload reduction, the actual number of persons on welfare declines due to a drop in enrollments or an increase in exits which exceeds new enrollments. Caseload turnover is omnipresent and meaningless; it not a valid measure of success in reducing dependence. Caseload reduction is difficult to achieve and has rarely occurred in the history of AFDC. The goal of welfare reform is not to increase the number of persons cycled through the welfare system (although the welfare bureaucracy would like such a goal); it is to reduce the level of dependence. Caseload reduction is a proper measure of that goal. The House-Senate conference bill established performance standards which gave states proper credit for anti-dependency efforts which resulted in real caseload reduction, but not for mere turnover.<p>
<li>NGA bureaucrats in fact are demanding any individual who has ever obtained a job and left AFDC be counted toward the state's work participation rate. The figures become very complex since these individuals would be counted in both numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating the participation rate. However, the bottom line is simple:  Even if caseload turnover only for the prior six months is counted, the actual work standards in the bill would be gutted, at least through the end of this century.<p>
<li>In particular, the plan would eliminate the current JOBS program, which has made it difficult for states to operate serious workfare programs.<p>
<li>However, some proponents of the NGA plan regard ending the entitlement nature of AFDC not only as the most important, but as the only acceptable element of reform. Such individuals tend to adhere to the philosophy of "value neutral revenue sharing."  Under this doctrine, the federal government should collect the revenue for the welfare system and hand it over to state governments with no requirement other than that the funds be spent to aid the poor. According to this narrow doctrine, most of the welfare provisions of the Contract With America (and especially those dealing with work and illegitimacy) are not only unnecessary, but also highly objectionable. From this perspective, "success" in welfare reform necessarily means opposing and eliminating most of the Contract's welfare provisions as unwanted impediments on the states. Not surprisingly, the NGA plan draws very high praise from adherents of this view. However, this seems to be a perspective which is not widely shared.<p>
<li>It could be argued reasonably that the rewards and incentives provided in the NGA plan are irrational but that this fact is of lessened importance because it is greatly outweighed by the impact of removing the AFDC entitlement funding mechanism. In this view, giving each state a fixed-sum block grant creates an implicit fiscal discipline which will drive states to pursue rational means to reduce dependency, irrespective of the explicit, contrary system of goals and bonus incentives. However, in the experience of this writer, explicit goals, reform concepts, and rewards play a very large role in shaping the outlook of state-level bureaucrats and decision makers, a role which greatly outweighs any implicit fiscal impetus. <p>
<li>Under the current law, a state government must request a federal waiver to enact the family cap. Under the NGA plan, a waiver would no longer be needed.<p>
<li>Family Research Council poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, mid-October 1995. The poll surveyed 1,000 randomly selected American adults about their views on welfare and social issues and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel long has sought a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors, and has made great progress since the landmark 1991 peace conference in Madrid. It signed a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 and concluded a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. But negotiations with Syria have proceeded at a glacial pace. One of the major obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations has been Syrian insistence on recovering the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, without ironclad security guarantees that Syria would not use the Golan as a staging area for aggression against Israel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has tried to bridge the negotiating gap by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor compliance with any agreement, but it has resisted congressional calls to examine the wisdom of such a commitment, claiming that a public debate would be premature. Administration officials contend that the details of a peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights have not been worked out and a final commitment has not been made. However, Defense Secretary William Perry, after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on January 8, confirmed the Clinton Administration's long-standing offer to provide U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor the Golan Heights. Although Perry had said last September that the U.S. "should be willing" to contribute forces that would facilitate a peace accord, he recently firmed up the U.S. offer by proclaiming, "we are prepared to do that."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress Should Hold Hearings.</b> Now that Secretary Perry has explicitly made this offer, Congress should hold hearings to examine the potential costs and benefits of this commitment. It also should press the Administration to reconsider its risky plans to enter such an open-ended peacekeeping operation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Administration has resisted congressional scrutiny of the Golan peacekeeping question, arguing that it could complicate efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. While this may be true, the Administration would be wise to gauge congressional support for a possible Golan peacekeeping operation now, rather than risk having an agreement unravel later due to congressional disapproval.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has its own reasons for debating a Golan peacekeeping commitment sooner rather than later, as underscored by the recent experience in Bosnia. The rapid pace of developments in the Bosnian peace negotiations greatly limited congressional debate, with U.S. troops being deployed to Bosnia only 11 days after the November 21, 1995, signing of the Dayton peace accords. While the pace of Syrian-Israeli negotiations is likely to be slower, Congress must address the Golan peacekeeping issue before, not after, the Israelis and Syrians negotiate a deal if it wants to avoid being presented with another diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i> by the Clinton Administration.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel is a sovereign state, and it is Israel's prerogative to negotiate whatever diplomatic arrangements it finds necessary to assure its security and promote peace. Washington should actively support efforts to build a just and lasting Arab-Israeli peace.<sup>2</sup>  But when America is asked to ensure the implementation of an agreement which entails obvious risks to American peacekeepers, the U.S. Congress has a right and duty to examine the risks and benefits of such a commitment, as it would do with any other peacekeeping commitment.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Congress examines the Golan Heights peacekeeping issue, it should bear in mind that American troops should not be involved in such a mission. There are five reasons for this conclusion.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing U.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula. Unlike the American troops assigned to the multinational peacekeeping force on the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai since 1982, peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be sandwiched between two large armored forces in a much smaller area. Moreover, Syria historically has been much more hostile to the U.S. than has Egypt, which is now a U.S. ally. Thus, a Golan peacekeeping operation would be much riskier.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. U.S. peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be close to southern Lebanon, which is a major staging area for numerous terrorist groups that oppose Arab-Israeli peace.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. An American presence on the Golan will constrain Israel's military options more than Syria's and will sap Israel's self-reliance. In the long run, this could strain U.S.-Israel relations.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. A small force will be unable to defend itself against possible terrorist or Syrian military attacks, while a large force will be a major drain on active U.S. Army forces.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. Other countries can play the same peacekeeping role. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, comprised of troops from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland, has been deployed on the Golan for almost 22 years to monitor the 1974 Syrian-Israeli Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under no circumstances should the U.S. promise foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. The prospective recovery of the Golan Heights and peace itself are Syria's peace dividends. Moreover, the U.S. should remember that it has important national interests to advance regarding Syria that go beyond brokering a Syrian-Israeli peace agreement. Congress must prevent the Administration's preoccupation with the peace process from obscuring American interests in halting Syrian support of terrorism, promoting Lebanon's independence from Syrian domination, ending Syrian subversion of Turkey, halting drug smuggling in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, and isolating Syria's ally Iran.
<p>

<b>THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Golan Heights comprise some of the most strategically significant terrain in the world. Occupying its high forward slopes gives Israel line-of-sight surveillance of Syrian military movements and electronic communications. Electronic intelligence-gathering facilities in the Golan provide early warning of threatening developments in the plains southwest of the Syrian capital of Damascus, or in south Lebanon. Control of the Golan also provides Israel, a small country, with something it badly needs:  a buffer zone to give it strategic depth. Before losing the Heights in 1967, Syria used its commanding position on the Golan to bombard the Israeli settlements in the nearby Galilee region. Highly lucrative agricultural and tourist sites around the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) now are safe. Finally, the Golan highlands form a watershed that supplies approximately 30 percent of Israel's water. Dominating the Golan watershed means potential control of this vital freshwater resource. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For these strategic reasons, most past Israeli governments, whether led by the Labor or Likud parties, have not been willing to withdraw from the Golan, which the Israel Defense Force (IDF) captured in a bold and courageous operation in 1967. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin began direct negotiations with Syria under American auspices after his June 1992 election, but declined to specify how far Israel would withdraw on the Golan until Damascus made clear what kind of peace and security arrangements it was willing to make. Syria's Hafez al-Assad broke off the talks in July 1995, insisting on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights. After Rabin's November 4 assassination, his successor, former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, dropped Rabin's insistence that security arrangements be dealt with first.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Peres used his December 12, 1995, speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress to appeal to Assad to resume the talks. Assad agreed and the talks were revived on December 27. Two rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks already have been held at the Wye Plantation in eastern Maryland, and a third round began on January 23. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has offered to undertake open-ended shuttle diplomacy between the two countries to bridge the still-wide gaps. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though Israel is eager to make peace and maintain the momentum generated by the diplomatic breakthrough with the Palestinians reached in Oslo in 1993, many Israelis are deeply concerned about the potential threat to their security if the IDF withdraws and the Syrian army moves back onto the Golan. The position of the Peres government is that the benefits of a deal with Syria outweigh the risks and that Israel must deal now, while the opportunity exists, and while Israel is in a position of strength. But most Israelis nevertheless believe that only extraordinary security guarantees can make the return of the Golan to Syria acceptable. 

<p>
<b>FIVE REASONS TO REJECT U.S. PEACEKEEPING IN THE GOLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One possible guarantee is the deployment of U.S. troops on the Golan, either as part of a multinational operation or alone, and either in a pure "peacekeeping" role or as a kind of tripwire to hedge against renewed hostilities from Syria. This possibility has been a matter of speculation in Washington for over two years. The Clinton Administration has aggressively discouraged congressional consideration of the issue, maintaining that it is premature to address the issue of an American peacekeeping force on the Golan.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Secretary Perry's January 8 statement indicating that the U.S. is prepared to deploy a Golan peacekeeping force has considerably undermined this argument. Congress soon must consider the implications of a U.S. peacekeeping deployment on the Golan, or it will find itself reacting to a diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>, as in Bosnia. While examining the Golan peacekeeping issue, Congress should bear in mind five reasons that the U.S. should reject a U.S. peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing mission on the Sinai Peninsula. U.S. and Israeli officials often cite the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which monitors compliance with the security arrangements in the Sinai peninsula, as a model for an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan. The MFO, created in 1982 to monitor compliance with the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, is composed of three battalions of troops from Colombia, Fiji, and the U.S. and a Civilian Observer Unit staffed with American personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, however, would operate in a markedly different geographic, military, and political environment. Rather than being deployed in a vast, empty desert far from the main bodies of the opposing military forces, Golan peacekeepers would be stationed in a constricted area, sandwiched between large armored forces in positions that would quickly become important military objectives if fighting were to break out. Unlike the remote, sparsely populated Sinai, the Golan also would be a more hospitable operating theater for terrorists based in neighboring Lebanon or among civilians living in the Golan Heights. Finally, Hafez al-Assad's Syria today is a far cry from Anwar Sadat's Egypt. Not only has Syria supported terrorists that have killed Americans and provoked military clashes with the U.S. in Lebanon in 1983, but Assad is extremely unlikely to become a reliable U.S. ally in the future, unlike Sadat's Egypt.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much depends on the details of an Israel-Syrian treaty. If an agreement leads to the removal of a standing Syrian mechanized army within 40 kilometers of the Golan, then U.S. troops, as in the Sinai MFO, might play a useful role in monitoring or verifying compliance with the treaty. But if large Syrian forces remain deployed close by and a significant potential security threat remains, then a mere monitoring mission makes little sense. In essence, the U.S. force would be serving as a deterrent or tripwire to prevent Syria reverting to the use of arms.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There also are major questions about size, composition, mission, and command and control of the Golan force. An MFO-like monitoring force would be small and lightly armed. But a small, light force would have difficulty protecting itself from terror attacks emanating from Lebanon, let alone a Syrian military offensive. Therefore, a U.S. peacekeeping force in the Golan would have to be large enough to deter attacks from any source and defend itself. In other words, it must be a large combat formation, configured for possible combat, with appropriate rules of engagement. But a large force, such as an armored or mechanized infantry brigade, would be costly and a drain on the U.S. military presence in more important regions such as Europe or South Korea.<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. Unlike the Sinai MFO, Golan peacekeepers would be vulnerable to significant terrorist threats. They would be stationed close to southern and eastern Lebanon, the staging area for some of the world's most dangerous terrorists, including Hezbollah, the militant pro-Iranian terrorist group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups operating in Lebanon have a history of attacking Americans. They will have even more reason to use terrorism to disrupt an American-brokered peace agreement that they violently oppose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Syria itself is one of the chief exporters of international terrorism.<sup>3</sup>  Assad repeatedly has used terrorism as an adjunct of foreign policy in inter-Arab politics, in Lebanon, and against Israel. He also supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in 1983-1984. Given his success in helping Hezbollah to drive U.S. peacekeepers out of Lebanon in 1984, Assad may try a similar strategy in the Golan if he decides to seek their removal. Even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, however, Iran, Iraq, and Libya could support Lebanon-based terrorist proxies against U.S. forces in the Golan. Since U.S. troops will be a lightning rod for terrorism, particularly due to American brokering of a Syrian-Israel peace accord, a Golan peacekeeping operation should not be manned by Americans.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. A peacekeeping force is supposed to be a neutral, honest broker, but maintaining a neutral stance is likely to have a negative political, military, and psychological impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. This would be particularly true if the U.S. maintains strict neutrality with respect to Israel and Syria in the implementation of any agreement. At a minimum, sharp differences of opinion are likely to arise concerning compliance issues and the interpretation of Syrian activities along the border. Deeper strains in the bilateral relationship could occur if Israel concluded that the peacekeeping forces were turning a blind eye to Syrian violations of the peace treaty or if Washington concluded that Israel was overreacting to minor or ambiguous Syrian violations. It should be remembered that American participation in the 1982-1984 multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon led to considerable friction with Israel and at one point an American Marine officer brandished a pistol to halt the advance of an Israeli tank.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A U.S. presence on the Golan also will sap Israeli self-reliance. Because Syria adamantly rejects allowing Israel to maintain early warning facilities in the Golan as an infringement on its sovereignty, Israel is likely to become more dependent on U.S. spy satellites and aircraft. The U.S. presence also will put a brake on Israeli military operations in the event of conflict with Syria or terrorists in Lebanon. Their presence will constrain Israel's military options, possibly depriving Israel of the opportunity to launch a preemptive military strike if a Syrian attack was imminent. Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked. They are likely to constitute only a marginal military deterrent to Syria and they will be unable to provide adequate early warning to Israel.<sup>4</sup>  The real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the U.S. will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts. This is dangerous because it could engender a false sense of security that could lead Israelis to take more risks in peace negotiations with Syria than they otherwise would take.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. The U.S. cannot afford to commit an ever-larger proportion of its declining active duty forces to worldwide peacekeeping operations. Sending U.S. troops to Haiti and Bosnia already has depleted America's strategic reserve and could jeopardize American interests by stretching U.S. forces thin around the world. It should be remembered that the peacekeeping commitments to Haiti and Bosnia, and now possibly on the Golan as well, were made in addition to the existing military alliance commitments in Europe and Asia -- and even as the Clinton Administration is trying to cut the defense budget even further.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For a Golan peacekeeping mission to be credible, it would require the commitment of a large force consisting of at least a heavy brigade, roughly 5,000 troops. To maintain a long term deployment of this force, three brigades would have to be dedicated to the mission:  one on deployment, one recovering and retraining after returning from the mission, and one training and preparing to deploy on the mission. This is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength, a prohibitively high burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission. If the U.S. is suddenly faced with conflict in other regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula, the forces on the Golan could be sorely needed to protect vital U.S. national interests.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to diverting troops from other, more important missions, an open-ended peacekeeping mission on the Golan will reduce the military effectiveness of troops available for other missions. Troops returning from the Golan will need many months of retraining to regain the warfighting skills that atrophied during their peacekeeping deployment.<sup>5</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American Golan peacekeeping commitment also would entail considerable financial costs, and could drain away hundreds of millions of dollars from the defense budget. Congress already has scaled back the U.S. contribution to the Sinai MFO budget, cutting it from $80 million to $74 million in fiscal year 1988. Similar budgetary pressures could undercut a Golan MFO, even if other nations contribute to the costs of the operation.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. If peacekeepers are needed to monitor a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, they should not be Americans. An American peacekeeping presence would be a lightning rod for terrorism, would drain the U.S. defense budget unnecessarily, and would strain Israeli-American relations. Other countries are willing and fully able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces. After all, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has deployed peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to blocking an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights, Congress should press the Clinton Administration to:
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Rule out foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. To make it clear that no U.S. aid will be forthcoming to sweeten a Syrian-Israeli deal, Congress should pass a resolution opposing U.S. foreign aid to Syria. The reward for peace is peace, not billions of dollars of bribery. America's aid to Egypt, a country which did not launch terrorist attacks against Americans, came after the 1978 Camp David accords and in the context of the Cold War. Egypt switched sides and left the Soviet orbit to become a reliable American ally. Syria has no Soviet card to play. The U.S. must allocate its increasingly scarce foreign aid resources to long-term friends and not use foreign aid as a reward to Syria, a long-standing adversary. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Maintain pressure on Syria to halt its support of terrorism. Damascus supports over one dozen terrorist groups, including many Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The U.S. should push Syria relentlessly to expel these Palestinians from Syrian territory and Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory, crack down on Hezbollah in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and cooperate with the U.S. in breaking the back of international terrorist groups. There can be no genuine peace as long as Syria maintains ties with terrorists. Congress should ensure that the war against terrorism remains a high priority of U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, Syria should not be removed from the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism unless Damascus halts its support for terrorism. Syria should not be removed from the list merely as a reward for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights is not needed. It would not significantly reduce the military risks that Israel would run in returning the Golan to Syrian control. The U.S. cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit. Nor should it seek to downplay the significant military risks attendant on returning the Golan Heights to Syria. If Israel decides to do so, that is its prerogative, but it should do so without the implied commitment represented by a U.S. tripwire on the Golan. There are many other nations that would be willing to provide peacekeeping forces, if that is necessary.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress must open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another <i>fait accompli</i> like Haiti or Bosnia. Now that Secretary of Defense Perry has confirmed that a U.S. commitment of some sort exists, it can no longer be deemed "premature" for Congress to discuss the issue.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The bottom line:  Syria gets more out of a peace agreement with Israel than does the U.S. and therefore should be willing to pay more for it. Washington should push Assad to acquiesce to America's agenda and not get bogged down in more narrow peace negotiating issues. The U.S. must not jeopardize important national interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic.

<h3>A Tale of Two Pesos:  A Comparison of Currency Policies In Mexico and Argentina</h3>




<b>By Steve H. Hanke<sup>1</sup></b><br>Delivered December 12, 1995<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A sound currency is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the establishment of a stable government and the promotion of economic prosperity. This theme has been sounded over and over again by virtually all great economists in positions of influence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After suffering the trauma of the 1922-1923 hyperinflation, no people has taken the call for sound currency and credit systems more to heart than the Germans. As West Germany's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, put it:  "Safeguarding the currency forms the prime condition for maintaining a market economy and, ultimately, a free constitution for society and the state" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30). Not surprisingly, Adenauer's economics minister, Ludwig Erhard, went so far as to proclaim that monetary stability was a basic human right. These sentiments are shared by all political parties in Germany. Indeed, one of the pithiest pronouncements on the need for sound money was uttered in parliamentary debate by Karl Schiller, the Social Democratic economics minister from 1966 to 1972:  "Stability is not everything, but without stability, everything is nothing" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The German views on sound money are enshrined in the Bundesbank Law of 1957. That law charges the central bank with one and only one objective:  to defend the value of the German mark. And that is just what the Bundesbank does. Indeed, in the post-Bretton Woods era, the mighty mark has been the world's most stable currency (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). This performance is, of course, music to the ears of most Germans:  a recent poll found that almost 80 percent of the Germans identify their Germanness with the stability, strength, and international prestige of the mark (Nash, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After bearing the burden of one of the world's most unstable currencies for decades, Argentineans appear to be following the path of the Germans (Hanke, 1995). In Argentina's most recent presidential election, all three major parties (which accounted for 96.2 percent of the popular vote) supported Argentina's Convertibility Law (Law 23.928). Under this law, which has governed monetary policy since April 1, 1991, the Argentine peso is fully backed by U.S. dollar denominated assets and is freely convertible at an absolutely fixed exchange rate of one peso for one dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In contrast, Mexico's monetary policy is in disarray. Although Mexicans yearn for a sound peso, politicians from the three major parties and the technocrats who advise them have not been able to agree on a well defined exchange rate policy. The Banco de Mexico has allowed the peso to collapse during the last four presidential election periods and consequently has the distinction of being one the world's worst central banks (101st out of 108), judged on the basis of currency stability (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). Given this, it is not surprising that the Banco has been unable to establish a transparent exchange rate policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Banco de Mexico's monetary policy remains incoherent. Indeed, the numbers contained in the Banco's monetary plan for 1996 are not plausible. The Banco assumes that real GDP and inflation will increase by 3 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively, and that the monetary base will increase by 28.6 percent during 1996. This implies that the demand for pesos will dramatically increase and that the velocity of money will dramatically decline to    -5 percent. Given the historical record in Mexico, this is highly unlikely (I.D.E. A. and the London School of Economics, 1995). Indeed, for velocity to decline to -5 percent, inflation would have to decline from 53 percent in 1995 to around 20 percent in 1996, and more important, such a drop in inflation and a stable exchange rate would have to be the prevailing expectation. Such a shift in expectations is highly unlikely, particularly given the central bank's low level of credibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, it is important to mention that Mexico -- unlike Argentina and Chile, for example -- has also failed to produce a coherent program to cut public spending and to privatize and deregulate its economy. As the <i>Economist</i> magazine put in its recent  <i>Survey of Mexico</i>, "much of the economic liberalization of recent years has not been up to scratch. Privatization sometimes merely served to replace public monopolies with private ones -- amid much scattering of lucrative favors....  [And] financial reform was late and poorly regulated."  (<i>Economist</i>, October 28, 1995, p. 15). If this is not bad enough, Mexico continues to embrace the principle of wage-price controls. This principle was enshrined in October 1995, with the approval of yet another pact, the Alliance for Economic Recuperation (DePalma, October 30, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An incoherent monetary policy and half-baked economic liberalization are hardly the foundation upon which to build stability and robust economic growth. Indeed, this combination of policies is a recipe for continued financial and political turmoil in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To avoid future turmoil, Mexico must correctly define its exchange rate regime. Exchange rate regimes come in three varieties:  pegged (fixed, but adjustable), floating, and fixed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Pegged exchange rates are favored by most developing countries. Some developed countries, most notably those that are members of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, also employ pegged exchange rates. This regime is not a free-market mechanism for international payments. It is an interventionist system, and should be rejected on principle.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In practice, pegged exchange rate regimes, not surprisingly, do not perform well. They require central banks to manage simultaneously a currency's exchange rate, the domestic liquidity, and the capital account. This is a tricky, if not impossible, task, particularly in developing countries, where the instruments for discretionary monetary policies are limited (Fry, 1995). Consequently, a pegged rate inevitably results in contradictory policies that invite a speculative attack. When under siege, a peg cannot last unless interest rates are raised to sky-high levels or foreign exchange controls are imposed. Alas, such episodes usually get out of hand and result in an "adjustment" to the peg (a devaluation).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is what happened with Mexico's old pegged system in which the peso was linked to the U.S. dollar. Under that peg, the peso was allowed to trade within a tolerance band of some plus or minus 3 percent. The band "crawled" downward daily, allowing an annual peso depreciation of about 4 percent against the dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To keep the peso within this band, the Mexican central bank had to manage at the same time both the peso-dollar exchange rate and the peso money supply. This is a difficult balancing act, as Mexico discovered in 1994, and as members of the ERM discovered in 1992 and 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Interestingly, Lord Keynes anticipated the difficulties posed by pegged systems. As he put it in 1923, "we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose" (Keynes, 1971, p. 126). Alas, despite the evidence, advocates of pegged exchange rates are alive and well. Indeed, some research institutions, notably the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., are evangelical in their promotion of pegged systems (Bergston and Williamson, 1983).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put the failure of pegged exchange rates into a broader context -- particularly in developing countries, where they are almost universally used -- consider the performance of central banks in developing countries since 1971, when the U.S. closed the gold window (Schuler, 1995). The median annual rate of inflation of the 126 developing countries with central banks has been double that of the 19 developed countries. And 37 developing countries have experienced annual inflation from 100 percent to 999 percent, and 19 have endured hyperinflation of over 1,000 percent per year. In the same period, 13 developing countries have confiscated their currencies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the currencies of the developing countries have lost most of their value relative to the U.S. dollar. The median depreciation has been 79 percent since 1970. And if you reside in a developing country, it is difficult to legally avoid the effects of currency depreciation because 88 percent of those countries impose some form of exchange controls.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And here's the saddest part:  The low-quality junk money produced by the central banks in developing countries has been a drag on per capita economic growth. Since 1971, the developed countries have grown at almost twice the rate of the developing nations,
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an attempt to avoid being robbed by their central banks, citizens in developing countries resort to all means, legal or illegal, to get their hands on "high-quality" money. Consequently, Gresham's Law in reverse is at work in most of the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As much as some might complain about the U.S. dollar, the greenback is the world's preferred currency, with the German mark coming in a distant second. Indeed, between $185 billion and $260 billion in cash is held outside the U.S. -- 50 percent to 70 percent of the total U.S. dollar notes outstanding (Blinder, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Where have all the greenbacks gone?  Between 1988-1991, most went to Latin America. Since then, Europe has been the dominant destination, with Russia demanding the lion's share. In 1994 well over half of the total foreign shipments of dollars went to Russia, a total of about $20 billion. The rate of shipments to Russia has increased in 1995, with flows running at a remarkable $100 million per business day. After Europe, the Far East and Middle East now account for about 30 percent of the shipments, and the remainder of the dollars flow to Latin America (Porter and Judson, 1995). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The export of greenbacks is a very profitable business for the U.S. No other export can match the profit margins earned by the Federal Reserve's shipments of cash overseas. The Fed prints and hands over little pieces of noninterest-bearing green paper at almost no cost and gets hard currency in exchange. This amounts to an interest-free loan from foreign holders of those pieces of green paper. The Fed then invests the proceeds in U.S. government securities and turns the profits over to the U.S. Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The profits are huge, between $11 billion to $15 billion per year -- equal to federal receipts from estate and gift taxes. Moreover, it is a growing business:  Foreign holdings of U.S. dollars are growing faster than the U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unlike pegged exchange rates, floating and fixed rates are free-market mechanisms for international payments. Under a floating regime -- such as that which governs the U.S. dollar, German mark, and Japanese yen -- a national currency seeks its own level in relation to other currencies that it floats against. Although many currencies in developed countries float, few of the developing countries float their currencies, and for those that do float, it tends to be a short-lived experiment (Schuler, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though there is nothing wrong with floating, in principle, this type of regime is plagued with practical problems in developing countries, where most central banks have very poor records and lack credibility. Consequently, to achieve price stability under a floating regime, a central bank must impose a relatively restrictive monetary policy and relatively high real interest rates for an extended period. Alas, this would be accompanied by an economic slump or very slow economic growth. This is why few developing countries have adopted floating rates. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fixed exchange rates are favored by a handful of countries -- most notably, Argentina, Estonia, Hong Kong, and Lithuania. These countries employ currency board-like systems in which their local currencies are backed 100 percent by a reserve currency and are freely convertible into the reserve currency at an absolutely fixed exchange rate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, a country operating under this discipline forgoes an independent monetary policy and becomes part of a unified currency area with the country to which its local currency is linked. Unlike floating regimes, currency boards have a rich and successful history in developing countries (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have had currency boards. The first currency board was established in 1849 in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, then a British colony. Currency boards spread to other British colonies and to independent countries that wanted to earn income from having their own currencies, yet maintain fixed exchange rates with an anchor currency. Most currency boards used the pound sterling as their anchor currency, but some used the U.S. dollar, the Australian pound, gold, or silver.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beginning about 1913, the currency board system spread rapidly, and eventually it reached almost all parts of the world. Currency boards were common in Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, the Caribbean, and Oceania. In South America, Argentina had a currency board. In 1899 Argentina passed a law re-establishing the gold standard and requiring the Caja de Conversin, previously a conduit for unbacked paper money, to hold 100 percent gold reserves for all new liabilities. The system became fully operative in 1902. The period of its operation was one of great prosperity for Argentina, which at the time was among the world's richest countries. Argentina suspended the system just after the First World War began, apparently because the government feared a drain of gold to countries that had already suspended the gold standard. Argentina re-established a currency board briefly from 1927 to 1929, but suspended it again in December 1929, as a result of the worldwide stock-market crash and the resulting cessation of foreign investment in Argentina. Both in 1914 and 1929, the gold reserves of the Caja and commercial banks were high, and the rationale for suspending the system appears dubious in retrospect (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The performance of currency boards through out the world has been excellent. All have maintained full convertibility into their anchor currencies. Furthermore, countries with boards have generally had price stability, respectable economic growth, and balanced government budgets. (Hanke and Schuler, 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What type of exchange rate regime should Mexico adopt?  A pegged system should be rejected on two counts:  it is unsound in principle, and in practice, pegged regimes have a poor record, particularly in Mexico. A floating regime, though sound in principle, is unsatisfactory for developing countries with central banks that have low credibility, such as is the case in Mexico. Alas, many free-market economists have recommended that Mexico float the peso. Two notable examples are Dr. W. Lee Hoskins and Professor Allan H. Meltzer (Hoskins and Coons, 1995 and Meltzer, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Apparently, these free-market economists have failed to pay heed to Professor R.H. Coase and his complaints about economists who engage in abstract theorizing to the neglect of acquiring a detailed knowledge of the actual institutions involved (in this case, central banks in developing countries). This, of course, is not the first time this type of error has been committed in debates about exchange rate regimes (Hutchinson, 1977).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both on principle and in practical terms, a currency board for Mexico offers the most attractive exchange rate regime. Sir Alan Walters and I first argued in favor of this approach in July 1994 (Hanke and Walters, 1994). Specifically, we concluded that the peso was overvalued and that Mexico's crawling peg system would fall apart. We recommended that the peso should be devalued by 16 percent, to 4 pesos per U.S. dollar, and that a currency board system should be installed. By introducing a completely new and credible exchange rate regime, inflation expectations would have been dramatically altered in Mexico and the new exchange rate would have remained absolutely fixed at 4 pesos per U.S. dollar from that point onward. Hence, we are not "airy-fairy" devaluationists, as Sir Roy Harrod has called them (Hutchinson, 1977, p. 101).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, we are not the only free-market economists who see currency boards as the only means to achieve monetary stability in developing countries. Professor Milton Friedman, never one to overlook real world institutional detail, has written that:
<p><blockquote>
	[F]or developing countries, the case against using monetary policy primarily as an instrument for short-run stabilization is far stronger than for developed countries. The crucial problem for developing countries is to achieve sustained growth, not to smooth short-run fluctuations. In addition, such countries seldom have financial markets and banking institutions sufficiently sophisticated to permit what has come (most inaccurately) to be called "fine-tuning" of monetary policy.
<p>
	...  [F]or most such countries, I believe the best policy would be to eschew the revenue from money creation, to unify their currency with the currency of a large, relatively stable, developed country with which they have close economic relations, and to impose no barriers to the movement of money or of prices, wages, or interest rates. Such a policy requires avoiding a central bank. (Friedman, 1974, p. 274).
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So why has Mexico eschewed a currency board?  Many hypothetical objections have been raised. Most of these have been presented in a recent book (Williamson, 1995). And all have been refuted (Hanke and Schuler, 1994). But, the Mexican technocrats, unable to mount a substantive attack on the currency board system, turned to a practical argument. They claimed that Mexico did not have enough reserves to fully back the Banco de Mexico's liabilities (Buira, 1995). Even if this was true, it is irrelevant. A viable currency board can be started with less than 100 percent reserves on existing, old liabilities, if all new liabilities are required to have 100 percent reserve backing. In the past, this type of marginal reserve rule has been successfully employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, while the fiat issue of pesos that Argentina's currency board inherited in 1902 was virtually unbacked by gold (which served as the reserve cover), new pesos could only be issued if they were backed 100 percent by gold reserves. Once the new system was installed, the demand for new pesos grew rapidly. Consequently, the gold cover for all outstanding pesos rose from only 0.11 percent in 1902 to almost 73 percent in 1913 (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leaves us with two unanswered questions:  How well did the Argentine currency board-like system stand up to the ravages of the so-called tequila effect?  And what lessons can Mexico draw from Argentina's experience?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The shock imposed on Argentina by Mexico's financial crisis had four distinct phases (Banco Central, Republic of Argentina, 1995). The first phase lasted from December 20, 1994 through February 1995. External drains from the currency board-like system occurred, with the central bank's liquid reserves falling from $15.8 billion before the crisis to $13.3 billion at the end of February. (Note that Argentina's system is not orthodox because only 80 percent of the system's reserves must be held in dollar denominated assets issued by foreign governments. These are called "liquid reserves."  The remaining reserves must be dollar denominated, but can be issued by the Republic of Argentina. Both types of reserves must be marked-to-market (valued) at current prices.) There were also internal drains of both peso and dollar deposits from commercial banks. Wholesale banks and small retail banks were most strongly affected. Two small wholesale banks, with a high proportion of their assets in Argentine government bonds, were suspended.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the first phase, the broad money supply, M3 (pesos outside banks plus peso and dollar deposits), decreased by 3.2 billion pesos, or 5.8 percent, by the end of February. And bond prices fell sharply, with yields on peso denominated bonds moving from 22.6 percent before the crisis to 38.9 percent at the end of February. The prime rate on peso denominated loans also increased during the period, from 12.5 percent to 22.7 percent. Dollar denominated bond yields and the dollar prime rate also increased, but not by as much as those on comparable peso denominated instruments. The peso-dollar bond yields, for example, increased from 480 basis points to 934 basis points (Pre 1 vs. Pre 2 bonds), reflecting an increase in the perceived exchange rate risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central bank took steps to tighten the link between the peso and the dollar. On January 12th, it eliminated the spread between buying and selling rates for dollars, making the rate exactly 1 peso = $1. It also required banks to hold their current accounts at the central bank in dollars instead of pesos (these accounts are used for clearing and reserve requirements). That reduced the central bank's potential gain from a devaluation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase the liquidity of banks, the central bank temporarily reduced reserve requirements on deposits on the 28th of December and again the 12th of January. On January 12th, it also established a safety net (lender of last resort facility) financed with 2 percentage points of existing required reserves. These funds could be loaned to solvent banks with liquidity problems. Previously, there had been a private, voluntary safety net to buy loans from banks with temporary liquidity problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Subsequently, the government took further action to assure bank liquidity. Decree 286 of February 27th created the Fiduciary Fund for Provincial Development to help privatize banks owned by provincial governments, many of which were notoriously weak. Decree 290 of February 27th amended the Organic Law of the central bank to broaden its power to lend to illiquid banks, and amended the Law of Financial Institutions to allow the central bank to play a more active part in reorganizing troubled institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The liquidity squeeze that the financial system had endured became a true crisis in the second, post-tequila phase, which started in late February 1995 and lasted through March. On February 27th, the international banks with branches in Argentina cut off credit lines to their branch operations, citing "country risk" as the rationale for such drastic action. This shocked branch bank managers and sent them scurrying unprepared into the domestic interbank market. The consequences were predictable. The interbank interest rates rose dramatically, from about 20 percent on peso deposits to over 50 percent within hours after the international credit lines were cut. Also, the massive entry of the international branch banks into the interbank market was interpreted as a vote of no confidence for Argentina's currency board-like system. Consequently, both external drains from the currency board-like system and internal drains from the commercial banks became great floods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is important to stress that the withdrawal of the credit lines from the international banks was the event that pushed Argentina from a liquidity squeeze into a liquidity crisis. Viewed from a historical perspective, this event is unusual, if not unique. With absolutely fixed exchange rate regimes, either currency boards or the classical gold standard (1880-1914), foreign banks have provided liquidity during times of liquidity squeezes (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993; Gallarotti, 1995). Indeed, private foreign banks have traditionally acted as lenders of last resort in absolutely fixed exchange rate systems. This was not the case in Argentina, because its currency board-like system was relatively immature and untested. Alas, Argentina had to pay a price for the sins of its monetary past.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuel was added to the crisis, when in the last days of February, rumors spread that the government might freeze deposits, as it had done with the "Bonex plan" of early 1990. Many people were also apprehensive that the decrees of February 27th were a prelude to broader powers that would reduce the rule-bound nature of the currency board-like system. There was also fear that a possible devaluation in Brazil would have effects in Argentina.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In March, the broad money supply fell by 4.3 billion pesos, or 8.4 percent; it reached its low point for the crisis at the end of the month. Peso deposits, dollar deposits, and currency outside banks all fell, reflecting a desire by many Argentines to hold their money outside the local financial system, either in dollar deposits abroad or dollar caches locally. Interest rates jumped; the peso prime rate increased from 28 percent at the end of February and peaked at 45 percent in March. Dollar interest rates likewise increased, with the prime rate peaking at 30 percent. The exchange rate risk exploded, with the peso-dollar interest rate spread moving from 934 basis points at the end of February to 1,647 basis points at its peak. Since dollar interest rates were many times those prevailing in the United States, market participants evidently perceived that there was a high risk that borrowers of dollars would default or that the Argentine government would interfere with loans and deposits in dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the crisis worsening, the central bank took additional measures to further increase liquidity for banks. On March 10th it temporarily allowed all banks to use up to 50 percent of their peso and dollar vault cash to fulfill reserve requirements, and allowed banks that had bought assets from institutions with liquidity problems to use the remaining 50 percent in the same way. The central bank also used its excess reserves to make short-term loans (discounts and repos) exceeding 900 million pesos to solvent banks with liquidity problems. As a result of its loans and the reduction in pesos outside banks, the central bank's liquid reserves fell to a low of 10.2 billion pesos at the end of March, compared with 15.8 billion pesos in late December. However, at no time during the crisis did the ratio of liquid reserves to the monetary base fall below the statutory minimum of 80 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On March 14th, the government announced a package of measures, totaling 11.4 billion pesos, to contain the financial crisis. It accelerated privatizations. It reduced its planned government spending by 2 billion pesos, including cutting the wages of senior government employees by 5 percent to 15 percent. It increased several taxes, most important the value-added tax (a temporary increase of the rate, lasting until March 31, 1996, from 18 percent to 21 percent). And it announced plans to borrow up to US$7 billion -- a three-year US$l billion domestic "patriotic" bond issue from Argentines, a three-year US$l billion bond issue from private foreign lenders and US$5 billion from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Argentina's success in putting together the (oversubscribed) $1 billion Patriotic Loan turned the corner. The loan was a convincing domestic affirmation of the creditworthiness of the Menem-Cavallo administration, and the IMF et al. tagged along. This soon opened up the system with a fall in interest rates as dramatic as the February-March rise. The crisis was over.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the beginning of April to the presidential election of May 14th, phase three, the crisis leveled off in some respects and eased in others. The broad money supply remained approximately constant:  dollar deposits decreased, while peso deposits and pesos outside banks actually increased. Interest rates declined slightly; the peso prime rate eased from about 27 percent at the beginning of April to 24.5 percent in mid-May. Perceived exchange rate risk also declined, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 1,224 basis points at the beginning of April to 713 basis points in mid-May. And on April 12th, the government announced the creation of a privately financed, voluntary Deposit Guarantee Fund for peso and dollar deposits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the crisis, the Convertibility Law continued to enjoy support across the political spectrum, including the three leading candidates and parties in the presidential election. Nonetheless, people were apprehensive about what might happen if President Menem were defeated or forced into a runoff election. However, President Menem's re-election in the first round, and the strong showing of his Justicialist Party in Congress, calmed the fears that a change in the government would undermine the Convertibility Law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After the presidential election, all monetary indicators improved, marking the last phase the crisis, which ended by the beginning of August. Interest rates fell; the peso prime rate fell from 24.5 percent in mid-May to 14.5 percent by late July, while the dollar prime rate fell from about 18.5 percent to 12 percent in the same period. The broad money supply increased, though by the end of July it was still about 10 percent below the pre-crisis level. Pesos outside banks, peso deposits, and dollar deposits all registered increases. Bank credit to households and businesses, which had fallen about 4 percent from the beginning of the crisis to the low point at the end of April, began to recover. Further, the central bank reduced its repos by about half between the end of March and the end of July, while its liquid reserves held against the monetary base rose above 90 percent. The perceived exchange rate risk also eased, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 713 basis points at the beginning of phase three to 500 basis points at the end of July.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the present, the Argentine monetary indicators roughly reflect the "pre-tequila" magnitudes. The peso-dollar exchange rate remains absolutely fixed at 1 to 1. And inflation for 1995 was 1.6 percent, one of the lowest rates in the world and the lowest annual inflation in Argentina since 1944. The central bank's liquid reserves increased by $3 billion during December 1995, to reach $15 billion, almost the pre-tequila level of $15.8 billion. Dollar denominated time deposits currently stand $500 million higher than those of December 1994, and M1 has returned to its December 1994 level. And the peso and dollar prime interest rates are 9.5 percent and 8.25 percent, respectively. Both rates are lower than their pre-tequila levels. The perceived exchange rate risk is actually lower than the pre-crisis level, with the peso-dollar spread currently standing at 359 basis points, 121 basis points lower than the pre-crisis spread. Like tempered steel, Argentina's currency board-like system has been toughened by the crisis, and as the peso-dollar spread indicates, the system is stronger than ever. In addition, unemployment has started to come down and economic activity is starting to show signs of life. So, Argentina's currency board-like system has proven its critics, such as Professor Krugman, wrong (Krugman, 1995). As the Duke of Wellington often observed victory is the avoidance of being crushed by an onslaught, and Argentina's currency board-like system has certainly kept Argentina from being crushed by the tequila effect.
<p>
<b>What lessons can Mexico draw from the Argentine experience?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Currency boards, much like the classical gold standard, provide a constraint on monetary authorities. This is not to say that the monetary authorities do not attempt to maneuver around the constraints. Indeed, writing about the gold standard in 1932, Professor F. A. Hayek concluded that "Every effort has been made to obviate [the gold standard's] functioning at any point at which there was dissatisfaction with the tendencies which were being revealed by it" (Hayek, 1984, p. 134). During Argentina's recent experience, the authorities also squirmed as much as they could within the confines of Argentina's currency board-like system. However, as much as the monetary authorities tried to maneuver and introduce discretion into Argentina's rule-bound, absolutely fixed rate system, they failed to shake its irksome constraints (Gallarotti, 1995 and Hayek, 1984). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, currency boards create price stability, even in times of severe crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The hard budget constraints imposed by currency boards motivate deeper liberal economic reforms, as well as desired automatic adjustments in the economy. For example, before the Mexican crisis, Argentina's banking system was notoriously weak. Given that Argentina had no central bank that could print pesos at will or act liberally as a lender of last resort, many people thought that the weak banking system would be Argentina's Achilles' heel. It was not and is not. Argentina's banking system is rapidly being strengthened and consolidated, with a few weak banks going to the wall and many more being bought by strong banks. Now, 80 percent of all Argentinean deposits are in the 25 largest banks. In addition, virtually all the weak banks owned by the provinces are on the block in a mass privatization. The discipline imposed by the currency board has put in place a virtuous cycle. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; And perhaps most important, the results produced by currency board systems can give politicians a platform from which they can win elections.
If Mexico wants to clean up its monetary mess, it must ponder the lessons provided by the Argentine experience. By facing reality, even Mexico's braying pack of technocrats might finally appreciate that a currency board system is the only way for Mexico to provide Mexicans with what they yearn for:  a stable peso.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since the Cold War ended, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization has been in the midst of an identity crisis. When it lost the Soviet threat in the early 
1990s, the Atlantic alliance went on a search to redefine itself. There have been many stops on this 
inchoate journey of redefinition. The Bush Administration used NATO forces, structure, and 
modus operandi to build a framework for the coalition that defeated Saddam Hussein in the Persian 
Gulf War. Since President Clinton took office, NATO has gone in even more directions. Between 
1993 and 1995, NATO acted as a combat subcontractor for the United Nations in the former 
Yugoslavia, implementing and enforcing a "no-fly zone" over Bosnia and providing close air 
support to U.N. peacekeepers. Now, of course, NATO is involved in an ambitious peace 
enforcement operation in Bosnia:  a mission for which NATO was not originally designed and in a 
country that is not a member of the Atlantic alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has traveled far from its original mission of 
deterring a Soviet attack on Western Europe. It stands to reason that it should do so, NATO 
planners maintain, because the original raison d'etre of the alliance -- the Soviet threat -- has 
disappeared. What is needed, they argue, is to make NATO more up-to-date and more relevant to 
solving messy conflicts like Bosnia. Peacekeeping and "out-of-area" military operations (whereby 
NATO becomes involved in conflicts outside the treaty area) are supposed to save NATO from 
irrelevance. Unless NATO adapts to new circumstances, they aver, it will wither away and become 
extinct.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These advocates of a trendier NATO have it backwards. 
Unless NATO returns to its core mission, it will not survive. That mission is to preserve the 
freedom and security of Europe as a whole -- to prevent the general conflagration of Europe -- and 
not to put out every brushfire that breaks out in every corner of the continent. Put in the parlance of 
the strategist, NATO's core mission is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or 
bloc of powers which strive to deny the continent of its overall freedom and security.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That mission -- preserving the basic security condition of 
Europe -- is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War. Moreover, it is especially important in 
defining the American role in European security and NATO. The U.S. has a vital interest in the 
freedom and security of Europe regardless of whether a hostile attack is imminent. Who is to say 
whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe ten or twenty years 
from now?  It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest 
in the basic security condition of Europe. If even a potential threat to that interest exists, the U.S. 
must be prepared to deter major power aggression and defend European security and freedom. It 
makes no sense for America to leave Europe and return, as it did in the last two world wars, only 
when Europe is in flames and the threat is practically on America's doorstep. It is far better to keep 
100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send 1 million GIs to fight a European war 
that broke out in America's absence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The more NATO drifts away from this core mission, the 
less likely it will survive in the long run. It will not work to create new roles and missions for which 
the alliance is poorly suited and in which the U.S. is reluctant to become involved. Military make-
work will cause the interests of alliance members to diverge and will accelerate the demise of the 
alliance. If peacekeeping and other crisis management operations take NATO too far afield of its 
core mission, the cohesion of the alliance will be diluted and the U.S. will lose interest over time. 
Getting NATO involved in "out-of-area" operations for their own sake will not do the trick either. 
Having a baby to save the marriage is neither good family practice nor a sound basis for military 
strategy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. It needs to refocus on 
its core mission of ensuring that peace and freedom in Europe as a whole are not threatened by a 
hostile power. The greatest threat to NATO's cohesion today is the possibility of failure in 
Bosnia.<sup>1 </sup>  No other issue has such a potential to tear NATO apart -- not the debate over 
NATO enlargement or disagreements about how to handle the Russians. If NATO trips up today, it 
will not be over a disagreement concerning its core mission, but over some tangential but 
seemingly urgent problem (like Bosnia) which Europeans and Americans mistook as being 
fundamentally and strategically important to the security and freedom of Europe as a whole.
<p>
<b>Why NATO? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO countries need to explain to their peoples why 
NATO is needed regardless of what happens in Bosnia. American leaders in particular need not 
only to articulate more clearly to a skeptical public why NATO should exist, but also to establish 
clearer principles for when the U.S. should or should not become involved in Europe's wars. In 
addition, leaders should make an effort to define how America will become involved in other 
European security affairs. This will promote a clearer and more sensible division of labor that can 
be understood by Americans and Europeans. Accomplishing these tasks would give NATO 
direction and purpose. There are three reasons why NATO should exist. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. This is vitally important to the freedom and security 
of the United States. A Europe dominated by any power hostile to America, her interests, and her 
values would be a direct threat to the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States itself. 
America fought two world wars and sustained over 40 years of a Cold War military commitment to 
prevent Europe's domination. It should be no less committed to this goal today, even though the 
immediacy of the threat has diminished.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is a strategic insurance policy. Insurance exists to 
protect against catastrophe, no matter how remote the threat may be. Because the cost of 
catastrophe is so high, people are willing to pay insurance premiums to protect them in case it 
strikes. Even when the likelihood of a household fire is remote, most people still take out fire 
insurance because the cost of a fire is so devastating, and far greater than the cost of the premiums.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So it is with NATO. The threat today in Europe is not as 
great as it once was, but neither are the premiums. One hundred thousand troops deployed in 
Europe today is far more economical, both in blood and treasure, than the cost a world war would 
impose on America tomorrow. Twice this century, Americans have seen what happens when fire 
sweeps over Europe. Anything that would prevent such a catastrophe would be well worth the 
price. Indeed, for this reason, NATO is even better than insurance. It actually helps to prevent 
catastrophe. That makes it a double bargain. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A major 
power threat to Europe would cause economic disruption that would be devastating to U.S. markets 
and economic stability. The U.S. economy is greatly dependent on the economic stability of 
America's principal trading partners, and access to trade and resources in Europe is a vital 
American interest. Europe is America's second largest trading region and accounts for billions of 
dollars in two-way trade per year. Many millions of jobs in the United States are directly dependent 
upon American trade with Europe and European investment in the U.S. The prosperity of America 
depends in large measure on a free and prosperous Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. While NATO ultimately is an 
alliance of collective defense, it also is a functional vehicle for promoting democracy and freedom 
in Europe. It is not only practically important from the standpoint of providing stability in Europe, 
but it has a moral component as well. NATO is an organization of democratic states and a reflection 
of America's identity in the world, an anchor for American values both abroad and at home. This 
stability, born of political freedom and economic prosperity, should be brought by NATO to 
Central Europe, a region historically characterized by political instability.
<P>
<b>When Should America Become Involved? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It is not enough to know that America should remain in 
the NATO alliance. The far more pressing problem is to know when and under what circumstances 
U.S. combat troops should or should not become involved in a range of military operations in 
Europe. In order to have a coherent strategy and promote a sensible division of labor in Europe, the 
U.S. should adhere to some basic guidelines. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. The main mission of the U.S. armed forces in 
Europe should be to prevent Europe from falling victim to a hostile hegemonic power. Thus, 
America's main military mission is collective defense -- to protect NATO member states from a 
major power threat. While the U.S. should never rule out participation in less threatening scenarios 
or turn its back on out-of-area operations, in general it should concentrate its military efforts on 
achieving NATO's core military mission. This will lend definition and purpose to NATO and the 
American role.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. As a rule, if U.S. forces duplicate the efforts of European 
allies that can provide the same capabilities, the European forces should get the nod. The United 
States is NATO's military leader because of its unique and powerful military capabilities. It is not 
just another European military power; it is a world power with many strategic commitments. A 
significant U.S. military role in NATO must be guided by the singular capabilities that America can 
bring to bear.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The use of large numbers of American combat forces should make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. If the American people perceive an American-led NATO 
chasing peripheral security crises with the reluctant participation of prosperous European allies, 
public support for NATO will erode quickly. The U.S. military role in NATO must be a unique and 
decisive contribution towards the core mission of the alliance.
<p>
<b>Enlarging NATO. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Expanding the Atlantic alliance to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would enhance NATO's capability to perform its core 
mission of defending the basic security condition of Europe. The profound geopolitical security and 
stability this will bring to Central Europe far outweighs the technical and financial difficulties of 
limited enlargement. To do this, the Clinton Administration must stop dragging its feet. Clinton has 
taken the exclusive counsel of his fears and has given too much weight to complaints from 
Russians who oppose NATO enlargement. The President has given Russia a <i>de facto</i> veto 
and has used the Partnership for Peace plan as little more than a bureaucratic delaying tactic. 
Clinton needs to act now by making a political commitment to these four Central European states 
and demonstrating the same kind of vision and courage that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President George Bush showed in pressing for German unification in the face of Soviet opposition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act. To spur the President to 
revitalize NATO, the Congress needs to act. The Clinton Administration has not done a good job of 
giving NATO a sense of purpose and mission in the post-Cold War era. The Congress should 
consider passing a NATO Revitalization Act that not only spells out the reasons for the American 
people about why the U.S. should be involved in NATO, but also clearly defines the strategic role 
of the U.S. in fulfilling NATO's core mission of collective defense. This Act also should define the 
principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, thereby urging the Europeans to take 
more responsibility for peacekeeping and other marginal military missions. Finally, it should call 
expressly for the rapid inclusion of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in NATO 
and substantial modification of the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program.
<p>


<b>NATO'S IDENTITY CRISIS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has proven to be 
the most effective security alliance of modern times. Its stated aim was to "safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage and civilization of [its] peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty and the rule of law."  The treaty signatories also sought to "promote stability and 
well-being in the North Atlantic area" and were "resolved to unite their efforts for collective 
defense and for the preservation of peace and security."<sup>2 </sup>  That NATO achieved these 
goals with small loss of life in the face of an adversarial and expansionist Soviet Union was truly 
remarkable. Underpinning this success story was the enormous and expensive political and military 
commitment made by America to NATO, a commitment that did not waver during the many crises 
of the Cold War.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is the ironic fate of alliances that their success ultimately 
can spell the end of their existence. Such is the case with NATO, where the moment of the 
alliance's greatest triumph contained within it the seeds of the identity crisis that now threatens its 
viability and even its existence. The demise of the Soviet Union brought calls for a "peace 
dividend" the world over. Politicians and strategists proposed a restructuring of alliance 
commitments, defense requirements, and security architecture to meet the more unpredictable but 
less apocalyptic threats of the new world disorder. The American public demanded that its 
politicians focus on troubles at home. The 1992 presidential campaign was about "the economy, 
stupid," and foreign policy issues dropped out of the immediate consciousness of 
America.<sup> 3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the meantime, NATO has struggled for a post-Soviet 
identity that can inspire its members to remain completely committed. It is still not clear that this 
can be accomplished in the absence of a clear and present danger that would cause the interests of 
all NATO members to converge. Consequently, the struggle to find a new identity for the alliance 
has been marked by an inchoate and inclusive program of NATO enlargement (further muddled by 
the Partnership for Peace program), a dabbling in combat support to U.N. peacekeeping, a proposal 
to refocus NATO on the Mediterranean and the implicit threat of nationalist Islam, and the out-of-
area peace enforcement operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;None of these operations has served to inspire solid 
support for NATO from the American public and Congress. While a majority of Americans (56 
percent) support America's basic commitment to the alliance, public support for the American role 
in NATO's Bosnian intervention has peaked at around 40 percent.<sup>4 </sup>  In addition, while 
support for NATO is stable in Congress, the Bosnian mission has met strong congressional 
opposition in both the House and Senate. Many congressional leaders question the utility of an 
American-led alliance that created a supposedly vital American interest in Bosnia, an area of 
marginal strategic interest for the United States. Indeed, President Clinton used American 
leadership and credibility in NATO as the chief justification for the American role in Bosnia. 
NATO became the end in itself, no longer an appropriate means to the relative end of preventing a 
major power threat to Europe. 
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR A WORKABLE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States needs alliances of all sorts in an 
interdependent world. Economic alliances allow the U.S. to remain the number one trading nation 
in the world and sustain American prosperity at home. Political alliances ensure that America is 
involved in decisions the world over that may influence the peace and prosperity of the United 
States. Military alliances give America partners in fighting her enemies and defending her interests, 
thereby lessening the costs to the U.S. in time of war and peace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. has many national interests throughout the world, 
but not all are equally important. The principal task of American statecraft is to discriminate among 
these interests, set strategic priorities, and choose policy options commensurate with their 
importance. Such an approach distinguishes among vital national interests, important interests, and 
marginal interests.<sup>5 </sup>  Naturally, America has a vital national interest in defending the 
physical territory and airspace of the United States and ensuring the safety and well-being of 
Americans abroad. To protect these vital interests, the U.S. should be willing to wage war if 
necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, the U.S. has vital national interests that lie 
beyond American shores. For both political and economic reasons, it is in America's vital national 
interest that Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf are not dominated by a hegemonic power or 
bloc of powers. It is also in America's vital national interest that the U.S. have unimpeded access to 
foreign trade and natural resources. American prosperity overwhelmingly depends on the stability 
of international markets and free trade regimes. Political scientist Benjamin Schwarz has written 
that:
<p><blockquote>
	Economic interdependence dictates security commitments. As long as world politics 
remain what they have always been, Europe and East Asia will be potentially 
unstable. And as long as U.S. prosperity is understood to depend upon the stability 
of those regions, the United States must pacify them. America's worldwide security 
commitments are a truly permanent burden.<sup>6 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, Schwarz and many others also recognize that 
this permanent burden ultimately could turn into a "wasting proposition."  America, without a 
coherent strategy, and in order to sustain its prosperity, will run itself ragged trying to preserve the 
stability of the entire world. Its engagement in world affairs therefore must be selective. The U.S. 
must set clear priorities that allow it to use its political capital and military forces for the tasks that 
most matter to America. If the U.S. tries to do everything, it will overextend itself and accomplish 
nothing.<sup> 7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid becoming the world's policeman, the 
U.S. must operate within security alliances. These alliances must preserve the conditions necessary 
for American prosperity, and must do so by "stretching" American resources through an intelligent 
definition of America's exact role and principles for sharing burdens with allies. These alliances 
must unequivocally lay out the roles that make the most sense for America and her goals abroad. 
NATO, in particular, needs to be refocused to avoid being drawn into an expensive "wasting 
proposition" that the American people will not support.
<p>

<b>WHY NATO?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most military alliances in the world can only hope to 
attain the level of political and military credibility enjoyed by NATO. However, in order for NATO 
to sustain public and congressional support in the U.S., its fundamental purpose must be refocused. 
American leaders should explain exactly why NATO is critical and should define America's basic 
role in the alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are three principal reasons why the U.S. should be a 
member of NATO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. The U.S. has been a major European power 
throughout the 20th century, intervening in three world wars (two hot and one cold) to prevent a 
hostile power or bloc of powers from dominating the continent. An American commitment to this 
basic security condition of Europe is an insurance policy that works to prevent another great power 
war in Europe. The premiums that America pays on this policy are commensurate with the benefits. 
A focused and clearly defined policy will ensure this balance is retained. In fact, the costs of these 
premiums have dropped tremendously since the end of the Cold War. In 1989, the United States 
military had over 313,000 servicemembers permanently stationed in Europe. That number is now 
down to 100,000.<sup>8 </sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with any insurance policy, the cost of being insured 
through NATO is far less than the cost of not being insured at all. A major power threat to the 
political freedom of the European continent was the condition that inevitably drew the U.S. into the 
enormously expensive campaigns of World Wars I and II and the Cold War. It is far better to have 
100,000 troops peaceably deployed in Europe now than have to commit a million later to fight a 
war that broke out in the absence of the one power that could guarantee the core security condition 
of Europe:  Less expensive to live as lodgers now than as liberators later. Even the most superficial 
and cursory look at modern history supports this view.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A U.S. 
commitment to the collective defense of Europe is necessary to preserve the economic prosperity of 
America. The system of international trade upon which American prosperity depends is predicated 
on free, stable, and orderly political conditions. In 1993, Europe was America's second largest 
customer, taking 31 percent of American exports. It also was the U.S.'s second largest supplier, 
providing 29 percent of imports. While the U.S. runs a large trade deficit with Asia, it has relatively 
balanced trade with Europe. More important, almost 50 percent of direct American investment 
abroad is in Europe, and over 60 percent of direct foreign investment in the U.S. comes from 
Europe. Finally, and closer to home, nearly 3 million Americans are employed in the U.S. by 
European-owned firms, and another 1.5 million American workers are supported directly by U.S. 
exports to Europe.<sup> 9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A great power threat to Europe would cause the wholesale 
disruption of the European economic order. The stability of world markets and international trade 
depend on a stable and thriving Europe. The United States cannot afford to cut itself off from the 
world market. Neither could the U.S. long sustain its economic growth if Europe as a whole were to 
enter an economic crisis born of insecurity or protracted instability. America's very standard of 
living depends on stable international financial and commodity markets, of which Europe is a 
critical element. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. America's defense of Europe 
through NATO strengthens America's values and identity as a nation. NATO is a community of 
democratic nations. It is based on a common set of ideals that originated in European thought but 
have become uniquely American. Helping to secure these ideals in Europe anchors the values of 
freedom and democracy at home, giving them a larger life on the world stage, and by so doing 
deepens their roots in America's own political culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to reinforcing these ideals and values, 
American commitment to NATO serves as a solidly practical vehicle for expanding democracy and 
freedom. NATO represents not only a "zone of peace and security," but a "zone of democracy" as 
well. Democratic systems and market economies produce free and prosperous societies and are 
stabilizing forces that serve to lessen tensions and prevent the conflicts NATO is intended to deter. 
While the main mission of NATO, as a defensive alliance, is not to crusade for democracy, it must 
be recognized that democracy is both a cause and effect in NATO. An alliance of free and 
democratic nations that wish to preserve their political and economic systems, NATO provides the 
security and stability in which democracy and economic prosperity can flourish.
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these compelling reasons for American 
involvement in NATO, the American public will not support such a commitment if it is not 
supported by a clear and coherent military strategy. A commitment that does not discriminate 
between situations where American power is necessary and those where it is merely a substitute for 
that of reluctant Europeans will cause the American people to balk at an expensive transatlantic 
responsibility. A recent poll by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy 
Attitudes shows that over 70 percent of Americans believe the United States should work 
principally through alliances or coalition structures to relieve America of some of its security 
burden. More conclusively, 71 percent of Americans said the U.S. is playing the role of world 
policeman "more than it should be."<sup>10 </sup>  Americans want multilateral security structures 
that make sense for America. This means working through military alliances, not the United 
Nations. Americans want the U.S. involved in alliances where the U.S. role is clearly understood, 
the burden is shared, and American participation is essential for success.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans need to understand clearly the criteria that 
determine the American role in NATO and NATO's role in Europe. In the identity crisis that has 
characterized NATO's search for a post-Cold War role, many new or revised missions have been 
entertained and questions raised. Should NATO operate only in its traditional area of operations, or 
should it consider out-of-area missions?  Should NATO concentrate on traditional notions of 
military deterrence and warfighting, or should it engage in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and 
military operations other than war?  Should NATO extend its nuclear guarantee to new members or 
associate members? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These questions are based on the search for relevant and 
viable missions that would justify the existence of NATO in the absence of a threat to its core role 
as a defensive alliance. As guidelines for determining the future American role in NATO, they 
completely miss the point. The U.S. role in NATO, a fundamentally American alliance, should be 
determined by principles of engagement, not by geographic parameters or mission types. Stating 
that the U.S. will undertake NATO operations only in certain areas or will not participate in certain 
types of missions unnecessarily limits American flexibility. Instead, the American role should be 
considered through guidelines that point the way to a successful and sensible role in 
NATO.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. NATO's mission is collective defense, not 
collective security. Collective defense seeks to tie many nations to a collaborative effort in 
defending their territory. It is inherently limited, focused, and reactive in its political nature. The 
missions of collective defense are straightforward and focused:  defend members from outside 
attack. Collective defense seeks to deter through military strength and defeat an aggressor when 
deterrence fails. Collective defense organizations cannot afford to do anything except succeed 
spectacularly. Any other result amounts to failure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Collective security arrangements are different from 
collective defense. They seek to provide a forum through which members can organize cooperative 
responses to security problems, especially those below the threshold of war. Collective security 
missions can include many quasi-military efforts such as humanitarian intervention, support for 
nation-building, peacekeeping, and peace-enforcement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States already is involved in a collective 
security organization in Europe, and it is not NATO. It is the 54-member Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Established in 1973, the OSCE has become increasingly 
institutionalized since the end of the Cold War. It is an organization that can act as a forum in 
which the nations of Europe can coordinate and integrate their common efforts towards preserving 
peace and stability. Along these lines, it has undertaken very limited fact-finding, sanctions-
monitoring, and observation missions in the former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Ukraine, Albania, and even Chechnya.<sup> 12</sup>  However, the OSCE is viewed largely as a 
toothless talking-shop. There is too much disparity among its members to institutionalize the 
military resources and structures needed for more significant military operations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The failure of the OSCE and the United Nations (another 
collective security organization) to deal competently with problems like Bosnia has thrust NATO 
into the picture. In short, events are taking NATO down the road to becoming something it never 
was:  a collective security organization. By default, not design, NATO has been consigned to fill 
the collective security gap in Europe. This means that NATO might become involved in even more 
ambiguous security missions like Bosnia. As it does so, it will find that the inevitable divergence of 
opinion over these operations will dilute its unique and formidable cohesion. NATO drew its 
strength from its core identity, which united all members. A lack of focus on its principal mission 
of collective defense will continue to weaken the alliance. As one U.N. scholar recently recognized, 
"NATO's biggest advantage over the UN, historically, has been agreement on some clearly defined 
defensive purposes, whereas the UN has an almost infinite range of responsibilities."<sup>13 </sup> 
 Using NATO for contentious collective security missions will only serve to erode that unique 
advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. public and Congress will not support an 
American-led alliance running hither and yon from one media-generated crisis to another and 
lacking criteria for distinguishing the roles of America and its European allies. The U.S. should 
refocus its role in NATO on the core mission:  to prevent a major power threat to Europe by a 
hostile power or bloc of powers. While U.S. participation in NATO peacekeeping operations 
should not be ruled out, it should be undertaken only if participation affects NATO's core mission 
or some other vital U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. The United States is the only military superpower in the 
world today. It has an enormous edge in intelligence-gathering systems, military technology, and 
the size, lethality, and professionalism of its armed forces. No other nation alone, and few 
combined, can challenge the combined air, land, sea, and space-based military capability of the 
U.S. But while America's military capabilities are enormous, they also are thinly spread. The Soviet 
threat has collapsed, but global U.S. military commitments remain. The U.S. military has been 
reduced by over one-third since the end of the Cold War and has been greatly strained in trying to 
honor its commitments with such a reduced force. This situation is made worse by the defense cuts 
imposed by the Clinton Administration -- cuts that underfund President Clinton's own strategy by 
some $150 billion over five years.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since American military forces are stretched thin, the U.S. 
must deploy them only when their capabilities and effect are unique. As a rule, America should not 
duplicate the efforts of the European powers. If an American infantry battalion is needed to balance 
a NATO force on paper, but does not make a unique contribution to the force, it should not be 
deployed in place of a similar European unit. The United States is not just another European power; 
it is a world power with unique capabilities and a unique role in European security. The division of 
labor in NATO military operations should be based on this premise. The intention is not to help the 
U.S. shirk mundane tasks, but to ensure that the American public see clearly that, to paraphrase 
Lyndon Johnson, "American boys aren't dying where French boys should."  The intention of an 
intelligent division of labor in NATO is to preserve, at all costs, the fundamental American security 
guarantee to Europe. To do that, Americans must be convinced that every NATO nation is pulling 
the wagon in the best way it can, and is not merely along for the ride. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does this mean that America would lose its leadership role 
in NATO, consigning itself to a specialist's role in the alliance?  Not at all. The U.S. need not match 
the Danes infantry battalion for infantry battalion to exert its leadership. At times the U.S. may need 
to deploy a large American combat formation in order to exercise its leadership in a NATO 
coalition of forces, even if the French, British, or Germans can match the size and type of 
contribution on paper. This is a unique contribution because it demonstrates the seriousness of the 
U.S. military commitment in a way that air, sea, or support forces cannot. A leader reserves his 
talents, time, and resources for important tasks that only he may be able to accomplish. It is good 
teamwork, but not always good leadership, for a leader to duplicate the efforts of others to the 
detriment of his unique responsibilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The last principle that should guide American military operations in NATO is that the 
American contribution should be decisive. The American military effort must make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. Ultimately, American support for a rich and prosperous 
NATO alliance cannot be sustained if the American public and Congress see that the basic security 
condition of Europe can be guaranteed without the United States. If that is the case, it is time for the 
United States to come home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States military contribution should push the 
effort over the top. In some cases, this may mean the limited deployment of special capabilities that 
dramatically enhance and multiply the effectiveness of a European-dominated coalition. For 
example, the U.S. may wish to deploy intelligence, logistics, air, sea, and specialized combat 
support units to assist a European effort in out-of-area peacekeeping. In the core missions of 
NATO, the U.S. may need to dominate the force structure, base its operations on American 
command and control structures, and take the lead in determining strategy and operations. This was 
the arrangement in the Persian Gulf War. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics might argue that this distinction robs the United 
States of a leadership role in day-to-day European events and reserves U.S. influence for some 
cataclysmic battle for Europe's future. Once again, this presents a narrow reading of the principle of 
a decisive role and discounts the role that competent American leadership can play in Europe. The 
United States can exercise American leadership in NATO and European security affairs in many 
ways. American diplomacy, political influence, and economic tools all can be decisive in conflicts 
outside of a great power threat to Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, randomly deploying American military forces 
on peripheral missions in order to "fill out" a European force structure and "preserve American 
leadership" will erode American support for NATO. It traps the U.S. into having always to "lead" 
in even the most marginal operations, because European security systems have no other viable 
alternative. In a recent address to Congress, President Jacques Chirac of France seemed to support 
this line of reasoning, stating that reform of NATO would "enable the European allies to assume 
full responsibilities, with the support of NATO facilities, whenever the United States does not wish 
to engage its ground forces."<sup>15 </sup>  America leads in NATO because of the conditions that 
leadership engenders, conditions that must be favorable to the United States. Leadership is not an 
end in itself.
<p>


<b>EXPANDING THE EUROPEAN ZONE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The immediate enlargement of NATO to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would bring a level of stability and security to Central 
Europe that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history. In short, it would expand 
the zone of peace and freedom that NATO has provided for Western Europe for almost 50 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, those who take a skeptical view of NATO 
enlargement raise questions about provoking Russia and drawing a "new Iron Curtain in Europe."  
They also point to the technical and financial difficulties involved in military integration and 
NATO interoperability. Other critics maintain that the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have 
not yet shown a sustained commitment to free market economies, democratic political institutions, 
and civilian control of the military.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The naysayers of NATO enlargement are making the same 
mistakes that opponents of German reunification made in 1990. At that time, it was widely thought 
that the Soviet Union would never accept a unified Germany. At most the Soviets might accept a 
long-term plan for confederation within a neutral Germany.<sup>16 </sup>  Among the many dire 
warnings that came from the Soviets was the prediction by then Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze that "Europe could come again to ruin on German soil."  British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and French President Franois Mitterand were adamantly opposed to German 
unification; many Germans balked at the tremendous costs to be borne by the West German 
taxpayer; and even after the reunification plan was announced, Soviet President Gorbachev warned 
the U.S. that a reunified Germany in NATO would be an absolutely "unacceptable shift in the 
balance of power."<sup>17 </sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten months later, in October 1990, reunification was fact. 
More significantly, the reunified Germany was not some neutral European entity, but a leading 
NATO member. What was unthinkable to the world less than a year before was neatly 
accomplished due to the driving leadership and vision of President George Bush and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. A comprehensive strategy was undertaken adroitly by these two leaders. President 
Bush in particular put forward a three-part plan which ensured that Germany would not work issues 
in isolation from the Soviets, that the Soviets would not feel forced into a corner, and that a unified 
Germany must be a full member of NATO.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This courageous approach should have been adopted for 
NATO enlargement from the beginning. In fact, the window of opportunity for bringing a 
guarantee of peace and stability to Central Europe is rapidly disappearing. The Clinton 
Administration has dragged its feet on NATO enlargement, taking the exclusive counsel of its fears. 
The Administration had hoped that the soft line on NATO enlargement would encourage Russian 
democratic reforms and make enlargement "easier" in the future. In essence, President Clinton has 
given Russia a veto over how, when, and where NATO will enlarge, ostensibly to gain Russian 
cooperation in Bosnia and stop a hard-line trend that already has occurred and is getting 
worse.<sup> 18</sup>  However, it is clear that being soft on NATO enlargement has not stopped 
the Russian drift away from democratic reforms. The election results in the Russian Duma and the 
appointment of hard-liner Yevgeny Primakov as Russian Foreign Minister should give notice that 
the trend is most likely in the other direction.<sup>19 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs a plan to admit Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia as soon as possible. The first pillar of this plan would offer full 
membership for these countries. To be sure, there will be technical difficulties, and these countries 
will put a financial burden on NATO. However, the costs are far outweighed by the greater 
geopolitical good of NATO enlargement. Full NATO membership for these Central European 
countries will bring them a security and stability they have never known.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A purely military line that distinguishes NATO from non-
NATO should stop for the time being after the admission of these four countries. As with German 
reunification, Russia must be convinced that while she has no veto, she is a partner in Europe and 
her security concerns are a consideration. Limited NATO enlargement will make it clear that 
enlargement is not intended to encircle Russia with an adversarial alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To reinforce this point, NATO must modify the 
Partnership for Peace program (PFP) by dropping its membership provision. Other useful aspects of 
PFP, such as association through defense cooperation, should be retained. PFP offers an official 
association with NATO and the implicit guarantee of full membership. However, it also perpetuates 
a damaging myth:  that NATO eventually can include every part of the former Soviet Union 
(including Russia). Such a move is unsound for several reasons. Admitting all the PFP states to 
NATO would dilute the cohesion of NATO as a focused alliance of collective defense. A NATO of 
some 40 nations, including Russia or other former Soviet Republics, would be a collective security 
organization as unwieldy and ineffective as the OSCE or U.N. NATO cannot be all things to all 
people; if it attempts to do so, it will lose the unique and formidable cohesion that makes it the most 
functional military alliance in existence.
<p>

<b>TOWARD A REVITALIZED NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has failed to develop a sound 
strategy for NATO. Lacking a practical vision for America's role in Europe, President Clinton has 
taken the alliance in dangerous directions. If the present course is not changed, it could threaten the 
survival of the alliance. To give NATO badly needed focus in the post-Cold War era, Congress 
needs to step into the breach opened by the President's failure to articulate a coherent NATO 
strategy. Congress should consider, as an amendment to the FY 1997 Defense authorization bill, a 
NATO Revitalization Act that:
<p><ul>
<li>Spells out America's vital national interests in Europe, explains the reasons for America's 
participation in NATO and the U.S. strategic role, and states that NATO is a political insurance 
policy that ensures Europe will not be dominated by a hostile power or bloc of powers;
<p>
<li>Defines the principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, states that any 
significant American combat force commitment to a NATO operation must be firmly grounded in 
NATO's core mission of collective defense, and recognizes that U.S. forces must make a unique 
and decisive contribution to NATO military action;
<p>
<li>Encourages the Europeans to take lead roles in addressing marginal and peripheral security 
problems while guaranteeing an active U.S. support role in these endeavors; 
<p>
<li>Offers immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia 
and drops the implicit guarantee of membership for other countries in the Partnership for Peace 
program.
</ul><P>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is an American alliance. It is a tool that America 
needs to defend its vital national interests in Europe. It does not need charity work in the form of 
attempting to reinvent itself as a pan-European alliance of collective security. NATO protects the 
political freedom and economic prosperity of the United States, and serves as an effective means to 
this end.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. In the absence of a 
clear and present danger to Europe, it has lost its focus. It has tried to become relevant by 
embarking on military make-work programs for the United Nations, and now on its own behalf. 
These diffuse efforts have diluted NATO's cohesion and caused U.S. public support for the alliance 
to erode.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and 
preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe. It will enhance this support by laying out 
principles guiding U.S. military action in NATO. These criteria will serve to put forth a clearly 
understood and sensible division of labor in NATO that will keep the alliance strong. This strong, 
cohesive, and focused NATO must undertake limited enlargement to extend the zone of peace, 
security, and freedom to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. This will enhance 
NATO as an alliance of collective defense. Forestalling enlargement and failing to refocus NATO 
will, at best, turn the alliance into an incohesive and emasculated collective security organization 
that bears no resemblance to its robust predecessor.

<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  "Advancing American Business Interests Through APEC" is our topic this morning. It is an important topic. We have three excellent panelists who will approach it from different points of view.
<p>
This program is a joint production of the Heritage American Trader Initiative (ATI) Advisory Council, newly formed in the last year, and the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Heritage Asian Studies Center</a>. The ATI brings together the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g3.html">foreign policy</a> and <a href="/heritage/library/index/l1.html">international trade</a> aspects of Heritage's work, which are considerable, and we have created a new advisory council of private-sector business and policy leaders, which I am pleased to chair. I'm Barbara Franklin, former U.S. Commerce Secretary. The other half of the equation is Heritage's Asian Studies Center, which has been going on for some time and which really is excellent. I know <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> is here; he is the director of that program. So, with this bit of introduction, we will begin.
<p>
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) was founded in 1989, at the instigation of Australia. The United States has been a member ever since, and in 1993 hosted the first meeting of the leaders of the member countries in Seattle. There are now eighteen countries that belong to APEC. The obvious ones are in the Pacific Rim, plus the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Chile. Ten working groups have been activated as a part of the APEC framework, and there is a secretariat today in Singapore.
<p>
That this group was formed at all is, I think, a reflection of the dynamic growth that is prevailing in Asia today, with economies growing, in many cases, in double digits. That part of the world is a very important marketplace for the U.S. In U.S. terms, our exports to Asia grew 12 percent in 1994 from the preceding year, to over $153 billion. Our direct investment climbed 17 percent in that region, to over $108 billion in 1994. Our exports to Asia now support 3.1 million jobs here at home.
<p>
There was an historic event at the APEC leaders' meeting in 1994. In fact, it was so historic that some of us wondered whether it was possible. At last year's meeting, on November 15, the heads of the APEC governments decided to set a goal for themselves:  to create "free and open trade and investment" in that region by the year 2020. President Suharto of Indonesia, where that meeting was held, deserves a great deal of credit for overcoming a lot of differences in points of view, economic realities, and cultures. He did quite a magnificent job.
<p>
Now we have before us this year's meeting coming up in just a few weeks in Japan, with the Japanese as hosts and with Prime Minister Murayama as the chairman. I think it would be fair to say that our Japanese friends have not been as aggressive in putting this meeting together as we might have hoped. After last year we began to have high hopes for what might be possible, and the hope was that we would come out of this meeting with a framework for implementing this free trade concept in the Pacific Rim by the year 2020.
<p>
Right now, we have a bit of a split, and that is what I hope some of our panelists will address. We have a split in the ranks, with the Japanese having proposed a "flexibility" that would allow the membership to exclude certain sectors, mainly agriculture, from the trade liberalization discussions. This concerns us. The U.S. is not in that camp. The "flexibility" group includes -- in addition to Japan -- China, Korea, and Taiwan. On the other side we have ourselves, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the other countries.
<p>
In just a few short weeks, on November 19, we will have this meeting in Osaka. So the real question is:  Can this division over "flexibility" and the exclusion of agriculture be overcome at this meeting?  That is really the biggest question. I have read articles recently that would indicate that maybe APEC doesn't matter, that business will flourish with or without it. It did before APEC was formed in the Pacific Rim, and some say business activity will overtake and outrun the APEC process. We have two representatives from our business community here, and we will be very interested in your answers to that question. And with that, let me introduce the panelists.
<p>
First of all is Stuart Allan, who is Director of the Office of Economic Policy, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at the Department of State. This is the office that interacts with APEC and is involved in planning this conference. Mr. Allan is a career foreign service officer, having joined the department in 1971. He has served as Counselor of Economic Affairs at our embassy in Australia and has also served in the Netherlands, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Mexico. He is a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, with an M.A. in economics from the University of Wisconsin.
<p>
<b>STUART ALLAN:</b>  Thank you very much, Barbara. It's a great pleasure to be here today to talk about this very important question of free trade in the Asia Pacific region and the prospects for moving forward on that. Sandy Kristoff, my boss, does extend her sincere regrets. She had been scheduled to come, she wanted to come, but as we move closer to ministerial and summit meetings, the leaders' meeting, she gets pulled over to the White House quite frequently. So she extends her regrets.
<p>
In Canberra in 1989, when Secretary of State Baker joined the other foreign ministers for what was to be a very informal discussion on shared interests in the region, there was a lot of skepticism about the Australian initiative to pull the meeting together. There was some doubt in the region, particularly among some in Southeast Asia, as to the utility of the idea. But after the ministers met for a couple of days of fruitful discussion, they discovered that indeed they had a lot in common, that there were a lot of things they would like to pursue. They sketched out a work program in particular sectors where there might be prospects for cooperation to enhance trade and to enhance the ability of firms to do business in the region. From that slow and hesitant start, APEC has really burgeoned.
<p>
Barbara has pointed out the seminal event in Seattle in 1993, when President Clinton really elevated APEC from a meeting of foreign ministers and trade ministers to an annual meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. Then President Suharto last year hosted a similar meeting in Bogor, just outside of Jakarta, where APEC took another very important step forward. President Suharto, as an important leader of the developing member economies in APEC, and as a leader of the developing world as head of the non-aligned movement, was able to convince all the member economies of APEC to undertake this commitment to achieve free trade and investment in the region by specified dates. Those specified dates were 2010 for the industrialized members of the group and 2020 for the developing member economies.
<p>
So the challenge before the APEC members this year has been to frame an action agenda which the leaders requested. They asked the ministers to come forward with specific, detailed proposals on how to get from where we are to where they have committed us to be in 15 to 25 years. That has proved to be a major challenge over the past year. The Japanese have worked very hard, and it has been difficult. The situation in Japan is such that Prime Minister Murayama, as a member of a coalition government, is doing what he can to provide leadership. Within Japan there are competing bureaucracies that sometimes affect the Japanese ability to do things; but even with those constraints, they have worked very hard this year to try to frame an action agenda, working with the 17 other member economies, that could be finalized by the foreign and trade ministers in their ministerial meeting in Osaka and then promulgated by the leaders in their meeting on November 19 in Osaka.
<p>
The draft, as it now stands, is maybe 70 to 80 percent agreed but still has some very important components that have yet to be concluded. The draft includes a section of general principles that the APEC member economies will seek to adhere to as they move forward to the free trade goal. Those principles include things like the main point that Barbara mentioned, the question of comprehensiveness. Under that principle, the question is:  As we move forward, will it be to comprehensively liberalize trade and investment, or will there be exceptions?  In the leaders' declaration last year, they did not mention any exceptions. They said "free trade and investment in the region" by specified dates.
<p>
But as we've engaged in this initiative this year, moving from the political commitment to the practical reality, a number of member economies have found that it begins to be very hard to swallow. I think the reasons are quite understandable. They were quite evident at the closing days of the Uruguay Round, for example. We found with a number of the member economies, particularly Korea and Japan, that the problem of agricultural liberalization was a major difficulty for them, but they moved forward.
<p>
Our approach is that the APEC leaders did not state any exception to comprehensive free trade and investment liberalization, and the leaders did not say anything about special consideration for sensitive sectors. The one understanding the leaders had was a recognition of the different levels of development, and that was reflected in the two different target dates, with the industrialized by 2010 and the developing by 2020.
<p>
How do we deal with this problem at this point?  That has yet to be decided, but my sense is that in the run up to the ministerial meeting there will be intensive discussions in advance in Osaka. If the issue cannot be resolved at the working level, it will probably go to the ministers. And if the ministers are unable to reach agreement on this question of comprehensive coverage, I think it will ultimately have to go to the leaders. After all, it was leaders who made the commitment, it was leaders who did not say "except for sensitive sectors," and if there is some clarification required for the ministers and the rest of us, then maybe the leaders will have to do that. So the jury is out on this question of comprehensiveness and whether there might be an exception for agriculture.
<p>
The reason we are fairly firm on this, quite firm on it, is that once we start making exceptions for sensitive sectors -- again, agriculture in the case of Japan and Korea -- we will find that everybody has a sensitive sector. And if everyone was able to identify one sensitive sector for exclusion -- I could imagine, for example, elements in the U.S. would be happy for the Japanese to exclude agriculture -- we might exclude textiles, the Chinese might exclude automobiles, the Southeast Asians might exclude financial services. Pretty soon, if everyone takes one thing off the table, you don't have much left. It's quite easy to picture an unraveling of the objective. Moreover, agriculture is an important trading commodity, one that we are very efficient at exporting, so agriculture is an important issue. We will have to see where that comes out.
<p>
Other items in the principles section of the draft action agenda include things like the question of nondiscrimination; that is one that has to be worked out. The question of comparability is critical as member economies move forward to achieve the free trade goal:  How do they do it, and how does one assure that the efforts and, more important, the market access results are mutually beneficial and comparable?  These are open issues, and I think we will be able to reach agreement on them, but they are not yet agreed.
<p>
The second part of the draft action agenda addresses the central question of the process:  How do we do this over the next 15 to 25 years?  To generalize, there have been roughly two different approaches to this question. On one side, a number of member economies would prefer more of a voluntary and unilateral effort, whereby they accept the goal but move forward in their own way over the next 15 to 25 years to open up the different sectors, to address the different issues, so that they achieve the commitment. At the other end of that spectrum is a group of countries that think you cannot depend entirely on voluntarism, although some member economies have indeed been doing a lot unilaterally. Many of the countries in Southeast Asia, for their own benefit, have been deregulating, lowering tariffs unilaterally, to help open up their economies and continue to enjoy the rapid growth that they have enjoyed, in part because of wise, market-oriented policies.
<p>
On the other hand, there are other member economies in Asia where the track record is less encouraging. Therefore, for all the member economies to be confident that we are going to achieve the goal, some believe that we cannot depend solely on voluntarism and unilateralism, that we also need some collective action where we sit down and talk through some issues and agree on where we are going and how fast we are going to get there.
<p>
In the actual action agenda, what I think we will find is perhaps a mix of these different methods that might include unilateral and voluntary actions, might include some collective actions by member economies, ongoing actions in the context of the WTO to meet multilateral commitments which will also be beneficial in an APEC context. In APEC we have this notion of "18 minus X."  Of the 18 members of APEC, perhaps a subset of 12, for example, might be able to agree on action in a particular area. And if the other six cannot move forward in the near term, subsets of the whole group can move forward. This is copied from a technique that is used in ASEAN, where they have a "6 minus X" approach. If some parts of ASEAN, say five of the six, can move forward, you don't hold out for absolute consensus; the other one basically catches up later and the five move ahead.
<p>
After principles and a process section, the key part of the action agenda will be a section that identifies specific sectors and issues that we will be focusing on at the outset and consistently over the 15 to 25 years. These issues include things like trade in services, intellectual property protection, government procurement, regulation and deregulation, competition policy, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers. There is an enumeration of 14 or 15 specific sectors and issues where the member economies are going to focus their efforts as they pursue liberalization individually, collectively, in the WTO, 18 minus X -- the different methodologies.
<p>
That is where we stand. The senior officials of APEC -- this is the group just below the ministers level -- have met six times or so this year, both in a special restricted negotiating context and in the general meetings they routinely have. The action agenda draft is, as I say, about 80 percent toward where we need to be, but a lot of important work has yet to be done.
<p>
I would like to turn a little bit away from what I have been talking about, which is what has seized the headlines and focused the attention of a lot of people in the last 12 months, and understandably so, to look at another aspect of APEC:  the more short-term, the more practical, concrete kinds of things that APEC has been doing and will continue to do to provide some tangible benefits for business. This is what APEC really started on back in 1989, with these working groups looking at tourism, looking at telecommunications, looking at transportation, looking at energy -- some of the sector-specific working groups looking at ways the member economies could cooperate.
<p>
Let me just mention a few of the kinds of things that have happened or will be happening in this area, in different categories. One is activities that increase transparency. This is important. I think it is fair to say we have one of the most transparent trade and investment regimes in the world. But in the Asian part of APEC -- and, again, think of Southeast Asia, think of China, developing economies -- transparency is a problem for businessmen. To the extent that through APEC we can be clear in terms of what the business rules, procedures, and so forth are, and make that information more readily available to businessmen, that should make it easier to do business.
<P>
A couple of examples. One is the customs guidebook, a publication by the APEC Customs Subcommittee with information on the regulatory regimes, non-tariff barriers, and so forth, all collected in one place, in English, available globally for exporters of all the member economies. Another transparency measure seems kind of small and very specialized, but is quite important for one sector, and that is the fish inspection system handbook. There is a Fisheries Working Group looking at both health and safety and trade issues in the fisheries area. The U.S. is an exporter of seafood products, and seafood is traded widely in the APEC region. This is one of the most highly regulated sectors because of safety and health concerns. Now, through this working group, a handbook has been published that identifies what the rules, regulations, contact points, and so forth are to import and export shellfish and seafood products.
<p>
Another type of practical measure I would characterize as in the "doing business" category. This differentiation between "doing business" measures and "transparency" measures may seem a little artificial, but just let me give you a few other examples. Through one of the working groups of the Committee on Trade and Investment, over the last year the APEC member economies have developed a tariff database. It is now on a CD-ROM and can be purchased for $50 or $60 from the APEC secretariat; I can give you a contact point in the Commerce Department that can tell you exactly how to do it. Here on a CD-ROM, which will be updated annually, are all the tariff schedules for all the member economies, easily accessible on a common tariff description. I think it is BTN or the standard tariff classification. The key thing here is for American businesses, or any other businesses that are considering exporting a product into the APEC region, to find the tariff level. Is it a prohibitive tariff?  Is it something they could deal with and still be competitive in that target market?  Here is a key "doing business" question, with the information readily available.
<p>
Another one that we kicked off a few years ago was called the APEC Partnership for Education. I think this was initiated about 1991. The idea was that there are lots of foreign students studying in the United States, including many from Southeast Asia. They come here for four or five or six years and learn excellent English, become familiar with American education and the way we approach business and so on. There also are a lot of American multinationals working in Southeast Asia or in Asia that would like to offer employment to many of these students that have the language and American orientation. Many of those graduates, as they go back to their home countries, would like to offer their services as employees of those companies. So it was really a matchmaking exercise that was set up with some seed money from the U.S. Agency for International Development. I think in recent years that seed money has been removed, and the latest I heard is it is now self-sustaining by the two parties, the buyer and seller. I'm not sure who pays most of the costs, but it is an ongoing effort.
<p>
Each year for the last several years, in advance of the APEC ministerial meetings, there has been a customs symposium. I think we kicked this off in Seattle and found it to be very useful, where customs officials sit down and talk with importers and exporters about practical problems faced by firms doing business in that country. I sat in on a small part of this in Jakarta last year, and this was an incredibly well-attended event:  a roomful of probably three or four hundred businessmen talking with Indonesian customs officials. They had the director-general and the other customs officials, as well as some international customs officials from the GATT and the World Customs Organization, talking about practical problems in an actual forum where businessmen could go into some of the problems in terms of importing and exporting in Indonesia:  good contacts and a good way to exchange information and seek to improve procedures and solve problems.
<p>
Another example is mutual recognition agreements. This is something that is still being worked on. Member economies have different product standards, and products typically will have to be tested and approved by different testing organizations. Even though individual economies may have their own standards for their own reasons, the ideal is to have a harmonized standard, but in many cases that will not be possible. In terms of testing and testing conformance to standards, is it fruitful and efficient to test every product in every place, or can we in APEC come up with an approach where we agree to test it once and accept it everywhere and, if so, this really facilitates movement of products in the region?  Again, I think this is probably less a problem in the United States, but I know that many American exporters, as they try to ship a product into Japan or into China, face tremendous problems. Sometimes each product has to be tested. So if we could somehow simplify testing procedures, recognize the results of tests regionwide, that should really facilitate the movement of products in the region.
<P>
Finally, there is another category of tangible, near-term, and practical benefits for business, and I put it under the business promotion rubric. I'll give just a couple of examples. One example is simply showcasing technologies. This year Secretary of Transportation Pea hosted an APEC Transportation Ministerial meeting. All of the transport ministers from around the region met here in Washington for two days for an excellent session in one of the conference rooms of the State Department. Day One of that session was a symposium of the ministers with the business communities. Every minister was invited, and most of them brought a group of businessmen concerned with the transportation sector. For a day, the ministers sat down and talked with businessmen about transportation issues in the region.
<p>
There was an official ministers-only session the next day, and then Secretary Pea invited all of the ministers to go with him on a short tour through the United States in order to showcase some of the transportation technology of the U.S. They went to the new Denver airport, which Secretary Pea knew a lot about, as well as to Seattle to look at Boeing, look at some of the infrastructure there, and I think down to San Francisco:  a good opportunity to showcase American technology to ministers from the region. We all know that infrastructure growth in the region, particularly transportation infrastructure, is very important and offers a lot of opportunities. So the post-ministerial tour provided a good exposure for U.S. transportation technology.
<p>
There was another, similar event in Vancouver a couple of years ago, when APEC environmental ministers met under Canadian chairmanship and there was a showcase of environmental technology. I think many American environmental technology companies showed their products at that time. I would hope that there will be more opportunities of the business promotion kind.
<p>
Another impact of APEC, in my opinion -- and this may be more important for the United States than most other member economies -- is to raise the profile of the opportunities in Asia. This is not a conscious objective of U.S. policy, but it is really an important byproduct. In the United States, we have very competitive multinationals, very active globally and in the region. But in the United States, we also have lots of small and medium-sized enterprises which are accustomed to doing business in their state, maybe nationally, but they are not sufficiently oriented to international exports and international investment opportunities. To the extent that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce go to the ministerial and APEC leaders' meetings and thereby draw attention to the opportunities in Asia, they can stimulate the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises in exploring opportunities in Asia that they might not have thought about before.
<p>
Small and medium-sized business here is one of the great generators of new technology, of jobs and so on, and to the extent we can get small business more internationally oriented, that is good for the United States. This is true also in most of the other member economies. Small business is an important component of many of the developing economies, and many of the practical results in APEC that I described earlier really are more beneficial to small businesses, which face these big expenses in lack of transparency and lack of knowledge, than to IBM or General Motors, which are much more comfortable working internationally.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Next is Philip Vaughn, Director of Government Relations for Fluor Corporation, a very large, diversified engineering and construction company operating in over 50 countries. Prior to joining Fluor, Phil was vice president of International Business Government Counselors, a consulting firm here in the District. Before that, he was on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee when Dan Rostenkowski was the chairman and with the Peace Corps in Zaire. He graduated from Georgetown, with a B.S. in foreign service and an M.A. in Arab studies, and speaks French, Arabic, and Italian.
<p>
<b>PHILIP VAUGHN:</b>  Thank you very much for asking me to be here today. As a real believer in APEC, I was very pleased to be a part of this program this morning. Actually, Fluor is very active in Asia. We have offices in all the APEC countries except for Brunei, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
Our involvement in this started last year, when the President asked our chairman, Les McCraw, to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, which is the business advisory group to the APEC leaders. The Pacific Business Forum is made up of two members from each APEC economy, one from a large business -- in the case of the U.S., Fluor Corporation -- and one from a small business. The small business representative for the United States was Discovery Communications, although Discovery Communications is actually not all that small. For the past two years, Fluor has also been co-chairman of the Pacific Business Forum. We have done this with Indonesia last year, and this year we have been co-chairman with Indonesia and Japan.
<p>
I was asked to speak about business views toward APEC. I'm not going to go into great detail on the report which the Pacific Business Forum produced, but I will be happy to send people copies if they want to contact me. I wanted to talk a little more broadly about why APEC is important. I think it's a bit difficult to represent U.S. business views as a whole, for two reasons. First, as you all know, the U.S. business community is probably among the most diverse in all the APEC economies. There are differences between large and small, which we touched on earlier, between the manufacturing sectors and service sectors, heavy industry and high tech; so, depending on who you talk to, you might get a very different opinion on APEC.
<p>
Second, there really is a distinct lack of awareness in the business community about APEC and what it does, so I think, as a whole, business views have not fully matured at this point. Indeed, until our chairman was asked to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, Fluor was aware of APEC but certainly not deeply involved in it. 
<p>
Before I go into the specific trade and investment issues that we were looking at this year in APEC as the PBF, I would like to make some very broad comments on why I think APEC is important to business.
<p>
First, it can help solidify the economic and political security of the region that business needs to feel confident in its investments. It is clearly in the interests of the U.S. business community to have a forum in which the U.S. can deepen its ties with all of its trading partners in the Asia Pacific region.
<p>
Second, APEC offers a mechanism for anchoring the U.S. in the region, as I mentioned, both strategically and economically. There seems to be a lot of debate today, at least around APEC, that America may be too focused on Asia, putting too much emphasis on the region; that we do not have a natural role there; that the cultural differences are far too great; and that we really should be focusing perhaps more on Latin America or Europe. I think the physical distance, the cultural differences, and the lack of a clear role in the post-Cold War world perhaps make APEC even more important, and keeping the U.S. involved in the region through APEC even more a priority.
<p>
Third, APEC is the only truly regional grouping in existence, and I think it can play an important role in bringing together the NAFTAs, the AFTAs (which is the ASEAN free trade area), the CERs (which is the free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand), and prevent the region from breaking down into a multiplicity of isolated subregional trading blocs.
<P>
And fourth, APEC offers the U.S. a broad policy forum in which we can sit down and talk to our trading partners in more constructive dialogue, rather than in destructive confrontations that I think we have had in the past.
<p>
Beyond the tariff and trade and business reasons, I think those four are very broad areas or reasons to stay involved in the APEC process. But when you get to the business side, people always look at me and say, "Well, why APEC?  Why are you involved in it?  Does this really have any meaningful impact on your bottom line?"  I think the answer really is a resounding, "Yes, it can," but only if APEC gets its act together this year and starts taking some tough decisions in Osaka is it going to prove to business once and for all that it is willing to move from being a policy talk shop into an action-oriented forum. I think that is the main thing we need to see from Osaka this year.
<P>
Our report that the Pacific Business Forum produced this year, in fact, addresses this issue. Our theme is "Making APEC more relevant to business."  To achieve that business relevancy, APEC has to do two things this year. First, it has to establish itself as a credible and effective organization in the eyes of business, and, put very simply, that means we want to see APEC take some actions that are going to have an immediate and beneficial impact on our ability to conduct business in the region. If APEC does not begin to undertake these types of activities, I think it is going to lose its growing credibility with business, both in the U.S. and in the region, and the nascent business support you are seeing for APEC is going to evaporate.
<p>
Second, APEC really needs to strengthen its ties with business. There has been some general agreement that business has been the driving force behind the tremendous growth we have seen in the region in the last decade. Business is going to continue to do its part to drive that growth and create jobs, but we can do that better in partnership with the public sector through APEC in breaking down some of the barriers that you referred to. That is going to take a great deal of effort, because I'm not convinced that all of the APEC economies really want business input into the process. It is clear the U.S. is looking for it. Australia is looking for it. But I think there is a definite lack of interest in business participation by some of the other members.
<p>
Looking to the Osaka meetings, which are coming up in just about two weeks, there are three very broad things we would like to see. First of all, we need to see a clear road map on how we are going to get to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 and 2020. This would include time lines, milestones, and frequent progress reviews so that we can see exactly who is living up to their commitments, who is not living up to their commitments, and whether APEC as a whole is moving in the right direction. Declarations of intent and promises to do things next year and the year after simply aren't good enough any more.
<p>
Second, at Osaka we need to see a series of steps announced which prove APEC is serious about this trade and investment liberalization agenda. I think these can be small things. They don't all have to be focused on the tariff area. We can accelerate the work they have done in the customs area. We can look at visa-free entry for business travelers. You could look at further work on the rather weak investment principles that were adopted in Jakarta last year, look at continued work on intellectual property. These things are not difficult. They don't cost money, and with a little bit of political will by the leaders, I think they could be done.
<p>
Third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to strengthen this partnership between business and APEC, and there are two main ways I think that can be done. PBF has recommended that a successor organization to our group be established, which would be an official advisory group by regional business to the APEC leaders and ministers. I think there is a lot of debate about how that is going to come out.
<p>
In addition to that formal advisory group, APEC really does need to reach out, whether they want to or not, and get business involved in the working groups -- the ten that you mentioned, some of the programs you mentioned -- on an ongoing basis. Getting a report from business once a year will not keep APEC on the right track. They need to include businessmen in the official discussions; they need to include business in all of their meetings on an ongoing basis. Otherwise, I think we are going to see APEC waver from the path they are setting this year.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to say that I think APEC really is a remarkable organization. It has come a lot further, a lot faster, than anyone might have imagined. We are always intoning this mantra:  that APEC's been around six years and, by God, it better do something this year or we're going to walk away from it. But if you look at it, APEC has been around for only six years. I think it has come rather far for an organization of 18 countries of very disparate levels of economic development, disparate languages and cultures. I think we need to support APEC -- give them a little more time than we have so far.
<P>
Let me make one last observation. I mentioned earlier about keeping the U.S. involved in Asia. There seems to be a big debate these days on Asian values and Western values, and on differences between our philosophies and our ways of doing things. This is usually in the context of why APEC must fail or why ultimately the East and West cannot work together. Well, the PBF was 34 people from 18 different economies, different economic backgrounds, different outlooks, yet over time we all learned to respect each other, to respect each other's points of view. We have worked in great harmony and, in the true spirit of APEC, achieved consensus and mutual respect. We produced a report which every person put their signature on. If this represents the future of the region, I am really very optimistic that we are going to be able to work together in a long and productive partnership, both as business and as government. Thank you.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Dan Amstutz became president and CEO of the North American Export Grain Association in Washington last April. For three years previous to that, he was executive director of the International Wheat Council in London. Earlier, he had been in the Reagan Administration for six years, first as undersecretary of Agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs and then as ambassador and chief negotiator for agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round trade negotiations. He was one of the key architects of the U.S. agriculture position in that round. When that round started, one of the U.S.'s major objectives was to have trade in agriculture products covered by GATT -- now WTO -- rules, and that was accomplished. Before that, Dan was with Goldman Sachs. He also was with Cargill for 25 years, the culmination of which was his serving as president and CEO of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago. We particularly wanted somebody who knew the agriculture sector around the world on this panel, given the divisions within APEC about that issue, so we are eager to hear from you.
<p>
<b>DAN AMSTUTZ:</b>  Thank you, Barbara. Phil mentioned that some opine that, perhaps, here in America these days we focus too much on Asia to the exclusion of the rest of the world. But from an agricultural perspective, probably we do not focus enough. When one looks at the demographic and economic outlook, it is staggering. Just to pass on a few things that most of you have heard before, it is highly likely that the world's population by 2025 will increase by 50 percent over current levels; it is reasonable to expect that at that time some 35 percent of the world's people will live in only two countries, China and India; so, within a generation, half the number of people that live in the entire world now may be living in China and India alone.
<P>
The economic scenario is equally exciting. Currently, the five largest economies in the world are the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, and France. In the year 2020, when trade liberalization is supposed to be accomplished in the APEC, the five largest economies of the world, with the exception of the United States, will be Asian:  China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. France will be ninth largest, behind Germany, Korea, and Thailand, and Britain will be the fourteenth largest, behind Russia and barely ahead of Mexico. Canada, currently part of the G-7, will not even be in the list of the top 15. It appears that the OECD is rapidly becoming irrelevant and that it will have to be replaced by a new grouping, but that is a different subject.
<p>
Consider just one example of why agriculture is so interested in Asia. This is an OECD estimate. If China, India, and Indonesia grow by an average of 6 percent a year economically, which is entirely feasible, and their income distribution remains unchanged from current levels, by the year 2010 some 700 million people in those countries will have an average income equal to Spain today. That is 600 million more than at present. The interesting thing about that number, 700 million, is that it is roughly equal to the current combined populations of the United States, the European Union, and Japan. So in a half a generation, a sophisticated market equal in size to Europe, the U.S., and Japan will develop in China, India, and Indonesia. For the agriculture sector, that is a lot of business:  a lot of meat and a lot of all kinds of food products. It presents an exciting outlook for trade expansion.
<P>
The agriculture industry in this country, by and large, is very much in favor of trade liberalization. We believe, as an industry, that trade negotiations must be comprehensive; otherwise, they are self-defeating. That means that all industries must be involved, and all segments of each industry, and that all barriers, all forms of protection, must be addressed.
<P>
The magic of trade negotiations is the concept of reciprocity, and unless you have a comprehensive negotiation, the magic of reciprocity breaks down. How in the world can you expect the U.S. to agree to liberalize import barriers for textiles and apparel, for example, if it is not going to enjoy better market access for some products in which it has a comparative advantage, namely, in agriculture?  The conclusion must be clear:  There would be no progress.
<P>
The truth is that the history of trade negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, has been one of addressing the subject almost on a case-by-case, product-by-product basis. The terminology is "request/offer."  Country A says, "Can you open the market for more tires that we produce here?"  And Country B says, "Maybe we can do that, but what can you do about opening opportunities for the United Parcel Service?"  I use those two examples because I read that when President Zedillo was here from Mexico, these were trade issues that he discussed with President Clinton. With heads of state and heads of government meeting with each other, this is the process that has ensued. So product by product, service by service, progress is made, but slowly. The objective of a multilateral approach is to expand markets quickly, to allow for the generation of more wealth and more buying power quickly. That can be accomplished, in my judgment, only if we follow a truly comprehensive approach.
<p>
It goes without saying that when that kind of approach is endorsed, there will be some displacement of industries in various countries. It goes without saying that there is an enormous need for retraining, for restructuring, for redeveloping industries. And that becomes a national obligation, both by government and by the private sector. The reason for reluctance, and the reason countries ask for flexibility in the approach to trade negotiation, is they do not want to face those necessities. But the payoff is more opportunity, more access, more growth for more industries. This was what we preached at the beginning of the Uruguay Round, and I am proud that we were able to maintain agriculture on a comprehensive basis during that round.
<P>
I might add that, even in my industry, there are losers from this, and there are some that say, "Wait a minute, let's show some flexibility," as the government of Japan currently says. Certainly, the textile industry of this country would like to slow down the flow of textiles and apparel into the United States. And certainly, as we have trade liberalization, there is going to be a need for some restructuring and retraining and redevelopment in that industry here in the U.S. But there are always new services and new products that can be developed and for which there can be a market around the world. Again, the question is, "How quickly, how rapidly, can world economies expand?"  And the payoff from trade liberalization is that more countries are shipping more goods and services, and more wealth is indeed generated. That is what we're searching for.
<p>
We don't need an APEC to do that, I guess, but I'm here to tell you that an APEC really facilitates it, and really permits it to work much more effectively and much more rapidly. Is APEC competing with the World Trade Organization?  Not at all. It is facilitating it and advancing the objectives of trade liberalization more rapidly.
<p>
Can there be sensitivity to weak economies in this?  The term for this in trade negotiations is S&D, special and differential:  special and differential treatment for economies that are developing more slowly, special and differential treatment for industries that have particular problems in various countries. Of course there can be, and APEC is on a dual track in this regard:  2010 for the developed countries, 2020 for the developing. And there can be flexibility shown within that -- although I should not use the word "flexibility," because it's a buzz term for exclusions, and I want to speak out forcefully against that.
<p>
Within any industry there are some that will say, "Well, let's not rush too rapidly into this because we'll make some of our very good customers unhappy."  The truth is, the best customer in the world for American agriculture is Japan. By far. And I can tell you that we in American agriculture value the markets in Japan very much. We need them, we would like them to grow, and we want to help in that effort, in that pursuit. To use the word "reciprocity" again, we're very eager to help Japan's market outlets in this country grow as well.
<P>
The fainthearted cannot prevail these days on these subjects. You really cannot have your cake and eat it too; you either support overall growth in trade, or you opt for what I would say is a no-growth situation. So, again, to sum up, the opportunities for all involved in trade expansion in all the APEC countries -- certainly in agriculture -- are dramatic and exciting. We can have optimum realization of these opportunities for all only if APEC plows forward with a truly comprehensive approach. Then the magic of reciprocity will really work. It is for all of us who are not in government to urge our governments to press hard for this, and I think we will all be pleased with the results in the years ahead.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The vast expanses of the former Soviet Union harbor oil and gas riches which will be crucial in fueling the global economy in the next century. The huge oil reserves, estimated at over 25 billion barrels, under the Caspian Sea and in the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are similar to those in Kuwait and larger than those in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Control over these energy resources and export routes out of the Eurasian hinterland is quickly becoming one of the central issues in post-Cold War politics. Like the "Great Game" of the early 20th century, in which the geopolitical interests of the British Empire and Russia clashed over the Caucasus region and Central Asia, today's struggle between Russia and the West may turn on who controls the oil reserves in Eurasia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The world now faces a choice between the cooperative exploitation by the East and West of natural resources or a wasteful struggle that could cost a fortune in blood and treasure. Regional conflicts in the Caucasus and Central Asia threaten to deny Western access to the vital oil and gas reserves the world will need in the 21st century. The wars in Chechnya, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in Georgia were started or exacerbated by the Russian military, and the outcome of these wars may determine who controls future pipeline routes. Moscow hopes that Russia will. Powerful interests in Moscow are attempting to ensure that the only route for exporting the energy resources of Eurasia will pass through Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs to ensure free and fair access for all interested parties to the oil fields of the Caucasus and Central Asia. These resources are crucial to ensuring prosperity in the first half of the 21st century and beyond. Access to Eurasian energy reserves could reduce the West's dependence on Middle East oil and ensure lower oil and gas prices for decades to come. Moreover, oil revenues can boost the independence and prosperity of such Newly Independent States (NIS) as Azerbaijan and Georgia. For example, through production royalties, Azerbaijan could generate over $2 billion a year in revenue from its oil fields, while Georgia could get over $500 million annually from transit fees. With these new-found oil riches, non-Russian republics in the region would depend less on Russia, both economically and militarily. Independent and self-sufficient former Soviet states, bolstered by their oil revenues, would deny Russia the option of establishing a <i>de facto</i> sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two pipeline routes in Central Asia are under consideration. The first would allow oil to flow from the Azerbaijani Caspian Sea shelf to the Black Sea coast. The second would transport oil from the giant Tengiz oil field, developed by the U.S.-based Chevron corporation in Kazakhstan, in a westerly direction toward Europe and the Mediterranean. Western governments and oil companies participating in the Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani pipeline projects<sup>1</sup> face a choice: Will a neo-imperialist Russia (aided and abetted by Iran) dominate the development of Eurasian oil and its exports, or will Russia be an equal and fair player in the region with Turkey, the three Caucasian states (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), and possibly Iran?  The U.S. should respect the right of Russian companies to bid for the exploration and transport of oil and gas in the region. However, the West has a paramount interest in assuring that the Caucasian and Central Asian states maintain their independence and remain open to the West. Otherwise, Moscow will capture almost monopolistic control over this vital energy resource, thus increasing Western dependence upon Russian-dominated oil reserves and export routes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves in Central Asia, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the Newly Independent States in Central Asia.</b> The U.S. should try to prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). To achieve that end, it should endeavor to ensure that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other Newly Independent States receive a fair portion of the oil revenues from the region. Moreover, the U.S. should strengthen bilateral and multilateral political and military cooperation with these states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil and gas companies should be allowed to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equitable basis with other countries in the region. That is their right. Forming partnerships with Western oil companies could turn the Russian business sector into an ally of the West. However, domination by military means should be rejected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> Thus far, the West has focused mainly on settling the crisis in Bosnia, relegating the Caucasus region to the back burner. Now that a Bosnian settlement has been reached, the U.S. should endeavor to settle the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The OSCE would be a useful vehicle for pursuing these goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian geostrategic ambitions and Iranian-style religious militancy pose long-term threats to the Muslim societies of the region. These threats can be countered by helping to create free market economies, respect for the rule of law, and a civil society that respects democracy and political pluralism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> Absent a new oil pipeline, more potentially hazardous oil shipments will pass through the already clogged Bosphorus Straits. Oil tanker fires like the one in 1994 can block international shipping through the Boshporus for days, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage and threatening the lives and health of local citizens. The U.S. should support a pipeline route through the territory of Georgia and Turkey that will bring oil from Eurasia to a Mediterranean port such as Ceyhan in Turkey.
</ul><p>

<b>WARS ENDANGERING OIL TRANSIT ROUTES IN THE CAUCASUS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The War in Chechnya.</b> One of the main goals of the Russian attack on Chechnya in December of 1994 was to ensure control of the oil pipeline which runs from Baku, via Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the Russian city of Tikhoretsk. The pipeline ends at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, designed by Russia to be the terminal for the proposed Kazakh and Azerbaijani pipelines.<sup>2</sup> In addition, Grozny boasts a large refinery with a processing capacity of 12 million tons per year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During its brief self-proclaimed independence under President Jokhar Dudayev from 1991 to 1994, Chechnya illegally exported crude oil and refined products worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. The rebel government worked closely with corrupt politicians in Moscow to obtain export licenses. Partly to cut off this activity, Russia launched a massive but covert military action in the fall of 1994 to support opponents of Dudayev. In 1994, Dudayev turned to radical Islamic elements in the Middle East and Central Asia for support. This exacerbated the religious aspect of the conflict between the Muslim Chechens and Christian Orthodox Russians. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overt military action began on December 12, 1994, when the Russian army marched on Grozny, destroying Chechnya's capital city by brutal aerial, tank, and artillery bombardment. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, and more than 300,000 have become refugees. Hostilities continue, with hostage-taking crises erupting in July 1995 and January 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Drama in Georgia.</b> Another conflict affecting potential oil routes is occuring in the Caucasus republic of Georgia. Russia wants to prevent oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan from going the "Western" route through Georgia to Turkey. Moscow's support of civil strife in Georgia is directly connected to its goal of perpetuating conflict in the Caucasus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1991 through the end of 1993, Georgia was in the midst of a bloody civil war which pitted the supporters of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia against each other. Political violence became chronic. Eventually, the defeated Gamsakhurdia either committed suicide or was murdered under mysterious circumstances in 1993. But even after his victory over Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze faced challenges from warlords and militias. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In exchange for crucial Russian support, Shevardnadze finally was forced to join the CIS in October 1993, a move he had bitterly opposed. When he attempted to read a press release announcing this step, Russian diplomats took it out of his hands and gave him a Moscow-authored text to read. Such was the degree of independence enjoyed by Shevardnadze at the hands of his Russian patrons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1995, Moscow brought pressure on Shevardnadze not to build a pipeline for Azeri oil through Georgian territory. The Georgians wanted to bring oil to the Georgian port of Supsa (between Poti and Tbilisi), from which it then would be exported by tanker to Turkey. However, the Russians demurred. Soon after Shevardnadze refused to cancel the pipeline plan, he was injured in an assassination attempt when a car bomb exploded next to his vehicle on August 29, 1995. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shevardnadze has insisted repeatedly that Russia was behind this attempt on his life. The suspected culprit -- Shevardnadze's security chief, Igor Georgadze -- has escaped to Russia and continues to threaten Shevardnadze's life.<sup>3</sup>  Shevardnadze demanded that the Russians extradite the suspect, and the Russian Prosecutor General's Office issued an order for his arrest. However, the Russian Interior Minister refused the extradition, and Georgadze is still at large. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Fighting in Abkhazia.</b> Another dangerous conflict is smoldering in Abkhazia, a breakaway region in Georgia. The bitter war in Abkhazia, which began in 1992, has claimed over 35,000 lives. It was precipitated by the Russian military backing the Abkhaz separatist minority against the Georgian government in Tbilisi.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One purpose of the Russian intervention was to weaken Georgia and curb Turkish and Western influence in the region. But more important was the Russian goal of controlling access to oil. By acting as it did, Russia gained <i>de facto</i> control over the long Black Sea coastline in Abkhazia. Moscow also was protecting the Russian Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse and moving closer to the Georgian oil exporting ports in Poti, Supsa, and Batumi. In August 1995, Georgia's beleaguered President Shevardnadze agreed to place four Russian military bases on Georgian soil, thus assuring Russia's control of the oil exporting routes via the Black Sea coast. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Russia became entangled in Chechnya in 1994-1995, and word of Chechen commando training camps operating from Abkhazia spread, Moscow began to show less support for the Abkhaz rebels, who are allies of the Chechens. But Russia also has refused either to close the border with Abkhazia or to deny the separatist government in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, financial and military support. Shevardnadze had hoped that this would be a Russian <i>quid pro quo</i> for his agreement to permit Russian military bases on Georgian territory.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict.</b> Yet another bloody war affecting potential oil pipeline routes is occurring in Nagorno-Karabakh, a small, largely Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The enclave of Karabakh sits astride a potential oil route from the Caspian Sea to Turkey. Populated mainly by Armenians, Karabakh was put under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction in 1921 after Stalin negotiated a treaty in the Transcaucasus between communist Russia and Turkey. Strife between the mainly Christian Armenians and Shi'a Muslim Azerbaijanis broke out in 1988. Full-scale war erupted in 1992, with the Armenians demanding complete independence for Karabakh or its absorption into Armenia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cease-fire negotiated in May 1994 has been holding. The Armenians in Karabakh have proclaimed an independent republic, which Azerbaijan refuses to recognize. Thus far, Azerbaijan has suffered political and military defeat at the hands of the Armenians, losing one-fifth of its territory since the collapse of the Soviet Union. One million people, mostly Azerbaijanis, have become refugees as a result of the war. The Azeri capital of Baku has seen the government change three times since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has supported the Armenians and the Azeris intermittently. In 1992, Moscow proposed that Russia become a guarantor of peace in the region, promising to send in 3,000 peacekeepers, but was rebuffed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security group in Europe.<sup>4</sup>.  The OSCE "Minsk group," which consists of Russia, the U.S., Turkey, France, Sweden, and Italy, has been charged with finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict but thus far has met with only limited success. Under Western pressure, Moscow has agreed to a multilateral OSCE peacekeeping force for Karabakh. However, this force has yet to materialize, and there is still no peace agreement between the warring parties. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Azerbaijan: Key Oil Region.</b> The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is important because of the immense oil reserves controlled by Azerbaijan. Since the late 19th century, the oil in Azerbaijan has played a key role in the economies of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union, as well as in the global energy market. International business interests, such as the Nobel and Rothschild families, and even conquerors like Adolf Hitler have all vied at different times for control of Azerbaijan's oil. Even after 100 years of Russian imperial and Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan still has some of the largest reserves in the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At stake today is a $6 billion, 4 billion barrel Caspian Sea shelf petroleum deal between Azerbaijan and a consortium of large international oil companies.<sup>5</sup>  Put simply, Russia opposes the deal. The Russian oil company Lukoil is part of this international consortium, but other Russian oil interests felt excluded, and the Russian foreign and defense ministries have come out squarely against the arrangement. In addition to demanding that at least 25 percent of the deal go to Russian firms (Lukoil gets only 10 percent), Moscow wants full control of the oil exports. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Caspian Sea oil deal was facilitated first by President Abulfaz Elchibei, who was overthrown in June 1993 by former Azerbaijani KGB Chief and Brezhnev Politburo member General Heydar Aliev.<sup>6</sup>  While Elchibei was considered pro-Turkish, Aliev had a reputation for being pro-Russian. It was Aliev who signed the oil agreement in September 1994. On October 9, 1995, the Azerbaijani International Oil Consortium (AIOC) announced that "early" oil (approximately 80,000 barrels a month) would be split between two pipelines. The northern line would go to the Russian port of Novorossiysk (via unstable Chechnya) and the western line to the Georgian port of Supsa in two separate pipelines. This was a compromise decision supported by the Clinton Administration and aimed at placating Moscow, but it failed to do so. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite his attempts to accommodate Russia, Moscow apparently considers Aliev too independent. Therefore, the Kremlin is backing Suret Husseinov, a warlord who reportedly has good connections with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.<sup>7</sup>  Between 1993 and 1995, four unsuccessful coups were attempted against Aliev, reportedly with Moscow's support. Russia also is playing the ethnic separatism card against Aliev, bolstering the national movement of the Lezgin minority in the north of Azerbaijan and the movement of the Talysh minority in the south. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Aliev has proved himself to be a tough survivor. Although Azerbaijan has joined the CIS, he has managed to resist the pressure to deploy Russian military bases or troops on Azerbaijani soil. However, Moscow probably can outwait Aliev, in the meantime fostering instability in Azerbaijan. Russia will attempt to block any large-scale production or exports of oil from Azerbaijan until such time as a more compliant man can be put in charge.
<p>

<b>OIL POLITICS AND RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM IN THE "NEAR ABROAD"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The main threat to the equitable development of Eurasian oil is the Russian attempt to dominate the region in a <i>de facto</i> alliance with the radical Islamic regime in Tehran.<sup>8</sup>  Russia benefits from instability in the Caucasus, where wars and conflicts undermine independence and economic development while hindering the export of oil from the region's states.<sup>9</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moscow has gone beyond words to establish its power in the Caucasus. The Russians are setting up military bases in the region in order to gain exclusive control over all future pipelines. Georgia now has four Russian bases and Armenia has three, while Azerbaijan is still holding out under severe pressure from Moscow. In addition, members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are required to police their borders jointly with Russian border guards, and thus are denied effective control over their own territory. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Attempts to Reintegrate the South.</b> The struggle to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia started in early 1992. While not a full-scale war, this struggle employs a broad spectrum of military, covert, diplomatic, and economic measures. The southern tier of the former Soviet Union is a zone of feverish Russian activity aimed at tightening Moscow's grip in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. The entire southern rim of Russia is a turbulent frontier, a highly unstable environment in which metropolitan civilian and military elites, local players, and mid-level officers and bureaucrats drive the process of reintegration.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin called for a re-examination of Russia's borders to the detriment of her neighbors, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For example, upon his return from a state visit to the U.S. in September 1994, Yeltsin reiterated Russia's "right" to conduct "peacemaking" in the "near abroad," to protect Russian speakers and to exercise freedom of action in its sphere of influence.<sup>11</sup>  These statements were echoed on numerous occasions by former Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other key policymakers in Moscow. In his September 1995 Decree "On Approval of the Strategic Policy of the Russian Federation Toward CIS Member States,"<sup>12</sup> Yeltsin outlined plans to create a CIS military and economic union. Some observers have termed this design an informal empire "on the cheap," a "sustainable empire" which is less centralized than the old Soviet Union.<sup>13</sup>  The aim of such an arrangement would be to ensure Russia's control of the oil and gas reserves in Eurasia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Competing political interests inside Russia's neighbors often prompt local elites to challenge the faction in power and to seek Moscow's support. For example, Russian oil chieftains in Kazakhstan and military commanders who are still in place in Moldova and Georgia naturally maintain close links with Moscow. Where it lacks troops on the ground, Moscow supports the most pro-Russian faction in the conflict, such as Trans-Dniestrian ethnic Russians in Moldova, the separatist Abkhazs in Georgia, warlords and former communist leaders in Azerbaijan, and pro-communist clans in Tajikistan. This is a classic scenario for imperial expansion. What is common to these conflicts is that without Russian support, the pro-Moscow factions (regardless of their ethnicity) could not have dominated their respective regions, and would be forced to seek negotiated and peaceful solutions. In each case, appeals by the legitimate governments of the Newly Independent States to restore their territorial integrity were ignored by Moscow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russian political elites have not overcome the imperialist ideology that inspired both pre-1917 and Soviet expansionism. For today's Moscow bureaucrats and generals, as for their predecessors in St. Petersburg prior to 1917, the turbulent southern periphery is a potential source of political fortunes, promotions, and careers. For Russian politicians in search of a grand cause, re-establishing the empire and paying for it with Eurasian oil revenues is a winning proposition, especially in the murky environment in the aftermath of imperial collapse. 
<p>

<b>KEY RUSSIAN PLAYERS IN THE GREAT OIL GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and security services are by far the most resolute driving force behind the restoration of a Russian-dominated CIS. They are playing a key role in ensuring Moscow's control over the pipeline routes. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall terminated, at least temporarily, confrontation with the West, leaving the Red Army's General Staff, the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and the former KGB desperately seeking new missions. The biggest of these new missions is to establish control over Caucasus and Central Asian oil, establishing a Russian sphere of influence in the process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control. Russian military activities over the last four years indicate an attempt to consolidate strategic control of oil sources and export routes in Eurasia. For example, the war in Chechnya blocked an important pipeline from Azerbaijan through Grozny, and the victory of the Abkhaz separatists, supported by the Russian military, further secured the Russian oil terminals in the ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse. In order to obtain an oil route in the region, Western exporters may be pressured to reach accomodations with the Russian generals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian intelligence services are also involved. The successor to the KGB's First Chief Directorate, now known as the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVRR) and led until January 1996 by KGB general and now Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov, published an important document in 1994 on Russia's policies in the "near abroad," called "Russia-CIS: Does the Western Position Require Correction?"<sup>14</sup>  General Primakov's staff argued that any attempt to integrate the CIS states into the global economy without Moscow's cooperation is doomed to fail. Russia already has effectively stopped Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani joint oil exporting ventures in their tracks. 

<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The states of the CIS's southern tier were coerced by Russia even before they declared their independence from the USSR. Moscow incited local pro-Russian factions, such as Abkhazians in Georgia, Armenians in Karabakh, and hard-line communist pro-Russian clans in Tajikistan, to challenge the independence and territorial integrity of these nascent states. The Russian military provided advisers, hardware, training, planning, and coordination for the military activities in these areas. As a result, hundreds of thousands have been left dead, wounded, or homeless. In addition, these violent conflicts blocked the transit routes to the West for Caspian and Central Asian oil. 
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN THE GREAT GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<sup>15</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Eurasian oil resources are pivotal to economic development in the early 21st century. The supply of Middle Eastern oil would become precarious if Saudi Arabia became unstable, or if Iran or Iraq provoked another military conflict in the area. Eurasian oil is also key to the economic development of the southern NIS. Only with oil revenues can these countries sever their dependence on Moscow and develop modern market economies and free societies. Moreover, if these vast oil reserves were tapped and developed, tens of thousands of U.S. and Western jobs would be created. The U.S. should ensure free access to these reserves for the benefit of both Western and local economies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to protect U.S. and Western interests in Eurasia and ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves of the region, the United States should:
<p><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the New Independent States in the region.</b> In cooperation with Britain, Germany, and France, the U.S. should prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern CIS. The West should not grant Moscow <i>carte blanche</i> in the "near abroad" in exchange for cooperation in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. should lead other Western countries in implementing programs that support independent statehood, free-market development, and the rule of law in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Central Asian states. Training for the civil and security services of these countries should be stepped up, and economic reforms, including privatization of industries and agriculture, should be continued. Moreover, sanctions on technical and humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan, imposed at the height of the Karabakh conflict, should be lifted to increase Washington's leverage in settling the conflict there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil companies should be assured of equitable access to the development of oil resources and pipeline projects. The strategic goal of the West should be the creation of a level playing field that allows Russian and Western corporations to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equal footing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If cooperation from Russia is not forthcoming, the U.S. should oppose attempts by the Russian security establishment to impose a single direction for the pipelines -- i.e., north, via Russian territory. This kind of geopolitical <i>diktat</i> would give Moscow an unacceptable level of control over the flow of oil to Western markets and would make the West vulnerable to Russia's political whims. The U.S. government should demand that Russia stop fostering conflicts in the area. At the same time, Washington should promise that the interests of Russian companies operating in the region will be taken into account in current and future oil consortia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> The OSCE has been charged by its members with settling the conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, and Karabakh. This authority is recognized by Russia. So far, the OSCE has not been successful. To become more so, the OSCE should step up efforts to bring together the leaders of the Newly Independent States and separatist ethnic groups so they can find acceptable political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The OSCE should assign senior politicians to mediate in order to prevent new conflicts, particularly between the Azerbaijanis and the Lezgin and Talysh minorities in Azerbaijan, or between the Georgians and the Adzhar minority. An OSCE-sponsored conference to promote minority rights in the Southern CIS would be in order. The U.S. and its allies should support the OSCE's efforts and initiate a bilateral dialog with leaders of the ethnic groups to assist them in finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> in their countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian ambitions and Islamic radicalism threaten the pro-Western orientation of regimes in the region. Economic development, support for basic human rights, and cultural affinity with the West are important to prevent a radicalization of Islamic politics in the region. An important ally in this regard is Turkey. The U.S. should support Turkey's bid for membership in the European Union. Turkish efforts have been sidetracked by the Europeans because of Ankara's crackdown on the Kurds last year. Washington should urge the Europeans to refrain from rejecting Turkish Westernizers and pushing the Turks into the hands of militant Islamists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> As an important U.S. ally and founding NATO member, Turkey has raised serious concerns regarding tanker exports of Eurasian oil through the narrow and twisting Bosphorus Straits. Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, would be endangered by the nonstop tanker traffic the exports of vast new quantities of Eurasian oil would require. 
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Straits today are one of the busiest maritime passages in the world. The shipping of more oil from Eurasia would clog the already crowded waterway. Recent accidents involving burning tankers prove that Turkish concerns are justified. Free access to shipping via the Straits was envisaged in the 19th century, when the volume of traffic was twenty times lower than today. Therefore, the safest (and cheapest) route for Eurasian oil, which is preferred by Western oil companies, is a large pipeline from the Caucasus via Turkey to the Eastern Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The struggle for Eurasian oil is a multifaceted game. It involves security, geopolitical, and economic interests not only Russian and Eurasian, but American and Western as well. In Russia, nothing less than democracy is at stake. If Russia pursues a cooperative engagement with the West in the Caucasus, it will strengthen its economic and political integration with the West. However, if it chooses to challenge the West and reverts to its old imperial ways, Moscow likely will become increasingly hostile toward the West in other areas as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The oil and gas reserves of the Caucasus and Central Asia are vital to Western geostrategic and economic interests in the 21st century. They have the potential to secure prosperity and economic growth bolstered by low oil prices. In addition, these resources are key to ensuring revenues and, with them, the sovereignty of the Newly Independent States. In addition, the wealth brought by oil can fuel both economic and democratic development in the Caucasus and Central Asia, fostering the independence and freedom of countries which serve in turn as an obstacle to potential Russian imperial expansion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and political establishment is attempting to impose a sphere of influence on the CIS and secure control of the region's oil. If a hardliner wins the Russian presidential elections in June 1996, these efforts may redouble. A major campaign to assert influence in the Russian "near abroad" would be a setback for U.S. interests. In addition, control of the Caucasus and Central Asia would allow Russia geographical proximity to, and closer cooperation with, the anti-Western regimes in Tehran and Baghdad. Together, an anti-Western Russia, Iran, and Iraq, if they desired, could pursue a common interest in driving up the price of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To counter this prospect, the U.S. and the West need to convince the Russians to approach the oil question in Eurasia as an economic, not geopolitical, opportunity. The U.S. should reassure Russia that its companies will be included in future economic ventures in the region. Russian companies alone do not have the technological and financial resources to develop the hydrocarbon reserves of Eurasia. They will need Western oil companies to do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To become richer, Russia needs American and Western help. To foster peace and stability in Eurasia, America needs Russian help. A <i>modus vivendi</i> can be reached only if Russia accepts that the principles of free markets, democracy, and state sovereignty take precedence over the outdated geopolitical practices of the past century.
