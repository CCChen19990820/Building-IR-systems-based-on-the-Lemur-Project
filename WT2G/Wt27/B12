<TITLE>	Department of Labor Performance Agreement</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">


 <H2 align=center>Performance Agreement
 
 between<BR>
 
 The President of the United States,
 
 William J. Clinton
 
 and <BR>
 
 The Secretary of Labor,
 
 Robert B. Reich</H2>
 
   

   

<H3>  I. Introduction</H3> 

   

  The American people deserve a government that works better and costs  

  less.  The departments and agencies of the federal government hold  

  vital keys to improving performance and to restoring the faith of the  

  American people in their government.  Many changes will need to take  

  place for this broad goal to be realized.  The purpose of performance  

  agreements with senior officials is to establish clarity and  

  consensus about the priorities for departmental management.  They are  

  intended to improve the management of the Executive Branch and are  

  not intended to and do not create any legally enforceable rights.   

  From these agreements should flow the program and management  

  priorities of the departments.  These agreements represent a  

  beginning, a basis for continuous improvement as we reinvent our  

  government to meet the needs and expectations of the American people.  

   

   

<H3>  II. The Department of Labor</H3> 

   

  <B>Section One:  Purpose</B> 

   
<BR>
  This Agreement reflects the goals and priorities that Secretary of  

  Labor Robert B. Reich has for the Department of Labor for fiscal year  

  1994 and supports his commitment to prepare America's workforce and  

  workplaces for the 21st century.   

   <P>

 <B> Section Two:  Department of Labor's Mission</B> 

   <BR>

  The problem:  Americans are working harder for less and are more  

  anxious about their jobs and their children's futures. 

   <P>

  Americans are working harder for less and are more anxious about  

  their jobs and their children's futures than ever before.  We can,  

  however, ensure that all Americans will enjoy better living standards  

  by creating a better prepared workforce and supporting high value- 

  added work organizations.  To do this, the Department of Labor has  

  embraced four major departmental strategies to enhance worker  

  preparedness and improve American workplaces.  

   <P>

  The creation of a well-prepared workforce begins with &quot;First Jobs&quot;  

  and our plan to prepare all Americans for good jobs at the start of  

  their careers.  Likewise, our workforce is strengthened when  

  individual workers possess the skills to move between jobs as  

  increasing globalization and advancing technologies change the way we  

  work.  Our second strategy, then, focuses on &quot;New Jobs&quot; and our  

  commitment to ease the transition of Americans from job to job.  Our  

  third strategy recognizes that American success in a global economy  

  also requires the development of &quot;Better Jobs,&quot; and we will work  

  diligently to create High Performance Workplaces throughout the  

  country and to enhance the enforcement of labor laws that protect  

  workers' rights, safety and health.  Finally, we know that the  

  successful creation of First, New and Better Jobs depends on the  

  Department's willingness and ability to reinvent itself into a high  

  performance work organization.  Our fourth strategy, therefore, is to  

  reaffirm our commitment to reinvent the Department through a labor- 

  management partnership with our employee unions.   

   <P>

  The following list of Fiscal Year 1994 goals represents the  

  culmination of ideas that have been developed at all levels of the  

  Department of Labor and reflect the Department's internal performance  

  measures.  Last June, for example, 150 Department managers, union  

  representatives and field employees attended a leadership conference  

  where many of these ideas were first posed.  These ideas were  

  analyzed and sharpened by reinvention teams looking at both agency  

  specific suggestions and ideas that cut across agency lines.  In  

  addition, Department of Labor employees contributed over 1,500  

  Proposals to Reinvent and Improve Department of Labor Effectiveness  

  (PRIDE), some of which have been included in our goals.  Together  

  with our employee unions, we have used these ideas to create an  

  agenda for the effective delivery of First Jobs, New Jobs, and Better  

  Jobs to the American workforce and workplace.  Once signed, this  

  document will be distributed to every employee of the Department of  

  Labor and will lay the foundation for working performance agreements  

  between the Secretary and his executive staff.

  <H3>Annex: Performance Measures, Fiscal Year 1994 </H3>

   

  During Fiscal Year 1994 (FY 1994), performance will be measured by  

  the successful accomplishment of the following specific measures:  

   

  1.  ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL BIOLOGICAL SURVEY 

   
<OL type=a>
  <LI> The Secretary commits that the National Biological Survey will  

  be a functioning organization as soon as FY 1994 appropriations  

  become available.  The National Biological Survey will maximize  

  its programmatic work and minimize its administrative  

  structures as it draws upon existing resources across the  

  Department. 

   

  <LI> The Secretary will delegate to the Director of the National  

  Biological Survey responsibility for expanding the current  

  Department research program to include projects related to  

  populations and ecosystems.  The Secretary will  publish clear  

  research priorities for the National Biological Survey by the  

  end of FY 1994. Those priorities will reflect the  

  recommendations of users, communicated through surveys and  

  other forms of customer response. 

   

 <LI> The National Biological Survey will develop an implementation  

  plan by the end of FY 1994 to integrate the Department's  

  biological database systems with other relevant federal and  

  state databases.     

   

  <LI> By the end of FY 1994, the National Biological Survey will  

  publish a generally accepted definition of natural resource  

  status and trends that will provide information needed by the  

  Nation to help avert endangered species crises and to aid in  

  wise management and development decisions. 

 									    

  <LI> The National Biological Survey will provide information on  

  populations and ecosystems to those government agencies, states  

  and other entities that rely on biological data to administer  

  programs and will work with such agency customers to insure  

  that their needs can be met.    

   </OL>

  2.  REFORM LAND MANAGEMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 

   <OL>

  <LI> Subject to outcomes of the Conference Committee, the Secretary  

  will take final action on the administrative proposal that was  

  first announced in August 1993 to improve management of  

  rangeland ecosystems and provide for more effective  

  administration of livestock grazing on public lands.  

   

 <LI> In early 1994, the Department will publish a draft Notice of  

  Proposed Rulemaking for public comment and a draft  

  Environmental Impact Statement regarding rangeland reform. The  

  Secretary is committed to implementing changes in the grazing  

  fee formula that will be used to set fees for grazing on  

  federal lands.  The Secretary also will eliminate the existing  

  Grazing Advisory Boards and District Advisory Councils and  

  replace these with new Resource Advisory Councils that can  

  better represent the many constituencies concerned with public  

  lands and respond to the needs of rangeland managers within  

  specific geographical areas.  

   

  <LI> The Department will develop an experimental set of outcome  

  measures for successful changes in grazing management.  

  Development of these measures will involve the Resource  

  Advisory Board members. These will be included in the final  

  Administrative Proposal to be published by the end of FY 1994. 

    

  <LI> The Secretary will commit significant personal time and  

  appropriate staff resources during FY 1994 to insure passage of  

  mining law reform legislation, under the principles that have  

  been enunciated by the Administration.     

   </OL>

  3.  REINVENT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION 

   <OL type=a>

  <LI> A policy directive will be published in early FY 1994 that will  

  articulate a new mission and structure for a streamlined Bureau  

  of  Reclamation.  This mission will commit the Department to  

  shift its emphasis from large civil works to water and  

  environmental management. 

   

 <LI> In conjunction with Executive Order No. 12862, pertaining to  

  customer service, the  Bureau of  Reclamation will strengthen  

  relationships with the environmental community, water users and  

  other customers during its transformation.  In FY 1994, the  

  Bureau will experiment with customer opinion surveys to measure  

  the level of service expected and received. 

   </OL>

  4. STRENGTHEN THE COMMITMENT OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE TO  

     EMPLOYEES AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

   
<OL type=a>
  <LI> The Secretary will make significant progress in FY 1994 to  

  develop a mechanism to provide seasonal and temporary employees  

  greater benefits in line commensurate with the contribution  

  they have made to the National Park Service. In addition, the  

  Secretary will propose a plan to transfer eligible seasonal and  

  part-time employees to Full Time Equivalents. 

    

 <LI> The Secretary will delegate to the Director of the National  

  Park Service responsibility to finalize the Ranger Futures  

  concept and initiate comparable employee career development  

  activities for other Park Service employees by the end of FY  

  1994. 

   

 <LI> The Secretary will prepare legislation to eliminate  

  prohibitions that restrict the collection of entrance fees at  

  national parks, and to raise entrance fees in those parks where  

  fees are currently charged.   In addition, concession reform  

  will commence with new negotiations of current contracts early  

  in FY 1994.   

   

  <LI> A portion of increased fee revenues will be used to complete  

  infrastructure improvement projects. The National Park Service  

  will develop by the end of FY 1994 ongoing visitor opinion  

  surveys to assess satisfaction with park services and  

  facilities. 

   

  <LI> The problems of inadequate employee housing will be addressed  

  during FY 1994 with a major Department initiative to fund  

  needed housing improvements through private sector  

  partnerships.     

   </OL>

   

  5.  ACT AS A PARTNER WITH INDIAN TRIBES 

   
<OL type=a>
 <LI> In order to assist the tribes in better preparing themselves to  

  compete and prosper in the 21st century, the Department will

  partnership envisioned as the Administration develops its  

  Indian policy position. To carry out this commitment, the  

  Secretary will finalize and implement regulations pursuant to  

  Pub.L. No. 93-638 as soon as possible in FY 1994 and will  

  continue expansion of the self-governance initiative. 

   

 <LI> The Secretary will emphasize continued consultations with the  

  tribes and Congress to develop an appropriate vehicle for the  

  management of Indian trust funds including alternatives other  

  than operations within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 

   

  <LI> Through the reauthorization process for the Indian Education  

  Act in 1994, the Department will develop a sound legislative  

  plan for education of all Indian children in concert with the  

  tribes, Indian parents, Congress, the Department of Education  

  and other federal agencies which have funding and  

  responsibility for Indian Education, and other concerned  

  organizations and individuals.  
</OL>
   

  6. MAKE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WORK 

   
<OL type=a>
  <LI> The Secretary will initiate key administrative reforms to the  

  Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, by issuing four  

  policy directives before the end of  FY 1994: 

   
<OL>

  strategy to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act. The  

  Department of the Interior will provide leadership in  

  developing the Clinton Administration strategy to reauthorize  

  the Endangered Species Act. 

   

  <LI> The Department will provide leadership with the White House to  

  promulgate an Executive Order by February 1, 1994, that will

  individual species including a section 4(d) rule for the  

  Northern Spotted Owl by March 1, 1994 (subject to the  

  alternative timetables dictated by the completion of the FEMAT  

  &quot;Option 9&quot; FEIS); a section 4(d) rule for the California  

  Gnatcatcher by February 1, 1994; and an expedited processing of

     The American people deserve a government that works better and costs

     less.  The departments and agencies of the Federal government hold

     vital keys to improving performance and to restoring the faith of the

     American people in their government.  Many changes will need to take

     place for this broad goal to be realized.  The purpose of performance

     agreements with senior officials is to establish clarity and consensus

     about the priorities for departmental management.  Performance agree-

     ments are intended to improve the management of the Executive Branch

     and are not intended to and do not create any legally enforceable rights.

     <P>

     The Administration has identified national health care reform, Federal

     deficit reduction, downsizing of active duty forces, and reinvention of

     government as domestic priorities.  Changes resulting from these

     initiatives, as well as changing veteran demographics, will affect the

     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dramatically.  Our success in

     responding to these changes will have a significant effect on the

     benefits and services provided to veterans and their families.

     <P>

     VA today stands at the threshold of a period that will guide us into the

     challenges of the 21st century.  Across the entire spectrum of VA

     activity, we are actively changing old patterns and routines to meet a

     new definition of Government service.  Yet the Department has a rich

     tradition to uphold.  We must and will ensure that our policies, our

     people, and our programs remain focused on their fundamental

     purpose: to fulfill the American public's sacred debt of gratitude to

     those who nobly served this Nation in the Armed Forces from World

     War I to Somalia -- our veterans.

     

     This agreement reflects the desire of the President and the Secretary to

     improve services to our Nation's veterans and their families.  To

     accomplish these goals the Department will undertake to accomplish the

     following:

     

     

    <H3> SATISFY OUR CUSTOMERS:  OUR NATION'S VETERANS</H3>


     VA's mission is the most service-oriented of all Cabinet departments. 

     Our customers include 27 million veterans and their families.  Services

     and benefits are provided through a nationwide network of 173 medical

     centers, 357 outpatient, community, and outreach clinics; 130 nursing

     home care units; 39 domiciliaries; 58 veterans benefits regional offices;

     and 114 national cemeteries.  We will establish customer service

     standards ensuring that VA service equals the best in business.  Our

     goal is &quot;Putting Veterans First.&quot;

                               

  <H3>   BECOME AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE</H3>

     

     Solving many of our Nation's most critical problems will require

     Federal employees and managers to respond creatively.  In order to do

     so, we will ensure a work environment free of discrimination with

     employees well trained and empowered to act more independently to

     accomplish VA's mission.

     

     

   <H3>  INTRODUCE MAJOR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS</H3>

     

     We are committed to a thoughtful, strategic approach to examining and

     changing the way VA does its business in serving the Nation's veterans. 

     We will improve the timeliness and quality of our service through

     reinventing and reengineering our delivery processes.  We will maintain

     a comprehensive medical care system for veterans second to none.  We

     will streamline organization structures, procedures and regulations, and

     take advantage of information management in the delivery of services. 

     We will establish benchmarks to measure outcomes and compare our

     performance with other Federal and private sector organizations to

     ensure that VA services are truly efficient and effective.

     

     

     

     <H3>MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE</H3>


     VA will develop specific actions to accomplish the objectives described

     above.  Actions to be taken in Fiscal Year 1994 are contained in the

     Annex.  Internal performance monitoring for these actions will be

     accomplished through VA s Strategic Management Process.  In

     addition, periodic external reviews of progress will be held between the

     President and/or his designees and the Secretary and other VA officials. 

     Any specific reporting requirements will be developed jointly with the

     Department.

     

                               

   <H3>  REVISIONS</H3>            

     It is expected that this agreement will be revised at least annually to

     reflect significant changes in budget, policy, personnel, customer needs

     or other factors that may affect the accomplishment of objectives.  This

     Agreement is intended only to improve the internal management of the

     Executive Branch and is not intended to and does not create any right,

     benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at

     law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its

     officers, or any person. 

     <P>

     This agreement reflects our joint commitment to a Department of

     Veterans Affairs that implements common-sense approaches to fulfilling

     our sacred trust to the Nation s veterans and the American people.

<P>

<TITLE>	General Services Administration Performance Agreement</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<P>
<H2 align=center> Performance Agreement between<BR>

 The President of the United States,

 William Jefferson Clinton and <BR>
The Administrator of the General Services Administration,

 Roger Johnson</H2>



<P> <BR>

<H3> I.  Introduction</H3>

 The American people deserve a government that works better and costs 

 less.  The departments and agencies of the federal government hold 

 vital keys to improving performance and to restoring the faith of the   

 American people in their government. Many changes will need to take   

place for this broad goal to be realized.  The purpose of performance   

 agreements with senior officials is to establish clarity and   

 consensus about the priorities for departmental management.  They are   

 intended to improve the management of the Executive Branch and are   

 not intended to and do not create any legally enforceable rights.    

 From these agreements should flow the program and management   

priorities of the departments.  These agreements represent a   

 beginning, a basis for continuous improvement as we reinvent our   

 government to meet the needs and expectations of the American people.   

 

<H3> II.  The General Services Administration  </H3>


 This Agreement reflects the program priorities developed by the   

 Administrator for the General Services Administration (GSA) as a   

 result of the National Performance Review and GSA's drive to reinvent   

 the way it does business.  It is an agreement to accept the challenge   

 of becoming more efficient and less costly to the American taxpayer.    

 It provides a framework for decisive action in a time that requires   

 more than marginal change.  

   

 The agreement reflects multi-year objectives, as well as specific   

 performance measures to be accomplished in Fiscal Year 1994.  It also   

 describes the specific support the Administration intends to provide   

 to support the accomplishment of these objectives.    

   

 The Administrator undertakes to accomplish the following at the   

 General Services Administration:  

   

   

<H3>REINVENT GSA  </H3>

   

 GSA will become a non-mandatory source of supplies and services and   

 seek to be the provider of choice for customer agencies.  Through   

 increasing competition, GSA will demonstrate innovation and   

 commitment to excellence in order to best serve its customers.  To   

 further its effectiveness and competitive position, GSA will separate   

 government-wide policy and oversight functions from service delivery.    

GSA will maximize the effective use and value of Federal real   

property through the development of a government-wide property asset   

 management function.  GSA will develop procurement plans and   

 practices that significantly reduce the cost of product, the cost of   

 procurement and increase the effective utilization of commercial   

 information products and services.  

<P>   

 In some instances, GSA will delegate authorities to its customer   

 agencies. Concurrent with its delegation of such authority to other   

agencies, GSA will assure that appropriate skills, objectives,   

 measurements and controls are in place that are appropriate for that   

 level of delegation.   

   

  

 <H3>SATISFY CUSTOMERS  </H3>

  

 GSA will be a preferred business partner by customers and the vendor   

 community. GSA will be easier to do business with and empower   

 agencies to accomplish their missions more effectively.  GSA will   

 provide one face to its customers and be a source of one-stop   

 shopping.  GSA will continue to reinvent and seek innovative ways to   

 improve customer service.  



   

 <H3>BECOME AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE </H3> 

  

 GSA will be an employer of choice.  GSA will develop programs to   

 build and maintain a quality workforce that values diversity and   

 offers career development opportunities and retraining as the agency   

 &quot;right sizes.&quot;  GSA will empower line managers and push decision-  

 making to the point of service delivery by flattening the current   

 organizational structures.   

   

  

<H3> BENCHMARK PROGRESS   </H3>

   

 GSA will establish performance standards to measure outcomes (as well   

 as inputs and outputs).  GSA will compare results against other   

 Federal and private sector organizations and previous performance.    

 GSA will reengineer as many of its functions as possible to be the   

 best in its class.  GSA will leverage the costs of doing business   

 government-wide to reduce the costs for customer agencies and to   

    provide substantial savings for the taxpayer.   

      

      

  <H3>  III.  Measurement of Performance  </H3>

      

    To measure progress against the above objectives, the Administrator   

    is committed to the accomplishment of specific measurable results.    

    Those specific measures for Fiscal Year 1994 are described in the   

    Annex.      

      <P>

    To maintain focus and a sense of urgency and to have a real impact on   

    performance, there will be periodic reviews of progress, discussion   

    of difficulties encountered and appropriate actions taken.  Reviews   

    of progress will be held between the President and/or his designees   

    and GSA officials, and, with greater frequency, within the Agency.    

    Any specific reporting requirements will be developed jointly with   

    GSA.  

      

    <H3>IV.  Administration Support </H3> 

      

    In order to assist in the accomplishment of the above described   

    objectives and measures during Fiscal Year 1994, the Administration's   

    objective is to provide GSA with the specific support described below   

    within all applicable laws:   

      <P>

    --Flexibility to manage personnel employment levels while   

    adhering to agency-level constraints imposed by Administration   

    policy.  

      <P>

    --Flexibility to operate more like a business by pilot testing a   

    capital budget that accounts for capital investments, operating   

    expenses and outlays as discrete elements of a unified budget.    

    Budget decisions will reflect sound management to ensure no   

    bias against long term investment in fixed assets.    

 <P>     

    --Flexibility to operate in the context of Executive Branch   

    policy but without unnecessary external program interventions   

    for projects or operations and with strong Administration   

    support to efforts to resist or eliminate Congressional   

    earmarking.   

      

   <H3> V.  Term of Agreement  </H3>

      

    This agreement will remain in effect until modified,  It is expected   

    that it will be updated at least annually to reflect significant   

    changes in budget, policy, personnel or other factors that may effect   

    the accomplishment of objectives.  

     <P> 

    This Agreement is intended only to improve the internal management of   

    the Executive Branch and is not intended to and does not create any   

    right, benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive or procedural,   

    enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States,   

    its agencies, its officers, or any person.  

      <P>
      

    This agreement reflects our joint commitment to a General Services   

    Administration that works better and costs less and fulfills our   

    sacred trust to the American people.  

      <P>

<TITLE>	Housing and Urban Development Performance Agreement</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

 
<H2 align=center> Performance Agreement between<BR>
 
 The President of the United States,
 
 William Jefferson Clinton
 
 and<BR>
 
 The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
 
 Henry G. Cisneros</H2>
 
 

<H3>  I.   Introduction</H3> 

   

  The American people deserve a government that works better and costs  

  less.  The departments and agencies of the federal government hold  

  vital keys to improving performance and to restoring the faith of the  

  American people in their government.  Many changes will need to take  

  place for this broad goal to be realized.  The purpose of performance  

  agreements with senior officials is to establish clarity and  

  consensus about the priorities for departmental management.  They are  

  intended to improve the management of the Executive Branch and are  

  not intended to and do not create any legally enforceable rights.   

  From these agreements should flow the program and management  

  priorities of the departments.  These agreements represent a  

  beginning, a basis for continuous improvement as we reinvent our  

  government to meet the needs and expectations of the American people. 

   

 <H3> II.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development</H3> 

   

 <B> Section One:  Purpose</B> 

   
<BR>
  This agreement reflects the major objectives developed by Secretary  

  Henry G. Cisneros for the Department of Housing and Urban Development  

  (HUD) to achieve over the next three fiscal years as well as specific  

  performance measures to be accomplished in Fiscal Year 1994.  It also  

  describes areas of specific support the Administration intends to  

  provide to support the accomplishment of these objectives. 
<P>
   

 <B> Section Two:  Relationship Between Community Empowerment  

 	       Principles and Departmental Mission</B> 
<BR>
   

  For several months, a sub-cabinet community empowerment working group  

  has been refining the core principles through which the community  

  work of key domestic Cabinet departments might be unified and  

  coordinated.  This effort, chaired by the Vice President, articulated  

  the following Community Empowerment Principles: 

   <BR>
<UL>
 <LI>A Commitment to Community. 

   

  <LI>A Commitment to Support Families. 

   

<LI>A Commitment to Economic Lift. 

   

 <LI>A Commitment to Reciprocity and to Balancing Individual  

    Rights with Responsibilities. 

   

 <LI>A Commitment to Reduce Separations by Race and Income in  

    American Life. 

   
</UL>
  To implement these Principles, employees of HUD have adopted the  

  following statement as their Mission: 

   <P>

    <DD>  <I> &quot;To help people create communities of opportunity&quot; </I>

   
<P>
   

<B>  Section Three:  Declaration of Objectives by the Secretary</B> 

   
<BR>
  To accomplish this Mission as guided by these Principles, the  

  Secretary undertakes to accomplish the following at the Department of  

  Housing and Urban Development: 

   

 <UL>  

<LI> <B>Assist Homeless Persons and Families</B> 

   <BR>

  Prevent homelessness, reduce the length of stay in emergency shelters  

  and help more homeless persons and families progress to permanent  

  housing through local HUD-assisted comprehensive homeless systems. 

   

   

<LI> <B>Reduce the Number of Distressed Public Housing Units</B> 

   <BR>

  Reduce the number of severely distressed public housing units through  

  project management reforms, combined with redevelopment and/or  

  replacement of units with low-density, small-scale, carefully  

  designed developments and housing choices throughout communities.   

  The above will be complemented by an effort to increase the  

  availability of housing vouchers and certificates, thereby broadening  

  the replacement housing and locational choices of resident families. 

   

   

<LI><B>Develop Affordable Housing and Make Homeownership  

  A Reality for More Americans</B> 

   <BR>

  Reform the Federal Housing Administration so that it once again  

  becomes a positive force for developing affordable housing;  

  reestablish Federal Housing Administration's role as a principal  

  means by which HUD significantly increases homeownership  

  opportunities for families; and expand state/local and public/private  

  partnerships to further homeownership and affordable housing  

  opportunities. 

   

   

<LI> <B>Reduce Racial Barriers</B> 

   <BR>

  Substantially reduce racial barriers to residential mobility and  

  enhance the ability of minorities to choose where they live, through  

  a combination of vigorous enforcement of federal fair housing laws  

  and creative metropolitan-wide housing and community development  

  strategies.  The goal is to reduce the spatial separation by race and  

  income that characterizes American urban areas. 

   

   

<LI>  <B>Empower Communities</B> 

   <BR>

  Empower communities and promote community economic development by  

  implementing the Administration's Empowerment Zones program, and work  

  in partnership with state and local governments, community-based  

  organizations, and the private sector to further the goals of  

  economic development, create jobs, stimulate the economy, and  

  appreciably improve the quality of urban life. 

   

   

<LI><B> Create An Environment That Supports Teamwork  

  And Organizational Excellence</B> 

   <BR>

  Eliminate management deficiencies by developing a performance  

  oriented planning process that anchors resources management and a  

  systems integration strategy.  The goal is to eradicate significant  

  numbers of duplicative, inefficient and wasteful management  

  practices, and to increase the satisfaction of HUD's customers, as  

  measured by customer surveys.  

   
</ul>
   

 <B> Section Four:  Subsequent Agreements by the Secretary and Assistant  

 		Secretaries</B> 

   
<BR>
  To ensure the comprehensive implementation of the above objectives  

  throughout the Department, the Secretary will enter into intra- 

  departmental agreements with each Assistant Secretary or the  

  equivalent in the Department.  These agreements will reflect the  

  detailed Program and Management Priorities which the Secretary has  

  formulated with the Assistant Secretaries.  These priorities will be  

  updated at least annually.  The Assistant Secretaries will, in turn,  

  complete agreements with their key staff members to assure broad  

  understanding of this performance agreement and commitment to its  

  objectives. 

   

   

 <H3> III.  Measurement and Monitoring of Performance</H3> 

   

  To measure progress against the above objectives, the Secretary is  

  committed to accomplishing specific measurable results.  Specific  

  measures for Fiscal Year 1994 are described in Annex A. 

   <P>

  To maintain focus and a sense of urgency and to have a real impact on  

  performance, there will be periodic reviews of progress, discussion  

  of difficulties encountered and agreement on appropriate actions.   

  These will be between the President and/or his designees and  

  Departmental officials and, with greater frequency, within the  

  Department.  Any specific reporting requirements will be developed  

  jointly with the Department. 

   

   

<H3>  IV.  Administration Support</H3> 

   

  In order to accomplish the above described objectives and measures  

  during Fiscal Year 1994, the Administration's objective is to provide  

  the Department of Housing and Urban Development with the specific  

  support described below. 

   
<UL>
  <LI>On January 17, 1994, the President signed Executive Order  

  Number 12892 establishing the President's Fair Housing Council  

  and directing that all departments and agencies work together  

  to reinvent the manner in which their housing and community  

  development programs affirmatively further fair housing. 

   

 <LI>Expedited review by the Office of Management and Budget of all  

  actions pertaining to the accomplishment of the objectives  

  contained in this performance agreement. 

   

  <LI>Flexibility in regard to position classification and pay from  

  the Office of Personnel Management. 

   </UL>

<H3>  V. Miscellaneo</H3>us 

   

  This Agreement is intended only to improve the internal management of  

  the Executive Branch and is not intended to and does not create any  

  right, benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive or procedural,  

  enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States,  

  its agencies, its officers, or any person. 

   

<H3>  VI. Revisions</H3> 

   

  It is expected that this agreement will be revised at least annually  

  to reflect significant changes in budget, policy, personnel, customer  

  needs or other factors that may affect the accomplishment of  

  objectives. 

   
<P>
   

  This agreement represents our joint commitment to a Department of  

  Housing and Urban Development that works better and costs less and  

  fulfills our sacred trust to the American people.

<H2>  Annex:  Performance Measures, Fiscal Year 1994</H2> 

   

  During Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, performance will be measured by the  

  successful accomplishment of the following specific measures: 

   
<OL>
  <LI> <B> Assist Homeless Persons and Families</B> 

   <P>

  Output Measures: 

   <P>

  --For the first time, 100 percent of all FY 1994 Supportive  

  Housing projects will incorporate a comprehensive approach to  

  homelessness providing all necessary services through a single  

  program and service delivery mechanism.   

   <P>

  --The Department will develop partnerships with innovative cities  

  that significantly increase the number of persons served within  

  each city by a continuum-of-care approach.  Intended to foster  

  independent living, the continuum-of-care approach will include  

  1) outreach and assessment, 2) transitional housing combined  

  with permanent housing, and 3) supportive services to  

  individuals and families who may  require them.  The first  

  continuum-of-care partnership will be implemented in the  

  District of Columbia through the D.C./HUD Homeless Initiative  

  by June 1, 1994, and pledges to increase by 2,050 persons the  

  number receiving comprehensive transitional or permanent  

  housing.  By September 30, 1994, at least three other  

  demonstration sites incorporating the continuum-of-care  

  approach will have been selected and have become operational.  

    
<P>
  --HUD will initiate the plan and development for use of a  

  military base to provide a comprehensive housing and community  

  development program including transitional and permanent  

  housing for homeless individuals. 

   
<P>
  --HUD will increase the number of projects awarded annually that  

  do not separate families at entry but, instead, provide family  

  support and counselling as needed. 

   <P>

  Outcome Measures: 

   <P>

  --In FY 1994, HUD will increase by 20 percent the number of  

  projects awarded that link to permanent housing homeless  

  persons living on the streets and being served in shelters and

  Output Measures: 

   <P>

  --By the end of FY 1994, HUD will fund 35 projects (8 planning  

  and 27 implementation) as part of the Urban Revitalization  

  Demonstration to redevelop and replace severely distressed  

  public housing projects. 

   <P>

  --HUD will complete site visits and execute grant agreements with  

  these 35 developments and the public housing authority or non-

  --During FY 1994, HUD will begin to measure the performance of  

  implementation grantees that have executed contracts for  

  specific tasks, (i.e. the number that have begun design work,  

  commenced relocation, or finalized demolition decisions.  By  

  the end of FY 1994, $100 million of funds appropriated for the  

  Urban Revitalization Demonstration will be under contract.  For  

  two-thirds of the implementation grantees HUD funded in FY  

  1993, support services and management improvement activities  

  integral to the revitalization process will be under  

  development; demolition permits from HUD will have been  

  received and the temporary relocation of residents begun; and,  

  rehabilitation activities will be underway.  HUD will also  

  establish performance goals for the remaining 14 implementation  

  grantees.

  (including vacancies and rent collections); and measures of  

  physical deterioration. Other indicators may include measures  

  of community/neighborhood satisfaction. 

   <P>

  --To accelerate the public housing modernization pipeline by the  

  end of FY 1994, HUD will implement a new system to distribute  

  modernization funds within 60 days of appropriations to replace  

  the current system which takes as long as 18 months; and  

  implement a new data reporting system enabling the timely  

  tracking of pipeline obligations among public housing  

  authorities with the greatest backlogs.  

   <P>

  Outcome Measures: 

   <P>

  indicators in the following areas: vacancy rates and rent  

  collections; and physical and structural conditions.  

   <P>

  --By September 30, 1994, HUD will develop and publish explicit  

  outcome measures of the improved quality of life of those  

  individuals and  families that have come from distressed public  

  housing and  have been dispersed to lower-density developments  

  or who have used voucher or certificate assistance to move from  

  public housing.

   <P>

  Output Measures: 

   <P>

  --Through enhanced program efficiencies and without relaxing  

  underwriting standards, HUD will respond to existing market  

  demands for its single family products by insuring 10 percent  

  more single family loans in FY 1994 than in the previous year  

  (from a total of 936,897 to 1,030,400 loans.)  This assumes no  

  drastic increase in interest rates or unexpected changes in  

  economic conditions.  

   <P>

  --HUD will carry out all of its designated regulatory actions  

  with respect to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including issuing

  local housing finance agencies for the financing of 30,000  

  units of affordable multifamily housing by the end of FY 1995. 

   <P>

  --HUD will expand its single-family disposition sales incentive  

  program from 2 to 21 field offices by March 1994 resulting in

  affordable homeownership. 

   <P>

  --Through the creation of seven technical and outreach working  

  groups that include representatives of developers, lenders,  

  advocates and local government, HUD will reduce regulations,

  request. 

   <P>

  --Contingent on acquisitions, interest rates and the economy, HUD  

  will sell from its inventory over 68,000 single-family  

  properties resulting in a substantial increase in the  

  availability of decent safe housing for homeownership and  

  improved quality of life in communities.   

   <P>

  <LI>  <B>Reduce Racial Barriers</B> 

   <P>

  Output Measures: 

   <P>

  --By the end of FY 1994, HUD will define lending discrimination  

  prohibited by the Fair Housing Act, by promulgating regulations  

  following public hearings.  By the end of FY 1994, take the  

  steps necessary to establish by the end of FY 1995 a definition  

  of property insurance discrimination prohibited by the FHA,  

  which will be promulgated by regulations following public  

  hearings. 

   
<P>

  Program, HUD will design and select a contractor for a national  

  mortgage lending testing project in areas of the country with  

  high mortgage rejection rates for Blacks and Latinos.  

   
<P>
  --Utilizing the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, HUD will fund  

  the creation of new full-service fair housing enforcement

  unserved or underserved and/or where no state or local  

  substantially equivalent law is in effect and no HUD office is  

  present. 

   <P>

  Outcome Measures: 

   <P>

  --By the end of FY 1995, contingent upon enactment of the

  institutions will have increased by 5 percent over FY 1993 the  

  number of loans they make to minority borrowers and the number  

  of loans they make to persons below 80 percent of median  

  income. 

   <P>

  --By the end of FY 1994, HUD will initiate a partnership with the

  capability to perform a broad range of investigative activities  

  including complaint intake counselling and testing; conduct  

  complaint resolution; make complaint referrals to appropriate  

  federal, state or local fair housing enforcement agencies, or  

  to private attorneys; and perform fair housing education and  

  outreach to the communities they serve. 

   

   <P>

 <LI> <B> Empower Communities</B> 

   <P>

  Output Measures: 

   <P>

  --Beginning in FY 1994, HUD will implement an intensive Section 3  

  technical assistance effort to expand economic opportunities  

  for low-income residents in 30 communities receiving housing  

  and community development assistance.  Section 3 of the Housing  

  and Urban Development Act of 1968 requires that training, jobs  

  and contract opportunities generated by HUD assistance for  

  housing and community development be directed to the greatest  

  possible extent to project area residents.  This technical  

  assistance effort will be provided to state and local  

  governments, public and Indian housing agencies, private  

  developers and their contractors, and will be taken in  

  partnership with the Department of Labor and other federal  

  departments.

  In the plans, communities will set forth concrete and  

  actionable objectives with regard to human, economic and  

  physical development.  HUD will work with the communities to  

  ensure that they reach the goals set forth in their strategic  

  plans.

  --HUD will continue to work with communities throughout the  

  United States to put in place a new planning, application and  

  reporting system for four Community Planning and Development  

  (CPD) formula grant programs.  This process will contain a  

  strong community involvement provision, with the goal of  

  empowering residents and community organizations to play a  

  decision-making role in formulating plans and priorities to  

  improve their communities using CPD formula programs.   

   <P>

  Outcome Measures: 

   <P>

  corporations that carry out the following activities:  enhance  

  the ability of community-based organizations to undertake  

  housing and community development activities and promote  

  employment of low-income individuals. 

   <P>

  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies for economic  

  development, HUD is working to increase the facility with which  

  cities can generate new jobs in urban centers and to help  

  cities to retain the existing employment base.  By the end of  

  FY 1995, contingent on the enactment of the President's FY 1995  

  budget, the use of CDBG and other community development  

  programs for job creation and job retention will increase by 50  

  percent from FY 1993 levels.

  occurred by their target deadline of October 31,1993. 

   <P>

  --The improvements to HUD's regulatory process announced by the  

  Deputy Secretary on October 7, 1993 -- most notably the use of  

  a &quot;Top 25&quot; list of priority rules and program office assumption  

  of drafting responsibility of lower priority rules -- will  

  increase the number of regulations and Notices of Funds  

  Availability (NOFAs) published by about ten percent, from

  process and integrate that process into an overall management  

  plan for the Department.      

   <P>

  Outcome Measures:

<H2 align=center>Performance Agreement

 between<BR>
   
 The President of the United States,
   
 William Jefferson Clinton
   
 and <BR>
   
 The Administrator of the Small Business
   
Administration,
   
 Erskine B. Bowles</H2>
   
       

   
   
       

   
   
       

   <H3> &quot;TODAY'S SBA MEANS BUSINESS&quot;   </H3>

       

  <H3>  I. Introduction </H3>  

       

    The American people deserve a government that works better and    

    costs less.  The departments and agencies of the federal government    

    hold vital keys to improving performance and to restoring the faith    

    of the American people in their government.  Many changes will need    

    to take place for this broad goal to be realized.  The purpose of    

    performance agreements is to establish clarity and consensus about    

    the priorities for departmental and agency management.  They are    

    intended to improve the management of the Executive Branch and are    

    not intended to and do not create any legally enforceable rights.    

    From these agreements should flow the program and management    

    priorities of the departments and agencies.  These agreements    

    represent a beginning, a basis for continuous improvement as we    

    reinvent our government to meet the needs and expectations of the    

    American people.   

       

   <H3> II. The Small Business Administration   </H3>

       

    Providing quality customer service to the small business    

    community is a proper mandate for the U.S. Small Business    

    Administration.  Aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting small    
 businesses is the SBA mission and my primary objective.  Reflecting    

    my business background, I am a results-oriented manager who wants to    

    be held accountable.  We at the SBA offer this agreement as a    

    framework for measuring our success.     

       <P>

    At the core of our culture is business; the classic examples of    

    American ingenuity are often products of small businesses.  The small    

    business sector employs almost 60 percent of the private work force,    

    contributes 54 percent of all sales in the country, and is    

    responsible for 50 percent of private sector products.  Virtually all    

    of the nation's new jobs between 1988 and 1990 were contributed by    

    small businesses.  In 1993, 26 of the 100 fastest growing U.S. firms    

    were small businesses, ten of which received SBA-backed venture    

    capital.  Small business is critical to our economic recovery, to    

    building America's future, and to helping the United States compete    

    in today's global marketplace.  We are committed to making the SBA    

    the champion of small business, nurturing the pioneering spirit which    

    is so central to our tradition, so critical to our dream.  Our vision    

    for the SBA revolves around two words: OUTREACH and MANAGEMENT.    

       <P>

   <B> OUTREACH:</B>  We are determined to reach out to small businesses    

    in an unprecedented way to listen to their needs, reporting these    

    needs back to the President and suggesting policy initiatives.  We    

    will work to see that small business has a place at the economic    

    table and we will continue to function as the President's &quot;eyes and    

    ears&quot; regarding small business interests.  As part of our promise to    

    improve the SBA's outreach, we will work to free up capital and will    

    increase the small business community's access to credit. We will    

    specifically expand our management, technical and financial    

    assistance to those small businesses most in need of our support,    

    including minority and women-owned enterprises, rural and inner city    

    businesses and high technology and export-oriented firms.   

         <P>

    <B>MANAGEMENT: </B> For the foreseeable future, the SBA will have to    

    meet escalating demands with fewer resources.  To do so, we intend to    

    be more efficient and effective, while emphasizing quality in our    

    service delivery.  We recognize the need to change our organizational    

    culture and the way we do business.  Our management goal will be to    

    create a more entrepreneurial, customer-driven and efficient SBA.  We    

    will focus our scarce resources on those small businesses that have    

    the greatest potential for job creation and maintenance, streamline    
 our structure and processes, eliminate duplication, fraud and waste,    

    and reinstill a sense of quality customer-service.  We will work hard    

    to restore a sense of pride among our people and to build in our    

    organization a &quot;can do&quot; attitude based on mutual respect that puts    

    people first, serves our customers and empowers our employees.   

       

 <H3>   III. Policy Goals and Performance Measures</H3>   

       

    We are committed to the President's four policy goals for the    

    SBA and wish to be held accountable for implementing them.

       <P>

    To measure our success, determine if  we have initiated:

    This agreement outlines four policy goals and supporting    

    strategic objectives that we as an Agency are pledged to accomplish    

    during my tenure as the SBA Administrator and provides specific    

    performance measures for FY 1994 (Annex).  This agreement will serve    

    as the framework for the SBA's participation as a performance pilot    

    agency under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the    

    platform for our strategic and performance planning, and the basis    

    for measuring results and discussing progress with the President.     

    Any specific reporting requirements will be developed jointly with    

    the Agency.   

     <P>

    This agreement is intended only to improve the internal    

    management of the Executive Branch and is not intended to and does    

    not create any right, benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive    

    or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the    

    United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.   

       <P>

    In sum, this agreement reflects our joint commitment to a Small    

    Business Administration that works better, costs less, and honors our    
 sacred trust to the American people.  Unless and until modified, it    

    will guide our efforts at the Small Business Administration.

    <H3>STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND PROGRAM AND MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES</H3>   

       

    To accomplish the mission entrusted to the Small Business    

    Administration by the President, we have established ten strategic    

    objectives, which support the four principal policy goals discussed    

    above in this performance agreement.  Accomplishing each objective    

    will fulfill our broad mandate to:   
    
<P>
   --Expand and improve our outreach to the small business    

    community, and   

   <BR>

    --Improve the overall management of the Small Business    

    Administration by becoming more customer-driven in the    

    effective and efficient delivery of program services.   

       
<P>
    1. OUTREACH OBJECTIVE:  FREE UP CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT IN SMALL    

       BUSINESSES, WORK TO END THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND CREATE JOBS    

       <UL>

  <LI>  A. Expand the 7(a) General Business Loan Program by:    

      <OL>

    <LI> Increasing credit availability from &#036;6.4 billion in    

    FY 1993 to &#036;7.0 billion in 1994 and, contingent    

    upon passage of the President's budget, &#036;9.0    

    billion in FY 1995.     

       

    <LI> Improving and expanding the loan servicing    

    capability at our Fresno, California Center, to    

    include additional regions; and    

       

   <LI>Creating a new loan processing center in the    

    Southwest to provide better customer service.   

       </OL>
<P>

 <LI> Contingent upon passage of the President's FY 1995    

    budget, create a new loan program for veterans by October    

    1, 1994, which leverages funds allocated for Vietnam-era    

    and disabled veterans; and provide a Veteran Loan    

    Guaranty Program of &#036;800 million (up from &#036;15 million)    

    for all military veterans.   

       

    <LI> Utilize the Microloan program and the Women's    

    Demonstration Project to increase lending and counselling    

    to currently under-served populations.  The SBA would    

    function as a resource partner with the Departments of    

    Labor and Health and Human Services in the    

    Administration's effort to transform the welfare system    

    into a transitional support program that promotes work    

    and responsibility.   

       

 <LI> Focus limited capital resources more wisely on those    

    small businesses that need it the most (e.g. minority and    

    women-owned, rural and inner city companies, veteran-   

    owned firms) and those that have the greatest potential    

    to create and maintain jobs and make the United States    

    more competitive in the global market place.     

      <OL>

    <LI> Work with district directors to develop a more    

    focused approach to lending.     

       

    <LI> Develop a pilot project in Chicago to focus more    

    loans on qualified women-owned businesses.  By    

    March 1994, complete a pre-qualification    

    application process to improve our outreach to    

    women-owned businesses and by June 1994, expand the    

    program to five additional cities (Columbus, OH;    

    Albuquerque, NM; Helena, MT; New Orleans, LA; and    

    Charlotte, NC).   

       

   <LI> Increase capital availability to those industries    

    that are growing and creating jobs.  Contingent    

    upon passage of implementing regulations, create as    

    many as 50 additional Small Business Investment    

    Companies in FY 1994 and an additional 100 to 150    

    over the next two to three years, and focus general    

    business lending on those sectors that are creating    

    and maintaining jobs.   

    </OL>   

  <LI> Completely revise the working capital loan program with    

    input from the private sector, recognizing that many    

    companies need more than term loans to be successful.     

    Line SBA personnel will be educated in new financial    

    assistance tools and two pilot efforts will be merged    

    into a national program by March 15, 1994.   

       

   <LI> Contingent upon passage of implementing regulations,    

    create a new Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)    

    security to provide incentives to SBICs to make long-term    

    equity investments and leverage more private capital in    

    order to meet the goals of growth, expansion and    

    modernization of small businesses.  The new instrument, a    

    participating security, will give the government a share    

    of the profits from successful investments financed with    

    federal funds and should be implemented by October 1994.   

       

   <LI> Significantly reduce documentation requirements related    

    to lending.  Reduce the SBA's application form to a    

    minimum, analyzing by February 1994 the success of the    

    pilot project in Region 6 (Texas), which reduces the form    

    to a one-page document.  Initiate a Loan Express pilot    

    with several lenders by May 1994, authorizing them to use    

    their own forms.  Establish an electronic loan approval    

    pilot process with selected lenders and institute a    

    revised application package that eliminates unnecessary    

    paperwork by June 1994, to include encouraging character    

    loans and pooling loans of a similar type and size.   

  </ul>     <P>

    2. OUTREACH OBJECTIVE:  MINORITY ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT --EXPAND    

       OPPORTUNITIES IN POORER RURAL COMMUNITIES AND INNER CITIES   

       
<UL>
  <LI> Identify up to 12 Empowerment Zone (EZ) One-Stop-Capital-   

    Shops (OSCSs) in 12 different locations to provide &#036;3    

    billion in capital for small and minority businesses in    

    these economically-distressed locations.  During January-   

    March 1994, present technical seminars on the OSCSs in    

    eight or more locations and coordinate with the    

    Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National    

    Economic Council and other interested parties to    

    implement the Empowerment Zone initiative.   

       

   <LI> Improve the existing Minority Enterprise Development    

    program.  Streamline support by:  processing applications    

    more efficiently; eliminating all past due Controlled    

    Correspondence; reducing reporting; using automation more    

    effectively; delegating contract award functions to    

    federal agencies; and establishing small disadvantaged    

    set-aside programs in civilian agencies similar to the    

    program established for the Department of Defense.   

       

    <LI> Redesign and expand the Minority Enterprise Development    

    program to be a comprehensive business development    

    assistance effort that utilizes all Agency programs to    

    provide technical and financial assistance to minority-   

    owned firms, enabling them to compete in the mainstream    

    of the economy.   

       
</ul>
       <P>

    3. OUTREACH OBJECTIVE:  EXPAND EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL    

       BUSINESSES   

     <UL>  

   <LI> Expand our trade assistance by establishing four Export    

    Assistance Centers in 1994 and 10 additional centers in    

    1995 in partnership with the Department of Commerce and    

    the Export-Import Bank.  These centers will provide &quot;one-   

    stop-shopping&quot; assistance for businesses interested in    

    international trade opportunities.     

       

  <LI> Revise our Export Revolving Line of Credit and coordinate    

    with the Export-Import Bank the harmonizing of programs    

    of the two agencies by September 30, 1994, thereby reducing the   

    paperwork and confusion to the public over the two programs.

	<B>THE WHITE HOUSE</B>
<P>
	WASHINGTON
<P>
	December 8, 1994
<P>

</CENTER>
To the Members of Federal Executive Boards and Federal Executive Associations:
<P>
	More that thirty years ago, President John F. Kennedy established Federal Executive Boards to strengthen the coordination of management activities outside Washington.  I know that many of you have spent your careers improving service to the American people through the mission of your agency, and you have many opportunities to use your collective experience to reinvent our government.
<P>
	The federal employees who developed the recommendations of the National Performance Review told us that we can create a government that better serves the American people by:
<UL>
	<LI>	putting customers first;
	<LI>	cutting red tape; and 
	<LI>	empowering employees to get results.
</UL>
	To achieve these goals, Federal Executive Boards and Federal Executive Associations must assume a strong leadership role.  In particular, I would ask you to work with the federal agencies in your community to ensure that Customer Service Executive Order, No. 12862, is implemented.  Specifically, I hope you will follow the lead of the Federal Executive Boards who are improving service delivery by:
<UL>
	<LI>	creating interagency forums to ask customers and partners 
		in service delivery what services they want and whether 
		they are satisfied with the services they receive;

	<LI>	forming teams of agencies that serve or regulate the same
		customers to share systems and resources;

	<LI>	cutting red tape by coordinating service delivery and
		reporting requirements; and

	<LI>	demonstrating to citizens that federal agencies can
		provide service "equal to the best in business."
</UL>
	Together we can create a government that works better and costs less -- a government designed to restore the faith of people in government one American at a time.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<P>

Bill Clinton

These facilities all involve cooperative partnerships between federal, state,

customers (often the public or small businesses) to obtain service at a central
 location. Some of these facilities are geared primarily to small business or are 
financed by grants, and others are financed and staffed by the participating 
agencies.  Federal Executive Boards and Associates in cities across the country 
coordinate these efforts.  There are some other Small Business Administration (SBA)

Federal Executive Boards</H1>

<H2>Mission of Federal Executive Boards </H2>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>   <I>  "Although each executive agency and its field organization have a special<BR>
 mission, there are many matters on which the work of the departments converge.<BR> Among them are management and
budgetary procedures, personnel policies,<BR> recruitment efforts, office information duties, and
similar matters. There are<BR> opportunities to pool experience and resources, and to accomplish

approach in many activities."</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
With those words, President John F. Kennedy introduced Federal Executive Boards in 1961.
Today, a quarter of a century later, 28 FEBs exist to provide closer coordination among Federal
agencies outside Washington, DC. As regional hubs for all government activity, their work
relates to five mission themes:<P>
<UL>

<LI><B> Communicate</B> - FEBs inform member agencies of each other's initiatives and
successes, and the local community of national policies and priorities.

<LI> <B>Reduce Costs and Improve Efficiency</B> - FEBs bring together agencies with
common goals so that their efforts are complementary.

<LI> <B>Facilitate Service Delivery </B>- FEBs draw together agencies with common
clients so that government services are convenient for the customers. 

<LI><B> Partner with Community Groups</B> - FEBs partner with community groups
to solve problems.

<LI> <B>Coordinate Emergency Services </B>- FEBs stand ready to marshal 
            resources of the entire federal community, whether to aid a member agency in a crisis, or  
             to assist the citizenry in a public emergency.  
</UL>
Examples of the ways in which Federal Executive Boards focus on these themes are found in the
composite of FY 95 activities that follows.

<H1>1995 Composite Annual Report</H1>

<H2>Theme 1: Communicate</H2>

FEBs inform agencies of member initiatives, celebrate successes and inform the local community
of national priorities and policies. The 28 FEBs offer an effective two-way communication
network for reaching federal employees throughout the country.<P>

<H3>Locate and Recognize Service Delivery and Cost Savings Success Stories:</H3>
FEBs located over 100 reinventing government success stories that were recognized with
the Vice President's Hammer Award program. Many of these stories were included in this year's
<U>National Performance Review Report: Common Sense Government.</U><P>

All FEBs have undertaken reinvention education initiatives "to make government work
better and cost less". <I>St. Louis</I>, for example, provided briefings on Process Reengineering,
Horizontal Management, Customer Service, Self-Directed Team Recognition, Privatization,
Creating Partnerships with Industry, Communicating with Stakeholders, and the New Role of the
Federal Executive.<P>

<H3>Develop Communication Networks:</H3>
<B>Electronic</B>--Many FEBs including <I>Buffalo, Cincinnati, Denver, Kansas City, Oklahoma   City </I>and the <I>Twin Cities</I> use a combination of E-mail and FAX. <I>Houston</I> uses their
FAX/E-mail network daily to inform agency heads, congressional staffs, city officials and news
outlets of FEB activities, news items and emergency information. It is received by 150
individuals who, in turn, cascade it to thousands. <P>

<I> Philadelphia</I> manages FEBNET, the OPM Bulletin Board for FEBs. Several FEBs are
developing Internet capability; <I>Boston, Oklahoma City </I>and <I>Twin Cities</I> have Homepages, <I>San
Antonio</I> is working on a Homepage that will include federal job information and <I>Pittsburgh</I> is
developing an FEB/CASU Bulletin Board. Many of the FEBs take advantage of member
downlink sites to coordinate OPM and NPR satellite broadcasts for member agencies.<P>

<B> Newsletters</B>-- Many FEBs prepare and distribute newsletters; <I>Seattle</I> includes state,  county and city employees. And San Antonio distributes theirs to other FEBs and the  local Chambers of Commerce. <P>

<B>Brochures and Prepare Orientation Videos</B>-<I>-Baltimore, Denver and Kansas City</I> have     created FEB brochures. Cleveland produced an Orientation Video on the role of the
federal agencies in the city.<P>
 
<H3>Communicate with Congressional Staffs on the Local Federal Role:</H3>
<I>Houston </I>sponsors a yearly congressional liaison breakfast meeting with more than 130
participants. <I>Detroit </I>held a get-acquainted meeting for the Michigan congressional delegation
and staff that focused on building a stronger working relationship between federal agencies and
local congressional offices. <I>Kansas City</I> briefed congressional staffs on administration and
agency initiatives. <I>Cleveland </I>published a Congressional Directory. <P>

<I>Chicago</I> represented all FEBs at a congressional hearing; <I>Houston </I>provided speakers for
a hearing on one-stop service delivery.<P>
     
<H3>Communicate with the Media for the Federal Community:</H3>
    <B> TV</B>- <I>Kansas City</I> produces a monthly television program "Common Knowledge" to show
how federal agencies are using tax dollars effectively. American Cablevision donates time for the
program and trains employees. <P>

     <B>Radio</B>- <I>Philadelphia</I> produces a weekly "Inside Government" public affairs radio show
that features federal government initiatives and programs that positively affect the lives of
Philadelphia area residents. The shows reach approximately 44,000 listeners each week.<P>

     <B>Newspaper </B>- <I>San Antonio</I> conducts a yearly editorial board with the local newspaper staff. <P>

     <B>Media Guides</B>- <I>Kansas City</I> and <I>Cincinnati </I>prepare a public affairs directory. This
directory makes it easier for the press to know who to call in each agency. <P>

     <B>Training</B>- <I>Cleveland </I>used a former news anchor to conduct a one-hour training session for
members on how to interact with the press. <P>

    <B> Furloughs and emergency dismissals</B>- During furloughs and emergency dismissals   many FEBs communicate with the media for federal agencies; this year the Executive Director in Portand conducted 12 television interviews. <I>(Honolulu, San Antonio, Buffalo, Newark, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, Twin Cities, Portland and Pittsburgh). </I><P>


<H3>Hold Awards Programs:</H3> 
     All FEBs held Public Employee Recognition Week and Hammer Award programs;
attendance averaged 300-500. Many used innovative methods to spark interest such as a
Celebrity Master of Ceremonies (<I>Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, San Antonio, Buffalo,
Philadelphia and Cleveland</I>), or a panel of experts from media, corporations, congressional staffs,
charitable organizations or local government to choose winners (<I>Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Atlanta,
Oklahoma City</I>).  Most FEBs obtain press for awards ceremonies; <I>Newark</I> obtained TV
interviews for their six Public Employee Recognition Week award winners. <P>

<H2>Theme 2: Reduce Costs & Improve Efficiency</H2>

FEBs have a variety of initiatives in place to reduce costs for member agencies:<P>

<H3>Offer No Cost/Low Cost Training to Meet Common Needs:</H3>
     Several FEBs have very active Common Needs T raining and Conference Programs.    They estimate the no-cost/lowcost training  they offer saves agencies tuition cost that    amount to approximately &#036;30   0,000 to &#036;500,000 per year (<I>San Antonio, Denver,     Houston, Buffalo</I>) and keeps agencies up-to-date on current issues. Some of the most popular courses offered by FEBs last year include: A High Tech Government and the Changing Role of the Manager, The Internet, Quality, Customer Service, Labor/Management Partnerships, Secretarial Training, Personnel Management,
Team      Building, Facilitator Training, and How to Conduct Meetings.<P>

     <B>Innovative Cost Savings</B>--<I>Twin Cities</I> pooled agency downlink sites to offer over 60   courses for more than 1,100 employees. 
     <I>Los Angeles</I> established an Memorandum of Understanding with the Long Beach VA   Regional Medical Education Center to develop executive training and core curriculum  courses for FEB members. 
     <I>St. Louis</I> established a free hotline so agencies can use empty training slots.       <I>Pittsburgh </I>focused on "no-cost" training by using federal course instructors.        <I>Portland </I>partnered with state and city governments through the Oregon Option to offer
training courses to federal employees. 
     <I>Honolulu </I>and <I>Philadelphia </I>partnered with other organizations to hold quality conferences. 
     And Cleveland developed a training directory for member agencies.<P>

<H3>Offer Leadership Training and Retreats for Field Executives:</H3>
    <B> Leadership Programs</B>--To develop the skills of mid-career managers,<I> Seattle, San      Francisco and San Antonio</I> offer Leadership Development Programs for mid-career  employees. These FEBs report leadership program participants work on a variety of inter-agency
projects, such as, improving communications with state and local governments and developing
emergency preparedness plans. Each year <I>San Antonio</I> has 35 participants who learn about their
community, state and local government during the 9 months of the program. Graduates serve on
the board of directors of community agencies like the United Way. In addition, <I>Portland</I>
sponsored 11 employees in Public Administration training usually attended by state and local
employees.<P>
     
     <B>Executive Training Retreats</B>--Many FEBs held leadership or executive retreats; <I>St.    Louis and Kansas City, Los Angeles and San Francisco</I> held joint retreats. <P>

<H3>Organize Special Initiatives to Reduce Costs and Maximize Savings:</H3>
     <B>Combined Administrative Support Units and Memorandums of Understanding</B>--   <I>San
Antonio</I> worked to encourage participation in the CASU and estimates cost        avoidance this year at &#036;500,000. <I>Twin Cities</I> estimates their CASU saved &#036;450,000;    and
<I>Pittsburgh </I>puts savings at &#036;1million. <I>Dallas </I>has just opened a CASU and expects      significant
savings. <I>Houston </I>provided opportunities for agencies to share costs in          printing
material and job sharing. <I>Oklahoma City</I> coordinated an interagency partnership  to duplicating
facilities, space, equipment and combining purchasing power.<P>
      
<B>Procurement Reform Education</B>--<I>Denver</I> formed an Acquisition Council to inform    agencies of the new procurement streamlining laws and to conduct training on the     laws.     Training included IMPACT Card, Contractor Past Performance Evaluation      Requirements, Improving Government-Industry Communications, and Federal
Aviation  Administration initiatives. <P>

<B>Alternative  Dispute Resolution Programs</B>--FEBs with active    programs are reporting     impressive savings. In Seattle, The Mediation Consortium i nc ludes 25 federal agencies     (including DOD), the City of Seattle, King Count  y and  the Port of Seattle. Last year the consortium handled 46 mediations, resolving 87% of them. They estimate cost savings from a minimum of &#036;5,000 to a maximum of &#036;100,000 per case depending on the level at which the case is resolved. The <I>Seattle </I>FEB has shared the model with five other FEBs and coordinates a quarterly conference call with these sites. <I>St. Louis</I> trained 45 mediators at minimal cost, and estimates first year savings of &#036;150,000. Their mediators have resolved 22 cases for 6 agencies with an 89% success rate. Several FEBs, including <I>Dallas, Pittsburgh</I> and <I>Honolulu</I> have just completed training. 

<H3>Provide Low Cost Career Transition Assistance:</H3>
 The President's Executive Order on Career Transition asked FEBs to play an important      role in this initiative. Some FEBs have begun to take a very proactive role: 
     <I>Portland </I>arranged for conversion of a job placement center to a career transition center
and conducted orientation sessions for agency staff when it opened in January 1996. They
profiled employment, career/financial counseling and self-employment services.  <I>Oklahoma
City</I> is also coordinating a one stop job search center which houses the Oklahoma State
Employment Commission, Oklahoma County Joint Partnership and Training Act, and OPM job
search touch screen information center. 
     <I>Seattle, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, San Francisco and Pittsburgh</I> have set up Career      Transition Assistance Programs. 
     <I>New York</I> initiated a downsizing task force to look at technology, hold classes on resume
     writing, etc, and inventory soft landing aids to avoid duplication among member
agencies. 
     <I>Denver </I>is working with the State to set up assistance and retraining. 

<H3>Facilitate Placement of Displaced Federal Workers:</H3>
     Several FE Bs have been successful in placing federal workers in jobs. In conjunction      with the Federal Personnel Council, the <I>Denver </I>FEB spearheaded a drive to place 680 of    the 700 federal employees displaced from Lowry Air Force Base; 
<I>St. Louis</I> helped place 100 federal employees; <I>Twin Cities</I> maintains an outplacement database that has helped 7
     clerical employees find jobs, and <I>Newark </I>has placed 20 employees.

<H3>Develop Guides to Aid in Service Delivery for Members and Stakeholders: </H3>
     Many FEBs assisted member     agencies by preparing guides that made inter-agency    services easily accessible: <BR>
      In <I>St. Louis</I>, local agencies reported FY'95 savings of more than &#036;63,000 by using the
facilities, people, equipment and services offered in their Resource Sharing Guide (<I>Boston, St.
Louis, Pittsburgh</I>).  <I>Boston </I>also put their guide on the internet
http://204.96.146.119./febindex.htm. <BR>
     <I>Denver </I>provides member agencies with a Conference Guide that lists no cost
conferencing options, space, teleconferencing capability, audiovisual equipment and
translator/interpreter services. It also includes ADA accessible hotels/motels. <BR>
     <I>Baltimore, Newark and San Antonio</I> prepared Education Assistance Guides. They
included computer, mentoring and speaking needs and resources. <BR>
     Membership Directories (<I>Detroit, Oklahoma City, Newark, San Antonio, San Francisco</I>),
the Oklahoma City Directory proved invaluable following the bombing. It was the only
up-to-date listing of agencies housed in the bombed building. San Francisco recently expanded
its directory to include e-mail addresses. <BR>
     Other guides include: Speaker's Resource Guide (<I>Denver and Pittsburgh</I>), Training
Directory (<I>Cleveland</I>), Congressional Directory (Cleveland), Media Guide (<I>Kansas City </I>and
<I>Cincinnati</I>) and School Age Child Facts and Tips for Parents (<I>New York</I>).

<H3>Support Resource Conservation:</H3>
      <B>Recycling</B>--<I>Houston</I> coordinates the interagency rec ycling program which saved 2,000   trees, 350 barrels of oil, and 800,000 gallons of w ater. <I>Kansas City</I> issued an FEB   Recycler Newsletter, prepared a video on recycling, participated in Earth Day, had a booth at the National Recycling Conference, and provided judges and savings bonds to the student winners with the best conservation or increased energy use at the Greater <I>Kansas City</I> Science and Engineering Fair. <BR>
     <B>Transportation</B>--<I>St. Louis</I> co-sponsored Ride Share which resulted in 400 federal       employees forming car and van pools and Los Angeles located a County Transportation  Information Kiosk in the Federal Building.<P>

<H3>Conduct Initiatives to Improve the Quality of Life for Federal Employees:</H3>
     <B>Education</B>--<I>Kansas City</I> organized college fairs for federal employees interested in   pursuing additional training and education. <P>

     <B>Financial Planning/Retirement</B>-- FEBs including <I>Dallas, Seattle, Portland, Houston,   Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Baltimore, and Cleveland</I>  held pre-retirement/buyout courses.<P>

     <B>Health</B>--<I>Cincinnati, Cleveland and Pittsburgh</I> held health fairs with up to  3,000          participants. Many FEBs held a variety of health programs including Stress           Management, Wellness, Coping With Pain, Mammography screenings and CPR     training. <P>
     
      <B>Parenting</B>--New York held these classes as a result of a Census Bureau report that    indicated New York City had the largest percentage of single parent families in the  country. Five federal agencies pooled resources to create a Working Family Institute. They held 13 classes for federal employees with 325 attendees. <P>
     
     <B>Telecommuting Initiatives</B>--Many FEBs encouraged telecommuting, held Telecommute      America fairs and flexi-week open houses (<I>Denver, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago and Seattle</I>).<P>

     <B>Unemployment Compensation Furlough Initiatives</B>--Many FEBs provided information to
agencies and coordinated with the responsible state agency. (<I>Denver, Honolulu, Chicago,
Baltimore, Twin Cities, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Dallas,and Oklahoma City</I>).

<H3>Offer Special Emphasis Programs:</H3>
     <B>Unity Day Celebrations, Conferences and Training Sessions</B>--Many FEBs have very  active special emphasis programs and committees. They hold monthly luncheons and     seminars to inform and educate minority groups--Women, Hispanic, Black, Asian        American, Native American and Disabled. Other FEBs are recognizing that it is
effective      to honor all minority groups at a single ceremony. They report that it not only
saves     employee time and agency money but develops more harmonious and truly diverse   celebrations and training programs (<I>Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, New Orleans,    Chicago, Twin Cities, Baltimore and Newark</I>). <P>

    <B> Initiatives to Assist the Disabled</B>--<I>St. Louis</I> provides disabled employees with state-of-  the-art assistive technology through their TARGET Center. It is the first center outside  DC that is a partnership of federal, state, and local organ izations. Since opening in April, more than 100 demonstrations have been conducted. The FEB hopes to extend services to
the private sector. <I>New York</I> co-sponsored a career day for clients of the National Center for
Disability Services; 200 clients had employment interviews with 12 federal agencies to be
interviewed for possible employment. In FY 95 Social Security hired 21 disabled individuals as a
direct result of the FEB activities. <I>Cincinnati </I>held disability awareness training and produced a
newsletter about working with disabled employees. <P>

     <B>Special Emphasis Skills Training</B>--FEBs held classes such as EEO Counselor Training,  Supervising the Disabled and Sign Language Classes. <P>



<H2> Theme 3: Facilitate Service Delivery</H2>
 
FEBs draw together agencies with common clients so that government services are convenient
for customers. <P>

<H3>Improve Service Delivery: </H3>
     FEBs piloted service delivery innovations contained in the President's Management    Council Study of Federal Field Structures to improve customer service. <P>


   <B>  Technology Initiatives</B>--Dallas and Philadelphia are  developing Internet sites that will   interlace government service information. They a re working with state, county, and   municipal governments. Dallas is also research  ing development of one-stop shopping kiosks. The Denver FEB supports Project Colorado, an interagency/intergovernmental/ private sector touch screen kiosk system approach to one-stop shopping for government services and helps sponsor the Project's yearly Service to the Citizen Conference. Attendance at the Conference exceeds 2,000 national and international participants.
     The Denver FEB also works with agencies on a joint project to improve customer access     to recreation areas including National and State Parks via Internet.<P>

     <B>One Stop Shopping--</B>
      <LI> <B>For Businesses</B>--Houston opened the first US General Store for Small Businesses, which
is a partnership of 30 federal, state and local government agencies to provide information and
services to businesses. Since opening in July, they have had over 3,000 customers. In partnership
with their Enterprise Communities, Boston and Kansas City have recently opened stores. Buffalo
has a One-Stop Business Assistance Center sponsored by IRS, SBA, HUD, VA, United Way and
the New York Department of Finance and Taxation.<P> 

     <LI><B>  For Individuals</B>--Baltimore developed a business plan and held a conference to establish
the feasibility of a government one-stop shopping store G-Mart. They found that technology
would be a better alternative. In Portland, the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and
Oregon State Agencies have joined forces to offer a one-stop store for recreational land use
called the Nature of the NW. In Atlanta, the FEB is involved in the one-stop center for tourists to
the '96 Olympics.<P>

      <LI><B>Telephone Access to Government Services</B>--Th e Denver FEB worked with           member agencies and US West to revamp the Frequen  tly Called Section of the Denver    Telephone Directory. This FEB initiative "to list services not organizations" touched off a nationwide GSA/NPR telephone listing improvement project. Houston prepared an interagency directory of services available for agencies to use for information and referral. And Cincinnati published a "Who To Call" two-fold, six-panel listing of
phone     numbers for congressional, federal, state, county, city and general services available to      citizens.<P>
 
<H3>Lead Service Delivery Partnerships:</H3>
     Through Partnership Minnesota, the Twin Cities FEB brings together key agencies,
customers, stakeholders, and state/local partners to explore issues. This dialogue creates
improved service for customers. For example, IRS and the Minnesota Department of Revenue
routinely share tax compliance information. Partnership Minnesota has recognized more than 80
partnerships from around the state at an annual conference attended by 200 federal, state, local
and non-profit organizations. <P>
     
     Atlanta is working with the Atlanta Project to provide comprehensive assistance to   families including the Georgia Common Access Form, a universal application for       benefits form that is accepted by federal, state and local agencies. It is estimated
that joint     use of the form saves &#036;11.52 per intake application. <P>

     Detroit holds quarterly meetings with the Mayor's representative to identify issues of    mutual interest to federal agencies and city government. Such as a combined federal/city  sponsored garage sale for disposing of excess property. <P>

     I n Portland, local agency heads participate in the NW Economic Adjustment Initiative      and the FEB has formed the Oregon Options Ad hoc committee in partnership with the   Governor's Office. The FEB is now the primary point of contact for state agencies regarding federal programs.<P>

<H3>Support Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Initiatives:</H3>
     Houston serves on the Enterprise Zone Governing Board; Newark assisted in the local
application process; Philadelphia is working with the Empowerment Zone to donate surplus
property to the city; and Atlanta is working to improve services and co-locate programs. <P>

<H3>Inform Citizens of Federal Services Available:</H3>
      Several foster public awareness of federal services  by setting up mall displays during    Public Employee Recognition Week (New   Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Newark, and    Cincinnati). Twin Cities also used cultural,  ethnic and employment-oriented community events to inform the community of federal programs and employment opportunities, such as Cinco de Mayo and NAACP, City Fair, and Juneteenth City-wide Celebration Informational Booth. In Dallas, the FEB co-hosts a reception with INS for new citizens at the swearing-in ceremonies. <P>

<H3>Inform the Community of Regulatory Reform Initiatives:</H3>
     San Antonio briefs city, county, and Chambers of Commerce officials on reinvention
activities. They have extended an open invitation to help in revising federal regulations that may
be burdensome to local efforts to improve government. Houston held a One-Stop Compliance
Seminar for Small Businesses. <P>
     


<H3>Help Create Jobs in the Community:</H3>
     The Balti more FEB has assisted in converting the Fort Meade military airfield to a local  government general aviation airfield. Jobs will be created to include other types of      aviation-related business. Members of the San Francisco FEB are actively involved in developing re-use plans for two major bases that are scheduled to close.<P>


<H3>Assist Businesses in Securing Government Contracts:</H3>
     Phil adelphia, St. Louis, Chic ago and Pittsburgh sponsor ed or co-sponsored procurement     conferences, breakfasts and luncheons. Cincinnati he ld its 17th Annual Procurement   Conference; 50 prime contractors and 100 minority subc ontractors attended. Contracts awarded totalled &#036;217,000,000. St. Louis held a similar conference and 36 of the 250 businesses that attended received contracts. Kansas City, St. Louis, Philadelphia, and San Antonio developed directories of federal procurement opportunities to assist small businesses in more easily obtaining federal contracts. 

<H3>Support Veterans:</H3>
     Sev eral FEBs have Veterans' Committees and hav  e  supported Veterans' stand downs      (Education Days). St. Louis, in conjunction with Ve terans' organizations, conducted a     one-day stand down that provided medical, l egal counseling, employment services and food and clothing to 163 participants; many of whom were homeless. They also distributed a 135 page Veteran's Service Directory. In Seattle they also used a Veterans' stand down to inform congressional representatives about concerns in the veterans communities. It was co-sponsored by county and state veterans agencies and was well received by veterans.


<H2>Theme 4: Partner with Community Groups</H2>
 
FEBs help solve community problems. <P>

<H3>Join Business Associations, Chambers, etc:</H3>
     Several FEBs including Chicago and Pittsburgh belong to the Chamber of Commerce. In
Dallas the GSA manager represents the FEB on the Central Dallas Business District, an
organization established to invigorate the downtown area. The FEB in Pittsburgh sponsored
participation of their Chairperson in the Chamber's Leadership Program. <P>

<H3>Conduct Education Initiatives:</H3>
      <B>Develop Goals 2000 Programs</B>--The San Antonio FEB founded Project Satisfy to     survey area schools to determine unmet needs, and match federal, corporate and       community providers with schools expressing needs. For the past two years, the FEB has met at least one need of 97% of the schools responding, including 900 surplus computers,
     150 modems, numerous library books, classroom aids, and physical education equipment.
     Cost avoidance to taxpayers is estimated to be &#036;225,000. Baltimore promoted a variety of
     education i nitiatives including a scholarship program, provid ed a catalog of initiatives  that could benefit students, maintained an interagency speakers bureau, encouraged each   agency in Maryland to adopt a school and provided drug education to three schools. San Francisco also developed a "How To" partnership guide to help agencies partner with schools. <P>

    <B> Initiate Volunteer Efforts</B>--The Kansas City Public/Federal Partnership involves 19
schools and reaches 71,000 students. Portland and San Antonio surveyed school needs to
determine desired youth training activities and match those to member agency programs.
Houston in conjunction with IMAGE established a mentoring program; over 200 students
participated in the program. It includes a peer pyramid teams of students with federal managers.
Atlanta co-sponsors a leadership development program for youth ages 12 to 16, especially
African-American males. Detroit identifies volunteers as adult literacy trainers to work with the
local county literacy councils. Dallas has partnerships with three schools which includes federal
employees as mentors, pen pals and they hold a Christmas Program. Chicago and Newark
provide speakers to schools. <P>
     
    <B> Donate Technology</B>--Philadelphia transferred 250 WordPerfect licenses and 65          computers to schools, while San Antonio transferred 900 surplus computers.<P>

     <B>Hold Contests and Award Scholarships</B>--Baltimore, New Orleans, San Antonio and   Kansas City have annual scholarships. Pittsburgh holds essay and art contests to promote
multi-cultural awareness.<P>

     <B>Promote Grammar and High School Career Awareness</B>--Many FEBs support summer
employment programs, career and stay-in-school programs. Buffalo has gone one step further by
combining involvement in the City Summer Youth Program, which employs disadvantaged
youth for six weeks each summer break, with an active education program of FEB-sponsored
workshops in non-violent problem resolution, AIDS Information, Drug Awareness, Diversity
Training, and Money Management. <P>

     FEBs are  also involved in bringing awareness of fe deral  career opportunities to students.      Houston held a one-day Youth Forum that   attracted several thousand students. Dallas  held a Federal Career Awareness Day. Phi ladelphia, New Orleans and New York support a city-wide shadowing day through the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Education. Chicago established a Youth Entrepreneurial Development Subcommittee to match student entrepreneurs with business owners who could serve as mentors. Denver adopted a youth center which teaches young women to develop decision-making, organizational and human relations skills. And Twin Cities has an on-going relationship with Junior Achievement programs. <P>

    <B> Partner with Universities</B>--Houston places 100 interns each year, and has created a real
win-win for agencies and students. Agencies use the students in technical and staff positions and
students obtain real world experience. New York City works with the New York University
School of Public Service to develop the curriculum for the their Women in Management
Institute. This institute is offered twice yearly and is open to 30 graduate students and mid-level
managers from federal, state city and non-profit organizations. <P>
     
<B>     Other Innovative Activities</B>--Atlanta co-sponsored P.L.A.Y. Day. Private organizations     including NIKE and various public sponsors organized a day of sports events and offered   immunizations as well as other fitness information and a Youth Passport, a Polaroid
picture and fingerprints for each child, in case the child is lost or kidnapped. As part of their
initiative to support Single Parent Families, New York helped an organization obtain funding to
conduct training for providers of after school-care. 

<H3>Support Charitable Activities:</H3>
     <B>Combined Federal Campaign</B>--All FEBs help coordinate the Combined Federal
Campaign. The most recent campaign raised well over &#036;50 million dollars. Many organize blood
drives (e.g. Kansas City, Honolulu and New Orleans). They also support the Savings Bond
Campaign.  FEB members serve on the boards of charitable organizations such as the United
Way and actively support education and charitable initiatives.<P>

    <B> Oklahoma City Memorial Activities</B>--This year, many FEBs held memorial services  and collected donations for federal workers and their families (Boston, Denver, Honolulu,
     St. Louis, New Orleans, Seattle, Pittsburgh, Newark, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and    Cleveland).<P>

 <B>    Donations</B>--FEBs conduct food, clothing, school supplies and toy drives, with amazing      results. St. Louis reported seven tons of donated food; New York's food drive is reported      as one of the top ten in the city and Seattle provided school clothes and supplies for 600. <P>

    <B> Volunteer Activities</B>--FEBs organize volunteer activities: Buffalo has adopted a senior    center, Cleveland provides meals to the hungry. Oklahoma City organized a multitude of
community outreach efforts including 272 volunteers for Christmas in April to assist seniors with
home repairs, 23 walked to raise funds for MS, 92 worked at the Salvation Army Toy Store, and
16 at the local PBS telethon. Seattle, Kansas City and      Pittsburgh participate in a Day of
Caring where from 400 to 1,600 federal volunteers paint homes, feed the needy and clean up
waterways. And Los Angeles held a picnic for homeless children and donates surplus equipment
to a homeless shelter.<P>

     <B>Charity Sporting Events</B>--FEBs such as Dallas, Atlanta and New York participate in    charity walks and runs; the FEB in Denver even holds a 5K run. <P>

    <B> Directory of Volunteer Activities</B>--Cleveland published a Directory of Volunteer      Opportunities in Elder Services. San Antonio, Portland and Baltimore produced a      directory of volunteer opportunities in schools. <P>


<H2>Theme 5: Coordinate Emergency Services</H2>
 
FEBs stand ready to marshal resources of the entire federal community, to assist citizen in a
public emergency or aid a member agency in crisis.<P>
 
<H3>Organize Emergency Communication for the Federal Community:</H3>
     <B>Interagency Coordination</B>--Most FEBs provide a uniform policy and communication  system for dismissal of federal employees. This year, they also provided information on
the furloughs and coordinated with local unemployment compensation agencies and credit
unions for affected employees.

  <B>   Security Task Forces</B>--Following the Oklahoma Cit  y disaster many FEBs reviewed   security. New York, for example, formed an Int eragenc y Task Force on Emergency  Management to review how the federal community com municates in all types of crises.       They established three levels of communication. They assigned primary responsibility to the FAA communication center. They can accept notification from the FEB, GSA, FEMA or the FBI. That system is backed up by an FEB telephone hotline and broadcast fax system. The system can also locate tenants in specific buildings electronically in case of specific building emergencies. They have also formed a 50-member Security Officers' Council to address high-profile issues like terrorists and violence in the workplace. <P>

     <B>Hotlines</B>--Several FEBs have set up hotlines for agency heads to call for critical
information during crises, emergencies or inclement weather (Pittsburgh, Cincinnati). Newark
has a direct line to the police department to immediately obtain and circulate correct information
to employees in case of possible civil disturbance.<P>

    <B> Security Training</B>--FEBs offer a variety of security training: security briefings
(Philadelphia), mail bomb classes (Seattle), and Violence in the Workplace (Kansas City and
Philadelphia); the Cincinnati FEB and OSHA co-sponsored a course for Collateral Duty Safety
Officers. <P>

<H3>Provide Disaster Assistance:</H3>
     Two years ago following the Northridge Earthquake, the Los Angeles FEB trained over
1,000 federal employees who volunteered to support FEMA. This year FEBs provided a variety
of support:
<P>
     <B>Aircraft Crash</B>--Following the crash of USAir 426 in Pittsburgh, the FEB assisted
agencies in coordinating emergency assistance--investigation, search and rescue, storage and
identification and social security claims takings.. 
<P>     
     <B>Bombing</B>--Oklahoma City was the central point   of contact for services and assistance  available to federal agencies and employees affected by the April 19th bombing in         Oklahoma City. The FEB continues to address ongoing needs of agencies and  individuals affected. Dallas is the regional office city for many of the agencies in Oklahoma City. The FEB there assisted in coordinating agency offers of
equipment and  materials, and relief efforts. <P>
          
    <B> Floods</B>--St. Louis saved &#036;30,000 for flooded agencies by helping them relocate to vacant   space in non-flooded agencies. Dallas assisted state and local agencies in clean-up and   recovery actions when the downtown area flooded.<P>


        <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>  Highlights of 1995-96 Initiatives </H2>
     
<B>Communicate -</B> FEBs located over 100 reinventing government success stories that were
recognized with the Vice President's Hammer Award.  Many of these successes were included in
this year's National Performance Review Report: Common Sense Government.   Their e-mail,
FAX, and on-line networks kept front-line federal managers apprised of reinvention news and
Adminsitration priorities including Career Transition Assistance, Computers to Schools, Voter
Registration, and the AIDs Initiative.  They also linked federal managers to the press and state
agencies during this year's employee furloughs. <P>

<B>Reduce Costs and Improve Efficiency </B>-   FEBs helped agencies pool agency training resources to
meet common needs, (i.e. executive development, supervisory training, customer service, and
pre-retirement).  Composite savings to agencies were often &#036;300,000 to &#036;500,000 by FEB
location.  They organized  interagency Alternative Dispute Resolution Programs and reported
major savings for agencies in resolving labor/management disputes. St. Louis, for instance,
trained 45 mediators at no cost in 1995 and estimates savings from 22 mediations to be
&#036;150,000.  FEBs also encouraged sharing administrative overhead costs.  <P>
     
<B>Facilitate Service Delivery </B>- The PMC Field Structures Report tasked FEBs with finding ways to
improve customer service.  As a result, the Houston US General Store for Small Business opened
in July. It has served over 3,000 customers with a 99% customer satisfaction rate and is being
replicated in Boston, Kansas City and Atlanta.  Denver piloted improving telephone access to
government services.  This program was adopted by GSA as its contribution to the President's
Customer Service Vanguard.<P>

          
         <B> Partner with Community Groups</B> -  In the bombing aftermath, Oklahoma City
coordinated relief efforts with the city, including financial assistance and scholarship funds; San
Antonio delivered 900 excess federal computers to schools; New Orleans worked with law
enforcement agencies on crime prevention; and New York assisted single-parent families.  In
addition, FEBs raised more than 50 million dollars  through the Combined Federal Campaign.
<P>
          
<B>Coordinate Emergency Services</B> - FEBs coordinated furlough planning,  Oklahoma City
communicated with and for federal agencies following the bombing, St. Louis and  Dallas
assisted following floods.  Last year, Los Angeles assisted FEMA by organizing over 1,000
federal volunteers following the Northridge quake.

<HR>

For Immediate Release <BR>
       September 11, 1993

<H2>EXECUTIVE ORDER</H2>

<H3>SETTING CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS</H3>

Putting people first means ensuring that the

Federal Government provides the highest quality

service possible to the American people.  Public

officials must embark upon a revolution within the

Federal Government to change the way it does

business.  This will require continual reform of the

executive branch's management practices and

operations to provide service to the public that

matches or exceeds the best service available in the

private sector.

<P>



NOW, THEREFORE, to establish and implement

customer service standards to guide the operations

of the executive branch, and by the authority

vested in me as President by the Constitution

and the laws of the United States, it is hereby

ordered:


<P>

<H3>
Section 1.  Customer Service Standards.</H3>  In

order to carry out the principles of the National

Performance Review, the Federal Government must

be customer-driven.  The standard of quality for

services provided to the public shall be:  Customer

service equal to the best in business.  For the

purposes of this order, &quot;customer&quot; shall mean an

individual or entity who is directly served by a

department or agency.  &quot;Best in business&quot;

shall mean the highest quality of service delivered

to customers by private organizations providing a

comparable or analogous service.

<P>



All executive departments and agencies

(hereinafter referred to collectively as &quot;agency&quot; or

&quot;agencies&quot;) that provide significant services directly

to the public shall provide those services in a

manner that seeks to meet the customer service

standard established herein and shall take the

following actions:


<OL type=a>


<LI> identify the customers who are, or should

be, served by the agency;





<LI>  survey customers to determine the kind

and quality of services they want and their level of

satisfaction with existing services;





<LI>  post service standards and measure results

against them;





<LI>  benchmark customer service performance

against the best in business;





<LI>  survey front-line employees on barriers to,

and ideas for, matching the best in business;





<LI> provide customers with choices in both the

sources of service and the means of delivery;





<LI> make information, services, and complaint

systems easily accessible; and





<LI> provide means to address customer

complaints.


</OL>


<H3>Sec. 2.  Report on Customer Service Surveys.</H3>

By March 8, 1994, each agency subject to this order

shall report on its customer surveys to the

President.  As information about customer

satisfaction becomes available, each agency shall

use that information in judging the performance of

agency management and in making resource

allocations.





<H3>Sec. 3.  Customer Service Plans.</H3>  By September

8, 1994, each agency subject to this order shall

publish a customer service plan that can be readily

understood by its customers. The plan shall include

customer service standards and describe future

plans for customer surveys.  It also shall identify

the private and public sector standards that the

agency used to benchmark its performance against

the best in business.  In connection with the plan,

each agency is encouraged to provide training

resources for programs needed by employees who

directly serve customers and by managers making

use of customer survey information to promote the

principles and objectives contained

herein.





<H3>Sec. 4.  Independent Agencies.</H3>  Independent

agencies are requested to adhere to this order.





<H3>Sec. 5.  Judicial Review. </H3> This order is for the

internal management of the executive branch and

does not create any right or benefit, substantive or

procedural, enforceable by a party against the

United States, its agencies or instrumentalities,

its officers or employees, or any other person.

		  <H3>  REGULATORY PLANNING AND REVIEW</H3>

 
</CENTER>
 

	The American people deserve a regulatory system that works

   for them, not against them:  a regulatory system that protects

   and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-being

   and improves the performance of the economy without imposing

   unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; regulatory

   policies that recognize that the private sector and private

   markets are the best engine for economic growth; regulatory

   approaches that respect the role of State, local, and tribal

   governments; and regulations that are effective, consistent,

   sensible, and understandable.  We do not have such a regulatory

   system today.

 
<P>
	With this Executive order, the Federal Government begins a

   program to reform and make more efficient the regulatory process.

   The objectives of this Executive order are to enhance planning

   and coordination with respect to both new and existing

   regulations; to reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the

   regulatory decision-making process; to restore the integrity and

   legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight; and to make the

   process more accessible and open to the public.  In pursuing

   these objectives, the regulatory process shall be conducted so as

   to meet applicable statutory requirements and with due regard to

   the discretion that has been entrusted to the Federal agencies.

 
<P>
	Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by

   the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it

   is hereby ordered as follows:

 <P>

	<H3>Section 1.  Statement of Regulatory Philosophy and

   Principles. </H3> 
 <OL type=a>
   <LI>  The Regulatory Philosophy.  Federal agencies

   should promulgate only such regulations as are required by law,

   are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by

   compelling public need, such as material failures of private

   markets to protect or improve the health and safety of the

   public, the environment, or the well-being of the American

   people.  In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should

   assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory

   alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating.  Costs

   and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable

   measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully

   estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that

   are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to

   consider.  Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory

   approaches, agencies should select those approaches that maximize

   net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public

   health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts;

   and equity), unless a statute requires another regulatory

   approach.

 



 

	<LI>  The Principles of Regulation.  To ensure that the

   agencies' regulatory programs are consistent with the philosophy

   set forth above, agencies should adhere to the following

   principles, to the extent permitted by law and where applicable:

         <OL>

	<LI>  Each agency shall identify the problem that it intends

   to address (including, where applicable, the failures of private

   markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action) as

   well as assess the significance of that problem.

 

	<LI> Each agency shall examine whether existing regulations

   (or other law) have created, or contributed to, the problem that

   a new regulation is intended to correct and whether those

   regulations (or other law) should be modified to achieve the

   intended goal of regulation more effectively.

 

	<LI>  Each agency shall identify and assess available

   alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic

   incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees

   or marketable permits, or providing information upon which

   choices can be made by the public.

 

	<LI>  In setting regulatory priorities, each agency shall

   consider, to the extent reasonable, the degree and nature of the

   risks posed by various substances or activities within its

   jurisdiction.

 

	<LI> When an agency determines that a regulation is the best

   available method of achieving the regulatory objective, it shall

   design its regulations in the most cost-effective manner to

   achieve the regulatory objective.  In doing so, each agency shall

   consider incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability,

   the costs of enforcement and compliance (to the government,

   regulated entities, and the public), flexibility, distributive

   impacts, and equity.

 

	<LI>  Each agency shall assess both the costs and the

   benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some

   costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a

   regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits

   of the intended regulation justify its costs.

 

	<LI>  Each agency shall base its decisions on the best

   reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other

   information concerning the need for, and consequences of, the

   intended regulation.

 

	<LI>)  Each agency shall identify and assess alternative forms

   of regulation and shall, to the extent feasible, specify

   performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or

   manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt.

 

	<LI>  Wherever feasible, agencies shall seek views of

   appropriate State, local, and tribal officials before imposing

   regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely

   affect those governmental entities.  Each agency shall assess the

   effects of Federal regulations on State, local, and tribal

   governments, including specifically the availability of resources

   to carry out those mandates, and seek to minimize those burdens

   that uniquely or significantly affect such governmental entities,

   consistent with achieving regulatory objectives.  In addition, as

   appropriate, agencies shall seek to harmonize Federal regulatory

   actions with related State, local, and tribal regulatory and

   other governmental functions.

 

 

	<LI> Each agency shall avoid regulations that are

   inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its other

   regulations or those of other Federal agencies.

 

	<LI> Each agency shall tailor its regulations to impose the

   least burden on society, including individuals, businesses of

   differing sizes, and other entities (including small communities

   and governmental entities), consistent with obtaining the

   regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other things,

   and to the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative

   regulations.

 

	<LI>  Each agency shall draft its regulations to be simple

   and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing the potential

   for uncertainty and litigation arising from such uncertainty.
</OL>
 </OL>

	<H3>Sec. 2.  Organization.</H3>  An efficient regulatory planning and

   review process is vital to ensure that the Federal Government's

   regulatory system best serves the American people.  
 <OL type=a>
<LI>  The

   Agencies.  Because Federal agencies are the repositories of

   significant substantive expertise and experience, they are

   responsible for developing regulations and assuring that the

   regulations are consistent with applicable law, the President's

   priorities, and the principles set forth in this Executive order.

 

	<LI>  The Office of Management and Budget.  Coordinated

   review of agency rulemaking is necessary to ensure that

   regulations are consistent with applicable law, the President's

   priorities, and the principles set forth in this Executive order,

   and that decisions made by one agency do not conflict with the

   policies or actions taken or planned by another agency.  The

   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall carry out that review

   function.  Within OMB, the Office of Information and Regulatory

   Affairs (OIRA) is the repository of expertise concerning

   regulatory issues, including methodologies and procedures that

   affect more than one agency, this Executive order, and the

   President's regulatory policies.  To the extent permitted by law,

   OMB shall provide guidance to agencies and assist the President,

   the Vice President, and other regulatory policy advisors to the

   President in regulatory planning and shall be the entity that

   reviews individual regulations, as provided by this Executive

   order.

 

	<LI>  The Vice President.  The Vice President is the

   principal advisor to the President on, and shall coordinate the

   development and presentation of recommendations concerning,

   regulatory policy, planning, and review, as set forth in this

   Executive order.  In fulfilling their responsibilities under this

   Executive order, the President and the Vice President shall be

   assisted by the regulatory policy advisors within the Executive

   Office of the President and by such agency officials and

   personnel as the President and the Vice President may, from time

   to time, consult.
</OL>
 

	<H3>Sec. 3.  Definitions.</H3>   For purposes of this Executive

   order:

   Staff Secretary; (9) the Assistant to the President and Chief of

   Staff to the Vice President; (10) the Assistant to the President

   and Counsel to the President; (11) the Deputy Assistant to the

   President and Director of the White House Office on Environmental

   Policy; and (12) the Administrator of OIRA, who also shall

   coordinate communications relating to this Executive order among

   regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).

 

	<LI>  &quot;Director&quot; means the Director of OMB.

 

	(<LI>  &quot;Regulation&quot; or &quot;rule&quot; means an agency statement of

   general applicability and future effect, which the agency intends

   forth in this Executive order.
 </OL>
</OL>


 

	<H3>Sec. 4.  Planning Mechanism.</H3>  In order to have an effective

   regulatory program, to provide for coordination of regulations,

   to maximize consultation and the resolution of potential

   conflicts at an early stage, to involve the public and its State,

   local, and tribal officials in regulatory planning, and to ensure

   that new or revised regulations promote the President's

   priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order,

   these procedures shall be followed, to the extent permitted by

   law: 
<OL type=a> 
<LI>  Agencies' Policy Meeting.  Early in each year's

   planning cycle, the Vice President shall convene a meeting of the

   Advisors and the heads of agencies to seek a common understanding

   of priorities and to coordinate regulatory efforts to be

   accomplished in the upcoming year.

   and in a manner specified by the Administrator of OIRA.  The

   description of each regulatory action shall contain, at a

   minimum, a regulation identifier number, a brief summary of the

   action, the legal authority for the action, any legal deadline

   for the action, and the name and telephone number of a

   knowledgeable agency official.  Agencies may incorporate the

   information required under 5 U.S.C. 602 and 41 U.S.C. 402 into

   these agendas.

 

	<LI>  The Regulatory Plan.  For purposes of this subsection,

   the term &quot;agency&quot; or &quot;agencies&quot; shall also include those

   considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in

   44 U.S.C. 3502(10). 
                <OL> <LI>  As part of the Unified Regulatory

   Agenda, beginning in 1994, each agency shall prepare a Regulatory

   Plan (Plan) of the most important significant regulatory actions

   that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final

   form in that fiscal year or thereafter.  The Plan shall be

   approved personally by the agency head and shall contain at a

   minimum:

         <OL type=A>

	<LI>  A statement of the agency's regulatory objectives and

   priorities and how they relate to the President's priorities;

 

	<LI>  A summary of each planned significant regulatory action

   including, to the extent possible, alternatives to be considered

   and preliminary estimates of the anticipated costs and benefits;

 

	<LI> A summary of the legal basis for each such action,

   including whether any aspect of the action is required by statute

   or court order;

 

	<LI>  A statement of the need for each such action and, if

   safety, or the environment, as well as how the magnitude of the

   risk addressed by the action relates to other risks within the

   jurisdiction of the agency;

 

	<LI> The agency's schedule for action, including a statement

   of any applicable statutory or judicial deadlines; and

 

	<LI>  The name, address, and telephone number of a person the

   public may contact for additional information about the planned

   regulatory action.
 </OL>
 

 

	<LI>  Each agency shall forward its Plan to OIRA by June 1st

   of each year.

 

	<LI>  Within 10 calendar days after OIRA has received an

   agency's Plan, OIRA shall circulate it to other affected

   agencies, the Advisors, and the Vice President.

 

	<LI>  An agency head who believes that a planned regulatory

   action of another agency may conflict with its own policy or

   action taken or planned shall promptly notify, in writing, the

   Administrator of OIRA, who shall forward that communication to

   the issuing agency, the Advisors, and the Vice President.

 

	<LI>  If the Administrator of OIRA believes that a planned

   regulatory action of an agency may be inconsistent with the

   President's priorities or the principles set forth in this

   Executive order or may be in conflict with any policy or action

   taken or planned by another agency, the Administrator of OIRA

   shall promptly notify, in writing, the affected agencies, the

   Advisors, and the Vice President.

 

	<LI>  The Vice President, with the Advisors' assistance, may

   consult with the heads of agencies with respect to their Plans

   and, in appropriate instances, request further consideration or

   inter-agency coordination.

 

	<LI> The Plans developed by the issuing agency shall be

   published annually in the October publication of the Unified

   Regulatory Agenda.  This publication shall be made available to

   the Congress; State, local, and tribal governments; and the

   public.  Any views on any aspect of any agency Plan, including

   whether any planned regulatory action might conflict with any

   other planned or existing regulation, impose any unintended

   consequences on the public, or confer any unclaimed benefits on

   the public, should be directed to the issuing agency, with a copy

   to OIRA.
 </OL>
 

	<LI>  Regulatory Working Group.  Within 30 days of the date

   of this Executive order, the Administrator of OIRA shall convene

   a Regulatory Working Group (&quot;Working Group&quot;), which shall consist

   of representatives of the heads of each agency that the

   Administrator determines to have significant domestic regulatory

   responsibility, the Advisors, and the Vice President.  The

   Administrator of OIRA shall chair the Working Group and shall

   periodically advise the Vice President on the activities of the

   Working Group.  The Working Group shall serve as a forum to

   assist agencies in identifying and analyzing important regulatory

   issues (including, among others (1) the development of innovative

   regulatory techniques, (2) the methods, efficacy, and utility of

   comparative risk assessment in regulatory decision-making, and

   (3) the development of short forms and other streamlined

   regulatory approaches for small businesses and other entities).

   The Working Group shall meet at least quarterly and may meet as a

   whole or in subgroups of agencies with an interest in particular

   issues or subject areas.  To inform its discussions, the Working

   Group may commission analytical studies and reports by OIRA, the

   Administrative Conference of the United States, or any other

   agency.

 

	<LI>  Conferences.  The Administrator of OIRA shall meet

   quarterly with representatives of State, local, and tribal

   governments to identify both existing and proposed regulations

   that may uniquely or significantly affect those governmental

   entities.  The Administrator of OIRA shall also convene, from

   time to time, conferences with representatives of businesses,

   nongovernmental organizations, and the public to discuss

   regulatory issues of common concern.

 </OL>

 

	<H3>Sec. 5. Existing Regulations.</H3>  In order to reduce the

   regulatory burden on the American people, their families, their

   communities, their State, local, and tribal governments, and

   their industries; to determine whether regulations promulgated by

   the executive branch of the Federal Government have become

   unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances;

   to confirm that regulations are both compatible with each other

   and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the

   aggregate; to ensure that all regulations are consistent with the

   President's priorities and the principles set forth in this

   Executive order, within applicable law; and to otherwise improve

   the effectiveness of existing regulations: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>  Within 90 days

   of the date of this Executive order, each agency shall submit to

   OIRA a program, consistent with its resources and regulatory

   priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its

   existing significant regulations to determine whether any such

   regulations should be modified or eliminated so as to make the

   agency's regulatory program more effective in achieving the

   regulatory objectives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment

   with the President's priorities and the principles set forth in

   this Executive order.  Any significant regulations selected for

   review shall be included in the agency's annual Plan.  The agency

   shall also identify any legislative mandates that require the

   agency to promulgate or continue to impose regulations that the

   agency believes are unnecessary or outdated by reason of changed

   circumstances.

 

	<LI>  The Administrator of OIRA shall work with the

   Regulatory Working Group and other interested entities to pursue

   the objectives of this section.  State, local, and tribal

   governments are specifically encouraged to assist in the

   identification of regulations that impose significant or unique

   burdens on those governmental entities and that appear to have

   outlived their justification or be otherwise inconsistent with

   the public interest.

 

	<LI>  The Vice President, in consultation with the Advisors,

   may identify for review by the appropriate agency or agencies

   other existing regulations of an agency or groups of regulations

   of more than one agency that affect a particular group, industry,

   or sector of the economy, or may identify legislative mandates

   that may be appropriate for reconsideration by the Congress.
</OL>
 

	<H3>Sec. 6.  Centralized Review of Regulations.  </H3>The guidelines

   set forth below shall apply to all regulatory actions, for both

   new and existing regulations, by agencies other than those

   agencies specifically exempted by the Administrator of OIRA:

 
<OL type=a>
	<LI>  Agency Responsibilities.
 <OL><LI>  Each agency shall

   (consistent with its own rules, regulations, or procedures)

   provide the public with meaningful participation in the

   regulatory process.  In particular, before issuing a notice of

   proposed rulemaking, each agency should, where appropriate, seek

   the involvement of those who are intended to benefit from and

   those expected to be burdened by any regulation (including,

   specifically, State, local, and tribal officials).  In addition,

   each agency should afford the public a meaningful opportunity to

   comment on any proposed regulation, which in most cases should

   include a comment period of not less than 60 days.  Each agency

   also is directed to explore and, where appropriate, use

   consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including

   negotiated rulemaking.

 

 

	<LI> Within 60 days of the date of this Executive order,

   each agency head shall designate a Regulatory Policy Officer who

   shall report to the agency head.  The Regulatory Policy Officer

   shall be involved at each stage of the regulatory process to

   foster the development of effective, innovative, and least

   burdensome regulations and to further the principles set forth in

   this Executive order.

 

	<LI>  In addition to adhering to its own rules and procedures

   and to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the

   Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and

   other applicable law, each agency shall develop its regulatory

   actions in a timely fashion and adhere to the following

   procedures with respect to a regulatory action:

  <OL type=A>

	<LI>  Each agency shall provide OIRA, at such times and in

   the manner specified by the Administrator of OIRA, with a list of

   its planned regulatory actions, indicating those which the agency

   believes are significant regulatory actions within the meaning of

   this Executive order.  Absent a material change in the

   development of the planned regulatory action, those not

   designated as significant will not be subject to review under

   this section unless, within 10 working days of receipt of the

   list, the Administrator of OIRA notifies the agency that OIRA has

   determined that a planned regulation is a significant regulatory

   action within the meaning of this Executive order.  The

   Administrator of OIRA may waive review of any planned regulatory

   action designated by the agency as significant, in which case the

   agency need not further comply with subsection (a)(3)(B) or

   subsection (a)(3)(C) of this section.

 

	<LI> For each matter identified as, or determined by the

   Administrator of OIRA to be, a significant regulatory action, the

   issuing agency shall provide to OIRA:
       <OL type=i>
 

	<LI>   The text of the draft regulatory action, together with

   a reasonably detailed description of the need for the regulatory

   action and an explanation of how the regulatory action will meet

   that need; and

 

	<LI>  An assessment of the potential costs and benefits of

   the regulatory action, including an explanation of the manner in

   which the regulatory action is consistent with a statutory

   mandate and, to the extent permitted by law, promotes the

   President's priorities and avoids undue interference with State,

   local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their

   governmental functions.
</OL>
 

	<LI>  For those matters identified as, or determined by the

   Administrator of OIRA to be, a significant regulatory action

   within the scope of section 3(f)(1), the agency shall also

   provide to OIRA the following additional information developed as

   part of the agency's decision-making process (unless prohibited

   by law):

 
<OL type=i>
	<LI>  An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of

   benefits anticipated from the regulatory action (such as, but not

   limited to, the promotion of the efficient functioning of the

   economy and private markets, the enhancement of health and

   safety, the protection of the natural environment, and the

   elimination or reduction of discrimination or bias) together

   with, to the extent feasible, a quantification of those benefits;

 

 

	<LI>  An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of

   costs anticipated from the regulatory action (such as, but not

   limited to, the direct cost both to the government in

   administering the regulation and to businesses and others in

   complying with the regulation, and any adverse effects on the

   efficient functioning of the economy, private markets (including

   productivity, employment, and competitiveness), health, safety,

   and the natural environment), together with, to the extent

   feasible, a quantification of those costs; and

 

	<LI>  An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of

   costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably

   feasible alternatives to the planned regulation, identified by

   the agencies or the public (including improving the current

   regulation and reasonably viable nonregulatory actions), and an

   explanation why the planned regulatory action is preferable to

   the identified potential alternatives.

 
</OL>
	<LI>  In emergency situations or when an agency is obligated

   by law to act more quickly than normal review procedures allow,

   the agency shall notify OIRA as soon as possible and, to the

   extent practicable, comply with subsections (a)(3)(B) and (C) of

   this section.  For those regulatory actions that are governed by

   a statutory or court-imposed deadline, the agency shall, to the

   extent practicable, schedule rulemaking proceedings so as to

   permit sufficient time for OIRA to conduct its review, as set

   forth below in subsection (b)(2) through (4) of this section.

 

	<LI> After the regulatory action has been published in the

   Federal Register or otherwise issued to the public, the agency

   shall:

 
 <OL type=i>
	<LI>  Make available to the public the information set forth

   in subsections (a)(3)(B) and (C);

 

	<LI>  Identify for the public, in a complete, clear, and

   simple manner, the substantive changes between the draft

   submitted to OIRA for review and the action subsequently

   announced; and

 

	<LI>  Identify for the public those changes in the

   regulatory action that were made at the suggestion or

   recommendation of OIRA.

 </OL>

	<LI>  All information provided to the public by the agency

   shall be in plain, understandable language.
 </OL>
 

	<LI>  OIRA Responsibilities.  The Administrator of OIRA shall

   provide meaningful guidance and oversight so that each agency's

   regulatory actions are consistent with applicable law, the

   President's priorities, and the principles set forth in this

   Executive order and do not conflict with the policies or actions

   of another agency.  OIRA shall, to the extent permitted by law,

   adhere to the following guidelines:

  <OL>

	<LI>  OIRA may review only actions identified by the agency

   or by OIRA as significant regulatory actions under subsection

   (a)(3)(A) of this section.

 

	<LI>  OIRA shall waive review or notify the agency in writing

   of the results of its review within the following time periods:

 

 
<OL type=A>
	<LI>  For any notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed

   rulemaking, or other preliminary regulatory actions prior to a

   Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, within 10 working days after the

   date of submission of the draft action to OIRA;

 

	<LI>  For all other regulatory actions, within 90 calendar

   days after the date of submission of the information set forth in

   subsections (a)(3)(B) and (C) of this section, unless OIRA has

   there has been no material change in the facts and circumstances

   upon which the regulatory action is based, in which case, OIRA

   shall complete its review within 45 days; and

 

	<LI>  The review process may be extended 
 <OL><LI> once by no more

   than 30 calendar days upon the written approval of the Director

   and <LI> at the request of the agency head.

 

	<LI>  For each regulatory action that the Administrator of

   OIRA returns to an agency for further consideration of some or

   all of its provisions, the Administrator of OIRA shall provide

   the issuing agency a written explanation for such return, setting

   forth the pertinent provision of this Executive order on which

   OIRA is relying.  If the agency head disagrees with some or all

   of the bases for the return, the agency head shall so inform the

   Administrator of OIRA in writing.

 

	<LI>  Except as otherwise provided by law or required by a

   Court, in order to ensure greater openness, accessibility, and

   accountability in the regulatory review process, OIRA shall be

   governed by the following disclosure requirements:
<OL type=A>
 

	<LI>  Only the Administrator of OIRA (or a particular

   designee) shall receive oral communications initiated by persons

<LI>  A representative

   from the issuing agency shall be invited to any meeting between

   communications, regardless of format, between OIRA personnel and

   any person who is not employed by the executive branch of the

   Federal Government, and the dates and names of individuals

   involved in all substantive oral communications (including

   meetings to which an agency representative was invited, but did

   not attend, and telephone conversations between OIRA personnel

   and any such persons); and

 

	<LI>  OIRA shall publicly disclose relevant information

   about such communication(s), as set forth below in subsection

   (b)(4)(C) of this section.

	<LI>  After the regulatory action has been published in the

   Federal Register or otherwise issued to the public, or after the

   agency has announced its decision not to publish or issue the

</OL>
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>

	<H3>Sec. 7.  Resolution of Conflicts.</H3>  To the extent permitted

   by law, disagreements or conflicts between or among agency heads

   or between OMB and any agency that cannot be resolved by the

   Administrator of OIRA shall be resolved by the President, or by

   the Vice President acting at the request of the President, with

   the relevant agency head (and, as appropriate, other interested

   government officials).  Vice Presidential and Presidential

   consideration of such disagreements may be initiated only by the

   Director, by the head of the issuing agency, or by the head of an

   agency that has a significant interest in the regulatory action

   at issue.  Such review will not be undertaken at the request of

   other persons, entities, or their agents.
<P>
 

	Resolution of such conflicts shall be informed by

   recommendations developed by the Vice President, after

   consultation with the Advisors (and other executive branch

   officials or personnel whose responsibilities to the President

   include the subject matter at issue).  The development of these

   recommendations shall be concluded within 60 days after review

   has been requested.
<P>

	During the Vice Presidential and Presidential review period,

   communications with any person not employed by the Federal

   Government relating to the substance of the regulatory action

   under review and directed to the Advisors or their staffs or to

   the staff of the Vice President shall be in writing and shall be

   forwarded by the recipient to the affected agency(ies) for

   inclusion in the public docket(s).  When the communication is not

   in writing, such Advisors or staff members shall inform the

   outside party that the matter is under review and that any

   comments should be submitted in writing.

 <P>

	At the end of this review process, the President, or the

   Vice President acting at the request of the President, shall

   notify the affected agency and the Administrator of OIRA of the

   President's decision with respect to the matter.

 <P>

	<H3>Sec. 8.  Publication.</H3>  Except to the extent required by law,

   an agency shall not publish in the Federal Register or otherwise

   issue to the public any regulatory action that is subject to

   review under section 6 of this Executive order until (1) the

   Administrator of OIRA notifies the agency that OIRA has waived

   its review of the action or has completed its review without any

   requests for further consideration, or (2) the applicable time

   period in section 6(b)(2) expires without OIRA having notified

   the agency that it is returning the regulatory action for further

   consideration under section 6(b)(3), whichever occurs first.  If

   the terms of the preceding sentence have not been satisfied and

   an agency wants to publish or otherwise issue a regulatory

   action, the head of that agency may request Presidential

   consideration through the Vice President, as provided under

   section 7 of this order.  Upon receipt of this request, the Vice

   President shall notify OIRA and the Advisors.  The guidelines and

   time period set forth in section 7 shall apply to the publication

   of regulatory actions for which Presidential consideration has

   been sought.

   construed as displacing the agencies' authority or

   responsibilities, as authorized by law.

 

	<H3>Sec. 10.  Judicial Review.</H3>  Nothing in this Executive order

   shall affect any otherwise available judicial review of agency

   action.  This Executive order is intended only to improve the

   internal management of the Federal Government and does not create

   any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at

   law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies

   or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other

   person.

 

	<H3>Sec.  11.  Revocations.</H3>   Executive Orders Nos. 12291 and

   12498; all amendments to those Executive orders; all guidelines

   issued under those orders; and any exemptions from those orders

   heretofore granted for any category of rule are revoked.

The involvement of federal Government employees and their union

representatives is essential to achieving the National Performance review's

Government reform objectives.  Only by changing the nature of Federal

labor-management relations so that managers, employees, and employees'

elected union representatives serve as partners will it be possible to

design and implement comprehensive changes necessary to reform

Government.  Labor-management partnerships will champion change in

Federal Government agencies to transform them into organizations capable

of delivering the highest quality services to the American people.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and

the laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States

Code, and in order to establish a new form of labor-management relations

KEY ELEMENTS: MANDATED PROCUREMENT OF RECYCLED PAPER. 
 
 
 <P>
**  Significantly reduce the burden on landfills. 
 
 
 <P>
**  All federal purchases of printing and writing paper must contain: 
 
 
 <P>
     - 20 percent post-consumer material by the end of 1994, and 30 percent by the end of 1998.

THE WHITE HOUSE; OFFICE OF THE PRESS SECRETARY<BR>

for immediate release October 26, 1993<BR>

<H2>EXECUTIVE ORDER<BR>

ENHANCING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PARTNERSHIP</H2>

<HR>
</center>
The Federal Government is charged with protecting the health and

safety, as well as promoting other national interests, of the American people.

However, the cumulative effect of unfunded mandates has increasingly strained

the budgets of State, local, and tribal governments.  In addition, the cost,

complexity, and delay in applying for and receiving waivers from Federal

requirements in appropriate cases have hindered State, local, and tribal

governments from tailoring Federal programs to meet the specific or unique

needs of their communities.  These governments should have more flexibility to

design solutions to the problems faced by citizens in this country without

excessive micro management and unnecessary regulation from the Federal

Government.

<P>

THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the

Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to

reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon State, local, and tribal

governments;  to streamline the application process for and increase the

availability of waivers to State, local, and tribal governments;  and to establish

regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with State, local, and

tribal governments on Federal matters that significantly or uniquely affect their

communities, it is hereby ordered as follows:

<P>

<H3>Section 1.</H3>	
Reduction of Unfunded Mandates.  
<OL type=a>
<LI>  To the extent

feasible and permitted by law, no executive department or agency (&quot;&quot;agency&quot;)

shall promulgate any regulation that is not required by statute and that creates a

mandate upon a State, local, or tribal government, unless:

  <OL>

    <LI>  funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the State, local,

or tribal government in complying with the mandate are provided by the

Federal Government; or



      <LI> the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of regulations

containing the proposed mandate, provides to the Director of the Office of

Management and Budget a description of the extent of the agency's prior

consultation with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal

governments, the nature of their concerns, any written communications

submitted to the agency by such units of government, and the agency's position

supporting the need to issue the regulation containing the mandate.

</OL>

<LI>  Each agency shall develop an effective process to permit elected

officials and other representatives of State, local, and tribal governments to

provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory

proposals containing significant unfunded mandates.

</OL>

<H3>Sec. 2.  Increasing Flexibility for State and Local Waivers.</H3>
<OL type=a>
<LI>	Each agency shall review its waiver application process and

take appropriate steps to streamline that process.



<LI>  Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law,

consider any application by a State, local, or tribal government for a waiver of

statutory or regulatory requirements in connection with any program

administered by that agency with a general view toward increasing

opportunities for utilizing flexible policy approaches at the State, local, and

tribal level in cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with the

applicable Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.



<LI> Each agency shall, to the fullest extent practicable and permitted

by law, render a decision upon a complete application for a waiver within 120

days of receipt of such application by the agency.  If the application for a

waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the applicant with timely

written notice of the decision and reasons therefor.



<LI>  This section applies only to statutory or regulatory requirements of

the programs that are discretionary and subject to waiver by the agency.

</OL>

<H3>Sec. 3.  Responsibility for Agency Implementation.</H3>  The Chief

Operating Officer of each agency shall be responsible for ensuring the

implementation of and compliance with this order.



<H3>Sec.4  Executive Order No. 12866.</H3>	This order shall supplement but

not supersede the requirements contained in Executive Order No. 12866

    <H3>  PART 3 - AGENCY GOALS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ENERGY

               AND WATER EFFICIENCY IN FEDERAL FACILITIES</H3>

 

<H3>Sec. 301.  Energy Consumption Reduction Goals. </H3>
<OL type=a>

<LI>  Each agency 

 shall develop and implement a program with the intent of reducing 

 energy consumption by 30 percent by the year 2005, based on energy 

 consumption per-gross-square-foot of its buildings in use, to the 

 extent that these measures are cost- effective.  The 30 percent 

 reductions shall be measured relative to the agency's 1985 energy 

 use.  Each agency's implementation program shall be designed to speed 

 the introduction of cost- effective, energy-efficient technologies 

 into Federal facilities, and to meet the goals and requirements of 

 the Act and this order.

<LI> Each agency shall develop and implement a program for its 

 industrial facilities in the aggregate with the intent of increasing 

 energy efficiency by at least 20 percent by the year 2005 as compared 

 to the 1990 benchmark, to the extent these measures are cost-

 effective, and shall implement all cost- effective water conservation 

 projects.  DOE, in coordination with the 656 Committee, shall 

 establish definitions and appropriate indicators of energy and water 

 efficiency, and energy and water consumption and costs, in Federal 

 industrial facilities for the purpose of establishing a base year of 

 1990.
</OL>
 

     <H3>Sec. 302.  Energy and Water Surveys and Audits of Federal 

 Facilities. </H3> 

<OL type=a>
<LI>  Prioritization Survey.  Each agency responsible for 

 managing Federal facilities shall conduct a prioritization survey, 

 within 18 months of the date of this order, on each of the facilities 

 the agency manages.  The surveys shall be used to establish 

 priorities for conducting comprehensive facility audits.

 

                         

  <LI> Comprehensive Facility Audits.  Each agency shall develop 

 and begin implementing a 10-year plan to conduct or obtain 

 comprehensive facility audits, based on prioritization surveys 

 performed under section 302(a) of this order.

  <OL>

        <LI>  Implementation of the plan shall ensure that 

 comprehensive facility audits of approximately 10 percent of the 

 agency's facilities are completed each year.  Agencies responsible 

 for managing less than 100 Federal facilities shall plan and execute 

 approximately 10 comprehensive facility audits per year until all 

 facilities have been audited.

 

          <LI>  Comprehensive audits of facilities performed within 

 the last 3 years may be considered current for the purposes of 

 implementation.

 

          <LI>  &quot;No-cost&quot; audits, such as those outlined in section 

 501(c) of this order, shall be utilized to the extent practicable.

 </OL>

      <LI> Exempt Facilities.  Because the mission within  facilities 

 exempt from the energy and water reduction requirements under the Act 

 may not allow energy efficiency and water conservation in certain 

 operations, actions shall be taken to reduce all other energy and 

 water waste using the procedures described in the Act and this order.  

 Each agency shall develop and implement a plan to improve energy and 

 water efficiency in such exempt facilities.  The prioritization 

 surveys are intended to allow agencies to refine their designation of 

 facilities as &quot;exempt&quot; or &quot;industrial,&quot; so that only individual 

 buildings in which industrial or energy- intensive operations are 

 conducted remain designated as &quot;exempt&quot; or &quot;industrial.&quot;  Within 21 

 months of the date of this order, each agency shall report to FEMP 

 and to the Office of Management and Budget (&quot;OMB&quot;) the redesignations 

 that the agency is making as a result of the prioritization surveys.  

 Agencies may seek exemptions for their facilities pursuant to the 

 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended.

 

     <LI>  Leased Facilities.  Agencies shall conduct surveys and 

 audits of leased facilities to the extent practicable and to the 

 extent that the recommendations of such surveys and audits could be 

 implemented under the terms of the lease.

 </OL>
<P>
   <H3>Sec. 303.  Implementation of Energy Efficiency and Water 

 Conservation Projects.</H3>  
<OL type=a>
<LI>  Implementation of New Audit 

 Recommendations.  Within 1 year of the date of this order, agencies 

 shall identify, based on preliminary recommendations from the 

 prioritization surveys required under section 302 of this order, high 

 priority facilities to audit and shall complete the first 10 percent 

 of the required comprehensive facility audits.  Within 180 days of 

 the completion of the comprehensive facility audit of each facility, 

 agencies shall begin imple- menting cost-effective recommendations 

 for installation of energy efficiency, water conservation, and 

 renewable energy technologies for that facility.

<HR>

      Geographic information is critical to promote economic 

 development, improve our stewardship of natural resources, and 

 protect the environment.  Modern technology now permits improved 

 acquisition, distribution, and utilization of geographic (or 

 geospatial) data and mapping.  The National Performance Review has 

 recommended that the executive branch develop, in cooperation with 

 State, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector, a 

 coordinated National Spatial Data Infrastructure to support public 

 and private sector applications of geospatial data in such areas as 

 transportation, community development, agriculture, emergency 

 response, environmental management, and information technology.

 governments in the development and implementation of the initiatives 

 contained in this order.  The FGDC shall utilize the expertise of 

 academia, the private sector, professional societies, and others as 

 necessary to aid in the development and implementation of the 

 objectives of this order.

 <P>

      <H3>Sec. 3.  Development of a National Geospatial Data 

 Clearinghouse.  </H3>(a)  Establishing a National Geospatial Data 

 Clearinghouse.  The Secretary, through the FGDC, and in 

 consultation with, as appropriate, State, local, and tribal 

 governments and other affected parties, shall take steps within 6 

 months of the date of this order, to establish an electronic National 

 Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (&quot;Clearinghouse&quot;) for the NSDI.  The 

 Clearinghouse shall be compatible with the National Information 

 Infrastructure to enable integration with that effort.

 <P>

      (b)  Standardized Documentation of Data.  Beginning 9 months 

 from the date of this order, each agency shall document all new 

 geospatial data it collects or produces, either directly or 

 indirectly, using the standard under development by the FGDC, and 

 make that standardized documentation electronically accessible to the 

 Clearinghouse network.  Within 1 year of the date of this order, 

 agencies shall adopt a schedule, developed in consultation with the 

 FGDC, for documenting, to the extent practicable, geospatial data 

 previously collected or produced, either directly or indirectly, and 

 making that data documentation electronically accessible to the 

 Clearinghouse network.

 <P>

      (c)  Public Access to Geospatial Data.  Within 1 year of the 

 date of this order, each agency shall adopt a plan, in consultation 

 with the FGDC, establishing procedures to make geospatial data 

 available to the public, to the extent permitted by law, current 

 policies, and relevant OMB circulars, including OMB Circular No. A-

 130 (&quot;Management of Federal Information Resources&quot;) and any 

 implementing bulletins.

 <P>

      (d)  Agency Utilization of the Clearinghouse.  Within 1 year of 

 the date of this order, each agency shall adopt internal procedures 

 to ensure that the agency accesses the Clearinghouse before it 

 expends Federal funds to collect or produce new geospatial data, to 

 determine whether the information has already been collected by 

 others, or whether cooperative efforts to obtain the data are 

 possible.

 <P>

      (e)  Funding.  The Department of the Interior shall provide 

 funding for the Clearinghouse to cover the initial prototype testing, 

 standards development, and monitoring of the performance of the 

 Clearinghouse.  Agencies shall continue to fund their respective 

 programs that collect and produce geospatial data; such data is then 

 to be made part of the Clearinghouse for wider accessibility.

 

                               <P>

<H3>      Sec. 4.  Data Standards Activities.</H3>  (a)  General FGDC 

 Responsibility.  The FGDC shall develop standards for implementing 

 the NSDI, in consultation and cooperation with State, local, and 

 tribal governments, the private and academic sectors, and, to the 

 extent feasible, the international community, consistent with OMB 

 Circular No. A-119 (&quot;Federal Participation in the Development and Use 

 of Voluntary Standards&quot;), and other applicable law and policies.

 <P>

      (b)  Standards for Which Agencies Have Specific 

 Responsibilities.  Agencies assigned responsibilities for data 

 categories by OMB Circular No. A-16 shall develop, through the FGDC, 

 standards for those data categories, so as to ensure that the data 

 produced by all agencies are compatible.

 <P>

      (c)  Other Standards.  The FGDC may from time to time identify 

 and develop, through its member agencies, and to the extent permitted 

 by law, other standards necessary to achieve the objectives of this 

 order.  The FGDC will promote the use of such standards and, as 

 appropriate, such standards shall be submitted to the Department of 

 Commerce for consideration as Federal Information Processing 

 Standards.  Those standards shall apply to geospatial data as defined 

 in section 1 of this order.

 <P>

      (d)  Agency Adherence to Standards.  Federal agencies collecting 

 or producing geospatial data, either directly or indirectly (e.g. 

 through grants, partnerships, or contracts with other entities), 

 shall ensure, prior to obligating funds 

 for such activities, that data will be collected in a manner that 

 meets all relevant standards adopted through the FGDC process.

 <P>

     <H3> Sec. 5.  National Digital Geospatial Data Framework.</H3>  In 

 consultation with State, local, and tribal governments and within 9 

 months of the date of this order, the FGDC shall submit a plan and 

 schedule to OMB for completing the initial implementation of a 

 national digital geospatial data framework (&quot;framework&quot;) by January 

 2000 and for establishing a process of ongoing data maintenance.  The 

 framework shall include geospatial data that are significant, in the 

 determination of the FGDC, to a broad variety of users within any 

 geographic area or nationwide.  At a minimum, the plan shall address 

 how the initial transportation, hydrology, and boundary elements of 

 the framework might be completed by January 1998 in order to support 

 the decennial census of 2000.

 
<P>
      <H3>Sec. 6.  Partnerships for Data Acquisition. </H3> The Secretary, 

 under the auspices of the FGDC, and within 9 months of the date of 

 this order, shall develop, to the extent permitted by law, strategies 

 for maximizing cooperative participatory efforts with State, local, 

 and tribal governments, the private sector, and other nonfederal 

 organizations to share costs and improve efficiencies of acquiring 

 geospatial data consistent with this order.

 <P>

      <H3>Sec. 7.  Scope.</H3>  (a)  For the purposes of this order, the term 

 &quot;agency&quot; shall have the same meaning as the term &quot;Executive agency&quot; 

 in 5 U.S.C. 105, and shall include the military departments and 

 components of the Department of Defense.

 <P>

      (b)  The following activities are exempt from compliance with

<H2>EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 12931</H2>

<H3>FEDERAL PROCUREMENT REFORM</H3>

    

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 

and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to 

ensure effective and efficient spending of public funds through 

fundamental reforms in Government procurement, it is hereby 

ordered as follows:



  <H3>  Section 1.</H3>  To make procurement more effective in support of 

mission accomplishment and consistent with recommendations of the 

National Performance Review, heads of executive agencies engaged 

in the procurement of supplies and services shall:


<OL type=a>
   <LI> Review agency procurement rules, reporting requirements, 

contractual requirements, certification procedures, and other 

administrative procedures over and above those required by 

statute, and, where practicable, replace them with guiding 

principles that encourage and reward innovation;



  <LI>  Review existing and planned agency programs to assure 

that such programs meet agency mission needs;



   <LI>  Ensure that procurement organizations focus on measurable 

results and on increased attention to understanding and meeting 

customer needs;



   <LI>   Increase the use of commercially available items where 

practicable, place more emphasis on past contractor performance, 

and promote best value rather than simply low cost in selecting 

sources for supplies and services;





  <LI>   Ensure that simplified acquisition procedures are used, 

to the maximum extent practicable, for procurements under the 

simplified acquisition threshold in order to reduce administrative 

burdens and more effectively support the accomplishment of agency 

missions;



<LI>  Expand the use of the Government purchase card by the 

agency and take maximum advantage of the micro-purchase authority 

provided in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 by 

delegating the authority, to the maximum extent practicable, to 

the offices that will be using the supplies or services to be 

purchased;



    <LI>   Establish clear lines of contracting authority and 

accountability;



  <LI>  Establish career education programs for procurement 

professionals, including requirements for successful completion of 

educational requirements or mandatory training for entry level 

positions and for promotion to higher level positions, in order to 

ensure a highly qualified procurement work force;



   <LI>  Designate a Procurement Executive with agency-wide 

responsibility to oversee development of procurement goals, 

guidelines, and innovation, measure and evaluate procurement 

office performance against stated goals, enhance career 

development of the procurement work force, and advise the agency 

heads whether goals are being achieved; and

    

   <LI>   Review existing and planned information technology 

acquisitions and contracts to ensure that the agency receives the 

best value with regard to price and technology, and consider 

alternatives in cases where best value is not being obtained.

</OL>



    <H3>Sec. 2. </H3> The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, 

in consultation with the heads of executive agencies, shall ensure 

that personnel policies and classification standards meet the 

needs of executive agencies for a professional procurement work 

force.





    <H3>Sec. 3.</H3>  The Administrator of the Office of Federal 

Procurement Policy, after consultation with the Director of the 

Office of Management and Budget, shall work jointly with the heads 

of executive agencies to provide broad policy guidance and overall 

leadership necessary to achieve procurement reform, including, but 

not limited to:

<OL type=a>

   <LI> Coordinating Government-wide efforts;



 <LI>   Assisting executive agencies in streamlining guidance for 

procurement processes;



 <LI>   Identifying desirable Government-wide procurement system 

criteria; and



    <LI>  Identifying major inconsistencies in law and policies 

relating to procurement that impose unnecessary burdens on the 

private sector and Federal procurement officials, and, following 

coordination with executive agencies, submitting necessary 

legislative initiatives to the Office of Management and Budget for 

the resolution of such inconsistencies.

</OL>



   <H3> Sec. 4. </H3> Executive Order No. 12352 is revoked.

                                         July 16, 1996
  
  <P>
       A Government that works better and costs less requires 
  efficient and effective information systems.  The Paperwork 
  Reduction Act of 1995 and the Information Technology Management 
  Reform Act of 1996 provide the opportunity to improve 
  significantly the way the Federal Government acquires and 
  manages information technology.  Agencies now have the clear 
  authority and responsibility to make measurable improvements 
  in mission performance and service delivery to the public 
  through the strategic application of information technology.  
  A coordinated approach that builds on existing structures 
  and successful practices is needed to provide maximum benefit 
  across the Federal Government from this technology.
  <P>
       Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President 
  by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
  America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
 <P> 
       <H3>Section 1.  Policy.</H3>
  It shall be the policy of the 
  United States Government that executive agencies shall:  
 <OL type=a> 
<LI> significantly improve the management of their information 
  systems, including the acquisition of information technology, 
  by implementing the relevant provisions of the Paperwork 
  Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-13), the Information 
  Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (Division E of Public 
  Law 104-106) (&quot;Information Technology Act&quot;), and the Government 
  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62);
  
      <LI>  refocus information technology management to support 
  directly their strategic missions, implement an investment 
  review process that drives budget formulation and execution for 
  information systems, and rethink and restructure the way they 
  perform their functions before investing in information 
  technology to support that work;
  
      <LI>  establish clear accountability for information 
  resources management activities by creating agency Chief 
  Information Officers (CIOs) with the visibility and management 
  responsibilities necessary to advise the agency head on the 
  design, development, and implementation of those information 
  systems.  These responsibilities include:  (1) participating 
  in the investment review process for information systems; 
  (2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of those 
  information systems on the basis of applicable performance 
  measures; and, (3) as necessary, advising the agency head to 
  modify or terminate those systems; 
  
      <LI> cooperate in the use of information technology to 
  improve the productivity of Federal programs and to promote a 
  coordinated, interoperable, secure, and shared Governmentwide 
  infrastructure that is provided and supported by a diversity of 
  private sector suppliers and a well-trained corps of information 
  technology professionals; and 
  
       <LI>establish an interagency support structure that 
  builds on existing successful interagency efforts and shall 
  provide expertise and advice to agencies; expand the skill 
  and career development opportunities of information technology 
  professionals; improve the management and use of information 
  technology within and among agencies by developing information 
  technology procedures and standards and by identifying and 
  sharing experiences, ideas, and promising practices; and provide 
  innovative, multi-disciplinary, project-specific support to 
  agencies to enhance interoperability, minimize unnecessary 
  duplication of effort, and capitalize on agency successes.  
  </OL>
      <H3> Sec. 2.  Responsibilities of Agency Heads. </H3> The head of 
  each executive agency shall:  
<OL type=a><LI> effectively use information 
  technology to improve mission performance and service to the 
  public;
  
       <LI>  strengthen the quality of decisions about the 
  employment of information resources to meet mission needs 
  through integrated analysis, planning, budgeting, and 
  evaluation processes, including:
      <OL>
      <LI> determining, before making investments in new 
  information systems, whether the Government should be performing 
  the function, if the private sector or another agency should 
  support the function, and if the function needs to be or has 
  been appropriately redesigned to improve its efficiency;
  
       <LI>  establishing mission-based performance measures 
  for information systems investments, aligned with agency 
  performance plans prepared pursuant to the Government 
  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62);
  
      <LI>  establishing agency-wide and project-level management 
  structures and processes responsible and accountable for 
  managing, selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments 
  in information systems, with authority for terminating 
  information systems when appropriate; 
  
       <LI>  supporting appropriate training of personnel; and 
  
       <LI>  seeking the advice of, participating in, and 
  supporting the interagency support structure set forth in 
  this order;
    </OL>
      <LI>  select CIOs with the experience and skills necessary 
  to accomplish the duties set out in law and policy, including 
  this order, and involve the CIO at the highest level of the 
  agency in the processes and decisions set out in this section; 
  
       <LI>  ensure that the information security policies, 
  procedures, and practices of the executive agency are adequate;
  
      <LI>  where appropriate, and in accordance with the Federal 
  Acquisition Regulation and guidance to be issued by the Office 
  of Management and Budget (OMB), structure major information 
  systems investments into manageable projects as narrow in scope 
  and brief in duration as practicable, consistent with the 
  Information Technology Act, to reduce risk, promote flexibility 
  and interoperability, increase accountability, and better 
  correlate mission need with current technology and market 
  conditions; and
  
      <LI> to the extent permitted by law, enter into a contract 
  that provides for multiagency acquisitions of information 
  technology as an executive agent for the Government, if and 
  in the manner that the Director of OMB considers it advantageous 
  to do so.

Title: Memo to Heads of Performance Measurement Pilot Projects

 Author: Alice Rivlin, OMB

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES 
<BR>
 DESIGNATED AS PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PILOT PROJECTS 
<BR>
 UNDER P.L. 103-62 
<P>
 
 
 FROM:    Alice M. Rivlin,

                Director 

 <P>
 
 <H2>SUBJECT:       Submission of FY 1996 Performance 

                Plans for Pilot Projects under P.L. 

                103-62, the Government Performance 

                and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) </H2>

 <HR>
 
       This memorandum covers the submission of 

 performance plans for FY 1996, the concluding year 

 of performance measurement pilots under the 

 Government Performance and Results Act. 

 <P>
 
       Two significant changes are being made to the 

 guidance for the FY 1994 and 1995 plans.  First, the 

 annual performance plan is to be submitted in 

 mid-April, some months before fiscal year 1996 

 begins.  (Previously, the pilot plans were due 

 either during or at the start of the fiscal year.)  

 A mid-April date is being set for several reasons.  

 By having pilots submit plans somewhat before the 

 fiscal year begins, we move halfway toward the 

 September date when agencies will be sending annual 

 performance plans to OMB with their budget requests.  

 This earlier submission will help in assessing how 

 well the plans can be prepared in advance.  The due 

 date also coincides with the Spring Review on 

 Program Performance, and the plans will be useful in 

 determining the current and future availability of 

 performance information. The second change allows 

 agencies the option of submitting a plan revision 

 later in 1995 that reflects Congressional action. 

 
 <P>
       Two attachments to this memorandum have been 

 prepared to assist your staff in developing these 

 plans.  With several changes, these are otherwise 

 similar to those appended to the two previous OMB 

 memoranda on pilot project performance plans. 

 Attachment 1 sets forth basic information on the 

 scope, content, and general format of the 

 performance plan.  Attachment 2 consists of 

 questions which were raised regarding particular 

 aspects of the performance plan as well as its 

 review by OMB, and the answers to those questions.  

 If you have any further questions on the pilot 

 project performance plans, please call 

 Walter Groszyk at (202) 395-6824 (or through an 

 Internet message to groszyk_w@a1.eop.gov). 

 <P>
 
       As this is the final submission of the pilot 

 project performance plans, we ask that you 

 particularly focus on how information is displayed 

 -- both in format and style -- in these plans.  As 

 we define in the months ahead suitable templates for 

 the FY 1999 plan submissions (which are due about 30 

 months from now), we continue to look for the better 

 ways of presenting performance information.  The 

 GPRA pilot project plans are our best resource for 

 developing these formats. 

 <P>
 
       Let me again express how much the staff of OMB 

 and I appreciate your agency's participation in 

 these performance measurement pilot projects.  This 

 has been a valuable learning experience throughout 

 the pilot agencies, and is helping to create a sound 

 basis for the forthcoming phase of GPRA 

 implementation government-wide. 

 <P>

 <H3>SUBMISSION OF PILOT PROJECT  </H3>                         

                                                      

 <H3>PERFORMANCE PLANS FOR FY 1996</H3> 

 
 <P>
 
 
<H3> * Submission Date * </H3>
<P>
 
 
       The plan should be sent to OMB by April 14, 

 1995.  If a department or agency chooses to prepare 

 a revision to this plan, the plan revision should be 

 sent to OMB by September 30, 1995, or within 30 days 

 of enactment of the department or agency's FY 1996 

 appropriations, whichever is later. 

 <P>
 
<H3> * Plan Content *</H3> 

 <P>
 
       The basic content of an annual performance 

 plan is defined in Section 4(b) of the Government 

 Performance and Results Act.  A plan contains the 

 following elements: 

 
 <OL>
       <LI> one or more performance goals for the 

 program activity (ies) covered by the pilot project 

    <LI>  performance indicators that will be used 

 in measuring outputs and outcomes 

    <LI>  a description of the means to be used to 

 verify and validate measured values 

    <LI>  a brief description of the operational 

 processes, skills, and technology, and the human, 

 capital, information, or other resources required to 

 meet the performance goals.  (This description may 

 be omitted for any operational or resource factor 

 that has not changed significantly from fiscal year 

 1993 or 1994 levels.) 

      <LI>  a description of the contribution (if 

 any) made by non-Federal parties (e.g., consultants 

 or contractors) in the preparation of the plan. 

 </OL>
 
       The performance goals and indicators should 

 establish target levels of achievement for the 

 programs and activities covered by the pilot 

 project. 

 <P>
 
       In choosing which goals and indicators to 

 include in the plan, agencies should be guided by 

 the following principles: 

 <UL>
 
       <LI> Goals and indicators should primarily be 

 those used by program managers to determine how well 

 a program or activity is doing in achieving its 

 intended objectives. 

 
 
       <LI>Include measures that will be useful to 

 agency heads and other stakeholders in framing an 

 assessment of what the program or activity is 

 accomplishing.  (For pilot projects for which 

 audited financial statements are also prepared, 

 agencies should consider including in the plan 

 performance measures from those statements.       

 Agencies should also consider including any other 

 publicly established standards of performance.) 
</UL>
 
 
<H3> * Submission of A Plan Revision and Additional 

   Content Therein* </H3> 

 
 
  Congress allows agencies to revise an annual 

 performance plan to reflect the significant effects 

 of Congressional action on the achievement of 

 performance goals.  As the FY 1994 and FY 1995 pilot 

 project performance plans were submitted either 

 during or at the start of the fiscal year, this 

 revision option was not feasible.  Thus, the FY 1996 

 performance plan is the first plan submitted 

 sufficiently in advance of the fiscal year to allow 

 this option to be exercised. 

 <P>
 
       An agency may elect to prepare and submit a 

 plan revision. If a plan revision is prepared, it 

 need only include changes from the plan submitted in 

 April, and not replicate the complete content of the 

 plan submitted in April.)  A plan revision should 

 include the following: 

 <UL>
 
       <LI> Adjustments made in the target levels of 

 achievement (as expressed in the performance goals 

 and/or indicators).  The levels in both the April 

 plan and the subsequent plan revision should be 

 presented to show the adjustment. 

 
 
       <LI> Identification of any performance goals 

 dropped from the April plan. 

 
 
       <LI>A brief summary of the nature and scope of 

 Congressional action(s) which significantly affected 

 the April plan. 

 </UL>
 
       Plans should not be revised to reflect the 

 consequences of factors or actions -- other than 

 Congressional action -- that may have occurred since 

 the April plan was prepared.  (However, see also 

 questions 2 and 7 in attachment 2 on revisions 

 resulting from OMB review of the April plan, and 

 describing the performance-related effects of 

 managerial accountability and flexibility waivers, 

 respectively.) 

 
 
<H3> * Waivers of Administrative Requirements and 

 Controls * </H3>

 
 
       GPRA specifies that annual performance plans, 

 beginning with FY 1999, are to include any requests 

 for waivers of administrative procedural 

 requirements and controls.  These future-year plans 

 are also to include endorsements of proposed waivers 

 by those agencies (other than OMB) establishing the 

 requirements.  However, during the pilot project 

 phase, requests for new waivers will be handled 

 separately from the submission and review of 

 performance plans.  Agencies designated as pilot 

 projects for managerial accountability and 

 flexibility should not submit proposed waivers of 

 administrative procedural requirements and controls 

 for FY 1996 as part of their performance plan.  (See 

 also question 7 in attachment 2 on including the 

 effects on performance resulting from approved 

 waivers.) 

 
 
 <H3>* Time-period Covered * </H3>

 
 
       The performance plan for fiscal year 1996 

 covers a 12 month period beginning on October 1, 

 1995 and ending on September 30, 1996.  The 

 measurement of actual performance compared to the 

 target levels established in the performance goals 

 and indicators should generally coincide with this 

 12 month period.  (See also question 3 in attachment 

 2 on lags in obtaining actual performance data.) 

 <P>
 
       Grouping of Goals, Indicators, and Related 

 Information  To relate performance with spending, 

 GPRA aligns the performance plans with the &quot;Program 

 by activities&quot; listing appearing in the Program and 

 Financing Schedules in the Budget Appendix.  (Each 

 listing usually contains from two to 10 or more 

 specific projects or activities.)  To make this 

 alignment, the performance goals, performance 

 indicators, and related descriptions or information 

 should be grouped according to the relevant Program 

 and Financing Schedule(s) for that pilot 

 project.  The relevant schedule(s) are those 

 containing (either all or in part) the funding 

 obligations for the individual programs and 

 activities constituting the pilot project. 

 <P>
 
       Many large-scale pilot projects will likely 

 span several schedules, and the goals and indicators 

 should be grouped and matched to the appropriate 

 schedule.  (See also question 4 in attachment 2.)  

 If a small-scale pilot project cannot be identified 

 in a &quot;Program by activities&quot; listing because it is 

 embedded within a more sizeable program, please 

 identify the specific project or activity in the 

 listing that covers the pilot project. 

 <P>
 
       For each grouping of goals and indicators, 

 please provide the Appendix page number of the 

 appropriate Program and Financing Schedule, as well 

 as the Identification Code which appears just 

 above the &quot;Program by activities&quot; heading in the 

 schedule. Please use the Budget Appendix for FY 

 1996.  (Agencies believing that the &quot;Program by 

 activities&quot; listing should be revised can request 

 changes to these listings.  See Section 11.6 (c) of 

 OMB Circular A-11.)  For those pilot projects that 

 are included in annual financial statements under 

 the Chief Financial Officers Act, please provide the 

 name of the reporting entity for which the statement 

 is prepared. 

 
 
 <H3>* Non-quantifiable Performance Goals *</H3> 

 
 
       Quantifiable measures are preferred because of 

 their objective nature.  However, if a performance 

 goal cannot be expressed in quantitative terms, GPRA 

 allows OMB to authorize the agency to use an 

 alternative, descriptive form of goal.  GPRA defines 

 one alternative form as containing separate 

 descriptive statements of (1) a minimally effective 

 program, and (2) a successful program with 

 sufficient precision and in such terms 

 that allow for an accurate, independent 

 determination of whether the program's performance 

 met the criteria of the description. Pilot project 

 agencies may use this alternative form and include 

 it in the FY 1996 performance plans, without advance 

 OMB authorization. 

 <P>
 
       GPRA also permits an agency to propose its own 

 alternative form, provided that this form also is a 

 description stated with sufficient precision and in 

 such terms that would allow an accurate, independent 

 determination to be made of whether the program's 

 performance met the criteria of the description.  

 There is no advance OMB authorization for an 

 individualized alternative form.  Pilot project 

 agencies proposing to use an individualized 

 alternative form should include this in the 

 submitted plan.  OMB authorization for the use of an 

 individualized alternative form will be provided 

 after its review of the submitted plan. 

 
 
 
 
<H3> * Strategic Plans *</H3> 

 
 
       GPRA requires a strategic plan be used when 

 preparing one or more of the performance plans 

 during the pilot period.  So that a notation can be 

 made of which of the three annual pilot project 

 plans satisfies this requirement, please indicate if 

 a strategic plan was used for the FY 1996 plan.  

 (Agencies should note that the strategic plan used 

 for this purpose need not meet all specifications 

 for the strategic plans required under GPRA to be 

 submitted to OMB by September 30, 1997.  Also, the 

 strategic plan need only cover the pilot program or 

 activity.)

<H3> Questions and Answers Regarding 

 SUBMISSION OF PILOT PROJECT PERFORMANCE PLANS</H3> 

 
 
 
 
<B> Q.1   Who should submit the agency's performance 

 plan to OMB? </B>

 <P>
 
 A.1   The plan should be submitted by the head of 

 the agency. However, at the agency's discretion, a 

 plan may be submitted by a senior official (one who 

 is appointed by the President and Senate-confirmed) 

 having direct responsibility for the programs and 

 activities covered in the plan. 

 
 <P>
<B> Q.2   After OMB reviews the FY 1996 performance 

 plans, should agencies expect to revise these FY 

 1996 plans based on this review? </B>

 <P>
 
 A.2   Requested revisions of the FY 1996 performance 

 plans will generally be confined to those plans 

 where measurement of performance appears to be 

 infeasible because of the lack of sufficient goals 

 or indicators for accomplishing such.  In these 

 cases, OMB may request the agency to revise and re- 

 submit its FY 1996 plan.  (See also question 8 on 

 withdrawing pilot project designations.)  As this is 

 the final submission of the pilot project 

 performance plans, OMB's review and critique of the 

 FY 1996 plans is being directed toward establishing 

 a foundation for the performance plans being 

 submitted in September 1997 as part of the agencies' 

 FY 1999 budget request.  (Previously, the critiques 

 emphasized changes and improvements to be 

 incorporated in the next year's pilot project plan.) 

 <P>
 
<B> Q.3   May an agency include a performance goal for 

 which it will be unable to measure actual 

 performance against that goal during the fiscal year 

 1996 time-period?</B> 

 <P>
 
 A.3   Yes.  There is often a substantial lag in 

 obtaining actual performance data for a particular 

 period.  The Congressional committees, in their 

 reports on this legislation, recognized this, and 

 made allowances for such in the content of the     

 annual program performance report.  When a lag 

 occurs, agencies should use the most current 

 relevant data (even if it is several years old), and 

 indicate, in the program performance report for FY 

 1996, approximately when the actual performance data 

 for the October 1995/September 1996 time-period will 

 be available. 

 
 
 
 <P>
 
 <B>Q.4   If a pilot project is funded under several 

 &quot;Program and Financing Schedules&quot;, and the 

 performance goals and indicators are mainly relevant 

 for only one of these schedules, should the goals 

 and indicators be arrayed against all the schedules? 
</B>
 <P>
 
 A.4   No, this is not necessary.  Agencies should 

 group performance goals and indicators against the 

 schedule that is the main source of funding for the 

 pilot project, and note only by Appendix page number 

 and identification code the other schedules that 

 provide partial funding for the pilot project.  

 Also, several agencies have indicated it may 

 be difficult to align every goal and indicator to a 

 specific schedule.  In such instances, these goals 

 and indicators should be separately grouped together 

 in the plan and note made of the reason for doing 

 so. 

 
 <P>
 <B>Q.5   How should a generic or agency-wide 

 performance goal be included in the performance 

 plan? </B>
<P>
 
 
 A.5   If an agency's performance plan contains a 

 generic performance goal (i.e., a goal applying to 

 all programs and activities of an agency, and not 

 just the pilot project), the goal should be 

 categorized as such, and presented separately from 

 the groupings of performance goals and indicators 

 that are specific to the pilot project. 

 
 <P>
<B> Q.6   Should the FY 1996 performance plan indicate 

 anticipated changes in performance goals or 

 measurement in future years?</B> 
<P>
 
 
 A.6   This is at the discretion of the agency.  

 Because the capacity to measure performance and set 

 performance goals differs between and within 

 agencies, the pilot project phase of GPRA was 

 established to give agencies time for developing 

 and improving this capacity.  The quality and scope 

 of the initial performance plans will be uneven.  An 

 agency's self-appraisal of limitations in its FY 

 1996 plan and an indication of how the FY 1999 plan 

 will likely be changed will assist OMB significantly 

 in its review and critique of the FY 1996 plans, and 

 in the discussions on various performance 

 initiatives (including GPRA implementation) to 

 be held with the agencies during the Spring 1995 

 Program Performance Review. 

 <P>
 
<B> Q.7   How should the performance plans address 

 changes in performance expected to occur as a result 

 of waivers of administrative requirements given as 

 part of a managerial accountability and flexibility 

 pilot project?</B> 

 <P>
 
 A.7   There is insufficient time between the April 

 submission date for the FY 1996 performance plans 

 and the approval of waiver requests for the 

 managerial flexibility pilots to require 

       that the effect(s) of these waivers be 

 reflected in the FY 1996 plans.  A performance 

 measurement pilot project that is also designated as 

 a managerial flexibility pilot has several options 

 for addressing the anticipated changes in 

 performance: 

 
 <OL>
       <LI>   Rely on the information provided in 

 support of the waiver request as part of the 

 managerial flexibility pilot project nomination.  

 OMB would subsequently append this information to 

 the performance plan.  (Waiver-related performance 

 information will be appended to the submitted FY 

 1995 performance plans, so that this can be covered 

 -- to the extent feasible -- in the program 

 performance reports for FY 1995.) 

 
 
      <LI>  If a revised FY 1996 performance plan is 

 prepared, include in the revised plan the 

 anticipated effects on performance from the approved 

 waivers. 

 </OL>
 
 
 
<B> Q.8   Can the designation of a pilot project end 

 before FY 1997?</B> 

 <P>
 
 A.8   Yes.  While GPRA has no specific procedure to 

 annul a designation, the number of designated 

 agencies substantially exceed the ten required by 

 the statute.  Thus, OMB will consider withdrawing 

 the designation of a pilot project that:  (a) is 

 unable to meet the GPRA requirement that a 

       strategic plan be used in preparing the 

 performance plan for at least one of the years of 

 the pilot project;  or, (b) is experiencing major 

 difficulties in establishing and expressing 

 performance goals in its plan, and is unlikely to 

 overcome these difficulties in its FY 1996 plans.  

 (Several pilot project designations were withdrawn 

 in FY 1995.) 

 <P>
 
 An agency seeking to withdraw the designation of a 

 pilot project need not submit a performance plan for 

 FY 1996 for the pilot project.  A withdrawal request 

 should be sent to OMB by April 14, 1995.  Agencies 

 considering withdrawal should discuss this in 

 advance with the cognizant OMB program division 

 staff.  OMB may also initiate discussions 

 with an agency on a possible withdrawal based on its 

 review of the FY 1994 and FY 1995 plans.

<H3> MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</H3> 

 
 
 <H3>SUBJECT: The Freedom of Information Act </H3>

 
 
 I am writing to call your attention to a subject that is of great  

 importance to the American public and to all Federal departments and   

 agencies -- the administration of the Freedom of Information Act, as   

 amended (the &quot;Act&quot;).  The Act is a vital part of the participatory system  

 of government.  I am committed to enhancing its effectiveness in my  

 Administration. 

 <P>
 
 For more than a quarter century now, the Freedom of Information Act has  

 played a unique role in strengthening our democratic form of government.   

 The statute was enacted based upon the fundamental principle that an 

 informed citizenry is essential to the democratic process and that the more  

 the American people know about their government the better they will be  

 governed.  Openness in government is essential to accountability and the  

 Act has become an integral part of that process. 

 
 <P>
 The Freedom of Information Act, moreover, has been one of the primary  

 means by which members of the public inform themselves about their  

 government.  As Vice President Gore made clear in the National Performance 

 Review, the American people are the Federal Government's customers.   

 Federal departments and agencies should handle requests for information in  

 a customer-friendly manner.  The use of the Act by ordinary citizens is not 

 complicated, nor should it be.  The existence of unnecessary bureaucratic  

 hurdles has no place in its implementation. 

 <P>
 
 I therefore call upon all Federal departments and agencies to renew their  

 commitment to the Freedom of Information Act, to its underlying principles  

 of government openness, and to its sound administration.  This is an 

 appropriate time for all agencies to take a fresh look at their  

 administration of the Act, to reduce backlogs of Freedom of Information 

 Act requests, and to conform agency practice to the new litigation guidance  

 issued by the Attorney General, which is attached. 

 
 <P>
 Further, I remind agencies that our commitment to openness requires more than 

 merely responding to requests from the public. Each agency has a  

 responsibility to distribute information on its own initiative, and to  

 enhance public access through the use of electronic information systems.   

 Taking these steps will ensure compliance with both the letter and spirit  

 of the Act. 

 <P>
 
 (s) William J. Clinton 

 
 
<HR> 

 
 
 Oct. 4, 1993 

 
 
<H3> MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</H3> 

 
 
 <H2>Subject: The Freedom of Information Act</H2> 

 
 
 President Clinton has asked each Federal department and agency to take  

 steps to ensure it is in compliance with both the letter and the 

 spirit of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.  The  

 Department of Justice is fully committed to this directive and stands 

 ready to assist all agencies as we implement this new policy. 

 
 <P>
 First and foremost, we must ensure that the principle of openness in  

 government is applied in each and every disclosure and nondisclosure  

 decision that is required under the Act.  Therefore, I hereby rescind  

 the Department of Justice's 1981 guidelines for the defense of agency  

 action in Freedom of Information Act litigation. The Department will no  

 longer defend an agency's withholding of information merely because there  

 is a &quot;substantial legal basis&quot; for doing so.  Rather, in determining whether  

 or not to defend a nondisclosure decision, we will apply a presumption of  

 disclosure. 

 
 <P>
 To be sure, the Act accommodates, through its exemption structure, the  

 countervailing interests that can exist in both disclosure and nondisclosure  

 of government information.  Yet while the Act's exceptions are designed to 

 guard against harm to governmental and private interests, I firmly believe  

 that these exemptions are best applied with specific reference to such  

 harm, and only after consideration of the reasonably expected consequences  

 of disclosure in each particular case. 

 <P>
 
 In short, it shall be the policy of the U.S.  Department of Justice to  

 defend the assertion of a FOIA exemption only in those cases where the  

 agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be harmful to an interest  

 protected by that exemption.  Where an item of information might technically  

 or arguably fall within an exemption, it ought not to be withheld from a 

 FOIA requester unless it need be. 

 <P>
 
 It is my belief that this change in policy serves the public interest by  

 achieving the Act's primary objective -- maximum responsible disclosure  

 of government information -- while preserving essential confidentiality.   

 Accordingly, I strongly encourage your FOIA officers to make &quot;discretionary  

 disclosures&quot; whenever possible under the Act.  Such disclosures are possible 

 under a number of FOIA exemptions, especially when only a governmental interest 

 would be affected.  The exemptions and opportunities for &quot;discretionary  

 disclosures&quot; are discussed in the Discretionary Disclosure and Waiver  

 section of the &quot;Justice Department Guide to the Freedom of Information Act.&quot;  

 As that discussion points out, agencies can make discretionary FOIA  

 disclosures as a matter of good public policy without concern for  

 future &quot;waiver consequences&quot; for similar information.  Such disclosures can  

 also readily satisfy an agency's &quot;reasonable segregation&quot; obligation under  

 the Act in connection with marginally exempt information, see 5 U.S.C.  

 552(b), and can lessen an agency's administrative burden at all levels of  

 the administrative process and in litigation.  I note that this policy is  

 not intended to create any substantive or procedural rights enforceable at  

 law. 

 <P>
 
 In connection with the repeal of the 1981 guidelines, I am requesting that  

 the Assistant Attorneys General for the Department's Civil and Tax  

 Divisions, as well as the United States Attorneys, undertake a review of  

 the merits of all pending FOIA cases handled by them, according to the  

 standards set forth above.  The Department's litigating attorneys will  

 strive to work closely with your general counsels and their litigation  

 staffs to implement this new policy on a case-by-case basis.  The  

 Department's office of Information and Privacy can also be called upon for 

 assistance in this process, as well as for policy guidance to agency  

 FOIA officers. 

 
 <P>
 In addition, at the Department of Justice we are undertaking a complete  

 review and revision of our regulations implementing the FOIA, all related  

 regulations pertaining to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as well as 

 the Department's disclosure policies generally.  We are also planning to  

 conduct a Department-wide &quot;FOIA Form Review.&quot; Envisioned is a comprehensive 

  review of all standard FOIA forms and correspondence utilized by 

 the Justice Department's various components.  These items will be reviewed  

 for their correctness, completeness, consistency and particularly for  

 their use of clear language.  As we conduct this review, we will be  

 especially mindful that FOIA requesters are users of a government service,  

 participants in an administrative process, and constituents of our  

 democratic society.  I encourage you to do likewise at your departments  

 and agencies. 

 <P>
 
 Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to raise with you the  

 longstanding problem of administrative backlogs under the Freedom of 

 Information Act.  Many Federal departments and agencies are often unable  

 to meet the Act's ten-day time limit for processing FOIA requests, and  

 some agencies -- especially those dealing with high-volume demands for 

 particularly sensitive records -- maintain large FOIA backlogs greatly  

 exceeding the mandated time period.  The reasons for this may vary, 

 but principally it appears to be a problem of too few resources in the  

 face of too heavy a workload.  This is a serious problem -- one of 

 growing concern and frustration to both FOIA requesters and Congress, and  

 to agency FOIA officers as well. 

 
 <P>
 It is my hope that we can work constructively together, with Congress and  

 the FOIA-requester community, to reduce backlogs during the coming year.   

 To ensure that we have a clear and current understanding of the situation,  

 I am requesting that each of you send to the Department's Office of  

 Information and Privacy a copy of your agency's Annual FOIA Report to  

 Congress for 1992.  Please include with this report a letter describing the  

 extent of any present FOIA backlog, FOIA staffing difficulties and any  

 other observations in this regard that you believe would be helpful. 

 <P>
 
 In closing, I want to reemphasize the importance of our cooperative efforts  

 in this area.  The American public's understanding of the workings of  

 its government is a cornerstone of our democracy.  The Department of  

 Justice stands prepared to assist all federal agencies as we make 

 government throughout the executive branch more open, more responsive,  

 and more accountable. 

 <P>
 
 /s/ Janet Reno

Title:  Presidential Memorandum, Env. Justice for Minorty Populations <BR>

Author:  The White House<BR>

<P> For Immediate Release <BR>
 February 11, 1994 

<HR>

 <H2> MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF ALL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</H2> 

  <H3>SUBJECT: Executive Order on Federal Actions to Address Environmental  

  Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations </H3>

   

  Today I have issued an Executive Order on Federal Actions to Address  

  Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income  

  Populations.  That order is designed to focus Federal attention on  

  the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities  

  and low-income communities with the goal of achieving environmental  

  justice.  That order is also intended to promote nondiscrimination in  

  Federal programs substantially affecting human health and the  

  environment, and to provide minority communities and low-income  

  communities access to public information on, and an opportunity for  

  public participation in, matters relating to human health or the  

  environment. 

   <P>

  The purpose of this separate memorandum is to underscore certain  

  provision of existing law that can help ensure that all communities  

  and persons across this Nation live in a safe and healthful  

  environment.  Environmental and civil rights statutes provide many  

  opportunities to address environmental hazards in minority  

  communities and-low-income communities.  Application of these  

  existing statutory provisions is an important part of this  

  Administration's efforts to prevent those minority communities and  

  low-income communities from being subject to disproportionately high  

  and adverse environmental effects. 

   <P>

  I am therefore today directing that all department and agency heads  

  take appropriate and necessary steps to ensure that the following  

  specific directives are implemented immediately: 

   <P>

  In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, each  

  Federal agency shall ensure that all programs or activities receiving  

  Federal financial assistance that affect human health or the  

  environment do not directly, or through contractual or other  

  arrangements, use criteria, methods, or practices that discriminate  

  on the basis of race, color, or national origin. 

   <P>

  Each Federal agency shall analyze the environmental effects,  

  including human health, economic and social effects, of Federal  

  actions, including effects on minority communities and low-income  

  communities, when such analysis is required by the National  

  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S;C. section 4321  

  et esq.  Mitigation measures outlined or analyzed in an environmental  

  assessment, environmental impact statement,, or record of decision,  

  whenever feasible, should address significant and adverse  

  environmental effects of proposed Federal actions on minority  

  communities and low-income communities.  

   <P>

  Each Federal agency shall provide opportunities for community input 

  in the NEPA process, including identifying potential effects and  

  mitigation measures in consultation with affected communities and  

  improving the accessibility of meetings, crucial documents, and 

  notices. 

   <P>

  The Environmental Protection Agency, when reviewing environmental  

  effects of proposed action of other Federal agencies under section  

  309 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. section 7609, shall ensure that  

  the involved agency has fully analyzed environmental effects on  

  minority communities and low-income communities, including human  

  health, social, and economic effects. 

   <P>

  Each Federal agency shall ensure that the public, including minority  

  communities and low-income communities, has adequate access to public  

  information relating to human health or environmental planning,  

  regulations, and enforcement when required under the Freedom of  

  Information Act, 5 U.S.C. section 552, the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C.  

  section 552b, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know  

  Act, 42 U.S.C. section 11044. 

   
<P>
   

   

  This memorandum is intended only to improve the internal management  

  of the Executive Branch and is not intended to, nor does it create,  

  any right, benefit, or trust responsibility, substantive or  

  procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the  

  United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person. 

   

   
<P>

  For Immediate Release    <BR>
                          April 26, 1994 

   

   

 <H3> MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</H3> 

   

  <H3>SUBJECT: Environmentally and Economically Beneficial  

           Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds </H3>


  The report of the National Performance Review contains  

  recommendations for a series of environmental actions, including one  

  to increase environmentally and economically beneficial landscaping  

  practices at Federal facilities and federally funded projects.   

  Environmentally beneficial landscaping entails utilizing techniques  

  that complement and enhance the local environment and seek to  

  minimize the adverse effects that the landscaping will have on it.   

  In particular, this means using regionally native plants and  

  employing landscaping practices and technologies that conserves water  

  and prevent pollution. 

   <P>

  These landscaping practices should benefit the environment, as well  

  as generate long-term cost savings for the Federal Government.  For  

  example, the use of native plants not only protects our natural  

  heritage and provides wildlife habitat, but also can reduce  

  fertilizer, pesticide, and irrigation demands and their associated  

  costs because native plants are suited to the local environment and  

  climate. 

   <P>

  Because the Federal Government owns and landscapes large areas of  

  land, our stewardship presents a unique opportunity to provide  

  leadership in this area and to develop practical and cost- effective  

  methods to preserve and protect that which has been entrusted to us.   

  Therefore, for Federal grounds, Federal projects, and federally  

  funded projects, I direct that agencies shall, where cost-effective  

  and to the extent practicable: 

   <OL type=a>

       <LI> use regionally native plants for landscaping; 

   

    <LI>design, use, or promote construction practices that minimize  

  adverse effects on the natural habitat; 

   

      <LI> seek to prevent pollution by, among other things, reducing  

  fertilizer and pesticide use, using integrated pest management  

  techniques, recycling green waste, and minimize runoff.  Landscaping  

  practices that reduce the use of toxic chemicals provide one approach  

  for agencies to reach reduction goals established in Executive Order  

  No. 12856, &quot;Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution  

  Prevention Requirements;&quot; 

   

       <LI> implem ent water-efficient practices, such as  the use of  

  mulches, effective irrigation systems, audits to determine exact  

  landscaping water-use needs, and recycled or reclai med water and the  

  selecting and siting of plants in a manner that conserves water  and  

  controls soil erosion.  Landscaping practices, such as planting  

  regionally native shade trees around buildings to reduce air  

  conditioning demands, can also provide innovative measures to meet  

  the energy consumption reduction goal established in Executive Order  

  No. 12902, &quot;Energy Efficient and Water Conservation ar Federal  

  Facilities;&quot; and 

   

     <LI> create outdoor de monstrations incorporating native plants,  

  as well as pollution prevention and water conservation techniques, to  

  promote awareness of the   environmental and economic benefits of  

  implementing this directive.  Agencies are encouraged to develop  

  other methods for sharing information on landscaping advances with  

  interested nonfederal parties. 

   </OL>

  In order to assist agencies in implementing this directive, the  

  Federal Environmental Executive shall: 

   <OL type=a>

      <LI> establish an  interagency working group to develop  

  recommendations for guidance, including compliance with the  

  requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.  

  4321, 4331-4335, and 4341-4347, and training needs to implement this  

  directive.  The recommendations are to be developed by November 1994;  

  and 

   

      <LI> issue the guidance by April 1995.  To the extent  

  practicable, agencies shall incorporate this guidance into their  

  landscaping programs and practices by February 1996. 

   </OL>

  In addition, the Federal Environmental Executive shall establish  

  annual awards to recognize outstanding landscaping efforts of  

  agencies and individual employees.  Agencies are encouraged to  

  recognize exceptional performances in the implementation of this  

  directive through their awards programs. 

   
<P>
  Agencies shall advise the Federal Environmental Executive by April  

  1996 on their progress in implementing this directive. 

   <P>

  To enhance landscaping options and awareness, the Department of  

  Agriculture shall conduct research on the suitability, propagation,  

  and use of native plants for landscaping.  The Department shall make  

  available to agencies and the public the results of this research.   

   

   

 
 <P>
 
 
 
 
                                        William J.Clinton

<H2>MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS<BR> AND  AGENCIES, THE PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT COUNCIL</H2> 



<H3>SUBJECT: Continued Commitment to Small, Small Disadvantaged,  

and Small Women-Owned Businesses in Federal Procurement</H3> 



It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair  

proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small  

disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses.  Such   

businesses should also have the maximum practicable  

opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts  

awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient  

contract performance.  I am committed to the continuation of  

this policy.  Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of  

various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and  

section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)),  

as necessary to achieve this policy objective. 

<P>

The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 authorizes  

civilian agencies to utilize set-aside procurements for  

small disadvantaged businesses.  The Act also, for the first  

time, establishes goals for contracting with small women- 

owned businesses.  These provisions, along with others in  

the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government  

business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and  

small women-owned businesses.  Department and agency heads  

should ensure that efforts to streamline acquisition  

procedures encourage the participation of these businesses  

in Federal procurements. 

<P>

This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register. 

<P>

                     WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Title: Presidential Memorandum, Improving Customer Service 
<BR>
 Author: White House Ofc. of the Press Secretary

 <H2 align=center>THE WHITE HOUSE 

 Office of the Press Secretary</H2> 

<HR>

 For Immediate Release 
<BR>
 March 23, 1995 
<BR>
 
 
 
 
<H3> MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND 

 AGENCIES</H3> 

 <P>
 
 <H3>SUBJECT:       Improving Customer Service</H3> 

 
 
 
 
 In the first phase of this Administration's 

 reinventing government initiative, I established the 

 principle that government must be customer-driven.  

 Executive Order No. 12862, &quot;Setting Customer Service 

 Standards,&quot; called for a revolution within the 

 Federal Government to change the way it does 

 business.  The initial agency responses to that 

 order, including the service standards published in 

 September 1994, have begun the process of 

 establishing a more customer-focused 

 government.  For the first time, the Federal 

 Government's customers have been told what they have 

 a right to expect when they ask for service. 

 
 
 In the second phase of reinventing government 

 (&quot;Phase II&quot;), this effort should be continued and 

 integrated with other restructuring activities. 

 The first question agency restructuring teams should 

 ask is whether a program or function is critical to 

 the agency's missions based on &quot;customer&quot; input.  To 

 carry out this Phase II effort and assure that 

 government puts the customer first, I am now 

 directing the additional steps set forth in this 

 memorandum. 

 <P>
 
      Actions.  The agencies covered by Executive 

 Order No. 12862 are directed as follows: 

 
 <OL>
      <LI>  In order to continue customer service 

 reform, agencies shall treat the requirements of 

 Executive Order No. 12862 as continuing 

 requirements.  The actions the order prescribes, 

 such as surveying customers, surveying employees, 

 and benchmarking, shall be continuing agency 

 activities.  The purpose of these actions will 

 remain as indicated in Executive Order No. 12862 -- 

 the establishment and implementation of customer 

 service standards to guide the operations of 

 the executive branch. 

 
 
      <LI>  Agencies shall, by September 1, 1995, 

 complete the publication of customer service 

 standards, in a form readily available to customers, 

 for all operations that deliver significant services 

 directly to the public.  This shall include services 

 that are delivered in partnership with State and 

 local governments, services delivered by small 

 agencies and regulatory agencies, and customer 

 services of enforcement agencies. 

 
 
      <LI>  Agencies shall, on an ongoing basis, 

 measure results achieved against the customer 

 service standards and report those results to 

 customers at least annually.  Reports should be in 

 terms readily understood by individual customers.  

 Public reports shall be made beginning no later than 

 September 15, 1995.  Measurement systems should 

 include objective measures wherever possible, but 

 should also include customer satisfaction as a 

 measure.  Customer views should be obtained 

 to determine whether standards have been set on what 

 matters most to the customer.  Agencies should 

 publish replacement standards if needed to 

 reflect these views. 

 
 
       <LI>  Development and tracking of customer 

 service measures, standards, and performance should 

 be integrated with other performance initiatives, 

 including Phase II restructuring.  Customer service 

 standards also should be related to legislative 

 activities, including strategic planning and  

 performance measure- ment under the Government 

 Performance and Results Act of 1993, reporting on 

 financial and program performance under the Chief 

 Financial Officers Act of 1990, and the Government 

 Management and Reform Act of 1994.  Operating plans, 

 regulations and guidelines, training programs, and 

 personnel classification and evaluation systems 

 should be aligned with a customer focus. 

 
 
      <LI>  Agencies shall continue to survey employees 

 on ideas to improve customer service, take action to 

 motivate and recognize employees for meeting or 

 exceeding customer service standards, and for 

 promoting customer service.  Without satisfied 

 employees, we cannot have satisfied customers. 

 
 
      <LI>  Agencies should initiate and support 

 actions that cut across agency lines to serve shared 

 customer groups.  Agencies should take steps to 

 develop cross-agency, one-stop service to customer 

 groups, so their customers do not needlessly go from 

 one agency to another.  Where possible, these steps 

 should take advantage of new information technology 

 tools to achieve results. 

 </OL>
 
 The standard of quality we seek from these actions 

 and the Executive order is customer service for the 

 American people that is equal to the best in 

 business. 

 <P>
 
      Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are 

 requested to adhere to this directive. 

 <P>
 
      Judicial Review.  This directive is for the 

 internal management of the executive branch and does 

 not create any right or benefit, substantive or 

 procedural, enforceable by a party against the 

 United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, 

 its officers or employees, or any other person.

<H2> Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less</H2> 

 
 
 <H3>Regulatory Reform <BR>

 
 
 A Fair, Open, Streamlined Process </H3>
</Center>
<HR>

 
 
 Reforming our regulatory process is critical to creating a government 

 that works better and costs less. Improving budget, personnel, and 

 procurement systems will strip away a lot of red tape. But thousands of 

 outdated, overlapping regulations will still remain in other areas -- inside 

 and outside the government -- unless we act aggressively to reform the 

 regulatory system. That system now is cumbersome and fails to ensure 

 that rules issued are necessary and effective. What's needed, and what we 

 propose, are sensible planning and a thorough, focused review of 

 regulations to end the proliferation of unnecessary and unproductive rules. 

 <P>
 
 This reform has already begun. President Clinton directed agencies to 

 eliminate 50 percent of all internal regulations when he signed an 

 executive order September 11 that was recommended by the National 

 Performance Review. The next step is reforming the regulatory review 

 process and eliminating outdated, obsolete, and duplicative regulations 

 that affect people outside of government.  The executive order the 

 President signs September 30, will do just that and create a regulatory 

 review process that works better while still providing needed health, 

 safety, and environmental safeguards. The President also will direct each 

 agency to review its internal procedures for developing and issuing 

 regulations. 

 <P>
 
 President Clinton is offering real reform.  He shut down the 

 Competitiveness Council during his first days in office, closing the back 

 door special interests used to get out from under regulations they didn't 

 like. In its place, President Clinton offers a regulatory review process that 

 is dramatically different: open to the public, streamlined, responsive, 

 coordinated, straightforward, and fair. 

 <P>
 
 <H3>Putting People First</H3> 

 <P>
 
 The President's plan provides a regulatory process that works for the 

 American people,  improving health, safety and well-being while 

 encouraging economic growth, competitiveness, and job creation. It is 

 aimed at producing regulations that are cost-effective, consistent, and 

 understandable. And, it takes away the unfair advantage special interests 

 enjoyed in the past thanks to the Competitiveness Council. 

 <P>
 
 Consider just a few examples of the Competitiveness Council's work: 

 meeting secretly with builders to undermine implementation of the fair 

 housing accessibility law that prohibits discriminatory housing practices; 

 blocking a rule banning the burning of lead acid car batteries (the single 

 largest source of lead emissions), an action later overturned by a federal 

 court;  and allowing a major pharmaceutical company to review a proposed 

 drug-approval policy before it was made public. 

 <P>
 
 Under this new Executive Order, there will be no special access for 

 special interests. The review process will exist only to resolve 

 intergovernmental disputes, not to provide an avenue for special 

 interest appeals of regulatory decisions.  Decisions on rules will be based 

 on the public record, not on political paybacks. During the review process, 

 outside contacts will be on the record and the status of regulations will be 

 public knowledge. Rules will be reviewed at the Vice Presidential level 

 only at the request of an agency head or the Office of Management and 

 Budget. 

 <P>
 
 <H3>Eliminating Regulatory Overkill </H3>

 <P>
 
 President Clinton's regulatory review reforms reflect his commitment 

 to ensuring that executive branch agencies produce effective and sensible 

 regulations, relieving businesses of unnecessary regulatory burdens and 

 ending special access for special interests.  The process created by the 

 executive order will ensure that agencies regulate only when necessary 

 and makes clear that alternatives, such as market incentives, are 

 preferable to command-and-control regulations. A regulatory working 

 group of representatives from agencies with major domestic regulatory 

 responsibility will meet regularly to consider new, creative, and more 

 effective alternatives and approaches to regulating. And , when regulations 

 are needed, the order will ensure that they are designed and implemented 

 in the most cost-effective manner, so as to maximize benefits to society 

 and to place the smallest necessary burden on those being regulated.  The 

 President's plan uses a sensible, balanced definition of costs and benefits to 

 ensure a realistic assessment of impacts on the economy, the environment, 

 and public health and safety. 

 <P>
 
 <H3>Sensible Planning</H3> 

 
 <P>
 President Clinton's plan will streamline the regulatory review process, 

 open it up to the public, improve planning and coordination, 

 ensure more agency and public involvement at the beginning of the 

 process (instead of simply at the end), and provide for the review of 

 duplicative or outdated regulations. A new planning process that starts at 

 the beginning of rule making will improve inter-agency coordination and 

 help ensure a clear and common understanding of innovative and effective 

 regulatory approaches across the government.  This process provides early 

 guidance about administration priorities, minimizing conflicts and 

 inconsistent regulatory activities among agencies. Agencies will set 

 priorities and assemble annual regulatory plans, improving their own 

 planing and ensuring that other agencies and the public are informed of 

 their activities. And, the new process will help agencies craft alternatives 

 to command-and-control regulations. In many cases, such advance 

 planning can remove the need for federal mandates. 

 
 <P>
 
 
<H3> Reviewing New Regulations</H3> 

 <P>
 
 The executive order recognizes the primacy of agencies in the 

 regulatory review process. It also makes clear that the Office of 

 Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) will be the central, day-today 

 entity in the process of reviewing, not writing, federal regulations. And 

 that process will be conducted in the open. There will be public disclosure 

 of OIRA's meetings with people outside the Executive Branch and the 

 status of regulations, including whether there is Presidential or Vice 

 Presidential review.  OIRA and the agencies will prepare and make public 

 written explanations of any differences between their views on particular 

 regulations. And, any  changes  made to regulations during the OIRA 

 review process will be made public. 

 
 <P>
 
 
 The OIRA review process will be more focused and streamlined 

 because OIRA will be authorized to review only the most significant 

 regulations, not every regulation, as the current system allows.  This will 

 ensure that OIRA reviews fewer regulations. Its review will be more 

 credible because it will  consider a broad definition of costs and benefits to 

 include a realistic assessment of impacts on the economy, the environment, 

 and public health and safety. And, its review will be timely, driven by 

 clear and appropriate time limits on review that will prevent delay from 

 effectively killing important protections or creating uncertainty that 

 disrupts business planning cycles. 

 <P>
 
<H3> Reviewing Existing Regulations</H3> 

 <P>
 
 Too often, cumulative and unnecessary regulations hamper economic 

 growth and job creation. We will begin an ongoing review of existing 

 regulations so that those that are cumulative, obsolete, duplicative, or 

 inconsistent will be identified for reconsideration and, where appropriate, 

 revision or elimination. This process is carefully structured to ensure that 

 it is meaningful and that it produces results. The agencies will be asked to 

 prepare a specific program for ongoing review of existing regulations and 

 laws mandating such regulations, and to receive comments from the public 

 about regulations to be reviewed. *In addition, the Vice President, in 

 consultation with the White House policy advisors, will conduct reviews of 

 existing regulations with a cross-agency perspective, and may identify 

 regulations to the agency for appropriate review.* 

 <P>
 
<H3> Resolving Disputes</H3> 

 <P>
 
 A clear and open process for resolving the rare regulatory disputes 

 that develop between agencies or OMB and an agency will replace the 

 inconsistent and closed-door process of the past.  Such disputes will be 

 reviewed by the President or the Vice President only at the request of an 

 agency head or the Office of Management and Budget. The President and 

 Vice President will not intervene at the request of private parties, be they 

 from business or from public interest communities.  The Vice President, 

 aided by the White House policy advisors, will advise the President in 

 resolving these disputes. 

 <P>
 
<H3> Enhanced Accountability</H3> 

 <P>
 
 Openness is the best way to restore credibility to the regulatory review 

 process. The new process encourages more public participation in the 

 development and promulgation of regulations. It encourages agencies to 

 consult with the public before taking any regulatory actions. The process 

 also encourages the development of regulations through the use of 

 negotiated rulemaking, a consensual mechanism for developing new 

 regulations. The President will direct each agency to identify, within 90 

 days, at least one rulemaking which the agency will, within the upcoming 

 year, develop through the use of negotiated rulemaking or explain why 

 this process will not be feasible. The new executive order also makes clear 

 that the public should be afforded a meaningful opportunity to comment 

 on proposed regulations. 

 <P>
 
 The OIRA review process will be open and timely. And, the order 

 makes clear that it is OIRA that is responsible for the review of individual 

 regulations and that review must occur within tight time limits. To ensure 

 that the process  is more selective and streamlined, OIRA will be directed 

 to report to the Vice President and President  its review activities during 

 the first six months under these new procedures. This report will include a 

 list of the regulatory actions reviewed by OIRA; whether OIRA selected the 

 action for review; and the time dedicated to review. 

 
 <P>
 The new process also ensures that the White House no longer serves as 

 a conduit for special interests. The back-room, closed-door 

 operations of the Competitiveness Council have left a legacy of mistrust 

 that can only be erased by an open, fair, and balanced process. The 

 President's plan provides a clear statement describing the review process 

 and comprehensive disclosure provisions for greater public accountability. 

 The concerns and interests of outside parties must be on the record, in 

 writing, to be considered by White House staff  in the rulemaking or 

 review process. 

 <P>
 
 The new executive order revokes existing orders on regulatory review. 

 In addition, the Administration will undertake a thorough review of the 

 related orders, for example, on takings,  federalism, and civil justice reform 

 to determine what action, if any, should be taken with respect to those 

 orders.

<H2 Align=center> MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS<BR> 

 AND AGENCIES - THE PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT COUNCIL</H2> 

 
 
<H3> Subject:  Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce</H3> 

 
 
 The Federal Government spends &#036;200 billion annually buying goods and 

 services.  Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the 

 current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, 

 and reduces Federal workforce productivity.  Moving to an electronic 

 commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will 

 promote customer service and cost-effectiveness.  The electronic exchange 

 of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal 

 Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal 

 contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently 

 doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well 

 as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult 

 under the current system.  For these reasons, I am committed to 

 fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government 

 buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is 

 implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible. 

 <P>
 <OL>
 <LI>  Objectives. <BR>

 
 
 The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to: <BR>

  <OL type=a>
 
 <LI>	exchange procurement information -- such as 

 solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and 

 other contractual documents -- electronically between the private sector 

 and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical; 

 
 
  <LI> provide businesses, including small, small 

     disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to 

     Federal procurement opportunities. 

 
 
 <LI>ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified 

     access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system; 

 
 
 <LI>employ nationally and internationally recognized data 

     formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; 

 and 

 
 
 <LI> use agency and industry standards and networks to 

     enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information 

     and access Federal procurement data. 

  </OL>
 
 <LI>  Implementation.<BR>

 
 
 The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of 

 Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and 

 in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical 

 and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, 

 management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic 

 commerce in the executive branch through the following actions: 

 <OL type=a>
 
  <LI> by March 1994, define the architecture for the 

     Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify 

     executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, 

     implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system; 

 
 
 <LI> by September 1994, establish an initial electronic 

     commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private 

     vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, 

     quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide 

     implementation; 

 
 
 <LI> by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic 

     commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic 

     payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and 

 
 
 <LI> by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic  

     commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent  

     possible. 

 </OL>
 
 This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable. 

 <P>
 
 The head of each executive department or agency shall: 

 
 <OL type=a>
  <LI>ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget  

     levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective  

     department or agency; 

 
 
 <LI> assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic  

     commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules  

     established herein; and 

 
 
 <LI> designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's  

     Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development  

     and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each  

     respective department or agency. 
</OL>
 
 
 <LI>	No Private Rights Created 

 
 
 This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and 

 does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 

 by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 

 officers or employees, or any other person. 

 </OL>
 
 The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and 

 directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

 <HR>
 
 
<H2> MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</H2> 

 
 
<H3> SUBJECT:  Streamlining the Bureaucracy </H3>

 
 
 Consistent with the National Performance Review's recommendation to 

 reduce the executive branch civilian work force by 252,000, or not less 

 than 12 percent, by the close of fiscal year 1999, I hereby direct each head 

 of an executive department or agency to prepare, as a first step, a 

 streamlining plan to be submitted to the Director of the Office of 

 Management and Budget not later than December 1, 1993. 

 <P>
 
 The streamlining plans shall be prepared in accordance with the following: 
<OL>
 <LI>  Each executive department's and agency's plans should address, among 

 other things, the means by which it will reduce the ratio of managers and 

 supervisors to other personnel, with a goal of reducing the percentage who 

 are supervisors or managers in halving the current ratio within 5 years. 

 
 
 <LI>  The streamlining plans should be characterized by: 

 (a) delegation of authority, (b) decentralization, (c) empowerment of 

 employees to make decisions, and (d) mechanisms to hold managers and 

 employees accountable for their performance. 

 
 
 <LI>  Each plan shall address ways to reduce overcontrol and 

 micromanagement that now generate &quot;red tape&quot; and hamper efficiency in 

 the Federal Government.  Each streamlining plan should also propose 

 specific measures to simplify the internal organization and administrative 

 processes of the department or agency. 

 
 
 <LI>  The streamlining plans should further seek to realize cost savings, 

 improve the quality of Government services, and raise the morale and 

 productivity of the department or agency. 

 
 
 <LI> All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to 

 comply with the provisions of this memorandum. 

 </OL
 
 The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and 

 directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

   <H3>SUBJECT:  THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNITY ENTERPRISE BOARD</H3> 

    

    

   The Vice President and I strongly believe that the best way to serve  

   distressed communities in urban and rural America is through a  

   comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated approach that combines  

   bottom-up initiatives and private sector innovations with responsive  

   Federal-State support.  Today, I direct the Federal agencies to work  

   cooperatively to implement this approach in a way that reflects the  

   principles of the Vice president's National Performance Review--i.e.,  

   meeting the needs of local communities through a performance-measured,  

   customer-driven philosophy and a cross-agency approach.  I also hereby  

   establish the President's Community Enterprise Board (&quot;Board&quot;) to  

   advise and assist me in coordinating across agencies the various  

   Federal programs available (or potentially available) to distressed  

   communities and in developing further policies related to the  

   successful implementation of our community empowerment efforts. 

 
 <P>
   The Vice President has agreed to chair this board, and the Assistant  

   to the President for Domestic Policy and the Assistant to the  

   President for Economic Policy have agreed to serve as Vice-Chairs of  

   the Board.  I request the following Administration officials to serve  

   on this board:  the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General,  

   the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the  

   Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health  

   and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,  

   the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Education, the  

   Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of  

   National Drug Control Policy, the Administrator of the Small Business  

   Administration, the Director of the office of Management and Budget,  

   and the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. 

    <P>

   The first task of the Board is to assist in the successful  

  implementation of the Administration's empowerment zone legislation,  

  Subchapter C of Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  

  of 1993, Public Law 103-66, &quot;Empowerment Zones, Enterprise  

  Communities, and Rural Development Investment Areas.&quot; This Act  

  authorizes the Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture to designate  

  certain localities as empowerment zones and enterprise communities,  

  thus enabling them to receive  certain Federal funds and other  

  benefits from the Federal Government. 

    
<P>
   Other programs, old and new, are similarly beneficial to local  

  communities.  These programs, however, form an overly complex,  

  categorical, unworkable, and ineffective response to the needs of  

  distressed communities.  I hereby direct the Board to review these  

  programs in order to ascertain how we can make the entire Federal  

  effort more responsive to the needs of distressed communities.  In  

  addition, with respect to the empowerment zones and enterprise  

  communities, I direct the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney  

  General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture,  

  the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of  

  Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban  

  Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of  

  Education, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  

  the Director of National Drug Control Policy, and the Administrator  

  of the Small Business Administration to (1) identify, within 15 days  

  of this directive, existing programs that further the goals and  

  objectives set forth in this memorandum and the Act and (2) make  

  available, to the extent permitted by law, funds from those programs  

  for use in implementing the strategic plans of the designated  

  empowerment zones and community enterprises. 

    <P>

   In order to advise and assist me regarding issues that relate to 

   community development and empowerment, I request that each Board 

   member: 

    <OL type=a>

       <LI> Provide me with recommendations, consistent with Section  

  13301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (&quot;OBRA&quot; or  

  &quot;the Act&quot;), on the criteria to be used for selection and designation  

  of empowerment zones and enterprise communities, as set forth in  

  Section 13301 of the Act; 

    

     <LI>  Identify additional legislative mandates that further the  

  goals and objectives set forth in this memorandum and the Act and,  

  where appropriate, develop for my consideration recommendations for  

  further action; 

    

       <LI>   Identify legislative mandates that may be impeding State,  

  local, and tribal governments from meeting the goals and objectives  

  set forth in this memorandum and the Act, and, where appropriate,  

  develop for my consideration recommendations for 

   further action; and 

    

  <LI>  Consult with the Board regarding exemptions from  

  regulatory mandates for which the member agency has jurisdiction and  

  inform his or her decisions regarding any such exemptions with the  

  recommendations of the Board. 

    
</OL>
   In addition, I direct each of the agencies to cooperate fully. with  

  the Chair, the Vice-Chairs, and the Secretaries of HUD and  

  Agriculture in assisting designated zones and enterprise communities  

  in successfully implementing their strategic plans under Section  

  13301 of the Act.  This interagency effort shall, among other things,  

  coordinate Federal assistance and support within each empowerment  

  zone and enterprise community. 

    <P>

   In order to meet the goals and objectives set forth above, I also  

  request the Secretary of HUD and the Secretary of Agriculture to  

  consult with the Board regarding (1) the designation, under Section  

  13301 of the Act, of empowerment zones and enterprise communities and  

  (2) possible revocation of designations, as set forth in Section  

  13301 of the Act. 

    <P>

   Finally, I direct the Secretaries of HUD, Agriculture, and HHS (in  

  consultation with the Board) to take, by November 1, 1993, the  

  appropriate regulatory measures to ensure that the use of all Title  

  XX grants awarded under the Act meets the-criteria of Section 13761  

  of the Act, including, specifically, that portion of Subsection C  

  that requires, among other things, localities to use Title XX grants  

  (1) in accordance with the strategic plans approved by the  

  Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture, (2) for activities that directly  

  benefit the residents within the designated empowerment zones and  

  enterprise communities, and (3) to promote economic independence for  

  low-income families and individuals. 

    <P>

   With the Board members' commitment to achieving community  

  empowerment and to providing our local communities with a single  

  Federal forum, we will be able to assist distressed communities and  

  American families all across urban and rural America in obtaining  

  economic self-sufficiency. 

    

    

    <P>

    

    

    

   WILLIAM J. CLINTON

March 4, 1995</H3>


MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES<P>

SUBJECT:       Regulatory Reinvention Initiative<P>
<HR>
Last week, I announced this Administration's plans for further reform of the Federal regulatory
system.  This is a central part of reinventing our Government.  All Americans want the benefits
of effective regulation: clean water, safe workplaces, wholesome food, sound financial
institutions.  But, too often the rules are drafted with such detailed lists of dos and don'ts that the
objectives they seek to achieve are undermined.  Clear goals and cooperation would work better. 
Too often, businesses, especially small ones, face a profusion of overlapping and sometimes
conflicting rules.<P>

We have already made real progress in reform regulation.  This memorandum will build on the
regulatory philosophy set forth in Executive Order No. 12866 of September 30, 1993,
"Regulatory Planning and Review," Which is premised on the recognition of the legitimate role
of government to govern, but to do so in a focused, tailored, and sensible way.<P>

In the year and half since that order was signed, we have opened the rulemaking process to the
public, we have increased cooperation and coordination among the Federal agencies, and we
have seen good processes produce good decisions.<P>

However, not all agencies have taken the steps necessary to implement regulatory reform.  To
reaffirm and implement the principles of Executive Order No. 12866, regulatory reform must be
a top priority.<P>

Accordingly, I direct you to focus on the following four steps, which are an integral part of our
ongoing Regulatory Reform Initiative.<P>

<U>FIRST:      CUT OBSOLETE REGULATIONS</U><P>

I direct you to conduct a page-by-page review of all of your agency regulations now in force and
elimate or revise those that are outdated or otherwise in need of reform.  Your review should
include careful consideration of at least the following issues:
<UL>

<LI>Is this regulation obsolete?

<LI>Could its intended goal be achieved in more efficient, less intrusive ways?

<LI>Are there better private sector alternatives, such as market mechanisms, that can better achieve
the public good envisioned by the regulation?

<LI>Could private business, setting its own standards and being subject to public accountability, do
the job as well?

<LI>Could the States or local governments do the job, making Federal regulation unnecessary?
</UL>
This review should build on the work already being done by your agencies under section 5 of
Executive Order No. 12866.<P>

Your regulatory review task force should be headed by one of your appointees who should be
given your full support and should, to the extent practicable, be freed of other duties.<P>

I further direct you to deliver to me by June 1 a list of regulations that you plan to eliminate or
modify with a copy of the report sent to Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).  The list should distinguish between the regulations that can be
modified or eliminated administratively and those that require legislative authority for
modification or elimination.<P>

<U>SECOND:     REWARD RESULTS, NOT RED TAPE</U><P>


I direct you to change the way you measure the performance of both your agency and your
frontline regulators so as to focus on results, not process and punishment.  For example,
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspectors should not be evaluated by
the number of citations they write, nor should officials of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission be judged by the number of boxes of consumer goods that are detained in shipment. 
This change in measurement should involve a two-step process.<P>

First, you should identify appropriate performance measures and prepare a draft in clear,
understandable terms, of the results you are seeking to achieve through your regulatory program. 
The draft should be circulated to frontline regulators for review and comment.  This is the same
work needed to meet the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.<P>

Second, you should evaluate and reward employees based on the realization of those
meaures/goals.<P>

By no later than June 1, I direct you to (a) eliminate all internal personnel performance measures
based on process (number of visits made, etc.), and punishment (number of violations found,
amout of fines levied, etc.), and (b) provide to the National Peformance Reviews (NPR) staff a
catalogue of the changes that you are making in existing internal performance evaluations to
reward employees.  You should also provide material describing shifts in resource allocation
from enforcement to compliance.<P>

<U>THIRD:     GET OUT OF WASHINGTON AND CREATE GRASSROOTS PARTNERSHIPS</U><P>

I direct you to promptly convene groups consisting of frontline regulators and the people affected
by their regulations.  These conversations should take place around the country -- at our cleanup
sites, our factories, our ports.<P>

I further direct you to submit a schedule of your planned meetings to the NPR staff by March 30
and work with NPR in following through on those meetings.<P>

<U>FOURTH:     NEGOTIATE, DON'T DICTATE</U><P>

It is time to move from a process where lawyers and bureaucrats write volumes of regulations to
one where people work in partnership to issue sensible regulations that impose the least burden
without sacrificing rational and necessary protections.  In September 1993, I asked each of you to
identify at least one rule that could be conducted through negotiated rulemaking (or to explain
why such could not be done) in order to promote consensual rulemaking as opposed to the more
traditional rulemaking that has dominated the regulatory arena.<P>

I now direct you to expand substantially your efforts to promote consensual rulemaking.  To this
end, you should submit to OIRA, no later than March 30, a list of upcoming rulemakings that can
be converted into negotiated rulemakings.  I have directed Sally Katzen to review your lists with
a view toward making clear to the regulated community that we want to work together
productively on even the most difficult subjects.<P>

To facilitate our ability to learn from those affected by regulation, I will amend Executive Order
No. 12838 (which requires agencies to reduce the number of advisory committees that they use
and to limit the future use of such committees) to allow for advisory committees established for
negotiated rulemakings.<P>

I also intend to take additional steps to increase our ability to learn from those affected by
regulation.  While many laws and rules that limit the ability of regulators to talk with those being
regulated were imposed to curb abuse, they now often serve as a barrier to meaningful
communication between the regulators and the regulated.  To address this problem, and to
promote consensus building and a less adversarial environment, I direct you to review all of your
administrative ex parte rules and eliminate any that restrict communication prior to the
publication of a proposed rule -- other than rules requiring the simple disclosure of the time,
place, purpose, and participants of meetings (as in Executive Order No. 12866).  We will also
begin drafting legislation that will carve out exemptions to the Federal Advisory Committee Act
to promote a better understanding of the issues, such as exemptions for meetings with
State/local/tribal governments and with scientific or technical advisors.<P>

I also ask you to think about other ways to promote better communication, consensus building,
and a less adversarial environment.  Please send your ideas to the Office of the Vice President.<P>

As I said on Tuesday, February 21, 1995, you are to make regulatory reform a top priority.  Good
government demands it and your full cooperation is crucial.  <P>

William J. Clinton<P>

Title: VP Memo Announcing PhaseII of NPR 
<BR>
 Author: Executive Office of the Vice President 
<BR>
 Date: January 3, 1995 
<BR>
 
 
<H3 Align=center> MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE     

  DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES              <BR>   

 FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT     </H3>
<HR>
  <H3>SUBJECT: Second Phase of the National    

          Performance Review</H3>             


 The President has announced his proposal for a 

 Middle Class Bill of Rights to help the American 

 people restore the American dream. As part of this 

 effort, he has asked me to lead a second phase of 

 the National Performance Review. This review will 

 examine the basic missions of government, looking at 

 every single government program and agency to find 

 and eliminate things that don't need to be done by 

 the federal government. It will also sort out how 

 best to do the things government should continue to 

 do.  
<P>
 
 
 To begin this fundamental rethinking of what the 

 federal government should do and how it should do 

 it, I would like each of you immediately to form a 

 team in your agency to review everything you do, 

 asking:  

 <OL>
 
<LI> If your agency were eliminated, how would the 

    goals or programs of your agency be undertaken -- 

    by other agencies, by states or localities, by 

    the private sector, or not at all?  

 
 
<LI> If there are goals or programs of national 

    importance that will remain undone and require a 

    federal role in order to be accomplished, should 

    they be done differently than they are being done 

    today in order to enhance service to the 

    customers?  

 
 
 
 
<LI> How do your customers (not just interest groups) 

    feel about the possible eliminations or changes? 

    This would build on your ongoing efforts to get 

    customer input about the services they want, and 

    how to improve satisfaction with the services we 

    provide. Throughout the review we have to 

    continue to put customers first and to deliver on 

    our published customer service standards.  

 </OL>
 
 Phase 2 of NPR will also review the federal 

 regulatory process to find a way to get better 

 results for the public with less interference in 

 their lives.  

 
 <P>
 
 
 The staff of the National Performance Review will 

 distribute a schedule for the review. The review 

 will be a collaborative effort between the agencies 

 and the NPR staff, OMB, the President's Management 

 Council, and the White House Policy Councils.  

 <P>
 
 The President and I believe absolutely in federal 

 workers. But these workers face uncertain times. We 

 need to involve them in sorting out tomorrow's 

 government. We need to continue to cut red tape and 

 empower them to get results. And we need to treat 

 them in a way that values their past contribution 

 and their role as the most important resource in the 

 government of the future.  

 <P>
 
 Carrying out Phase 2 of the National Performance 

 Review while we deliver on the promises of Phase 1 

 is a big challenge. It is also an enormous 

 opportunity for us to change yesterday's government 

 and make it work for the America of today and 

 tomorrow. Thank you for your help.

  Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day of January,
 one thousand nine hundred and ninety 
 An Act To amend title 31,
 United States Code, to improve the general and financial management of the Federal 
Government.  
  
                     <P>
   
    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress 
assembled,  
  
                           <H2 align=center>TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS</H2>  
  
<H3>  SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE. </H3> <BR>

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:  <BR>
<OL>
        <LI> General management functions of the Office of Management and Budget need to be significantly 
enhanced to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.  
       <LI>Financial management functions of the Office of Management and Budget need to be significantly 
enhanced to provide overall direction and leadership in the development of a modern Federal financial 
management structure and associated systems.  
    <LI> Billions of dollars are lost each year through fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement among the 
hundreds of programs in the Federal Government.  
        <LI> These losses could be significantly decreased by improved management, including improved 
central coordination of internal controls and financial accounting.  
       <LI> The Federal Government is in great need of fundamental reform in financial management 
requirements and practices as financial management systems are obsolete and inefficient, and do not 
provide complete, consistent, reliable, and timely information.         
        <LI> Current financial reporting practices of the Federal Government do not accurately disclose the 
current and probable future cost of operating and investment decisions, including the future need for cash 
or other, resources, do not permit adequate comparison of actual costs among executive agencies, and do 
not provide the timely information required for efficient management of programs. 
 </OL>
<P>
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following: 
 <OL>
        <LI> Bring more effective general and financial management practices to the Federal Government 
through statutory provisions which would establish in the Office of Management and Budget a Deputy 
Director for Management, establish an Office of Federal Financial Management headed by a Controller, 
and designate a Chief Financial Officer in each executive department and in each major executive agency 
in the Federal Government.  
       <LI> Provide for improvement, in each agency of the Federal Government, of systems of accounting, 
financial management, and internal controls to assure the issuance of reliable financial information and to 
deter fraud, waste, and abuse of Government resources.  
        <LI> Provide for the production of complete, reliable, timely, and consistent financial information for 
use by the executive branch of the Government and the Congress in the financing, management, and 
evaluation of Federal programs.

          administrative procedural requirements and controls, including
          specification of personnel staffing levels, limitations on

          funding transfers among budget object classification 20 and
          subclassifications 11, 12, 31, and 32 of each annual budget
          submitted under section 1105, in return for specific individual or
          organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. In
          preparing and submitting the performance plan under section
          1105(a)(29), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
          shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A waiver shall
          take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the 
          waiver is approved.
           <LI> Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the
          anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater 
          managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and 
          authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in
          performance resulting from any waiver. The expected improvements
          shall be compared to current actual performance, and to the
          projected level of performance that would be achieved independent 
          of any waiver.
           <LI> Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or
          remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in
          compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or awards,
          that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet
          performance goals.
            <LI> Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or controls
          imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency or the Office
          of Management and Budget) may not be included in a performance plan
          unless it is endorsed by the agency that established the
          requirement, and the endorsement included in the proposing agencys
          performance plan.
          <LI> A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as 
          specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in
          approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a subsequent 
          year. After a waiver has been in effect for three consecutive 
          years, the performance plan prepared under section 1115 may propose
          that a waiver, other than a waiver of limitations on compensation 
          or remuneration, be made permanent.

Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and
Results Act (Other Written Prod., 06/01/96, GAO/GGD-96-118).

GAO published an executive guide on implementing the Government
Performance and Results Act (GPRA). GAO noted that: (1) GPRA forces
federal agencies to focus on their missions and goals, how to achieve
them, and how to improve their structural organizations and business
processes; (2) agencies must define their missions and desired outcomes,
use strategic planning, involve stakeholders, assess their environments,
and align their activities, core processes, and resources to support
mission-related outcomes; (3) agencies need to measure their performance
to ensure that they are meeting their goals and making informed
decisions; (4) performance measures need to be based on program-related
characteristics and performance data must be sufficiently complete,
accurate, and consistent; (5) agencies must use performance data to
improve organizational processes, identify performance gaps, and set
improvement goals; and (6) GPRA success depends on strong leadership
practices that devolve decisionmaking authority with accountability,
create incentives, build expertise, and integrate management reforms.

PREFACE
============================================================ Chapter 0

In recent years, an understanding has emerged that the federal
government needs to be run in a more businesslike manner than in the
past.  As companies are accountable to shareholders, the federal
government is accountable to taxpayers, and taxpayers are demanding
as never before that the dollars they invest in their government be
managed and spent responsibly. 

As countless studies by GAO have long noted, federal agencies often
fail to appropriately manage their finances, identify clearly what
they intend to accomplish, or get the job done effectively and with a
minimum of waste.  After decades of seeing these problems recur in
agency after agency, Congress moved to address this endemic situation
on a governmentwide basis.  Major statutes now in their first years
of implementation hold substantial promise for creating a more
accountable and effective federal government. 

The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 provided for chief
financial officer positions in 24 major agencies and required annual
reports on the financial condition of government entities and the
status of management controls.  Under the CFO Act, federal agencies
will be subject to the same kinds of financial reporting that have
long been required in the private sector and by state and local
governments. 

The Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 requires,
among other things, that agencies set goals, measure performance, and
report on progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
operations through the use of information technology. 

And, most fundamentally, under the Government Performance and Results
Act of 1993 (GPRA), every major federal agency must now ask itself
some basic questions:  What is our mission?  What are our goals and
how will we achieve them?  How can we measure our performance?  How
will we use that information to make improvements?  GPRA forces a
shift in the focus of federal agencies--away from such traditional
concerns as staffing and activity levels and toward a single
overriding issue:  results.  GPRA requires agencies to set goals,
measure performance, and report on their accomplishments. 

This will not be an easy transition, nor will it be quick.  And for
some agencies, GPRA will be difficult to apply.  But GPRA has the
potential for adding greatly to government performance--a
particularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited and
public demands are high.  To help Congress and federal managers put
GPRA into effect, we have identified key steps that agencies need to
take toward its implementation, along with a set of practices that
can help make that implementation a success.  We learned of these
practices from organizations that successfully have taken initiatives
similar to the ones required by the act.  Several federal agencies
that have already put these practices to use are represented in the
case illustrations that are part of this guide. 

This guide is a companion to our Executive Guide:  Improving Mission
Performance Through Strategic Information Management and Technology,
which outlined a number of information management approaches that
federal agencies can take to improve their overall performance. 
Improving the management of federal agencies will require responsible
actions in several areas at once.  Success will demand concerted
effort and long-term commitment, but the returns should be
considerable.  And American taxpayers deserve no less for their
investment.

INTRODUCTION
============================================================ Chapter 1


   A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS
   FEDERAL MANAGEMENT REFORM
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:1

Over the past several years, Congress has taken steps to
fundamentally change the way federal agencies go about their work. 
Congress took these steps in response to management problems so
common among federal agencies that they demanded governmentwide
solutions.  In addition, two contemporary forces converged to spur
congressional action:  year-in, year-out budget deficits that had to
be brought down and a public now demanding not only that federal
agencies do their jobs more effectively, but that they do so with
fewer people and at lower cost. 

This was--and remains--an enormous challenge.  For one thing, many of
the largest federal agencies find themselves encumbered with
structures and processes rooted in the past, aimed at the demands of
earlier times, and designed before modern information and
communications technology came into being.  These agencies are poorly
positioned to meet the demands of the 1990s.\1 Moreover, many of
these agencies find themselves without a clear understanding of who
they are or where they are headed.  Over the years, as new social or
economic problems emerged, Congress assigned many agencies new and
unanticipated program responsibilities.  These additions may have
made sense when they were made, but their cumulative effect has been
to create a government in which many agencies cannot say just what
business they are in. 

In some cases, agencies' legislative mandates have grown so muddled
that Congress, the executive branch, and other agency stakeholders
and customers cannot agree on program goals, worthwhile strategies,
or appropriate measures of success.  Our work has shown that the
effectiveness of federal program areas as diverse as employment
assistance and training, rural development, early childhood
development, and food safety has been plagued by fragmented or
overlapping efforts.\2 A frequently cited example of overlap and
ineffectiveness is the federal food safety system, which took shape
under as many as 35 laws and was administered by 12 different
agencies yet had not effectively protected the public from major
foodborne illnesses.\3

Traditionally, federal agencies have used the amount of money
directed toward their programs, or the level of staff deployed, or
even the number of tasks completed as some of the measures of their
performance.  But at a time when the value of many federal programs
is undergoing intense public scrutiny, an agency that reports only
these measures has not answered the defining question of whether
these programs have produced real results.  Today's environment is
results-oriented.  Congress, the executive branch, and the public are
beginning to hold agencies accountable less for inputs and outputs
than for outcomes, by which is meant the results of government
programs as measured by the differences they make, for example, in
the economy or program participants' lives.  A federal employment
training program can report on the number of participants.  That
number is an output.  Or it can report on the changes in the real
wages of its graduates.  That number is an outcome.  The difference
between the two measures is the key to understanding government
performance in a results-oriented environment.

   LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
   SUPPORT MANAGING FOR RESULTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:2

Congress' determination to make agencies accountable for their
performance lay at the heart of two landmark reforms of the 1990s: 
the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and the Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).  With these two laws,
Congress imposed on federal agencies a new and more businesslike
framework for management and accountability.  In addition, GPRA
created requirements for agencies to generate the information
congressional and executive branch decisionmakers need in considering
measures to improve government performance and reduce costs. 

The CFO Act was designed to remedy decades of serious neglect in
federal financial management operations and reporting.  It provided
for chief financial officers in the 24 largest federal departments
and agencies, which together account for about 98 percent of the
government's gross budget authority.  In 1994, Congress followed up
on the CFO Act with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. 
The latter extended to all 24 CFO Act agencies the requirement,
beginning with fiscal year 1996, to prepare and have audited
financial statements for their entire operations. 

While the CFO Act established the foundation for improving management
and financial accountability among the agencies, GPRA is aimed more
directly at improving their program performance.  GPRA requires first
that agencies consult with Congress and other stakeholders to clearly
define their missions.  It requires that they establish long-term
strategic goals, as well as annual goals that are linked to them. 
They must then measure their performance against the goals they have
set and report publicly on how well they are doing.\4 Federal
agencies also are to apply these principles--goal setting,
performance measurement, and reporting--to their information
technology efforts, under the Information Technology Management
Reform Act of 1996.  For example, agencies are to establish
performance measures to gauge how well their information technology
supports their program efforts.

appendix I. 


   EXPERIENCES OF LEADING
   ORGANIZATIONS SHOW A WAY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:3

At the request of Congress, we studied a number of leading public
sector organizations that were successfully pursuing management
reform initiatives and becoming more results-oriented.\5 We studied
state governments, such as Florida, Oregon, Minnesota, North
Carolina, Texas, and Virginia; and foreign governments, such as
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.  Many of
these organizations found themselves in an environment similar to the
one confronting federal managers today--one in which they were called
upon to improve performance while simultaneously reducing costs. 
Congress asked whether the experiences of these organizations could
yield worthwhile lessons for federal agencies as they attempt to
implement GPRA. 

Each of the organizations we studied set its agenda for management
reform according to its own environment, needs, and capabilities. 
Yet despite their differing approaches to reform, all these
organizations were seeking to become more result-oriented, and they
commonly took three key steps.  These were to (1) define clear
missions and desired outcomes, (2) measure performance to gauge
progress, and (3) use performance information as a basis for
decisionmaking.  Although the organizations we studied were not
acting under GPRA, their three key steps were consistent with GPRA's
requirements.  That is, the first step--define mission and desired
outcomes--corresponds to the requirement in GPRA for federal agencies
to develop strategic plans containing mission statements and
outcome-related strategic goals; the second step--measure
performance--corresponds to the GPRA requirement for federal agencies
to develop annual performance plans with annual performance goals and
indicators to measure performance; and the third step--use
performance information--although much broader, includes the
requirement in GPRA for federal agencies to prepare annual
performance reports with information on the extent to which the
agency has met its annual performance goals. 

Along with each step, certain practices proved especially important
to the success of their efforts.  In addition to these steps, these
organizations also found that certain top leadership practices were
central to making the changes needed for the organizations to become
more results-oriented. 

Taken together, the key steps and practices drawn from the
organizations we studied provide a useful framework for federal
agencies working to implement GPRA.  The key steps and practices are
shown in figure 1. 

   Figure 1:  Implementing GPRA: 
   Key Steps and Critical
   Practices

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

In this executive guide, we discuss the three key steps and their
relationship to GPRA, along with the practices associated with each
step.\6 In the final section of this executive guide, we discuss the
role of top leadership and the practices it can follow if it hopes to
make GPRA a driving force in an organization.  Accompanying the
discussion of each practice is a case illustration involving a
federal agency that has made progress in incorporating the practice
into its operations.  The fact that an organization is profiled for a
particular practice is not meant to imply success or lack of success
in other dimensions.  Moreover, underscoring the fact that
implementing management changes required by GPRA will not come
quickly, most of the agencies profiled began their results-oriented
management before GPRA was enacted. 

The experiences of leading organizations suggest that the successful
implementation of GPRA may be as difficult as it is important.  For
example, obtaining agreement among often competing stakeholders is
never easy, particularly in an environment where available resources
are declining.  In addition, measuring the federal contribution to
outcomes that require the coordinated effort of numerous public and
private entities--such as improvements in education, employment, or
health--can require sophisticated and costly program evaluations. 

To help ensure the success of GPRA, the CFO Council, which the CFO
Act created to provide the leadership foundation necessary to
effectively carry out the Chief Financial Officers' responsibilities,
established a GPRA Implementation Committee.  The Committee is
providing guidance and information to Chief Financial Officers and
managers in the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act.  The Committee
recognized that uncertainty or fear of failure may immobilize an
agency's efforts to implement GPRA and that its implementation is
evolutionary in that proficiency comes with time and experience.  To
assist federal managers, the Committee published guiding principles
and key issues for implementing GPRA.\7 Our guide is intended to
complement the Committee's work in assisting managers as they
implement GPRA.  Our work has shown that although the steps and
practices discussed in this guide don't come quickly or easily, they
can serve as the fundamental building blocks to creating a
results-oriented organization.

STEP 1:  DEFINE MISSION AND
DESIRED OUTCOMES
============================================================ Chapter 2

   Figure 2:  Define Mission and
   Desired Outcomes

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)


GPRA requires that federal agencies, no later than September 30,
1997, develop strategic plans covering a period of at least 5 years
and submit them to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB).  OMB provided guidance on the preparation and submission of
strategic plans as a new part of its Circular No.  A-11--the basic
instructions for preparing the President's Budget--to underscore the
essential link between GPRA and the budget process.  OMB required
agencies to submit major parts of their strategic plans by June 7,
1996. 

Strategic plans are intended to be the starting point for each
agency's performance measurement efforts.  Each plan must include a
comprehensive mission statement based on the agency's statutory
requirements, a set of outcome-related strategic goals, and a
description of how the agency intends to achieve these goals.  The
mission statement brings the agency into focus.  It explains why the
agency exists, tells what it does, and describes how it does it.  The
strategic goals that follow are an outgrowth of this clearly stated
mission.  The strategic goals explain the purposes of the agency's
programs and the results they are intended to achieve. 

In crafting GPRA, Congress recognized that federal agencies do not
exist in a vacuum.  As agencies develop their mission statements and
establish their strategic goals, they are required by the act to
consult with both Congress and their other stakeholders.  Further,
agencies must be alert to the environment in which they operate; in
their strategic plans, they are required to identify the external
factors that could affect their ability to accomplish what they set
out to do. 

We found that leading results-oriented organizations consistently
strive to ensure that their day-to-day activities support their
organizational missions and move them closer to accomplishing their
strategic goals.  In practice, these organizations see the production
of a strategic plan--that is, a particular document issued on a
particular day--as one of the least important parts of the planning
process.  This is because they believe strategic planning is not a
static or occasional event.  It is, instead, a dynamic and inclusive
process.  If done well, strategic planning is continuous and provides
the basis for everything the organization does each day. 

For strategic planning to have this sort of impact, three practices
appear to be critical.  Organizations must (1) involve their
stakeholders; (2) assess their internal and external environments;
and (3) align their activities, core processes, and resources to
support mission-related outcomes. 


   PRACTICE 1:  INVOLVE
   STAKEHOLDERS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:1

Successful organizations we studied based their strategic planning,
to a large extent, on the interests and expectations of their
stakeholders.  These organizations recognize that stakeholders will
have a lot to say in determining whether their programs succeed or
fail.  Among the stakeholders of federal agencies are Congress and
the administration, state and local governments, third-party service
providers, interest groups, agency employees, and, of course, the
American public. 

In the federal government, stakeholder involvement is particularly
important as federal agencies face a complex political environment in
which legislative mandates are often ambiguous.  Thus, the basic
questions that must be answered in crafting a mission statement--what
is our purpose, what products and services must we deliver to meet
that purpose, and how will that be done--will present a significant
challenge for many agencies.  While statutory requirements are to be
the starting point for agency mission statements, Congress, the
executive branch, and other interested parties may all disagree
strongly about a given agency's mission and goals.  GPRA seeks to
address such situations by requiring agencies to consult with
Congress and other stakeholders to clarify their missions and reach
agreement on their goals.  Full agreement among stakeholders on all
aspects of an agency's efforts is relatively uncommon because
stakeholders' interests can differ often and significantly. 

Still, stakeholder involvement is important to help agencies ensure
that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highest
priorities.  Just as important, involving stakeholders in strategic
planning efforts can help create a basic understanding among the
stakeholders of the competing demands that confront most agencies,
the limited resources available to them, and how those demands and
resources require careful and continuous balancing.  Because of its
power to create and fund programs, the involvement of Congress is
indispensable to defining each agency's mission and establishing its
goals.\8 This may entail identifying legislative changes that are
needed to clarify or modify Congress' intent and expectations or to
address differing conditions and citizens' needs that have occurred
since the initial statutory requirements were established. 
Congressional consultations also may include additional guidance on
Congress' priorities in those frequent cases where agencies have more
than one statutory mission. 

Involving customers is important as well.  An agency's customers are
the individuals or organizations that are served by its programs. 
This is not to say that contact between a federal agency and its
customers is always direct.  Many federally mandated or federally
funded services are dispensed through third parties, such as state
agencies, banks, or medical insurance providers.  In such cases,
federal agencies face the particularly challenging task of balancing
the needs of customers, service providers, and other stakeholders,
who at times may have differing or even competing goals. 

In our reviews of successful results-oriented organizations, we found
numerous examples of organizations that achieved positive results by
involving customers and other stakeholders in defining their missions
and desired outcomes.\9 Oregon, for one, developed consensus on its
statewide strategic plan by bringing together such diverse
stakeholders as legislators, state agency officials, county and local
government officials, and community group representatives.  The
Minnesota Trade Office, for another, used surveys to obtain its
stakeholders' views on the degree to which the office was
contributing to its customers' export activities.  On the basis of
the data it obtained, the Trade Office made program changes and
improved both its performance and its responsiveness.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION: 
   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:2

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970
under a presidential reorganization plan in response to public
concerns over unhealthy air, polluted rivers, unsafe drinking water,
and haphazard waste disposal.  Congress gave EPA responsibility for
implementing federal environmental laws.  From the start, however,
EPA lacked an overarching legislative mission, and its environmental
responsibilities have yet to be integrated with one another.  As a
result, EPA could not ensure that it was directing its efforts toward
the environmental problems that were of greatest concern to citizens
or posed the greatest risk to the health of the population or the
environment itself.  Therefore, EPA decided in 1992 to launch the
National Environmental Goals Project, a long-range planning
initiative under which it would involve its stakeholders in
developing measurable goals for EPA to pursue in improving the
quality of the nation's environment. 

EPA designed its National Environmental Goals Project to produce a
set of long-range environmental goals, including milestones to be
achieved by 2005.  The agency recognized that while environmental
goals should be grounded in science and factual analysis, they should
be based, as well, on the needs and expectations of the nation's
citizens.  In 1994, EPA initiated a series of nine public meetings to
hear their views.  The meetings were held around the country and
included environmental organizations, businesses, state and local
governments, tribal governments, and other stakeholders.  To provide
a basis for discussion, EPA drafted and distributed to participants a
set of goal statements and descriptive information on the 13 broad
environmental goal areas that its staff considered to be of the
greatest national importance. 

EPA used the information it received at these public meetings to
revise and better define these goals.  For example, the agency added
milestones for managing and cleaning up radioactive waste, restoring
contaminated sites to productive use, and slowing habitat losses. 
Further, it added the goal of improving its dissemination of
environmental information and its other education efforts.  EPA found
that its stakeholders' interests included how EPA does its core
processes--for example, the amount of flexibility it can offer to the
regulated community.  EPA recognized these stakeholder interests in a
summary report of its revised goals that it sent to Congress and its
other stakeholders in February 1995. 

EPA continued to involve stakeholders in the National Environmental
Goals Project by soliciting comments on the summary report.  Many of
EPA's stakeholders are businesses or other regulated entities that
wanted the agency to address such matters as the procedural costs of
environmental regulations.  EPA responded with a discussion of the
overall costs and benefits of controlling pollution.  At its
stakeholders' request, it provided trend data and laid out strategies
for achieving its environmental milestones.  EPA recognizes that
involving stakeholders is an ongoing effort that needs to be
continued.  The proposed goals are to be sent again to federal,
state, local, and tribal government stakeholders for another round of
review later this year, and plans are being made for public review. 


  PRACTICE 2:  ASSESS THE
   ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:3

Good managers have understood for a long time that many forces--both
inside and outside their organizations--can influence their ability
to achieve their goals.  But even managers who try to stay alert to
these forces often gather their information anecdotally or
informally.  In contrast, the successful organizations we studied
monitor their internal and external environments continuously and
systematically.  Organizations that do this have shown an ability to
anticipate future challenges and to make adjustments so that
potential problems do not become crises.\10 By building environmental
assessment into the strategic planning process, they are able to stay
focused on their long-term goals even as they make changes in the way
they intend to achieve them. 

Both the external and internal environments are important, and
neither can be viewed independently of the other.  Assessing the
external environment is particularly important, in part because so
many external forces that fall beyond an organization's influence can
powerfully affect its chances for success.  For organizations both
public and private, external forces can include newly emerging
economic, social, and technological trends and new statutory,
regulatory, and judicial requirements.  An organization's internal
forces include its culture, its management practices, and its
business processes.  Today, federal agencies find that monitoring
these internal forces is especially important, given the effects of
funding reductions and reorganizations.  The tools available to
organizations assessing the internal environment include program
evaluations, employee surveys, independent audits, and reviews of
business processes.

of strategic thinking, see Henry Mintzberg, The Fall and Rise of
Strategic Planning (New York:  Free Press and Prentice Hall
International, 1994). 


   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  UNITED
   STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:4

The missions of the Customs Service--the oldest federal agency--are
to ensure that goods and persons entering and exiting the United
States comply with all U.S.  laws and regulations, while also
facilitating the legitimate movement of goods and persons through
U.S.  ports.  But long-standing management problems, including
weaknesses in strategic planning, had threatened the agency's ability
to adapt to changing demands.  Customs' strategic planning efforts
now focus on the dramatic changes occurring in its external and
internal environments and on the equally dramatic changes the agency
will need to make in response. 

Recognizing that the international trade environment has undergone
many changes in recent years, the Customs Service identified the new
challenges these changes brought it in its 1993 strategic plan.  The
clearest challenge for Customs would be to manage a workload that was
growing rapidly and that could not be expected to taper off.  From
fiscal year 1986 to 1995, for example, total import entries increased
by 242 percent, from 11.1 million to 38.0 million.  During the same
period, passenger arrivals increased by 42 percent, from 304 million
to 431 million.  Customs anticipated that world trade would also
continue to accelerate.  During 1995 alone, approximately $761
billion in merchandise was imported into the United States.  For the
rest of the decade, Customs expects that figure to grow by more than
10 percent each year. 

Customs anticipated that trade issues would assume greater prominence
in the coming years as developing countries continue to
industrialize, corporations continue to expand internationally, and
trade barriers continue to fall.  Further, the proliferation of
international trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement of 1989, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, should lead to further
increases in trade and travel volume. 

Internally, Customs anticipated that as public pressures to reduce
the federal deficit continued, no real growth would occur in the
agency's funding.  Customs also anticipated attrition among its staff
and a loss of valuable expertise due to that attrition.  It
determined that by 1998 about 10 percent, or about 2,000 employees,
would be eligible to retire. 

All of these forces--external and internal--have caused the Customs
Service to begin to reengineer its core processes, including those
related to the movement of people and cargo into the United States
and the movement of cargo out of the United States.  For example, the
agency is undertaking a major reorganization structured from the
ground up, using its 301 ports as its foundation.  While headquarters
staffing is to be streamlined, the staffing levels at the ports are
to be maintained or increased.  Under the reorganization, port
directors are to be given some of the authority previously exercised
at the district or regional levels. 

It is too soon to tell how effective Customs' reorganization will be
in responding to the pressures it faces.  But by assessing its
external and internal environments, the agency came to see that its
traditional ways of pursuing its mission were no longer viable and
that major changes would be needed. 


   PRACTICE 3:  ALIGN ACTIVITIES,
   CORE PROCESSES, AND RESOURCES
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:5

Leading organizations recognize that sound planning is not enough to
ensure their success.  An organization's activities, core processes,
and resources must be aligned to support its mission and help it
achieve its goals.  Such organizations start by assessing the extent
to which their programs and activities contribute to meeting their
mission and desired outcomes.  As the organizations became more
results-oriented, they often found it necessary to fundamentally
alter activities and programs so that they more effectively and
efficiently produced the services to meet customers' needs and
stakeholders' interests.  For example, we have traced the management
problems of many federal agencies to organizational structures that
are obsolete and inadequate to modern demands.\11 As federal agencies
become more outcome-oriented, they will find that outmoded
organizational structures must be changed to better meet customer
needs and address the interests of stakeholders. 

As agencies align their activities to support mission-related goals,
they should also make better linkages between levels of funding and
their anticipated results.  Under a series of initiatives called
Connecting Resources to Results, OMB is seeking to adopt a greater
focus on agencies' goals and performance in making funding decisions. 
For example, OMB fiscal year 1996 budget preparation guidance said
agencies were to identify key features of their streamlining plans
(e.g., increased span of control, reduced organizational layers,
and/or milestones for full-time equivalents) and encouraged agencies
to include performance goals and indicators in their budget
justifications.\12 Whereas the agencies' fiscal year 1995 documents
discussed streamlining primarily in terms of the number of positions
to be eliminated, the fiscal year 1996 budget documents included
discussions about how proposed staff reductions could affect the
agencies' performance.  Under OMB's guidance, agencies' fiscal year
1997 budget requests were to contain a significantly greater amount
of performance information to help define funding levels and
projected program results.  For the fiscal year 1998 budget, OMB
plans to continue to increase the role of performance goals and
information in guiding funding decisions. 

We also have found that leading organizations strive to ensure that
their core processes efficiently and effectively support
mission-related outcomes.  These organizations rely increasingly on a
well-defined mission to form the foundation for the key business
systems and processes they use to ensure the successful outcome of
their operations.  For example, many successful public and private
organizations integrate their human resource management activities
into their organizational missions, rather than treating them as an
isolated support function.\13 This sort of integrated approach may
include tying individual performance management, career development
programs, and pay and promotion standards to organizational mission,
vision, and culture. 

Information management is another activity that organizations must
address in aligning their activities and processes.\14 Modern
information management approaches, coupled with new information
technology, can make success more or less likely--depending on the
way they are handled.  We found that successful organizations pursue
something called strategic information management--that is,
comprehensive management of information and information technology to
maximize improvements in mission performance.  Strategic information
management will be an important part of any federal agency's attempt
to implement GPRA successfully.  Managing better requires that
agencies have, and rely upon, sound financial and program
information.  Strategic information management would lead to systems
that would better provide federal agencies the data they need in
considering ways to realign their processes, reduce costs, improve
program effectiveness, and ensure consistent results with a less
bureaucratic organization.  Lacking these data, the agencies would be
missing one of the indispensable ingredients of successful
management.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  FEDERAL
   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:6

Established in 1979, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
is responsible for the coordination of civil emergency planning and
mitigation as well as the coordination of federal disaster relief. 
FEMA is responsible for responding to floods, hurricanes,
earthquakes, and other natural disasters.  Hurricane Hugo and the
Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 generated intense criticism of the
federal response effort.  Hurricane Andrew, which leveled much of
South Florida in 1992, raised further doubts as to whether FEMA was
capable of responding to disasters.  In 1993, FEMA's new Director
refocused the agency on meeting its mission and aligning its
activities to better serve the public. 

Since FEMA issued its mission statement in April 1993, it has been
reexamining its approach to limiting deaths and property losses from
disasters.  Traditionally, FEMA had concentrated its efforts on
post-disaster assistance.  But after taking a hard look at its
performance, FEMA concluded that it could better fulfill its mission
by addressing the range of activities available before, during, and
after disaster strikes. 

As part of its first agencywide strategic planning effort, FEMA
comprehensively reviewed its programs and structures and initiated a
major reorganization in November 1993.  FEMA concluded that all
emergencies share certain common traits, pose some common demands,
and ought to be approached functionally.  FEMA's new, "all-hazard"
mission takes a multifaceted, sequential approach to managing
disasters:  mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 

FEMA now focuses its disaster planning and response processes on
steps that need to be taken, not just during and after the event, but
in advance.  To build preparedness, FEMA now seeks to build
partnerships with other federal, state, and local organizations.  For
example, the agency is working with local governments and the
building industry to strengthen building codes so that structures
will be better able to withstand disasters.  It has also launched an
effort to increase the number of flood insurance
policyholders--something that had not been a traditional focus of the
agency but that is now understood as being critical to helping
individuals recover from disasters.  By more closely aligning its
activities, processes, and resources with its mission, FEMA appears
today to be better positioned to accomplish that mission. 


STEP 2:  MEASURE PERFORMANCE
============================================================ Chapter 3

   Figure 3:  Measure Performance

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)


The second key step that successful results-oriented organizations we
studied take--after defining their missions and desired outcomes--is
to measure their performance.  Measuring performance allows these
organizations to track the progress they are making toward their
goals and gives managers crucial information on which to base their
organizational and management decisions.  Leading organizations
recognize, as well, that performance measures can create powerful
incentives to influence organizational and individual behavior. 

GPRA incorporates performance measurement as one of its most
important features.  Under the act, executive branch agencies are
required to develop annual performance plans that use performance
measurement to reinforce the connection between the long-term
strategic goals outlined in their strategic plans and the day-to-day
activities of their managers and staff.  The annual performance plans
are to include performance goals for an agency's program activities
as listed in the budget, a summary of the necessary resources to
conduct these activities, the performance indicators that will be
used to measure performance, and a discussion of how the performance
information will be verified.  For the first time, GPRA requires that
agencies' annual program performance planning efforts be linked
directly to their budget estimates and obligations.  This linkage is
achieved by requiring performance goals and measures for agencies'
program activities that are included in their budget requests. 
Congress recognized that the activity structure in the budget of the
United States government is not consistent across various programs. 
As a result, Congress expects agencies to consolidate, aggregate, or
disaggregate the lists of program activities appearing in the budget
accounts. 

The first of these annual performance plans is to cover fiscal year
1999; each agency is to submit its plan to OMB in the fall of 1997. 
However, OMB is requiring descriptions of the proposed performance
goals and indicators for fiscal year 1999 with the agency's fiscal
year 1998 budget request. 

In developing GPRA, Congress recognized that federal
agencies--unaccustomed as they are to the practice--may find that
developing performance measures is a difficult and time-consuming
task.  As a result, it provided for selected agencies and programs to
pilot GPRA's goal-setting and performance measurement requirements
before these are applied governmentwide.  Our work with leading
results-oriented organizations confirmed that many agencies may need
years to develop a sound set of performance measures. 

We learned, as well, that agencies that were successful in measuring
their performance generally had applied two practices.  First, they
developed performance measures based on four characteristics.  These
measures were (1) tied to program goals and demonstrated the degree
to which the desired results were achieved, (2) limited to a vital
few that were considered essential for producing data for
decisionmaking, (3) responsive to multiple priorities, and (4)
responsibility-linked to establish accountability for results. 
Second, recognizing that they must balance their ideal performance
measurement systems against real-world considerations, such as the
cost and effort involved in gathering and analyzing data, the
organizations we studied made sure that the data they did collect
were sufficiently complete, accurate, and consistent to be useful in
decisionmaking. 


   PRACTICE 4:  PRODUCE A SET OF
   PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT EACH
   ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL THAT
   DEMONSTRATE RESULTS, ARE
   LIMITED TO THE VITAL FEW,
   RESPOND TO MULTIPLE PRIORITIES,
   AND LINK TO RESPONSIBLE
   PROGRAMS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:1

As the leading organizations we studied strive to align their
activities and resources to achieve mission-related goals, they also
seek to establish clear hierarchies of performance goals and
measures.  Under these hierarchies, the organizations try to link the
goals and performance measures for each organizational level to
successive levels and ultimately to the organization's strategic
goals.  They have recognized that without clear, hierarchically
linked performance measures, managers and staff throughout the
organization will lack straightforward roadmaps showing how their
daily activities can contribute to attaining organizationwide
strategic goals and mission.  Federal agencies that are developing
such hierarchies for their organizations are finding that
organizationwide performance measurement efforts take time and
require the active involvement of staff at all organizational levels. 

The experiences of leading state, foreign, and federal governments
show that at least four characteristics are common to successful
hierarchies of performance measures.\15

These characteristics include the following: 

Demonstrate results:  Performance measures should tell each
organizational level how well it is achieving its goals.  Yet, simple
as this principle may appear, it poses an especially difficult
challenge for federal managers, for whom the link between federal
efforts and desired outcomes is often difficult to establish and may
not, in fact, be apparent for years.  Research programs provide one
example.  So do many health and welfare programs that are delivered
jointly with state and local governments and third-party service
deliverers. 

Limited to the vital few:  The number of measures for each goal at a
given organizational level should be limited to the vital few.  Those
vital few measures should cover the key performance dimensions that
will enable an organization to assess accomplishments, make
decisions, realign processes, and assign accountability. 
Organizations that seek to manage an excessive number of performance
measures may risk creating a confusing excess of data that will
obscure rather than clarify performance issues.  Limiting the number
of performance measures to the vital few at each organizational level
will not only keep the focus where it belongs, it will help ensure
that the costs involved in collecting and analyzing the data do not
become prohibitive.  As a result, lower organizational levels may use
different measures and goals from those meaningfully or appropriately
included in the organization's annual performance plan.  Likewise,
agencies will have more goals and measures than can be meaningfully
or appropriately included in the governmentwide performance plan OMB
will develop under GPRA.  However, as performance plans are compiled
for higher organizational levels, the consolidation and possible
exclusion of some goals and measures does not mean that those goals
and measures are not important to guide the efforts of the lower
levels and should still be monitored. 

Respond to multiple priorities:  Government agencies often face a
variety of interests whose competing demands continually force
policymakers and managers to balance quality, cost, customer
satisfaction, stakeholder concerns, and other factors.  Performance
measurement systems must take these competing interests into account
and create incentives for managers to strike the difficult balance
among competing demands.  Performance measurement efforts that
overemphasize one or two priorities at the expense of the others may
skew the agency's performance and keep its managers from seeing the
whole picture. 

Link to responsible programs:  Performance measures should be linked
directly to the offices that have responsibility for making programs
work.  A clear connection between performance measures and program
offices helps to both reinforce accountability and ensure that, in
their day-to-day activities, managers keep in mind the outcomes their
organization is striving to achieve.  This connection at the program
office helps to lay the groundwork for accountability as measures
advance through the agency.  By helping to lay the groundwork for
accountability, a connection between performance measures and program
offices also provides a basis for determining the appropriate degree
of operational authority for various organizational levels.  Managers
must have the authority and flexibility for achieving the results for
which they are to be held accountable.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  NATIONAL
   OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
   ADMINISTRATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:2

The mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) is to describe and predict changes in the earth's environment,
as well as to conserve and manage the nation's coastal and marine
resources to ensure sustainable economic opportunities.  NOAA
concluded in its 1995 strategic plan that the nation's ability to
prepare for severe weather events, including tornadoes,
thunderstorms, hurricanes, and flash flooding, depends on the quality
and timeliness of the agency's observations, assessments, and
information delivery.  Through strategic planning, NOAA evaluated how
best to accomplish its mission and then put into place those
performance measures essential to demonstrating the extent to which
it was attaining its desired outcomes. 

NOAA determined that the most important business of its short-term
warning and forecast weather services was to predict the time and
location of weather events and to do so with accuracy.  Rather than
simply count the number of forecasts it made--that is, to simply
gather data on its activity level--NOAA began to measure the extent
to which it could increase the lead time or advance notice it gave
the public prior to severe weather events.  It decided, in other
words, to measure what counts. 

NOAA reported that from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995, its
lead time for predicting tornadoes increased from 7 minutes to 9
minutes, and the accuracy of its predictions increased from 47
percent of the time to 60 percent of the time.  For fiscal year 1996,
NOAA has set targets of 10 minutes and 64 percent, respectively. 

NOAA also measured how accurately it could predict the range where
hurricanes would reach land, given a 24-hour lead time.  From fiscal
year 1993 to fiscal year 1995, its accuracy improved from 185
kilometers (115 miles) to 134 kilometers (83 miles).  It credited the
improvement to its installation in June 1995 of a new hurricane
tracking model.  On the basis of fiscal year 1995 performance, NOAA
revised its fiscal year 1996 target from 155 kilometers (96 miles) to
150 kilometers (93 miles).  Although the new fiscal year 1996 target
of 150 kilometers is higher than the fiscal year 1995 actual
performance of 134 kilometers, NOAA wants to test the new model
through at least another hurricane season before radically revising
its targets for future years. 

The significance of earlier and more accurate hurricane warnings is
enormous.  Most importantly, they help prevent deaths and injuries. 
But they also save money, because earlier and more accurate
predictions of hurricane tracks and intensities can reduce the size
of the warning areas in which people are advised to prepare for the
event.  NOAA calculated that for each hurricane, the public's
preparation and evacuation costs exceed $50 million, but improved
predictions can cut that cost by $5 million.  In addition, NOAA
officials believe that the public takes more accurate forecasts more
seriously--which helps lessen loss of life and property. 


   PRACTICE 5:  COLLECT
   SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE,
   ACCURATE, AND CONSISTENT DATA
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:3

As the organizations we examined developed their performance
measures, they paid special attention to issues relating to data
collection.  Although they recognized that adequate and reliable
performance data are indispensable to decisionmaking, they were also
aware that collecting the data can be costly and difficult.  As a
result, as agencies implement GPRA, they will have to balance the
cost of data collection efforts against the need to ensure that the
collected data are complete, accurate, and consistent enough to
document performance and support decisionmaking at various
organizational levels. 

As the experiences of these organizations demonstrated, managers
striving to reach organizational goals must have information systems
in place to provide them with needed information.\16 In Texas, for
example, officials said that the state restructured its statewide
information systems to include the missions and goals of its
agencies, specific strategies for achieving objectives, and measures
of progress.  The system also linked budgeted expenditures,
accounting information, and performance data. 

Our work has shown consistently that the federal government's basic
financial and information management systems are woefully out of date
and incapable of meeting modern needs for fast, reliable, and
accurate information--particularly as these needs relate to financial
reporting and program costs.  As the leading organizations we studied
became more results-oriented, many of them made significant
investments in their information management systems.  Many federal
agencies will need to do the same.  But agencies can keep costs down
by applying the performance measurement principles these leading
organizations have employed and also--where they can--by building
performance data collection into the processes that govern daily
operations, rather than creating entirely new and separate data
collection systems.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  NATIONAL
   HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY
   ADMINISTRATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:4

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) mission
is to reduce casualties and economic losses resulting from motor
vehicle crashes.  To accomplish its mission, NHTSA pursues two main
strategies:  setting and enforcing safety performance standards for
motor vehicles and promoting safe driving behavior.  After it was
established in 1970, NHTSA concluded that reliable crash statistics
databases were needed.  The need was twofold:  to help in identifying
and analyzing traffic safety problems and for evaluating the
effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and highway safety
initiatives.  To fill this need, NHTSA developed data collection
systems derived from existing data sources and has taken steps to
ensure the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of these data. 

NHTSA has developed two data systems that, taken together, serve as a
single source of motor vehicle crash statistics.  The Fatal Accident
Reporting System has enabled NHTSA to document that the rate for one
of its desired outcomes--reduction in the fatality rate--decreased
from 2.3 to an estimated 1.7 per 100 million vehicle miles of travel
from 1988 to 1995.\17 Also, NHTSA has used data from the General
Estimates System to document another one of its desired outcomes--a
reduction in injury rates--from 169 to an estimated 138 injuries per
100 million vehicle miles of travel from 1988 to 1995. 

The Fatal Accident Reporting System contains accident data provided
by the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. 
According to NHTSA documents, throughout the states, Puerto Rico, and
the District of Columbia, trained state employees gather and transmit
these data to NHTSA's central computer database in a standard format. 
State employees obtain data solely from each state's existing
documents--including police accident reports, vehicle registration
files, and vital statistics records--and then enter them into a
central computer database.  NHTSA analysts periodically review a
sample of the cases. 

The General Estimates System contains data from a nationally
representative sample of police-reported accidents.  To compile the
database, NHTSA data collectors randomly sample about 48,000 reports
each year from approximately 400 police jurisdictions in 60 sites
across the country, according to NHTSA documents.  NHTSA staff then
interpret and code the data directly from the reports into a central
electronic data file.  The data are checked for consistency during
both coding and subsequent processing. 

NHTSA has recognized that its data have limitations.  For example,
the General Estimates System is based on police reports, but various
sources suggest that about half of the motor vehicle crashes in the
country are not reported to police, and the majority of these
unreported crashes involve only minor property damage and no
significant injury.  A NHTSA study of the costs of motor vehicle
injuries estimated the total count of nonfatal injuries at over 5
million compared to the General Estimates System estimate for that
year of 3.2 million.  NHTSA intends to study the unreported injury
problem.

STEP 3:  USE PERFORMANCE
INFORMATION
============================================================ Chapter 4

   Figure 4:  Use Performance
   Information

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)


The third key step in building successful results-oriented
organizations--
after establishing an organizational mission and goals and building a
performance measurement system--is to put performance data to work. 
Managers should use performance information to continuously improve
organizational processes, identify performance gaps, and set
improvement goals.\18

When the CFO Act and GPRA are fully implemented, decisionmakers are
to routinely receive the performance and cost information they need
to assess their programs and make informed decisions.  Congressional
decisionmaking should also benefit.  GPRA was intended, in part, to
improve congressional decisionmaking by giving Congress comprehensive
and reliable information on the extent to which federal programs are
fulfilling their statutory intent.  The act requires that each agency
report annually to the President and to Congress on its
performance--specifically, on the extent to which it is meeting its
annual performance goals and the actions needed to achieve or modify
those goals that have not been met.  Annual performance reports are
intended to provide important information to agency managers,
policymakers, and the public on what each agency accomplished with
the resources it was given.  The first of these reports, covering
fiscal year 1999, is due by March 31, 2000. 

In crafting GPRA, Congress recognized that different information
users would have differing information needs.  Federal agencies must
determine what information is both relevant and essential to
different internal and external information users and include only
the information the users require.\19 Most important, agency managers
need performance information to ensure that programs meet intended
goals, assess the efficiency of processes, and promote continuous
improvement.  Congress needs information on whether and in what
respects a program is working well or poorly to support its oversight
of agencies and their budgets.\20 Agencies' stakeholders need
performance information to accurately judge program effectiveness. 

In short, we have found that leading organizations that progressed
the farthest to results-oriented management did not stop after
strategic planning and performance measurement.  They applied their
acquired knowledge and data to identify gaps in their performance,
report on that performance, and finally use that information to
improve their performance to better support their missions.

   PRACTICE 6:  IDENTIFY
   PERFORMANCE GAPS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:1

Performance data can have real value only if they are used to
identify the gap between an organization's actual performance level
and the performance level it has identified as its goal.  Once the
performance gaps are identified for different program areas, managers
can determine where to target their resources to improve overall
mission accomplishment.  When managers are forced to reduce their
resources, the same analysis can help them target reductions to keep
to a minimum the threat to their organization's overall mission. 

The leading organizations we studied recognized that improvement
goals should flow from a fact-based performance analysis and be
rooted in organizational missions.\21

Such organizations typically assess which of their processes are in
greatest need of improvement in terms of cost, quality, and
timeliness.  By analyzing the gap between where they are and where
they need to be to achieve desired outcomes, management can target
those processes that are in most need of improvement, set realistic
improvement goals, and select an appropriate process improvement
technique.\22 One technique these organizations used is
benchmarking--comparing their processes with those of private and
public organizations that are thought to be the best in their fields. 
By benchmarking its own processes against those of the best in the
business, an organization can learn how much change it needs to make
and what changes might be the right ones.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  VETERANS
   HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:2

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in the Department of
Veterans Affairs runs one of the nation's largest medical care
delivery systems, consisting of a network of medical centers, nursing
homes, domiciliaries, and outpatient clinics that provide health care
services to nearly 2.8 million patients each year.  VHA recognizes
that its ability to survive growing market pressures, answer
criticisms of health care quality, and sustain and improve services
to an aging veteran population depends on its ability to analyze data
to pinpoint areas needing change and improvement.  VHA has initiated
numerous studies to identify performance gaps.  With better data in
hand, VHA is taking actions to improve its products and services. 

VHA has provided medical care to veterans for over 60 years. 
Traditionally, however, the agency has lacked the sort of data needed
to assess the quality, cost, and effectiveness of its care.  VHA's
current data analysis efforts are structured to provide caregivers
with improved data on medical outcomes.  It has begun to use this
performance information to improve service to veterans. 

An example is VHA's effort to benchmark the success of cardiac
surgeries in VHA facilities.  VHA's database, which contains over
51,000 records on cardiac surgical outcomes, is risk-adjusted for
severity of illness on the basis of 54 variables, including age and
previous medical history, collected prior to surgery.  VHA was able
to identify the differences in surgical outcomes among the 43 VHA
medical centers performing cardiac surgery.  On the basis of these
analyses, VHA recommended a number of techniques and processes for
shortening the postoperative hospital stay, decreasing excessive
diagnostic testing, and reducing the risk of postoperative infections
or complications.  According to VHA, because it adopted these and
other techniques, the performance data show that cardiac teams
lowered their mortality rates for all cardiac procedures over the
last 8 years by an average of 13 percent. 

Another VHA data analysis effort is the External Peer Review Program. 
The program compares VHA medical centers' performances against
established community standards.  As part of the effort, panels
composed of physicians not affiliated with VHA review medical records
to determine if community standards have been met.  One performance
gap VHA identified through this benchmarking was the low vaccination
rate of elderly and chronically ill VHA patients who are at high risk
for contracting one type of potentially fatal pneumonia.  VHA has
worked with the National Institute on Aging in the Department of
Health and Human Services and the American Lung Association to raise
its pneumonia immunization rate for these patients from 19 percent to
29 percent over the past 2 years. 

VHA also is analyzing performance data to switch some of its focus
from inpatient to ambulatory care.  For example, according to VHA,
after careful data analysis, its medical center in Little Rock,
Arkansas, determined that only a small percentage of the patients
admitted to its 28-day inpatient detoxification program needed acute
medical attention.  As a result, the program was converted in fiscal
year 1995 to an outpatient program with only a small inpatient
capacity.  The center reportedly now serves more patients with eight
fewer full-time staff members and anticipates that savings from the
first year of the new outpatient program will be $600,000--with no
lessening in the quality of patient care. 


   PRACTICE 7:  REPORT PERFORMANCE
   INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:3

No picture of what the government is accomplishing with the
taxpayers' money can be complete without adequate program cost and
performance information.  But this information must be presented in a
way that is useful to the many audiences who rely on it to help them
assess and manage federal programs.\23 Viewing program performance in
light of program costs--for instance, by establishing the unit cost
per output or outcome achieved--can be important on at least two
levels.  First, it can help Congress make informed decisions. 
Second, it can give the taxpayers a better understanding of what the
government is providing in return for their tax dollars. 

Consistent with GPRA's requirement that annual performance plans be
tied to budget requests, the annual performance reports, which are to
report progress toward achieving the goals established in the plans,
are to link levels of performance to the budget expenditures. 
Directly calculating unit cost information will likely become more
widespread when the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA)
is implemented.  GMRA authorized OMB, upon proper notification to
Congress, to consolidate and simplify management reports.  The CFO
Council has proposed that agencies prepare two annual reports:  a
Planning and Budgeting Report and an Accountability Report.  The two
consolidated reports would be used to present each agency's past
financial and program performance and provide a roadmap for its
future planning and budgeting actions.  At present, OMB is having six
agencies produce Accountability Reports on a pilot basis.  The
Accountability Report would eliminate the separate requirements under
various laws--such as GPRA, the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity
Act, the CFO Act, and the Prompt Payment Act.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  GPRA PILOT
   PROJECTS' FISCAL YEAR 1994
   PERFORMANCE REPORTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:4

GPRA requires that each federal agency report annually on its
performance-- specifically, on the degree to which the agency is
meeting its annual performance goals and on the actions needed to
achieve those goals that have not been met.  Under GPRA, OMB was
required to select agencies to pilot GPRA performance planning and
reporting requirements.  Forty-four pilot projects submitted reports
for the first round of performance reporting in 1995.  We identified
some individual features that when viewed as a whole, appear to have
the potential for enhancing the general usefulness of future
performance reports in providing decisionmakers and the public with
the information needed to assess progress.\24 These features would
also be appropriate for GMRA accountability reports. 

Our initial observations suggest that GPRA performance reports are
likely to be more useful if they

  -- describe the relationship between the agency's annual
     performance and its strategic goals and mission,

  -- include cost information,

  -- provide baseline and trend data,

  -- explain the uses of performance information,

  -- incorporate other relevant information, and

  -- present performance information in a user-friendly manner. 

By describing how the annual performance information it has reported
relates to its strategic goals and mission, an agency can help its
customers and stakeholders understand the relationship between the
year's accomplishments and the agency's long-range goals and reason
for existence.  By including cost information--ideally, unit cost per
output or outcome--the agency can demonstrate the cost-effectiveness
and productivity of its program efforts.  In addition, by providing
baseline and trend data--which show the agency's progress over
time--the agency can give decisionmakers a more historical
perspective within which to compare the year's performance with
performance in past years.  Similarly, by explaining the uses of the
performance information--such as the actions the agency has taken or
identified as needed, based on the data--the agency can help
decisionmakers judge the reasonableness of its performance goals and
decide upon actions they may need to take to improve the agency's
performance.  The report should include any other information that is
relevant--such as the limitations in the quality of the reported
data--that users of the report may need to help them better
understand the performance data and its context.  It is important, as
well, that the text be understandable to the nontechnical
reader--that it use clearly defined terms and appropriate,
user-friendly tables and graphs to convey information as readily as
possible.

   PRACTICE 8:  USE PERFORMANCE
   INFORMATION TO SUPPORT MISSION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:5

As efforts continue to reduce federal spending, policymakers and the
public alike are reexamining the federal government's spending
priorities.  Federal agencies are feeling the pressure to demonstrate
that they are putting the taxpayers' money to sound use.  They are
expected to demonstrate improved performance even as they cut
costs--two simultaneous demands that are driving the trend toward
results-oriented government. 

As they focus on the outcomes they hope to achieve, federal managers
increasingly are finding that the traditional ways they measured
their success--and thus the traditional ways they did business and
provided services--are no longer appropriate or practical.  For
example, the new focus on outcomes is prompting some federal agencies
to alter the approach of their programs, including working more
closely with states and local governments and businesses.  As
agencies create information systems to provide them with cost and
performance data, they discover that having the facts gives them a
basis for focusing their efforts and improving their performance. 


   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  COAST GUARD
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:6

The mission of the Coast Guard's Office of Marine Safety, Security
and Environmental Protection is to protect the public, the
environment, and U.S.  economic interests through the prevention and
mitigation of marine incidents.  In the past, the Coast Guard's
marine safety program concentrated on the physical condition of
vessels, through activities such as inspections and certifications. 
The program focused less attention on the human factors that
contribute to marine safety.  But as the office became more
outcome-oriented and made more extensive use of performance
information, it began to redirect its safety efforts.  Coast Guard
data indicate that its mission-effectiveness is now dramatically
improved. 

Traditionally, the Coast Guard based its marine safety efforts on
inspections and certifications of vessels.  It measured its
performance by counting outputs, such as the number of prior
inspections and outstanding inspection results.  But the data on
marine casualties indicated that accidents were often caused, not by
deficiencies in the vessels or other factors, but by human error. 
For example, towing industry data for 1982 through 1991 showed that
18 percent of reported casualties were caused by equipment and
material failures, 20 percent by environmental and other factors, and
62 percent by human factors. 

Putting this information to use, the Coast Guard changed the focus of
its marine safety program from outputs to outcomes in its first
business plan, dated January 1994.  After all, it came to recognize,
the mission of the marine safety program was not to do more and
better inspections of vessels, but to save lives.  As a result, the
Coast Guard shifted its resources and realigned its processes away
from inspections and toward other efforts to reduce marine
casualties.  In addition, it identified a significant role for the
towing industry in the marine safety program and looked for
opportunities to work with its stakeholders in the towing industry to
reduce casualties in their field. 

The Coast Guard and the towing industry worked to build the knowledge
and skills of entry-level crew members in the industry.  The Coast
Guard and the towing industry jointly developed training and
voluntary guidelines to reduce the causes of fatalities.  This joint
effort contributed to a significant decline in the reported towing
industry fatality rate:  from 91 per 100,000 industry employees in
1990 to 27 per 100,000 in 1995. 

The marine safety program apparently not only improved its mission
effectiveness, but did so with fewer people and at lower cost.  Since
the Coast Guard's marine safety program became a GPRA pilot program
in fiscal year 1994, the number of direct program personnel declined
and its budget was reduced by 2 percent.  According to the Coast
Guard, the program achieved its results by giving field commanders
greater authority and by investing in activities and processes that
went most directly to the goal of reducing risks on the water. 

LEADERSHIP PRACTICES REINFORCE
GPRA IMPLEMENTATION
============================================================ Chapter 5

   Figure 5:  Leadership Practices
   Reinforce GPRA Implementation

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)


GPRA will not succeed without the strong commitment of the federal
government's political and senior career leadership.  Only they can
ensure that each agency's strategic planning and performance
measurement efforts will become the basis for its day-to-day
operations.  Moreover, only they can ensure that results-oriented
management will endure despite the customarily high rate of turnover
among political appointees.\25 Some of the practices they can take to
reinforce results-oriented management are to

  -- devolve decisionmaking authority within a framework of
     mission-oriented processes in exchange for accountability for
     results,

  -- create incentives to encourage a focus on outcomes,

  -- build expertise in the necessary skills, and

  -- integrate management reforms. 

If GPRA is to thrive over the long run, its concepts need to be made
a part of organizational culture.  For that to happen, the top
leadership in each agency has to initiate results-oriented
management, keep the agency focused on it, and embed its principles
in the organization's basic approach to doing business.\26

   PRACTICE 9:  DEVOLVE
   DECISIONMAKING WITH
   ACCOUNTABILITY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:1

Leading organizations we studied create a set of mission-related
processes and systems within which to operate, but they then give
their managers extensive authority to pursue organizational goals
while using those processes and systems.  These organizations invest
the time and effort to understand their processes and how those
processes contribute to or hamper mission accomplishment.  They then
seek to ensure their processes provide managers at each
organizational level with the authority and flexibility they need to
contribute to the organization's mission.  Allowing managers to bring
their judgment to bear in meeting their responsibilities, rather than
having them merely comply with overly rigid rules and standards, can
help them make the most of their talents and lead to more effective
and efficient operations. 

In our work with foreign countries that have adopted results-oriented
management, we found that two reforms in particular were aimed at
enhancing accountability among line managers:  simplifying the rules
for such things as budgeting and human resource management while
devolving decisionmaking authority.\27 These two reforms were
undertaken in exchange for managers assuming greater accountability
for the results of their programs.  Managers generally welcomed their
new authority to make spending, personnel, and operational decisions
that had formerly been made by central authorities.  But although
these countries were generally satisfied with the progress they had
made, they continued to struggle with a number of important issues,
such as the acceptable level of risk and the extent to which
decisionmaking authority should be devolved to a given organizational
level. 


--------------------
\27 GAO/GGD-95-120, May 2, 1995. 


   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  ARMY CORPS
   OF ENGINEERS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:2

The U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Directorate's
Operation and Maintenance Program is responsible for the stewardship
of dams, levees, and other parts of the water resources
infrastructure constructed by the Corps.  Operation and maintenance
expenditures had become by fiscal year 1990 the single largest
individual program item in the Corps' budget.  In 1991, faced with
rising budget pressures, a growing project inventory, and the need to
become more results-oriented, the Corps initiated a comprehensive
review of its civil operation and maintenance program. 

One major finding of the Corps' 1993 plan of improvement was the
burdensome number of internal levels of review.  At the majority of
project sites, for example, procurement of items costing less than
$25,000 required between one and five signatures; each approval
beyond the first one added to the time required for the procurement
and created inefficiency, revenue loss, and a potential danger to the
staff and public when safety corrections were delayed. 

To remedy this situation, the Corps changed its processes by
decentralizing its organizational structure and giving project
managers new decisionmaking authority to help them achieve the
desired outcomes.  The intent of these changes was to put key
operational decisions in the hands of the managers who were closest
to the point of customer service.  These managers could now focus on,
and be held accountable for, achieving goals instead of merely
complying with rules.  Now procurements of up to $25,000 can be
approved by a single individual. 

As part of this new approach, the Corps reformed its processes,
revising its policies and procedures to ensure that only those that
were necessary remained.  It achieved this reduction, by and large,
by indicating "what" was to be accomplished and leaving the "how" to
the initiative of project staff.  Eighty-nine engineering regulations
were thereby consolidated into 7, and the number of pages of Corps'
regulations was reduced from 1,596 to 306. 

This streamlining of its organization and processes allowed the Corps
to reduce the number of its management levels.  By the Corps'
estimate, the savings created amounted to about $6 million annually
and a reduction of 175 full-time equivalent staff years. 


   PRACTICE 10:  CREATE INCENTIVES
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:3

Across government, the best incentive Congress and the executive
branch can apply to foster results-oriented management is to use
performance measurement data in their policy, program, and resource
allocation decisions and to provide agencies with the authority and
flexibility to achieve results.  Like Congress and the executive
branch, an agency's top political and career leadership can encourage
a greater accountability for results by providing managers at each
level in the organization with the appropriate authority and
flexibility to obtain those results. 

Successful organizations we studied defined their missions clearly
and communicated them to their employees--particularly to their
managers--so that each one would understand his or her contribution. 
At both the organizational and managerial levels, accountability
requires results-oriented goals and appropriate performance measures
through which to gauge progress.  Our study of several leading
foreign governments, however, showed that although there was general
agreement on how to hold organizations accountable for results, there
was as yet no such agreement on how best to hold individual managers
accountable.\28 New Zealand and the United Kingdom held their program
managers accountable for efficiently providing specific goods and
services.  Australia and Canada, on the other hand, hold their
program managers accountable for evaluating the overall effectiveness
of their programs. 

Congress and the executive branch continue to explore formal ways to
hold individual managers accountable for results.  At the agency
level, however, informal incentives are available to leaders to
encourage results-oriented management.  Through meetings and personal
contacts, for example, leaders can let managers and staff know of
their commitment to achieving the agency's goals and to keeping these
goals in mind as they pursue their day-to-day activities.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  DEPARTMENT
   OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:4

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) comprises three agencies that
provide services and benefits to veterans.  The elevation of VA to
cabinet-level status in 1989 spurred the department to make internal
management improvements.  To recognize and reinforce results-oriented
management, VA instituted in 1992 a formal recognition program for
quality achievement. 

The Robert W.  Carey Quality Award is VA's most prestigious award for
quality achievement.  It is named for Robert W.  Carey, who, as the
Director of VA's Philadelphia Regional Office, was a "Quality Leader"
and champion of excellence in the federal government.  The Carey
Award helps promote quality management within VA by giving the
department a prominent means of recognizing high-performing offices,
encouraging outcome-oriented practices, and educating VA employees
about the benefits of results-oriented management and customer
service.  According to a VA official, the Carey Award is valuable, in
part, because VA offices that want it must apply for it and the
application itself becomes a useful self-assessment tool. 

VA announced its first Carey Award in 1992.  There is one overall
trophy winner annually along with several category winners.  There
have been 20 winners to date. 


   PRACTICE 11:  BUILD EXPERTISE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:5

To make the most of results-oriented management, staff at all levels
of the organization must be skilled in strategic planning,
performance measurement, and the use of performance information in
decisionmaking.  Training has proven to be an important tool for
agencies that want to change their cultures.\29 Australian government
employees, for example, cited training as one of the factors that
contributed the most to making reforms succeed in their areas.\30

Results-oriented managers view training as an investment rather than
an expense.  And as human resource management experts at leading
private and public organizations have pointed out, organizational
learning must be continuous in order to meet changing customer needs,
keep skills up to date, and develop new personal and organizational
competencies.\31 But at a time when overall agency budgets are under
pressure, training budgets are unlikely to increase.  Therefore, it
is important that agencies develop innovative and less costly ways to
train their staffs--remembering as well that the level of return for
investing in the skills needed for results-oriented management will
depend largely on how well employees are encouraged to put those
skills to use. 

Recognizing the value of training, especially for the people at the
top of the organization, the CFO Council's GPRA Implementation
Committee has begun an outreach effort directed toward senior
managers in the 24 CFO Act agencies.  The council's goals are to
familiarize these leaders with GPRA's fundamentals and with the
importance of these fundamentals for the future of federal
management. 

In addition, in response to an initiative of the American Society for
Public Administration and with the encouragement of OMB, over 30 case
studies are being developed on the agencies' use of strategic
planning or performance measurement.  These case studies, to be
completed in the summer of 1996, are to be made publicly available.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  DEPARTMENT
   OF DEFENSE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:6

The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for the military
forces needed to deter war and protect the security of our country. 
DOD's major service branches--the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air
Force--consist of about 1.5 million men and women on active duty, 1
million members of the reserve components, and about 900,000 civilian
employees.  As with other federal agencies, performance information
is becoming an increasingly important part of DOD's budget process. 
DOD's leadership has come to recognize that if the Department is to
make results-oriented management a success, it must train its
employees in strategic planning, performance measurement, and the use
of performance information. 

DOD officials recognized when they were considering various methods
to deliver GPRA training that the costs--in both money and time--of
providing training through traditional, live classroom instruction
would be prohibitive.  As an alternative, DOD is now testing the
feasibility of training staff at its GPRA pilot agencies via
satellite.  This interactive approach can reach widely dispersed
audiences less expensively than traditional methods.  The GPRA course
originates out of a studio and has been broadcast simultaneously to
up to 20 sites around the country.  Since the first class in
September 1995, the GPRA training has been delivered 3 times via
satellite to 38 sites and has reached 760 people. 

In developing its GPRA training, DOD decided to go beyond the
traditional lecture approach to instruction.  GPRA training has
included exercises and panel discussions designed to make trainees
think the way they will need to when the training is over and the
real work of implementing GPRA begins.  Participants have been asked,
for instance, to develop mission statements for their home
organizations and to develop strategic goals and performance
measures.  According to a DOD official, the classes have been well
received. 

DOD is also developing a self-paced GPRA course accessible on the
Internet and is considering the use of CD-ROM technology. 


   PRACTICE 12:  INTEGRATE
   MANAGEMENT REFORMS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:7

Within a given federal agency, the management reforms now under way
may spring from various sources.  Some of these reforms may be
self-initiated, others may have been mandated by legislation, still
others may be the result of administration initiatives such as the
National Performance Review.  All of this reform activity needs to be
integrated, as the CFO Council urged in May 1995: 

     Existing planning, budgeting, program evaluation and fiscal
     accountability processes should be integrated with GPRA
     requirements to ensure consistency and reduce duplication of
     effort.  In addition, other management improvement efforts, such
     as implementation of the CFO Act, and FMFIA [Federal Managers'
     Financial Integrity Act], customer service initiatives,
     reengineering, and Total Quality Management, etc., should be
     incorporated into the GPRA framework to capitalize on the
     synergy and availability of key information and to improve
     responsiveness to customers and other stakeholders.\32

Another management reform initiative that provides a legislative
basis for measuring performance is the Information Technology
Management Reform Act of 1996, which requires each federal agency to
ensure that performance measures are prescribed for information
technology that it will use or acquire and that the performance
measures assess how well the information technology supports agency
programs.  In addition, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of
1994 requires the head of each executive agency to approve or define
the cost, performance, and schedule goals for major agency
acquisition programs. 

Taken together, these reforms can help redirect an organization's
culture from the traditional focus on inputs and activities to a new
focus on defining missions and achieving results.\33 Our work has
shown, however, that the top leadership of each federal agency needs
to meld these various reforms into a coherent, unified effort.\34

Top leadership--both political and career--needs to make clear its
commitment to the fundamental principles of results-oriented
management and ensure that managers and staff at all levels recognize
that they must do the same.  Traditionally, the danger to any
management reform is that it can become a hollow, paper-driven
exercise.  Leaders who integrate results-oriented management into the
culture and day-to-day activities of their organizations will help
avoid that danger.

   CASE ILLUSTRATION:  ARMY
   RESEARCH LABORATORY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:8

The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) was established in October 1992 as
a result of a realignment of a number of Army research and
development organizations.  It is now the central laboratory of the
Army Materiel Command.  At a time when both staffing levels and
funding had been in decline since fiscal year 1989, ARL was given a
major technological challenge--digitizing the battlefield for the
U.S.  Army.  ARL concluded that to ensure that it had the capability
to meet the new challenge and continue to conduct its mission of
basic and applied research, it had to work in partnership with
universities and the private sector, as well as operate more
effectively and efficiently.  This "Federated Laboratory" concept
guided ARL as it integrated the various management reforms. 

As a GPRA pilot program, ARL developed a strategic plan that included
a mission statement and long-range goals.  In addition, it has
produced two yearly products:  a performance plan with key measures
and a report detailing its progress in meeting its goals.  The annual
reports have been integrated into ARL's planning and budgeting
processes and are discussed by agency leadership at the Director's
quarterly meetings.  In addition, the reports have been tied into
DOD's Planning, Programming, Budget, and Execution System.  ARL's
performance measures gauge the relevance of ARL's current work to the
agency's long-term goals and give ARL's leaders indicators of
productivity and quality.  As part of its performance measurement
efforts, ARL established customer service standards and sent surveys
to its customers to obtain feedback on the quality of its work. 

As a National Performance Review "reinvention laboratory," ARL has
been granted waivers by DOD and the Army from internal regulations in
order to streamline its processes.  For example, one such waiver
allowed ARL to eliminate redundant reviews of certain procurements,
thereby saving 5 workdays on each procurement.  Saving time on
administrative processes frees staff to perform the principal mission
of the laboratory. 


-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5:8.1

Facing pressures similar to those confronting federal managers to
reduce costs and improve performance, leading state and foreign
governments have responded by implementing management reform efforts
consistent with GPRA.  The experiences of these governments--and
those of the federal GPRA pilots--demonstrate that each federal
agency will need to chart its own course in response to its specific
environment as it seeks to implement GPRA and become more
results-oriented.  Nonetheless, the experiences of the leading
organizations suggest that the steps and practices discussed in this
guide can assist agencies in successfully implementing GPRA.  Federal
agencies that apply the practices may find that their transition to a
results orientation is quicker, smoother, and, most important, more
successful in providing the effective and efficient government the
American people deserve. 


OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT
PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT
=========================================================== Appendix I

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) is the primary
legislative framework through which agencies will be required to set
strategic goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to
which goals were met.  It requires each federal agency to develop, no
later than by the end of fiscal year 1997, strategic plans that cover
a period of at least 5 years and include the agency's mission
statement; identify the agency's long-term strategic goals; and
describe how the agency intends to achieve those goals through its
activities and through its human, capital, information, and other
resources.  Under GPRA, agency strategic plans are the starting point
for agencies to set annual goals for programs and to measure the
performance of the programs in achieving those goals. 

Also, GPRA requires each agency to submit to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), beginning for fiscal year 1999, an annual
performance plan.  The first annual performance plans are to be
submitted in the fall of 1997.  The annual performance plan is to
provide the direct linkage between the strategic goals outlined in
the agency's strategic plan and what managers and employees do
day-to-day.  In essence, this plan is to contain the annual
performance goals the agency will use to gauge its progress toward
accomplishing its strategic goals and identify the performance
measures the agency will use to assess its progress.  Also, OMB will
use individual agencies' performance plans to develop an overall
federal government performance plan that OMB is to submit annually to
Congress with the president's budget, beginning for fiscal year 1999. 

GPRA requires that each agency submit to the President and to the
appropriate authorization and appropriations committees of Congress
an annual report on program performance for the previous fiscal year
(copies are to be provided to other congressional committees and to
the public upon request).  The first of these reports, on program
performance for fiscal year 1999, is due by March 31, 2000, and
subsequent reports are due by March 31 for the years that follow. 
However, for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, agencies' reports are to
include performance data beginning with fiscal year 1999.  For each
subsequent year, agencies are to include performance data for the
year covered by the report and 3 prior years. 

In each report, an agency is to review and discuss its performance
compared with the performance goals it established in its annual
performance plan.  When a goal is not met, the agency's report is to
explain the reasons the goal was not met; plans and schedules for
meeting the goal; and, if the goal was impractical or not feasible,
the reasons for that and the actions recommended.  Actions needed to
accomplish a goal could include legislative, regulatory, or other
actions or, when the agency found a goal to be impractical or
infeasible, a discussion of whether the goal ought to be modified. 

In addition to evaluating the progress made toward achieving annual
goals established in the performance plan for the fiscal year covered
by the report, an agency's program performance report is to evaluate
the agency's performance plan for the fiscal year in which the
performance report was submitted (for example, in their fiscal year
1999 performance reports, due by March 31, 2000, agencies are
required to evaluate their performance plans for fiscal year 2000 on
the basis of their reported performance in fiscal year 1999).  This
evaluation will help to show how an agency's actual performance is
influencing its plans.  Finally, the report is to include the summary
findings of program evaluations completed during the fiscal year
covered by the report. 

Congress recognized that in some cases not all of the performance
data will be available in time for the March 31 reporting date.  In
such cases, agencies are to provide whatever data are available, with
a notation as to their incomplete status.  Subsequent annual reports
are to include the complete data as part of the trend information. 

In crafting GPRA, Congress also recognized that managerial
accountability for results is linked to managers having sufficient
flexibility, discretion, and authority to accomplish desired results. 
GPRA authorizes agencies to apply for managerial flexibility waivers
in their annual performance plans beginning with fiscal year 1999. 
The authority of agencies to request waivers of administrative
procedural requirements and controls is intended to provide federal
managers with more flexibility to structure agency systems to better
support program goals.  The nonstatutory requirements that OMB can
waive under GPRA generally involve the allocation and use of
resources, such as restrictions on shifting funds among items within
a budget account.  Agencies must report in their annual performance
reports on the use and effectiveness of any GPRA managerial
flexibility waivers that they receive. 

GPRA calls for phased implementation so that selected pilot projects
in the agencies can develop experience from implementing GPRA
requirements in fiscal years 1994 through 1996 before implementation
is required for all agencies.  As of June 1996, 68 pilot projects for
performance planning and performance reporting were under way in 24
agencies.  OMB also is required to select at least five agencies from
among the initial pilot agencies to pilot managerial accountability
and flexibility for fiscal years 1995 and 1996; however, as of June
1996 it had not done so. 

Finally, GPRA requires OMB to select at least five agencies, at least
three of which have had experience developing performance plans
during the initial GPRA pilot phase, to test performance budgeting
for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.  Performance budgets to be prepared
by pilot projects for performance budgeting are intended to provide
Congress with information on the direct relationship between proposed
program spending and expected program results and the anticipated
effects of varying spending levels on results. 


OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
========================================================== Appendix II

Our objectives were to (1) identify and describe the practices most
helpful to successfully implementing GPRA and related
results-oriented management initiatives and (2) provide case
illustrations of federal organizations that have made progress in
implementing each practice.  This report builds on (1) our 1994
report profiling leading private and public sector organizations that
have successfully improved mission performance and program outcomes
through the innovative use of information management and technology
and (2) our 1995 report on the human resource management principles
employed by selected public and private organizations to build and
sustain high levels of organizational performance.\35 Together, these
reports are intended to suggest frameworks for Congress and federal
agencies to use in implementing GPRA and related results-oriented
management initiatives. 

To meet our first objective, we reviewed the experiences of leading
public sector organizations that were successfully changing their
management and accountability practices to be more results-oriented. 
As part of that effort, we issued separate reports on the experiences
of six leading U.S.  state and four foreign governments.\36 We also
reviewed the management studies of 23 large federal departments and
agencies that we did during the last decade as well as a broad array
of our other management and program work.  To supplement our work
looking at leading organizations, we identified and reviewed a large
body of literature on management reform, strategic planning, and
performance measurement.  From our work, we identified a number of
practices common to successful efforts to become more
results-oriented.  We obtained input from a wide range of federal
executives and managers and experts in public sector strategic
planning, performance measurement, and program and policy evaluation,
including those from the Departments of Defense, Commerce,
Transportation, and the Treasury; OMB; the Office of Personnel
Management; the National Academy of Public Administration; the Urban
Institute; and the University of Southern California.  On the basis
of their comments and our continuing reviews of leading
organizations, we consolidated and refined the list of practices to
those presented in this guide. 

To meet our second objective, we identified those federal agencies
that were instituting results-oriented management from our ongoing
work on the implementation of GPRA at 24 departments and large
agencies (covering about 98 percent of the federal government's
fiscal year 1994 outlays) and OMB's identification of agencies making
early progress in implementing selected aspects of GPRA.  In this
way, we targeted our work toward agencies that would provide examples
illustrating each of the practices.  The fact that an organization is
profiled for a particular practice is not meant to imply the
organization's success or lack of success in meeting other practices. 
Moreover, underscoring the fact that implementing management changes
required by GPRA will not come quickly, most of the agencies profiled
began their results-oriented management before GPRA was enacted.  We
interviewed agency officials in program offices, strategic planning
and quality management offices, and planning and evaluation offices. 
We also reviewed agency documents, such as strategic plans,
performance plans, performance reports, program descriptions and
documentation, and other related documents. 

We did our work on this guide from January 1995 to March 1996 in
Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards.  The steps and practices presented in this
executive guide are largely a synthesis of previously published
information and analysis. 

We provided a draft of this guide to OMB, the CFO Council's GPRA
Implementation Committee, and to the individual agencies profiled in
the case illustrations for their review and comment.  OMB noted that
the guide and the practices suggested in it will help federal
agencies as they implement GPRA.  OMB also expressed support for the
guide's focus on agency use of performance information to improve
management and program performance and to demonstrate that federal
agencies are using taxpayers' money effectively.  OMB concurred with
our observation that the federal government is at the beginning,
rather than the end, of the process of turning itself into a more
accountable, better managed, more effective organization.  Finally,
OMB noted that the development and refinement of performance measures
will be an ongoing process. 

We also provided copies of a draft of this guide for comment to the
agency representatives on the CFO Council's GPRA Implementation
Committee and incorporated their individual comments as appropriate. 
Generally, their comments suggested that the steps and practices we
identified from the leading organizations studied were valid and
complete, and that the case illustrations were accurate to the best
of their knowledge.  We also asked officials in each of the agencies
profiled as case illustrations to verify the accuracy of the
information presented on their respective agencies; however, we did
not independently verify the accuracy of that information.

<P>TRANSMITTAL SHEET NO. 6-33

<P>Effective Date:  Immediately

<P>Material Transmitted:  Revision of Chapter 3 and Section
        5.3 of Chapter 5

<P> Purpose:  The General Accounting Office has revised
        chapter 3 and section 5.3 of chapter 5 of Title 6 of GAO's
        Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal
        Agencies.  The revisions cover internal controls over time
        and attendance (T&amp;A) reporting and situations where
        employee pay is not sufficient to permit all deductions. 
        The changes to T&amp;A reporting are the result of advancing
        technology and current initiatives to simplify
        administrative operations.  The changes that have been
        made should provide agencies with sufficient flexibility
        to streamline T&amp;A systems and implement steps to reduce
        costs.  We will monitor implementation of this new
        guidance and make additional refinements to further
        simplify T&amp;A operations and reduce costs within the
        parameters set forth by law, regulation, and good internal
        controls.
   <P>     
        This revision replaces chapter 3 of the May 1989 edition
        of Title 6.  Elimination of the order of precedence for
        deductions is in response to the requirements of the Hatch
        Act Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103-94, that were
        passed subsequent to the last revision of Title 6.  This
        revision also replaces section 5.3 in chapter 5.
        
        The principal changes include
     <UL>   
      <LI>  greater emphasis of agency's responsibility to have in
           place a system of internal controls that ensures 
         (1) proper authorization and approval of T&amp;A
                 transactions and (2) maintenance of complete and
                 accurate T&amp;A records,

         <LI> elimination of  specific procedural requirements,
        
         <LI>  discussion of requirements for using electronic
         signatures,
        
        <LI>  discussion of exception-based T&amp;A reporting systems and
                    minimum requirements, and

<P>3.1  INTRODUCTION

<P>     This chapter distinguishes between civilian employees, who are expected to be
     &quot;working,&quot; usually during certain times and other civilian employees and members
     of the active duty armed services, who are expected to be in a &quot;duty status.&quot;   Part
     I sets forth guidance for civilian employees and part II sets forth the guidance for
     military service members.  Employees who are paid regardless of their presence or
     absence and who do not accrue leave under 5 U.S.C. 6301 et seq., such as certain
     political appointees, are exempt from the provisions of this chapter.  [See
     Comptroller General Decision B-123698 (May 10, 1978).]

<P>     For the past several years, T&amp;A systems have been undergoing significant changes due to more flexible work schedules and places, increased use of automation, and the downsizing movement in government.  These trends have resulted in a changing internal control environment and are the basis for revising this chapter.

<P>
<P>PART I:  CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES

<P>3.2  GUIDANCE PROVIDED
   IN THIS CHAPTER

<P>   The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance to agencies on T&amp;A systems.  It
   identifies the internal control objectives that T&amp;A systems must meet and describes
   several requirements that must be addressed to help accomplish these control
   objectives.  With few exceptions, the particular internal control techniques needed to accomplish the objectives are not specified.  Rather, this chapter is intended to
   provide agencies sufficient flexibility to implement T&amp;A systems best suited to their
   needs and to implement the techniques they feel can best achieve the control
   objectives in their systems.

<P>3.3  INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES
        IN T&amp;A SYSTEMS

<P>   The primary objective of T&amp;A systems is to ensure that the hours worked, hours in
   pay status, and hours absent of employees/service members are properly reported. 
   Reliable data are important to accurately compute and account for computed pay,
   leave, and allowances.  To achieve this objective, management should have in place
   internal control systems that provide reasonable assurance that (1) T&amp;A transactions
   are properly authorized and approved and (2) T&amp;A data is completely and accurately
   recorded and retained.

<P>   A. T&amp;A Transactions Are Properly
      Authorized and Approved

<P>     The nature and extent of approvals of T&amp;A transactions will vary among T&amp;A
     systems depending upon the specific aspects of the system.  By their design, some
     systems, such as fully automated ones, may require fewer approvals than manual
     systems and will use automated signatures instead of the handwritten ones in
     manual systems.  Nevertheless, the nature and extent of T&amp;A approvals must be
     such that management knows that supervisors or other officials are accountable
     for approvals of employees' worktime and absences.  This helps ensure that
     accurate T&amp;A information is recorded and reported for the purposes of computing
     pay and allowances.

<P>     Primary responsibility for authorizing and approving T&amp;A transactions generally
     rests with employees' supervisors, who approve employees' T&amp;A reports. 
     Timekeepers and supervisors must be aware of the work time or absence of
     employees for whom they are responsible to ensure the reliability of T&amp;A data.  To
     the extent practical, changes to employees' normal work schedule should generally
     be approved prior to the change actually occurring.  Unanticipated changes should
     be approved as soon as possible.

<P>   B. T&amp;A Data Are Complete and Accurate

<P>     Because most federal civilian employees are paid on an hourly basis (or fractions
     of an hour) and earn and charge leave on that basis, a complete and accurate
     record of the hours (or fractions of an hour) an employee works must be retained
     as an official agency record available for review or inspection.  To provide a basis
     for pay, leave, and benefits, the records must include aggregate hours of regular
     time, other time (such as overtime, credit hours, or compensatory time), and
     leave.  To help ensure accuracy, the completed records must be approved by the 

<P>
<P>     supervisor (or other equivalent official) and, in an automated environment, checked
     by system edits and other tests to verify that recorded worktime is reasonable and
     allowable.

<P>3.4  RELIANCE ON INTERNAL
   CONTROLS IN T&amp;A SYSTEMS

<P>   As T&amp;A systems move away from traditional methods of recording and reporting
   employee work and leave times, it is important to implement and maintain a well
   defined system that provides management continuous confidence that controls are
   working as designed.  This can be done through:
<OL>
<LI>      A well-defined organizational structure and flow of T&amp;A data, with clearly
        written policies and procedures setting forth the responsibilities of employees,
        timekeepers (if applicable), and supervisors regarding recording, examining,
        and approving T&amp;A transactions.

<LI>   Effective application of available technology and concepts to achieve efficient
        and effective T&amp;A system processes in accordance with applicable
        requirements and the environment in which the agency operates.

<LI>   The ability to record payroll costs by appropriation, organizational code, and
        work activity to facilitate application of required cost accounting for financial
        and program management.  

<LI>   Review and testing of all aspects of the T&amp;A systems' processing procedures
        and controls in sufficient scope, depth, and frequency to provide reasonable
        assurance that key procedures and controls are working and effective and that
        employee integrity is maintained.
</OL>
<P>   Agencies' T&amp;A systems are subject to periodic review under the Federal Managers'
   Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) (31 U.S.C. 3512(d)). 

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>3.5  RECORDING AND MAINTAINING
   COMPLETE AND ACCURATE T&amp;A
     RECORDS

<P>   A. Data Contained on T&amp;A Reports

<P>     Because pay is based on a biweekly period, T&amp;A reports should generally cover no
     more than one biweekly pay period and include the following information for each
     employee:

<OL>       <LI> Employee name and identifying number (such as a social security number) .
      <LI> Pay period number or dates.
       <LI>  Aggregate number of hours worked for the pay period.
       <LI>   Aggregate number of hours of premium pay, by type of premium pay, to
             which the employee is entitled.
        <LI>   Dates and number of hours of leave (by type), credit hours and
             compensatory hours earned and used.
        <LI>   Evidence of approval by an authorized official (usually the supervisor).
        <LI>   Any required supporting documentation or records for absences.
            <LI>     Such other information as agencies believe necessary in support of
                    operations.
</OL>
<P>        A T&amp;A record containing all required data elements can be (1) a hard copy
        document completed manually, (2) an automated file retained electronically, or
        (3) a combination of automated and manual records.  The data contained in
        the T&amp;A records should be linked to  accounting records that can provide
        support for financial reporting and allocation of costs.

<P>     B. Recording T&amp;A Data

<P>        Agency policy must affix accountability for recording T&amp;A
        data referred to in 3.5.A. The data may be recorded by the
          1. individual employee,
          2. timekeeper, 
          3. supervisor, or
          4. combination of these persons.

<P>        Regardless of who records the data, the T&amp;A system must be able to identify
        the individual responsible for recording the data.  If the employee is not
        recording his or her T&amp;A data, the basis for recording the data could be (1) the
        timekeeper's or supervisor's observation, (2) time clocks, or other automated
        timekeeping devices, where not prohibited by law, or (3) other applicable
        techniques.  The person recording the T&amp;A data acknowledges responsibility
        for the accuracy of the recorded data.

<P>        Because T&amp;A systems may differ, the point at which T&amp;A data are recorded
        can vary among different T&amp;A systems.  For example, T&amp;A data may be
        recorded (1) daily, (2) when deviations occur from an individual's or agency's
        established work schedule, or (3) at the end of the pay period.  Regardless of
        the timing of recording T&amp;A data, management must have in place a system of
        control techniques that give reasonable assurance that integrity of the data is
        maintained.

<P>     C. Other T&amp;A Records

<P>        Other documents supporting T&amp;A records should be completed and
        maintained.  Examples of such documents include those for establishing 
        (1) work schedules (2) flexiplace arrangements, (3) leave, (4) overtime, 
        (5) compensatory time earned and used, (6) credit hours earned and used
        under an alternative work schedule, (7) number of unscheduled duty hours,
        etc.  The records must show (1) employees' pay period schedules indicating
        planned start and stop work times and hours per day for established work
        schedules, (2) the aggregate hours (or fractions of hours) and days employees
        worked regular hours, worked overtime, took leave, or used earned
        compensatory time or credit hours, and (3) approval by the supervisor. 
        Concerning overtime, in order for the agency to properly document and
        calculate an employee's overtime pay entitlements under title 5 of the U.S.
        code (5 U.S.C. chapter 55 and 61 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C.
        201 et seq.)), the records must distinguish between regular overtime and
        irregular or occasional overtime.

<P>     D. Employees Temporarily Assigned to Another Agency 

<P>        When an employee is on temporary assignment to another agency, the agency
        to which the employee is detailed must record T&amp;A data for the employee in
        accordance with the requirements of this title and report the information to his
        or her home agency promptly to facilitate disbursement of pay by the home
        agency.

<P>3.6  AUTHORIZING AND APPROVING
   T&amp;A TRANSACTIONS

<P>   A. Attestations, Verifications, and Approvals
     
     This section (1) defines attestations, verifications, and approvals and (2) discusses
     how attestations, verifications, and approvals can be indicated in a manual or
     automated T&amp;A system.

<P>     Attestation refers to employees affirming T&amp;A data to be true and correct. 
     Verifications are confirmations, usually by timekeepers or supervisors, that
     recorded information is true, correct, and accurate to the best of their knowledge. 
     Approvals are supervisors', other equivalent officials', or higher level managers'
     agreement, ratification, or concurrence to planned work schedules and leave of
     employees or actual T&amp;A data.  Such approvals represent that actual work
     schedules recorded by employees or timekeepers are to the best of the approving
     official's knowledge true, correct, and accurate, and in accordance with applicable
     laws, regulations, and legal decisions.  Approving officials acknowledge awareness
     and understanding of their responsibilities when approving T&amp;A data.

<P>     The evidence showing attestations, verifications, and approvals will differ between
     manual and automated systems.  In manual systems attestations, verifications, and
     approvals are usually shown by a signature or initial of an individual on a hard-
     copy document; in automated systems, they are represented by electronic
     programmed data elements.  The programmed data elements can vary from user
     identification codes and passwords to electronic signatures.  The degree of control
     in automated systems over T&amp;A data and the reliability of data will vary depending
     on the type of programmed data elements used in the attestation, verification, and
     approval. User identification codes and passwords provide less control over data
     than do electronic signatures.

<P>     In automated systems, electronic signatures are required to be used for indicating
     approvals but need not be used for attestations and verifications, if management so
     chooses to require such attestations and verifications.  If management requires
     attestations and verifications in an automated T&amp;A system, a review of the system
     and related risks should be made to help determine the type of automated
     attestation and verification to implement.  Based on the results of the review,
     management may use passwords or user ID codes if it believes that through such
     means it can obtain reasonable assurance that T&amp;A data accurately represent an
     employee's actual work schedule, type of hours worked, and leave.

<P>     Because of the nature of an electronic document, it is difficult to ascertain whether
     the data have been altered unless the signature is linked to the data in such a way
     that the signature verification process can detect data changes.  Electronic
     signatures are linked to the data so that if the data are changed, the signature is
     invalidated.  Traditional passwords and user identification codes do not contain
     this control.  For this reason, electronic signatures are preferred.

<P>     The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established
     procedures for the evaluation and approval of certain automated signature
     techniques to ensure the integrity of the data and compliance with the previously
     mentioned criteria.  The electronic signatures should conform with the
     requirements issued by NIST and also use algorithms and techniques approved by
     NIST.

<P>   B. Authorizing An Employee's Work Schedule
     When (1) an employee's work schedule differs from the agencywide schedule
     established by management or (2) reflects a flexible work program, an employee's
     work schedule must, when feasible, be approved by the supervisor or the official
     most knowledgeable of the employee's schedule in advance of the period when the
     plan takes effect. When not feasible, the plan should be approved as soon after the
     start of the pay period as possible.

<P>     Approval must be granted for overtime before the work has been performed when
     feasible and, when not feasible, as soon as possible after the work has been
     performed.  Care must be taken to distinguish between regular overtime and
     irregular overtime or occasional overtime (or compensatory time in lieu of
     overtime, where allowed) in order for  the agency to properly document and
     calculate an employee's overtime pay entitlements under title 5 of the U.S. Code (5
     U.S.C. chapters 55 and 61) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).

<P>   C. Approval of Leave

<P>     Approval of leave must be made before the leave is taken when practical.  If
     impractical, leave must be approved as soon as reasonably possible after taken.

<P>   D. Attestation and Verification
     by Employees and Timekeepers

<P>     Employees and timekeepers are not required to attest or verify T&amp;A reports and
     related documents.  However, if management requires such attestations and/or
     verifications, they should be performed as close to the end of the pay period as
     possible.  When not possible until after the end of the pay period, a copy of the
     T&amp;A report and related documents, when applicable, should be provided to the
     employee promptly for attestation and to the timekeeper promptly for verification. 
     Employees and/or timekeepers should disclose any discrepancies to supervisors
     promptly.  Supervisors should resolve such discrepancies promptly.

<P>   E. Approval of T&amp;A Reports and Related Records

<P>     All T&amp;A reports and related supporting documents (such as overtime pay
     authorizations) must be reviewed and approved by an authorized official.  Review
     and approval should be made by the official, normally the immediate supervisor,
     most knowledgeable of the time worked and absence of the employees involved. 
     Approval of T&amp;A reports and related documents should be based on personal
     observation, work output, timekeeper verification, checking data against other
     independent sources, reliance on other controls, or a combination of these
     methods.

<P>     The official most knowledgeable of the time worked should approve any overtime
     or compensatory time.  Care should be taken (1) to ensure that the overtime was
     approved, preferably in advance, and (2) that the amount and time of overtime
     (regular or irregular), credit hours, and compensatory time is accurately recorded.

<P>     If practical, T&amp;A data must be approved at the end of the last day of the pay
     period or later.  When this is not feasible because of payroll processing
     requirements to meet established paydays, T&amp;A data must be prepared and
     approved as close to the end of the pay period as possible to still allow processing
     of the payroll by payday.

<P>   F. Adjustments or Corrections After the T&amp;A Period Ends

<P>     Adjustments or corrections required because of changes after T&amp;A data were
     approved must be made in the payroll system and reflected in pay for the pay
     period to which the changes apply, when possible. When not possible, adjustments
     must be made as soon after discovery as practical.  Any changes must be approved
     by an authorizing official before being entered into the payroll system.

<P>   G. Self-Approval of T&amp;A Reports

<P>     In general, employees may not approve their own T&amp;A data.  However, the head of
     an agency (or designee) may authorize particular individuals to approve their own
     T&amp;A data in certain situations.  In these situations, an official authorized by the
     agency head (or designee) must grant advance authority in writing, and agencies
     must ensure that effective controls are in place.

<P>     Exceptions to the general prohibition of employees approving their own T&amp;A data
     are intended to apply when it is not feasible to have their T&amp;A data approved by a
     supervisor.  These exceptions include but are not necessarily limited to 
     (1) employees working alone at a remote site for long periods and (2) employees
     based at the same duty station as their supervisors or timekeepers but frequently
     away from the same general location.  In other situations when it is not practical
     for the supervisor to approve T&amp;A data promptly, the employee may be paid and
     the supervisor may subsequently review and approve the data.

<P>3.7  TRANSMITTING T&amp;A INFORMATION TO PAYROLL

<P>   T&amp;A information must be transmitted to the payroll system for all employees or,
   under exception-based systems, for employees who have changes to their normal
   work schedules.  While the choice of methods used to transmit the T&amp;A data may be
   based on cost-effectiveness and management information needs, the system used to
   transmit the information must protect T&amp;A data from unauthorized change or
   alteration and must generate a record of any change made.  Any change to
   previously attested to and approved data must be reviewed by and attested to by the
   employee to whom the data relate and must also be reviewed by and approved by an
   authorized official.

<P>
<P>3.8  EXCEPTION-BASED SYSTEMS

<P>   Exception-based reporting systems can exist when employees schedules are
   established, either through management designated work schedules or by mutual
   agreement between employees and management.  When employees' arrival and
   departure times for a pay period are established, these schedules become the basis
   for recorded T&amp;A data unless material variances or deviations occur.  Material
   variances or deviations must be approved by the supervisor before the change
   occurs, if feasible, or promptly after occurring, if not feasible.  As part of their
   approval of the change, supervisors or designees must verify that the dates and
   amounts of material changes have been recorded in the appropriate T&amp;A record.

<P>3.9  IMPLEMENTING OTHER T&amp;A METHODS
   NOT PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CHAPTER

<P>   Agencies may select other methods that suit their circumstances and that meet the
   internal control objectives mentioned earlier in this chapter.  In doing so, agencies
   should consider the cost of additional requirements against the benefits received. 
   Questions on interpretations of the material covered in this chapter or on
   acceptability of methods not covered may be made to the Assistant Comptroller
   General for Accounting and Information Management, U.S. General Accounting
   Office, 441 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20548.

<P>
<P>
<P>PART II:  MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS

<P>3.10 ACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL

<P>   Active military personnel are considered to be on duty 24 hours a day.  Because the
   nature of some military assignments makes a confirmation of the presence at duty
   stations difficult, if not impossible, the recording of presence of duty and of specific
   hours during which duty is performed each day is not required.  However, superiors
   are expected to be aware of the presence and absence of service members for whom
   they are responsible.  When a service member is on temporary assignment to
   another component of the armed services or to a civilian agency, the entity to which
   the service member is detailed must provide time and attendance recording for the
   service member and report the information to his or her home component promptly
   to facilitate payment of basic pay and allowances by (or through) the home
   component.

<P>   Absence reports must be maintained daily to indicate those service members who
   are to be charged leave and those who are not present for duty but who should be. 
   Examples of reports which might contain such data are &quot;morning&quot; or &quot;day&quot; reports,
   strength reports, unit diaries, and other similar reports.
   Information on absences which affect pay should be compiled each pay period and
   be transmitted to the payroll system.  Without such information, the payroll system
   may pay the member for authorized pay and allowances.  In either case, the
   following requirements for review and approval must be met:
<OL>
<LI>  Reports of such information and related supporting documents must be
        reviewed and approved by a designated authorizing official who is aware of the
        responsibilities for ensuring accuracy of the reports.

<LI> Approval of such reports will be made at the end of the last day of the pay
        period whenever possible.  When this is not possible because of payroll
        processing requirements to meet established paydays, documents must be
        approved as close to the end of the pay period as possible. 

<LI>  Approval must be done in accordance with section 3.6.A. of this chapter.

<LI>  Any adjustments required because of changes in reported absences after the
        reports were approved and transmitted to the payroll system must be made
        and reflected in the pay period to which the changes apply, when possible, or,
        when not possible, adjusted as soon as possible, preferably in the next pay
        period.
</OL>
<P>   Any changes must be approved by the authorizing official prior to being entered into
   the payroll system.  Service members may not approve their own absence reports
   unless prior authority to do so is granted in writing by an authorized official.

<P>   When feasible, cost-effective, and desirable, attendance reporting and related internal
   controls set forth in part I of this chapter should be instituted for service members
   to the extent management deems appropriate.

<P>3.11 MILITARY RESERVISTS

<P>   The work of military reservists is sometimes suited to the T&amp;A requirements for
   civilian employees set forth in part I of this chapter.  In other cases, it is more like
   that of active military service members, making the requirements set forth in section
   3.10 more appropriate.  When reservists perform duties suited to application of the
   requirements in part I, those requirements must be imposed and met.  However,
   when reservists perform duties that are not suited to application of the requirements
   in part I because application would make them impractical or infeasible, the
   requirements in section 3.10 above must be imposed and met.  When placed on
   active duty status, reservists will be subject to the T&amp;A criteria in section 3.10.


<P>5.3  INSUFFICIENT PAY TO COVER DEDUCTIONS

<P>   If the gross pay of an employee is not sufficient to permit all deductions to be made,
   the following regulations apply:
 
        
        Section 550.301 of subpart C--Allotments and Assignments from Federal
        Employees--of part 550--Pay Administration (General)--of title 5, Code of
        Federal Regulations, which identifies the deductions to be applied in
        determining the net pay from which allotments and assignments of pay are
        made; 

<P>        Section 550.805(c) of subpart H--Back Pay--of part 550--Pay Administration
        (General)--of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, which provides the order of
        precedence for deductions from back pay awards; 

<P>        Section 550.1104 of subpart K--Collection by Offset From Indebted Government
        Employees--of part 550--Pay Administration (General)--of title 5, Code of
        Federal Regulations, which identifies the deductions to be applied in
        determining the amount of disposable pay subject to offset.

<P>     Agencies should contact OPM should questions arise concerning the
     aforementioned regulations.

<P><B>Context: OMB's Role</B><BR>

<P><B>OMB's predominant mission is to assist the President in overseeing the preparation of the Federal<BR>
budget and to supervise its administration in Executive Branch agencies. In helping to formulate the<BR>
President's spending plans, OMB evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and<BR>
procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB<BR>
ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the<BR>
President's budget and with Administration policies. </B><BR>

<P><B>In addition, OMB oversees and coordinates the Administration's procurement, financial<BR>
management, information, and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's role is to help<BR>
improve administrative management, to develop better performance measures and coordinating<BR>
mechanisms, and to reduce any unnecessary burdens on the public.</B><BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Background<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) assigns <BR>

<P>the Director of OMB responsibility for maintaining a <BR>

<P>comprehensive set of information resources management (IRM) <BR>

<P>policies and for promoting the application of information <BR>

<P>technology to improve the use and dissemination of information by <BR>

<P>Federal agencies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To fulfill these responsibilities, OMB issued Circular No. A-130, <BR>

<P>Management of Federal Information Resources (50 FR 52730; <BR>

<P>December 24, 1985), which provided a policy framework for the <BR>

<P>management of Federal information resources. Since the Circular <BR>

<P>was issued in 1985, Federal agencies have introduced major new <BR>

<P>information programs involving the electronic collection and <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>dissemination of information. Congress has also enacted several <BR>

<P>laws bearing on the Circular, especially amendments to the PRA <BR>

<P>(Public Law 99-500), the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public <BR>

<P>Law 100-235), the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of <BR>

<P>1988 (Public Law 100-503), and the Computer Matching and Privacy <BR>

<P>Protection Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101- 508). Since <BR>

<P>publication of the Circular, OMB has addressed the need for <BR>

<P>additional guidance in several notices:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1) Notice of Policy Guidance on Electronic Collection of <BR>

<P>Information (52 FR 29454; August 7, 1987);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) Advance Notice of Further Policy Development on Dissemination <BR>

<P>of Information (54 FR 214; January 4, 1989);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) Second Advance Notice of Further Policy Development on <BR>

<P>Dissemination of Information (54 FR 25554; June 15, 1989);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4) Advance Notice of Plans for Revision of OMB Circular No. <BR>

<P>A-130 (56 FR 9026; March 4, 1991);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5) Proposed Revision of OMB Circular No. A-130 (57 FR 18296; <BR>

<P>April 29, 1992).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Also, consistent with the October 1, 1991, Notice of Rescission <BR>

<P>of OMB Circulars (56 FR 49824), OMB is incorporating into <BR>

<P>Circular No. A-130 certain provisions of existing Circular No. <BR>

<P>A-3, Government Publications, and of Circular No. A-114, <BR>

<P>Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities. As of the effective <BR>

<P>date of these revisions, Circular Nos. A-3 and A-114 are <BR>

<P>rescinded.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The purpose of the revision is to bring into proper perspective <BR>

<P>the following key areas that were not sufficiently emphasized in <BR>

<P>the original circular:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1) IRM planning, with special focus on the information life <BR>

<P>cycle.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) The role of State and local governments in the management of <BR>

<P>information resources, and the need for Federal agencies to <BR>

<P>consider the effects of their information activities on those <BR>

<P>governments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) Records management, with a special focus on the need to <BR>

<P>properly manage electronic records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4) Electronic collection and dissemination of information, <BR>

<P>identifying those conditions where agencies should consider using <BR>

<P>electronic techniques in order to reduce costs or provide better <BR>

<P>services.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5) Information dissemination policy, stating the basic <BR>

<P>responsibility of all agencies to disseminate information <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>consistent with their missions, and laying out the structure and <BR>

<P>substance of agency dissemination management programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Structure of this Revision<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This revision affects primarily Section 6 of the Circular, <BR>

<P>Definitions; Section 7, Basic Considerations and Assumptions; <BR>

<P>Section 8a, Information Management Policy, and Appendix IV, <BR>

<P>Analysis of Key Sections. Minor changes are made in other <BR>

<P>sections. The structural outline of the Circular, together with <BR>

<P>notations as to which parts are changed, is presented below.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Summary of Revisions<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 3. Authorities. This notice adds a reference to the <BR>

<P>Computer Security Act of 1987 and the Chief Financial Officers <BR>

<P>Act of 1990.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6. Definitions. OMB defines the terms ``record'' and <BR>

<P>``records management'' as set forth at 44 U.S.C. 3301 and 44 <BR>

<P>U.S.C. 2901(2) respectively because the newly proposed policy <BR>

<P>explicitly covers records management, and defines the terms <BR>

<P>``information life cycle'' and ``information dissemination <BR>

<P>product'' because policy statements regarding records management <BR>

<P>and information dissemination use the terms. The term <BR>

<P>``audiovisual production'' is defined in order to incorporate <BR>

<P>policy presently contained in Circular No. A-114. The revision <BR>

<P>modifies the definition of the term ``information'' for clarity. <BR>

<P>The term ``government information'' is expanded to include <BR>

<P>information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or <BR>

<P>disposed of by ``or for'' the Federal Government. The term <BR>

<P>``access to information'' is deleted because its use has caused <BR>

<P>confusion.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 7. Basic Considerations and Assumptions. Aside from minor <BR>

<P>stylistic changes and renumbering, the revisions are as follows:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection 7d revises a statement, taken from the public notice <BR>

<P>of June 15, 1989, to recognize that the benefits to be derived <BR>

<P>from government information may not always be quantifiable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection 7e in the current Circular is deleted; the intended <BR>

<P>meaning is adequately stated in OMB Circular No. A-76.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection 7i is a new statement emphasizing the need for <BR>

<P>strategic planning in the management of information resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection 7j is a new statement stressing the need for Federal <BR>

<P>Government cooperation with State and local governments in the <BR>

<P>management of information resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection 7l is a revision of the present 7f adding a statement <BR>

<P>about the potential benefits of electronic dissemination of <BR>

<P>information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a. Information Management Policy. The section begins <BR>

<P>with a set of policy statements concerning IRM planning with <BR>

<P>special emphasis on the information life cycle. Both in the <BR>

<P>planning statements and elsewhere, are new policy statements <BR>

<P>concerning the role of State and local governments and concerning <BR>

<P>records management. Also included are new policy statements <BR>

<P>regarding electronic collection and dissemination of information. <BR>

<P>The information dissemination policy statements are the most <BR>

<P>extensively revised, incorporating the concepts set forth in the <BR>

<P>June 15, 1989, notice (54 FR 25554). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(1). Information Management Planning. This policy is <BR>

<P>new. However, Section 8a(1)(d), pertaining to acquiring <BR>

<P>information through sharing from existing sources, is <BR>

<P>incorporated from the existing Circular at 8a(2).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(2) and (3). Information Collection. Section 8a(2) <BR>

<P>states the applicable information collection principles derived <BR>

<P>primarily from PRA. Section 8a(3) sets forth a new policy <BR>

<P>concerning situations under which electronic information <BR>

<P>collection is appropriate. These statements revise those proposed <BR>

<P>in the August 7, 1987, notice (52 FR 29454).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(4). Records Management. Section 8a(4) sets forth basic <BR>

<P>policy regarding records management.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Sections 8a(5) and 8a(6). Information Dissemination Policy. The <BR>

<P>notice of June 15, 1989, set forth certain conclusions about the <BR>

<P>proper role for executive branch agencies in government <BR>

<P>information dissemination and the boundaries between Federal and <BR>

<P>nonfederal roles. OMB has used these conclusions as a starting <BR>

<P>point for revising information dissemination policy.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(5) states the basic responsibility of all agencies to <BR>

<P>provide information to the public consistent with their missions. <BR>

<P>It also sets forth guidance on how agencies should go about <BR>

<P>disseminating information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6) is a new policy that agencies maintain an <BR>

<P>information dissemination management system to ensure the routine <BR>

<P>performance of certain dissemination functions. The system and <BR>

<P>its functions are new provisions; however, they set in place some <BR>

<P>requirements originally contained in OMB Bulletins 88-14, 89-15, <BR>

<P>90-09, and 91-16. Finally, this section incorporates certain <BR>

<P>requirements from Circular No. A-3, Government Publications, <BR>

<P>which is rescinded.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(7). Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices. Section <BR>

<P>8a(7) states a new policy concerning agency control over <BR>

<P>information that it intends to disseminate. This section also <BR>

<P>states policy regarding user charges for information <BR>

<P>dissemination products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(8). Electronic Information Dissemination. New section <BR>

<P>8a(8) sets forth policy about when agencies should consider <BR>

<P>disseminating information in electronic format. This section <BR>

<P>parallels section 8a(3) concerning electronic information <BR>

<P>collection.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(9). Information Safeguards. Section 8a(9) incorporates <BR>

<P>policy statements found in the existing Circular at 8a(3) through <BR>

<P>(6).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 9. Assignment of Responsibilities. New section 9(a)(10) <BR>

<P>carries over the requirement in Circular No. A-114 that the head <BR>

<P>of each agency designate an office with responsibility for <BR>

<P>management oversight of agency audiovisual productions, <BR>

<P>facilities and activities. Section 9(a)(11) adds a requirement <BR>

<P>that the agency designated IRM official monitor agency compliance <BR>

<P>with the policies contained in the Circular and act as an <BR>

<P>ombudsman to consider alleged instances of agency failure to <BR>

<P>comply.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Appendix I: Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining <BR>

<P>Records About Individuals. Changes to agency responsibilities <BR>

<P>resulting from recent enactments of privacy legislation have <BR>

<P>previously been issued in OMB guidance, and are incorporated into <BR>

<P>Appendix I.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. This appendix is <BR>

<P>completely revised and provides a general context and explanation <BR>

<P>of the contents of the key sections of the Circular. It explains <BR>

<P>the changes made to the original Circular by this notice, and <BR>

<P>reflects OMB's consideration and resolution of the comments <BR>

<P>received in response to the revisions proposed on April 29, 1992 <BR>

<P>(57 FR 18296).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Plans for Development of Other Topics<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The second phase of revisions to Circular No. A-130, which is <BR>

<P>being published separately, will address the following areas:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b. Information Systems and Information Technology <BR>

<P>Management. The revisions to Section 8b of the circular will <BR>

<P>focus on strategic IRM planning and analysis of proposed <BR>

<P>investments in information technology. The Circular will state <BR>

<P>policy principles to guide agency planning and explain OMB's <BR>

<P>expectations when reviewing agency budget requests for <BR>

<P>investments in information technology. OMB intends to make more <BR>

<P>explicit the policy connections between A-130 and OMB policy <BR>

<P>documents including Circular Nos. A-109, A-123 and A-127, with <BR>

<P>the goal of avoiding unnecessary overlap and harmonizing <BR>

<P>definitions among all four. It will link the management of <BR>

<P>information technology to agency strategic planning, stress <BR>

<P>incorporating user needs when preparing requirements analyses, <BR>

<P>and suggest policy level control and review mechanisms for IRM <BR>

<P>policies and life cycle management of projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Appendix II: Cost Accounting, Cost Recovery, and Interagency <BR>

<P>Sharing of Information Technology Facilities. OMB will revise <BR>

<P>Appendix II to reflect changes in law made by the Chief Financial <BR>

<P>Officers Act and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. These <BR>

<P>requirements include ensuring that accounting and reimbursements <BR>

<P>for sharing of information technology facilities are monitored <BR>

<P>and approved. The revision will also address the use of revolving <BR>

<P>funds for cost recovery and accounting for inter-agency and <BR>

<P>intra-agency reimbursements. In addition, the revision will <BR>

<P>address the budgetary scoring of capital leases and <BR>

<P>lease-to-purchase agreements for information technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Appendix III: Security of Federal Automated Information Systems. <BR>

<P>OMB will revise Appendix III to incorporate requirements of the <BR>

<P>Computer Security Act of 1987, including requirements for <BR>

<P>security plans described in OMB Bulletin 90-08. Those revisions <BR>

<P>will incorporate changes based on the experience gained in recent <BR>

<P>computer security visits to major agencies. OMB will also work <BR>

<P>with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to <BR>

<P>implement recommendations of the Computer Security and Privacy <BR>

<P>Advisory Board (established by the Computer Security Act) <BR>

<P>regarding better coordination between this Circular and OMB <BR>

<P>
<P>5. Background: The Paperwork Reduction Act establishes a broad <BR>

<P>mandate for agencies to perform their information management <BR>

<P>activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner. To <BR>

<P>assist agencies in an integrated approach to information <BR>

<P>resources management, the Act requires that the Director of OMB <BR>

<P>develop and implement uniform and consistent information <BR>

<P>resources management policies; oversee the development and <BR>

<P>promote the use of information management principles, standards, <BR>

<P>and guidelines; evaluate agency information management practices <BR>

<P>in order to determine their adequacy and efficiency; and <BR>

<P>determine compliance of such practices with the policies, <BR>

<P>principles, standards, and guidelines promulgated by the <BR>

<P>Director.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6. Definitions:<BR>

<P>on behalf of the Federal Government to accomplish a Federal <BR>

<P>function, regardless of the technology involved, whether <BR>

<P>computers, telecommunications, or others. It includes automatic <BR>

<P>data processing equipment as that term is defined in Section <BR>

<P>111(a)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act <BR>

<P>of 1949. For the purposes of this Circular, automatic data <BR>

<P>processing and telecommunications activities related to certain <BR>

<P>critical national security missions, as defined in 44 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>3502(2) and 10 U.S.C. 2315, are excluded.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>l. The term ``information technology facility'' means an <BR>

<P>business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that <BR>

<P>agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the <BR>

<P>organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, <BR>

<P>operations, or other activities of the government or because of <BR>

<P>the informational value of the data in them. Library and museum <BR>

<P>material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or <BR>

<P>exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for <BR>

<P>convenience of reference, and stocks of publications and of <BR>

<P>processed documents are not included. (44 U.S.C. 3301)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o. The term ``records management'' means the planning, <BR>

<P>controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and <BR>

<P>other managerial activities involved with respect to records <BR>

<P>creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition in <BR>

<P>order to achieve adequate and proper documentation of the <BR>

<P>policies and transactions of the Federal Government and effective <BR>

<P>and economical management of agency operations. (44 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>2901(2))<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7. Basic Considerations and Assumptions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a. The Federal Government is the largest single producer, <BR>

<P>collector, consumer, and disseminator of information in the <BR>

<P>United States. Because of the extent of the government's <BR>

<P>information activities, and the dependence of those activities <BR>

<P>upon public cooperation, the management of Federal information <BR>

<P>resources is an issue of continuing importance to all Federal <BR>

<P>agencies, State and local governments, and the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b. Government information is a valuable national resource. It <BR>

<P>provides the public with knowledge of the government, society, <BR>

<P>and economy_past, present, and future. It is a means to ensure <BR>

<P>the accountability of government, to manage the government's <BR>

<P>operations, to maintain the healthy performance of the economy, <BR>

<P>and is itself a commodity in the marketplace.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c. The free flow of information between the government and the <BR>

<P>public is essential to a democratic society. It is also essential <BR>

<P>that the government minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the <BR>

<P>public, minimize the cost of its information activities, and <BR>

<P>maximize the usefulness of government information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d. In order to minimize the cost and maximize the usefulness of <BR>

<P>government information, the expected public and private benefits <BR>

<P>derived from government information should exceed the public and <BR>

<P>private costs of the information, recognizing that the benefits <BR>

<P>to be derived from government information may not always be <BR>

<P>quantifiable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e. The nation can benefit from government information <BR>

<P>disseminated both by Federal agencies and by diverse nonfederal <BR>

<P>parties, including State and local government agencies, <BR>

<P>educational and other not-for-profit institutions, and for-profit <BR>

<P>organizations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>f. Because the public disclosure of government information is <BR>

<P>essential to the operation of a democracy, management of Federal <BR>

<P>information resources should protect the public's right of access <BR>

<P>to government information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>g. The individual's right to privacy must be protected in Federal <BR>

<P>Government information activities involving personal information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>h. Systematic attention to the management of government records <BR>

<P>is an essential component of sound public resources management <BR>

<P>which ensures public accountability. Together with records <BR>

<P>preservation, it protects the government's historical record and <BR>

<P>guards the legal and financial rights of the government and the <BR>

<P>public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>i. Strategic planning is basic to the operation of sound <BR>

<P>government programs. This planning ensures that the management of <BR>

<P>information resources reflects agency strategic priorities within <BR>

<P>budgetary limitations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>j. Because State and local governments are important producers of <BR>

<P>government information for many areas such as health, social <BR>

<P>welfare, labor, transportation, and education, the Federal <BR>

<P>Government must cooperate with these governments in the <BR>

<P>management of information resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>k. The open and efficient exchange of scientific and technical <BR>

<P>government information, subject to applicable national security <BR>

<P>controls and the proprietary rights of others, fosters excellence <BR>

<P>in scientific research and effective use of Federal research and <BR>

<P>development funds.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>l. Modern information technology presents opportunities to <BR>

<P>improve the management of government programs to provide better <BR>

<P>service to the public. The availability of government information <BR>

<P>in diverse media, including electronic formats, permits the <BR>

<P>public greater flexibility in using the information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>m. Federal Government information resources management policies <BR>

<P>and activities can affect, and be affected by, the information <BR>

<P>policies and activities of other nations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8. Policy_a. Information Management Policy<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1) Information Management Planning. Agencies shall plan in an <BR>

<P>impose substantial costs or other adverse effects on the public, <BR>

<P>especially State and local governments and small business <BR>

<P>entities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4) Records Management. Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>responsibility to provide information to the public consistent <BR>

<P>with their missions. Agencies shall discharge this responsibility <BR>

<P>by:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) Providing information, as required by law, describing agency <BR>

<P>organization, activities, programs, meetings, systems of records, <BR>

<P>and other information holdings, and how the public may gain <BR>

<P>access to agency information resources;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b) Providing access to agency records under provisions of the <BR>

<P>Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, subject to the <BR>

<P>protections and limitations provided for in these Acts; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c) Providing such other information as is necessary or <BR>

<P>appropriate for the proper performance of agency functions; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d) In determining whether and how to disseminate information to <BR>

<P>the public, agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(i) Disseminate information in a manner that achieves the best <BR>

<P>balance between the goals of maximizing the usefulness of the <BR>

<P>
<P>(f) Ensure that members of the public with disabilities whom the <BR>

<P>agency has a responsibility to inform have a reasonable ability <BR>

<P>to access the information dissemination products;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(g) Ensure that government publications are made available to <BR>

<P>depository libraries through the facilities of the Government <BR>

<P>Printing Office, as required by law (44 U.S.C. Part 19);<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>public and with State and local governments so that the agency <BR>

<P>creates information dissemination products that meet their <BR>

<P>respective needs;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(j) Provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially <BR>

<P>modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination <BR>

<P>products; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(k) Ensure that, to the extent existing information dissemination <BR>

<P>policies or practices are inconsistent with the requirements of <BR>

<P>this Circular, a prompt and orderly transition to compliance with <BR>

<P>the requirements of this Circular is made.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(7) Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices. Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) Avoid establishing, or permitting others to establish on <BR>

<P>their behalf, exclusive, restricted, or other distribution <BR>

<P>arrangements that interfere with the availability of information <BR>

<P>dissemination products on a timely and equitable basis;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b) Avoid establishing restrictions or regulations, including the <BR>

<P>charging of fees or royalties, on the reuse, resale, or <BR>

<P>redissemination of Federal information dissemination products by <BR>

<P>the public; and,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c) Set user charges for information dissemination products at a <BR>

<P>level sufficient to recover the cost of dissemination but no <BR>

<P>higher. They shall exclude from calculation of the charges costs <BR>

<P>associated with original collection and processing of the <BR>

<P>information. Exceptions to this policy are:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(i) Where statutory requirements are at variance with the policy;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(ii) Where the agency collects, processes, and disseminates the <BR>

<P>information for the benefit of a specific identifiable group <BR>

<P>beyond the benefit to the general public; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(iii) Where the agency plans to establish user charges at less <BR>

<P>than cost of dissemination because of a determination that higher <BR>

<P>charges would constitute a significant barrier to properly <BR>

<P>performing the agency's functions, including reaching members of <BR>

<P>the public whom the agency has a responsibility to inform; or<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(iv)Where the Director of OMB determines an exception is <BR>

<P>warranted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(8) Electronic Information Dissemination. Agencies shall use <BR>

<P>electronic media and formats, including public networks, as <BR>

<P>appropriate and within budgetary constraints, in order to make <BR>

<P>government information more easily accessible and useful to the <BR>

<P>public. The use of electronic media and formats for information <BR>

<P>dissemination is appropriate under the following conditions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) The agency develops and maintains the information <BR>

<P>electronically; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b) Electronic media or formats are practical and cost effective <BR>

<P>ways to provide public access to a large, highly detailed volume <BR>

<P>
<P>(c) The agency disseminates the product frequently;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d) The agency knows a substantial portion of users have ready <BR>

<P>access to the necessary information technology and training to <BR>

<P>use electronic information dissemination products;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(e) A change to electronic dissemination, as the sole means of <BR>

<P>disseminating the product, will not impose substantial <BR>

<P>acquisition or training costs on users, especially State and <BR>

<P>local governments and small business entities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(9) Safeguards. Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) Ensure that information is protected commensurate with the <BR>

<P>risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from the loss, <BR>

<P>misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such <BR>

<P>information;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b) Limit the collection of information which identifies <BR>

<P>individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for <BR>

<P>the proper performance of agency functions;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c) Limit the sharing of information that identifies individuals <BR>

<P>or contains proprietary information to that which is legally <BR>

<P>authorized, and impose appropriate conditions on use where a <BR>

<P>continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality of the <BR>

<P>information exists;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d) Provide individuals, upon request, access to records about <BR>

<P>them maintained in Privacy Act systems of records, and permit <BR>

<P>them to amend such records as are in error consistent with the <BR>

<P>provisions of the Privacy Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About <BR>

<P>Individuals<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1. Purpose and Scope. This Appendix describes agency <BR>

<P>responsibilities for implementing the reporting and publication <BR>

<P>requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as <BR>

<P>amended (hereinafter ``the Act'').  It applies to all agencies <BR>

<P>subject to the Act.  Note that this Appendix does not rescind <BR>

<P>other guidance OMB has issued to help agencies interpret the <BR>

<P>Privacy Act's provisions, e.g., Privacy Act Guidelines (40 FR <BR>

<P>28949-28978, July 9, 1975), or Final Guidance for Conducting <BR>

<P>Matching Programs (54 FR at 25819, June 19, 1989).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2. Definitions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a.  The terms ``agency,'' ``individual,'' ``maintain,'' <BR>

<P>``record,'' ``system of records,'' and ``routine use,'' as used <BR>

<P>in this Appendix, are defined in the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b.  Matching Agency.  Generally, the Recipient Federal agency (or <BR>

<P>the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a nonfederal <BR>

<P>agency) is the matching agency and is responsible for meeting the <BR>

<P>reporting and publication requirements associated with the <BR>

<P>matching program.  However, in large, multi-agency matching <BR>

<P>programs, where the recipient agency is merely performing the <BR>

<P>matches and the benefit accrues to the source agencies, the <BR>

<P>partners should assign responsibility for compliance with the <BR>

<P>administrative requirements in a fair and reasonable way.  This <BR>

<P>may mean having the matching agency carry out these requirements <BR>

<P>for all parties, having one participant designated to do so, or <BR>

<P>having each source agency do so for its own matching program(s).   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c.  Nonfederal Agency.  Nonfederal agencies are State or local <BR>

<P>governmental agencies receiving records from a Federal agency's <BR>

<P>automated system of records to be used in a matching program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d.  Recipient Agency.  Recipient agencies are Federal agencies or <BR>

<P>their contractors receiving automated records from the Privacy <BR>

<P>Act systems of records of other Federal agencies, or from State <BR>

<P>or local governments, to be used in a matching program as defined <BR>

<P>in the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e.  Source Agency.  A source agency is a Federal agency that <BR>

<P>discloses automated records from a system of records to another <BR>

<P>Federal agency or to a State or local agency to be used in a <BR>

<P>matching program.  It is also a State or local agency that  <BR>

<P>discloses records to a Federal agency for use in a matching <BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3. Assignment of Responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a. All Federal Agencies.  In addition to meeting the agency <BR>

<P>requirements contained in the Act and the specific reporting and <BR>

<P>publication requirements detailed in this Appendix, the head of <BR>

<P>each agency shall ensure that the following reviews are conducted <BR>

<P>as often as specified below, and be prepared to report to the <BR>

<P>Director, OMB, the results of such reviews and the corrective <BR>

<P>action taken to resolve problems uncovered.  The head of each <BR>

<P>agency shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Section (m) Contracts.  Review every two years a random <BR>

<P>sample of agency contracts that provide for the maintenance of a <BR>

<P>system of records on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency <BR>

<P>function, in order to ensure that the wording of each contract <BR>

<P>makes the provisions of the Act binding on the contractor and his <BR>

<P>or her employees. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1))<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Recordkeeping Practices.  Review annually agency <BR>

<P>recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices in order to <BR>

<P>assure compliance with the Act, paying particular attention to <BR>

<P>the maintenance of automated records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Routine Use Disclosures.  Review every four years the <BR>

<P>routine use disclosures associated with each system of records in <BR>

<P>order to ensure that the recipient's use of such records <BR>

<P>continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the <BR>

<P>disclosing agency collected the information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4)  Exemption of Systems of Records.  Review every four years <BR>

<P>each system of records for which the agency has promulgated <BR>

<P>exemption rules pursuant to Section (j) or (k) of the Act in <BR>

<P>order to determine whether such exemption is still needed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5)  Matching Programs.  Review annually each ongoing matching <BR>

<P>program in which the agency has participated during the year, <BR>

<P>either as a source or as a matching agency, in order to ensure <BR>

<P>that the requirements of the Act, the OMB guidance, and any <BR>

<P>agency regulations, operating instructions, or guidelines have <BR>

<P>been met.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(6)  Privacy Act Training.  Review annually agency training <BR>

<P>practices in order to ensure that all agency personnel are <BR>

<P>familiar with the requirements of the Act, with the agency's <BR>

<P>implementing regulation, and with any special requirements of <BR>

<P>their specific jobs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(7)  Violations.  Review annually the actions of agency personnel <BR>

<P>that have resulted either in the agency being found civilly <BR>

<P>liable under Section (g) of the Act, or an employee being  found <BR>

<P>criminally liable under the provisions of Section (i) of the Act, <BR>

<P>in order to determine the extent of the problem and to find the <BR>

<P>most effective way to prevent recurrence of the problem. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(8)  Systems of Records Notices.  Review annually each system of <BR>

<P>records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system <BR>

<P>of records.  Where minor changes are needed, e.g., the name of <BR>

<P>the system manager, ensure that an amended notice is published in <BR>

<P>the Federal Register.  Agencies may choose to make one annual <BR>

<P>comprehensive publication consolidating such minor changes.  This <BR>

<P>requirement is distinguished from and in addition to the <BR>

<P>requirement to report to OMB and Congress significant changes to <BR>

<P>systems of records and to publish those changes in the Federal <BR>

<P>Register (See paragraph 4c of this Appendix).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b.  Department of Commerce.  The Secretary of Commerce shall, <BR>

<P>consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB, develop <BR>

<P>and issue standards and guidelines for ensuring the security of <BR>

<P>information protected by the Act in automated information <BR>

<P>systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c.  The Department of Defense, General Services Administration, <BR>

<P>and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  These <BR>

<P>agencies shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the <BR>

<P>Director, OMB, ensure that instructions are issued on what <BR>

<P>agencies must do in order to comply with the requirements of <BR>

<P>Section (m) of the Act when contracting for the operation of a <BR>

<P>system of records to accomplish an agency purpose.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d.  Office of Personnel Management.  The Director of the Office <BR>

<P>of Personnel Management shall, consistent with guidelines issued <BR>

<P>by the Director, OMB:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Develop and maintain governmentwide standards and procedures <BR>

<P>for civilian personnel information processing and recordkeeping <BR>

<P>directives to assure conformance with the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Develop and conduct Privacy Act training programs for agency <BR>

<P>personnel, including both the conduct of courses in various <BR>

<P>substantive areas (e.g., administrative, information technology) <BR>

<P>and the development of materials that agencies can use in their <BR>

<P>own courses.  The assignment of this responsibility to OPM does <BR>

<P>not affect the responsibility of individual agency heads for <BR>

<P>developing and conducting training programs tailored to the <BR>

<P>specific needs of their own personnel.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e.  National Archives and Records Administration.  The Archivist <BR>

<P>of the United States through the Office of the Federal Register, <BR>

<P>shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Issue instructions on the format of the agency notices and <BR>

<P>rules required to be published under the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Compile and publish every two years, the rules  promulgated <BR>

<P>under 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) and agency notices published under 5 <BR>

<P>U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) in a form available to the public at low cost. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Issue procedures governing the transfer of records to <BR>

<P>Federal Records Centers for storage, processing, and servicing <BR>

<P>pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3103.  For purposes of the Act, such <BR>

<P>records are considered to be maintained by the agency that <BR>

<P>deposited them.  The Archivist may disclose deposited records <BR>

<P>only according to the access rules established by the agency that <BR>

<P>deposited them.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>f.  Office of Management and Budget.  The Director of the Office <BR>

<P>of Management and Budget will:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Issue guidelines and directives to the agencies to implement <BR>

<P>the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Assist the agencies, at their request, in implementing their <BR>

<P>Privacy Act programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Review new and altered system of records and matching <BR>

<P>program reports submitted pursuant to Section (o) of the Act.<BR>

<P>implementation of the computer matching provisions of the Privacy <BR>

<P>Act, pursuant to Section (u)(6) of the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4. Reporting Requirements. (See Table 1 at the end of this <BR>

<P>Appendix for due dates and recipient addresses.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a.  Biennial Privacy Act Report.  To provide the necessary <BR>

<P>information for the biennial report of the President, agencies <BR>

<P>shall submit a biennial report to OMB, covering their Privacy Act <BR>

<P>activities for the calendar years covered by the reporting <BR>

<P>period.  The exact format of the report will be established by <BR>

<P>OMB.  At a minimum, however, agencies should collect and be <BR>

<P>prepared to report the following data on a calendar year basis:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  A listing of publication activity during each year showing <BR>

<P>the following:<BR>

<P>

<P>The agency should provide a brief narrative describing those <BR>

<P>activities in detail, e.g., ``the Department added a (k)(1) <BR>

<P>exemption to an existing system of records entitled <BR>

<P>``Investigative Records of the Office of Investigations;'' or <BR>

<P>``the  agency added a new routine use to a system of records <BR>

<P>entitled ``Employee Health Records'' that would permit disclosure <BR>

<P>of health data to researchers under contract to the agency to <BR>

<P>perform workplace risk analysis.''<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  A brief description of any public comments received on <BR>

<P>agency publication and implementation activities, and agency <BR>

<P>response.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Number of access and amendment requests from record subjects <BR>

<P>citing the Privacy Act that were received during the calendar <BR>

<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* Number of Appeals of Denials of Access<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number For Which No Record Found<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* Number of Appeals of Denials of Amendment<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4)  Number of instances in which individuals brought suit under <BR>

<P>section (g) of the Privacy Act against the agency and the results <BR>

<P>of any such litigation that resulted in a change to agency <BR>

<P>practices or affected guidance issued by OMB.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5)  Results of any reviews undertaken in response to paragraph <BR>

<P>3a of this Appendix.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(6)  Description of agency Privacy Act training activities <BR>

<P>conducted in accordance with paragraph 3a(6) of this Appendix.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b. Biennial Matching Activity Report. (See 5 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>552a(u)(3)(D)).  At the end of each calendar year, the Data <BR>

<P>Integrity Board of each agency that has participated in matches <BR>

<P>covered by the computer matching provisions of the Privacy Act <BR>

<P>will collect data summarizing that year's matching activity.  The <BR>

<P>Act requires that such activity be reported every two years.  OMB <BR>

<P>will establish the exact format of the report, but agencies' Data  <BR>

<P>Integrity Boards should be prepared to report the data identified <BR>

<P>below both to the agency head and to OMB.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  A listing of the names and positions of the members of the <BR>

<P>Data Integrity Board and showing separately the name of the Board <BR>

<P>Secretary, his or her agency mailing address, and telephone <BR>

<P>number. Also show and explain any changes in membership or <BR>

<P>structure occurring during the reporting year.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  A listing of each matching program, by title and purpose, in <BR>

<P>which the agency participated during the reporting year.  This <BR>

<P>listing should show names of participant agencies, give a brief <BR> 

<P>description of the program, and give a citation including the <BR>

<P>date to the Federal Register notice describing the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  For each matching program, an indication of whether the <BR>

<P>cost/benefit analysis performed resulted in a favorable ratio.  <BR>

<P>The Data Integrity Board should explain why the agency proceeded <BR>

<P>with any matching program for which an unfavorable ratio was <BR>

<P>reached. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4)  For each program for which the Board waived a cost/benefit <BR>

<P>analysis, reasons for the waiver and the results of match, if <BR>

<P>tabulated.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5)  A description of each matching agreement the Board rejected <BR>

<P>and an explanation of why it was rejected.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(6)  A listing of any violations of matching agreements that have <BR>

<P>been alleged or identified, and a discussion of any action taken.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(7)  A discussion of any litigation involving the agency's <BR>

<P>participation in any matching program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(8)  For any litigation based on allegations of inaccurate <BR>

<P>records, an explanation of the steps the agency used to ensure <BR>

<P>the integrity of its data as well as the verification process it <BR>

<P>used in the matching program, including an assessment of the <BR>

<P>adequacy of each.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c.  New and Altered System of Records Report.  The Act requires <BR>

<P>agencies to publish notices in the Federal Register describing <BR>

<P>new or altered systems of records, and to submit reports to OMB, <BR>

<P>and to the Chair of the Committee on Government Operations of the <BR>

<P>House of Representatives, and the Chair of the Committee on <BR>

<P>Governmental Affairs of the Senate. The reports must be <BR>

<P>transmitted at least 40 days prior to the operation of the new <BR>

<P>system of records or the date on which the alteration to an <BR>

<P>existing system takes place.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  When to Report Altered Systems of Records.  Minor changes to <BR>

<P>systems of records need not be reported.  For example,  a change <BR>

<P>in the designation of the system manager due to a reorganization <BR>

<P>would not require a report, so long as an individual's ability to <BR>

<P>gain access to his or her records is not affected.  Other <BR>

<P>examples include changing applicable safeguards as a result of a <BR>

<P>risk analysis, or deleting a routine use when there is no longer <BR>

<P>a need for the disclosure.  The following changes are those for <BR>

<P>which a report is required:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  A significant increase in the number of individuals about <BR>

<P>whom records are maintained.  For example, a decision to expand a <BR>

<P>system that originally covered only residents of public housing <BR>

<P>in major cities to cover such residents nationwide would require <BR>

<P>a report.  Increases attributable to normal growth should not be <BR>

<P>reported.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  A change that expands the types or categories of information <BR>

<P>maintained.  For example, a file covering physicians that has <BR>

<P>been expanded to include other types of healthcare providers, <BR>

<P>e.g., nurses, technicians, etc., would require a report.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)  A change that alters the purpose for which the information <BR>

<P>is used.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d)  A change to equipment configuration (either hardware or <BR>

<P>software) that creates substantially greater access to the <BR>

<P>records in the system of records.  For example, locating <BR>

<P>interactive terminals at regional offices for accessing a system <BR>

<P>formerly accessible only at the headquarters would require a <BR>

<P>report.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(e) The addition of an exemption pursuant to Section (j) or (k) <BR>

<P>of the Act. Note that, in examining a rulemaking for a Privacy <BR>

<P>Act exemption as part of a report of a new or altered system of <BR>

<P>records, OMB will also review the rule under applicable <BR>

<P>regulatory review procedures and agencies need not make a <BR>

<P>separate submission for that purpose.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(f)  The addition of a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>552a(b)(3).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Reporting Changes to Multiple Systems of Records. When an <BR>

<P>agency makes a change to an information technology installation <BR>

<P>or a telecommunication network, or makes any other general <BR>

<P>changes in information collection, processing, dissemination, or <BR>

<P>storage that affect multiple systems of records, it may submit a <BR>

<P>single, consolidated report, with changes to existing notices and <BR>

<P>supporting documentation included in the submission.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Contents of the New or Altered System Report.  The report <BR>

<P>for a new or altered system has three elements:  a transmittal <BR>

<P>letter, a narrative statement, and supporting documentation that <BR>

<P>includes a copy of the proposed Federal  Register notice.  There <BR>

<P>is no prescribed format for either the letter or the narrative <BR>

<P>statement.  The notice must appear in the format prescribed by <BR>

<P>the Office of the Federal Register's Document Drafting Handbook.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) Transmittal Letter.  The transmittal letter should be signed <BR>

<P>by the senior agency official responsible for implementation of <BR>

<P>the Act within the agency and should contain the name and <BR>

<P>telephone number of the individual who can best answer questions <BR>

<P>about the system of records.  The letter should contain the <BR>

<P>agency's assurance that the proposed system does not duplicate <BR>

<P>any existing agency or governmentwide systems of records.  The <BR>

<P>letter sent to OMB may also include requests for waiver of the <BR>

<P>time period for the review.   The agency should indicate why it <BR>

<P>cannot meet the established review period and what will be the <BR>

<P>consequences of not obtaining the waiver, (see paragraph 4e <BR>

<P>below).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  Narrative Statement.  The narrative statement should be <BR>

<P>brief.  It should make reference, as appropriate, to information <BR>

<P>in the supporting documentation rather than restating such <BR>

<P>information.  The statement should:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1. Describe the purpose for which the agency is establishing the <BR>

<P>system of records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Identify the authority under which the system of records is <BR>

<P>maintained.  The agency should avoid citing housekeeping <BR>

<P>statutes, but rather cite the underlying programmatic authority <BR>

<P>for collecting, maintaining, and using the information.  When the <BR>

<P>system is being operated to support an agency housekeeping <BR>

<P>program, e.g., a carpool locator, the agency may, however, cite a <BR>

<P>general housekeeping statute that authorizes the agency head to <BR>

<P>keep such records as necessary.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Provide the agency's evaluation of the probable or potential <BR>

<P>effect of the proposal on the privacy of individuals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Provide a brief description of the steps taken by the agency <BR>

<P>to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the system of <BR>

<P>records.  A more detailed assessment of the risks and specific <BR>

<P>administrative, technical, procedural, and physical safeguards <BR>

<P>established shall be made available to OMB upon request.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Explain how each proposed routine use satisfies the <BR>

<P>compatibility requirement of subsection (a)(7) of the Act.  For <BR>

<P>altered systems, this requirement pertains only to any newly <BR>

<P>proposed routine use.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  Provide OMB Control Numbers, expiration dates, and titles of <BR>

<P>any OMB approved information collection requests (e.g., forms, <BR>

<P>surveys, etc.) contained in the system of  records.  If the <BR>

<P>request for OMB clearance of an information collection is <BR>

<P>pending, the agency may simply state the title of the collection <BR>

<P>and the date it was submitted for OMB clearance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)  Supporting Documentation.  Attach the following to all new <BR>

<P>or altered system of records reports:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  A copy of the new or altered system of records notice in <BR>

<P>Federal Register format, consistent with the provisions of 5 <BR>

<P>U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). For proposed altered systems the agency should <BR>

<P>supply a copy of the original system of records notice to ensure <BR>

<P>that reviewers can understand the changes proposed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  A copy in Federal Register format of any new exemption rules <BR>

<P>or changes to published rules (consistent with the provisions of <BR>

<P>5 U.S.C. 552a(f),(j), or (k)) that the agency proposes to issue <BR>

<P>for the new or altered system.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4)  OMB Concurrence.  Agencies may assume that OMB concurs in <BR>

<P>the Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not <BR>

<P>commented within 40 days from the date the transmittal letter was <BR>

<P>signed.  Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted <BR>

<P>expeditiously after they are signed.  Agencies may publish system <BR>

<P>of records and routine use notices as well as proposed exemption <BR>

<P>rules in the Federal Register at the same time that they send the <BR>

<P>new or altered system report to OMB and Congress.  The period for <BR>

<P>OMB and congressional review and the notice and comment period <BR>

<P>for routine uses and exemptions will then run concurrently.  Note <BR>

<P>that exemptions must be published as final rules before they are <BR>

<P>effective.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d.  New or Altered Matching Program Report.  The Act requires <BR>

<P>agencies to publish notices in the Federal Register describing <BR>

<P>new or altered matching programs, and to submit reports to OMB, <BR>

<P>and to Congress.  The report must be received at least 40 days <BR>

<P>prior to the initiation of any matching activity carried out <BR>

<P>under a new or substantially altered matching program.  For <BR>

<P>renewals of continuing programs, the report must be dated at <BR>

<P>least 40 days prior to the expiration of any existing matching <BR>

<P>agreement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  When to Report Altered Matching Programs.  Agencies need not <BR>

<P>report minor changes to matching programs.  The term ``minor <BR>

<P>change to a matching program'' means a change that does not <BR>

<P>significantly alter the terms of the agreement under which the <BR>

<P>program is being carried out.  Examples of significant changes <BR>

<P>include: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  Changing the purpose for which the program was established.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  Changing the matching population, either by including new <BR>

<P>categories of record subjects or by greatly increasing the <BR>

<P>numbers of records matched. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)  Changing the legal authority covering the matching program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d)  Changing the source or recipient agencies involved in the <BR>

<P>matching program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) Contents of New or Altered Matching Program Report.   The <BR>

<P>report for a new or altered matching program has three elements:  <BR>

<P>a transmittal letter, a narrative statement, and supporting <BR>

<P>documentation that includes a copy of the proposed Federal <BR>

<P>Register notice.  There is no prescribed format for either the <BR>

<P>letter or the narrative statement.  The notice must appear in the <BR>

<P>format prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's <BR>

<P>Document Drafting Handbook.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  Transmittal Letter.  The transmittal letter should be signed <BR>

<P>by the senior agency official responsible for implementation of <BR>

<P>the Privacy Act within the agency and should contain the name and <BR>

<P>telephone number of the individual who can best answer questions <BR>

<P>about the matching program.  The letter should state that a copy <BR>

<P>of the matching agreement has been distributed to Congress as the <BR>

<P>Act requires.  The letter to OMB may also include a request for <BR>

<P>waiver of the review time period.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  Narrative Statement.  The narrative statement should be <BR>

<P>brief.  It should make reference, as appropriate, to information <BR>

<P>in the supporting documentation rather than restating such <BR>

<P>information.  The statement should provide:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  A description of the purpose of the matching program and the <BR>

<P>authority under which it is being carried out.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  A description of the security safeguards used to protect <BR>

<P>against any unauthorized access or disclosure of records used in <BR>

<P>the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3. If the cost/benefit analysis required by Section (u)(4)(A) <BR>

<P>indicated an unfavorable ratio or was waived pursuant to OMB <BR>

<P>guidance, an explanation of the basis on which the agency <BR>

<P>justifies conducting the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c) Supporting Documentation. Attach the following:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  A copy of the Federal Register notice describing the matching <BR>

<P>program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  For the Congressional report only, a copy of the matching <BR>

<P>agreement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) OMB Concurrence. Agencies may assume that OMB concurs in the <BR>

<P>Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not commented <BR>

<P>within 40 days from the date the transmittal letter  was signed.  <BR>

<P>Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted expeditiously <BR>

<P>after they are signed. Agencies may publish matching program <BR>

<P>notices in the Federal Register at the same time that they send <BR>

<P>the matching program report to OMB and Congress.  The period for <BR>

<P>OMB and congressional review and the notice and comment period <BR>

<P>will then run concurrently.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e.  Expediting the Review Process.  The Director, OMB, may grant <BR>

<P>a waiver of the 40-day review period for either systems of <BR>

<P>records or matching program reviews.  The agency must ask for the <BR>

<P>waiver in the transmittal letter and demonstrate compelling <BR>

<P>reasons.  When a waiver is granted, the agency is not thereby <BR>

<P>relieved of any other requirement of the Act.  If no waiver is <BR>

<P>granted, agencies may presume concurrence at the expiration of <BR>

<P>the 40 day review period.  Note that OMB cannot waive time <BR>

<P>periods specifically established by the Act such as the 30 days <BR>

<P>notice and comment period required for the adoption of a routine <BR>

<P>use proposal pursuant to Section (b)(3) of the Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5. Publication Requirements. The Privacy Act requires agencies to <BR>

<P>publish notices or rules in the Federal Register in the following <BR>

<P>circumstances:  when adopting a new or altered system of records, <BR>

<P>when adopting a routine use or exemption for a system of records, <BR>

<P>or when proposing to carry out a new or altered matching program. <BR>

<P>(See paragraph 4c(1) and 4d(1) above on what constitutes a <BR>

<P>reportable alteration.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a.  Publishing New or Altered Systems of Records Notices and <BR>

<P>Exemption Rules.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Who Publishes.  The agency responsible for operating the <BR>

<P>system of records makes the necessary publication.  Publication <BR>

<P>should be carried out at the departmental or agency level.  Where <BR>

<P>a system of records is to be operated exclusively by a component, <BR>

<P>the department rather than the component should publish the <BR>

<P>notice.  Thus, for example, the Department of the Treasury would <BR>

<P>publish a system of records notice covering a system operated <BR>

<P>exclusively by the Internal Revenue Service.  Note that if the <BR>

<P>agency is proposing to exempt the system under Section (j) or (k) <BR>

<P>of the Act, it must publish a rule in addition to the system of <BR>

<P>records notice.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  Governmentwide Systems of Records.  Certain agencies publish <BR>

<P>systems of records containing records for which they have <BR>

<P>governmentwide responsibilities.  The records may be located in <BR>

<P>other agencies, but they are being used under the authority of <BR>

<P>and in conformance with the rules mandated by the publishing <BR>

<P>agency.  The Office of Personnel Management for example, has <BR>

<P>published a number of governmentwide systems of records relating <BR>

<P>to the operation of the government's personnel program.  Agencies <BR>

<P>should not publish systems of records that wholly or partly <BR>

<P>duplicate existing governmentwide systems of records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  Section (m) Contract Provisions.  When an agency provides by <BR>

<P>contract for the operation of a system of records, it should <BR>

<P>ensure that a system of records notice describing the system has <BR>

<P>been published.  It should also review the notice to ensure that <BR>

<P>it contains a routine use under Section (e)(4)(D) of the Act <BR>

<P>permitting disclosure to the contractor and his or her personnel.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  When to Publish. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  System Notice.  It must appear in the Federal Register <BR>

<P>before the agency begins to operate the system, e.g., collect and <BR>

<P>use the information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  Routine Use.  Must be published in the Federal Register 30 <BR>

<P>days before agency discloses records pursuant to its terms.  If <BR>

<P>the sole change to an existing system of records is to add a <BR>

<P>routine use, the agency should either republish the entire system <BR>

<P>of records notice, a condensed description of the system of <BR>

<P>records, or a citation to the last full text Federal Register <BR>

<P>publication.  (Note that the addition of a routine use to an <BR>

<P>existing system of records requires a report to OMB and Congress, <BR>

<P>and that the review period for this report is 40 days.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)  Exemption Rule.  Must be established through informal <BR>

<P>rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.  This <BR>

<P>process generally requires publication of a proposed rule, a <BR>

<P>period during which the public may comment, publication of a <BR>

<P>final rule, and the adoption of the final rule.  Agencies may not <BR>

<P>withhold records under an exemption until these requirements have <BR>

<P>been met. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Format.  Agencies should follow the publication format <BR>

<P>contained in the Office of the Federal Register Document Drafting <BR>

<P>Handbook obtainable from the Government Printing Office.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b.  Publishing Matching Notices.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Who Publishes.  Generally, the Recipient Federal agency (or <BR>

<P>the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a nonfederal <BR>

<P>agency) is responsible for publishing in the Federal Register a <BR>

<P>notice describing the new or altered matching program.  However, <BR>

<P>in large, multi-agency matching programs, where the recipient <BR>

<P>agency is merely performing the matches, and the benefit accrues <BR>

<P>to the source agencies, the partners should assign responsibility <BR>

<P>for compliance with the administrative requirements in a fair and <BR>

<P>reasonable way.  This may mean having the matching agency carry <BR>

<P>out these requirements for all parties, having one participant <BR>

<P>designated to do so, or having each source so for its own <BR>

<P>matching program(s). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) Timing.  Publication must occur at least 30 days prior to the <BR>

<P>initiation of any matching activity carried out under a new or <BR>

<P>substantially altered matching program.  For  renewals of <BR>

<P>programs agencies wish to continue past the 30 month period of <BR>

<P>initial eligibility (i.e., the initial 18 months plus a 1 year <BR>

<P>extension), publication must occur at least 30 days prior to the <BR>

<P>expiration of the existing matching agreement.  (But note that a <BR>

<P>report to OMB and the Congress is also required with a 40 day <BR>

<P>review period).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) Format.  The matching notice shall be in the format <BR>

<P>prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register Document <BR>

<P>Drafting Handbook and contain the following information:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)  The name of the Recipient Agency.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)  The Name(s) of the Source Agencies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)  The beginning and ending dates of the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d)  A brief description of the matching program, including its <BR>

<P>purpose; the legal authorities authorizing its operation;  <BR>

<P>categories of individuals involved; and identification of records <BR>

<P>used, including name(s) of Privacy Act Systems of  records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(e)  The identification, address, and telephone number of a <BR>

<P>Recipient Agency official who will answer public inquiries about <BR>

<P>the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>Analysis of Key Sections<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1. Purpose<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a general context and <BR>

<P>explanation for the contents of the key Sections of the Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2. Background<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 94 <BR>

<P>Stat. 2812, codified at Chapter 35 of Title 44 of the United <BR>

<P>States Code, establishes a broad mandate for agencies to perform <BR>

<P>their information activities in an efficient, effective, and <BR>

<P>economical manner. Section 3504 of the Act provides authority to <BR>

<P>the Director, OMB, to develop and implement uniform and <BR>

<P>consistent information resources management policies; oversee the <BR>

<P>development and promote the use of information management <BR>

<P>principles, standards, and guidelines; evaluate agency <BR>

<P>information management practices in order to determine their <BR>

<P>adequacy and efficiency, and determine compliance of such <BR>

<P>practices with the policies, principles, standards, and <BR>

<P>guidelines promulgated by the Director.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Circular implements OMB authority under the Act with respect <BR>

<P>to Section 3504(b), general information policy, Section 3504(e), <BR>

<P>records management, Section 3504(f), privacy, and Section <BR>

<P>3504(g), Federal automatic data processing and <BR>

<P>telecommunications; the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a); the <BR>

<P>Chief Financial Officers Act (31 U.S.C. 3512 et seq.); Sections <BR>

<P>111 and 206 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services <BR>

<P>Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 759 and 487, respectively); <BR>

<P>the Computer Security Act, (40 U.S.C. 759 note); the Budget and <BR>

<P>Accounting Act of 1921 (31 U.S.C. 1 et seq.); and Executive Order <BR>

<P>No. 12046 of March 27, 1978, and Executive Order No. 12472 of <BR>

<P>April 3, 1984, Assignment of National Security and Emergency <BR>

<P>Telecommunications Functions. The Circular complements 5 CFR Part <BR>

<P>1320, Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public, which <BR>

<P>implements other Sections of the PRA dealing with controlling the <BR>

<P>reporting and recordkeeping burden placed on the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, the Circular revises and consolidates policy and <BR>

<P>procedures in seven previous OMB directives and rescinds those <BR>

<P>directives, as follows:<BR>

<P>3. Analysis<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6, Definitions. Access and Dissemination. The original <BR>

<P>Circular No. A-130 distinguished between the terms ``access to <BR>

<P>information'' and ``dissemination of information'' in order to <BR>

<P>separate statutory requirements from policy considerations. The <BR>

<P>first term means giving members of the public, at their request, <BR>

<P>information to which they are entitled by a law such as the FOIA. <BR>

<P>The latter means actively distributing information to the public <BR>

<P>at the initiative of the agency. The distinction appeared useful <BR>

<P>at the time Circular No. A-130 was written, because it allowed <BR>

<P>OMB to focus discussion on Federal agencies' responsibilities for <BR>

<P>actively distributing information. However, popular usage and <BR>

<P>evolving technology have blurred differences between the terms <BR>

<P>``access'' and ``dissemination'' and readers of the Circular were <BR>

<P>confused by the distinction. For example, if an agency <BR>

<P>``disseminates'' information via an online computer system, one <BR>

<P>speaks of permitting users to ``access'' the information, and <BR>

<P>online ``access'' becomes a form of ``dissemination.''<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Thus, the revision defines only the term ``dissemination.'' <BR>

<P>Special considerations based on access statutes such as the <BR>

<P>Privacy Act and the FOIA are explained in context.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Government Information<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The definition of ``government information'' includes information <BR>

<P>created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of both <BR>

<P>by and for the Federal Government. This recognizes the <BR>

<P>increasingly distributed nature of information in electronic <BR>

<P>environments. Many agencies, in addition to collecting <BR>

<P>information for government use and for dissemination to the <BR>

<P>public, require members of the public to maintain information or <BR>

<P>to disclose it to the public. Sound information resources <BR>

<P>management dictates that agencies consider the costs and benefits <BR>

<P>of a full range of alternatives to meet government objectives. In <BR>

<P>some cases, there is no need for the government actually to <BR>

<P>collect the information itself, only to assure that it is made <BR>

<P>publicly available. For example, banks insured by the FDIC must <BR>

<P>provide statements of financial condition to bank customers on <BR>

<P>request. Particularly when information is available in electronic <BR>

<P>form, networks make the physical location of information <BR>

<P>increasingly irrelevant.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The inclusion of information created, collected, processed, <BR>

<P>disseminated, or disposed of for the Federal Government in the <BR>

<P>definition of ``government information'' does not imply that <BR>

<P>responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Circular <BR>

<P>itself extends beyond the executive agencies to other entities. <BR>

<P>Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with Section 4, <BR>

<P>Applicability, and with existing law. For example, the courts <BR>

<P>have held that requests to Federal agencies for release of <BR>

<P>information under the FOIA do not always extend to those <BR>

<P>performing information activities under grant or contract to a <BR>

<P>Federal agency. Similarly, grantees may copyright information <BR>

<P>where the government may not. Thus the information <BR>

<P>responsibilities of grantees and contractors are not identical to <BR>

<P>those of Federal agencies except to the extent that the agencies <BR>

<P>make them so in the underlying grants or contracts. Similarly, <BR>

<P>agency information resources management responsibilities do not <BR>

<P>extend to other entities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information Dissemination Product<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This notice defines the term ``information dissemination <BR>

<P>product'' to include all information that is disseminated by <BR>

<P>Federal agencies. While the provision of access to online <BR>

<P>databases and search software included on compact disk, read-only <BR>

<P>memory (CD-ROM) are often called information services rather than <BR>

<P>products, there is no clear distinction and, moreover, no real <BR>

<P>difference for policy purposes between the two. Thus, the term <BR>

<P>``information dissemination product'' applies to both products <BR>

<P>and services, and makes no distinction based on how the <BR>

<P>information is delivered.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(1). Information Management Planning. Parallel to new <BR>

<P>Section 7, Basic Considerations and Assumptions, Section 8a <BR>

<P>begins with information resources management planning. Planning <BR>

<P>is the process of establishing a course of action to achieve <BR>

<P>desired results with available resources. Planners translate <BR>

<P>organizational missions into specific goals and, in turn, into <BR>

<P>measurable objectives.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The PRA introduced the concept of information resources <BR>

<P>management and the principle of information as an institutional <BR>

<P>resource which has both value and associated costs. Information <BR>

<P>resources management is a tool that managers use to achieve <BR>

<P>agency objectives. Information resources management is successful <BR>

<P>if it enables managers to achieve agency objectives efficiently <BR>

<P>and effectively.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information resources management planning is an integral part of <BR>

<P>overall mission planning. Agencies need to plan from the outset <BR>

<P>for the steps in the information life cycle. When creating or <BR>

<P>collecting information, agencies must plan how they will process <BR>

<P>and transmit the information, how they will use it, how they will <BR>

<P>protect its integrity, what provisions they will make for access <BR>

<P>to it, whether and how they will disseminate it, how they will <BR>

<P>store and retrieve it, and finally, how the information will <BR>

<P>ultimately be disposed of. They must also plan for the effects <BR>

<P>their actions and programs will have on the public and State and <BR>

<P>local governments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Role of State and Local Governments<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB made additions at Sections 7a, 7e, and 7j, Basic <BR>

<P>Considerations and Assumptions, concerning State and local <BR>

<P>governments, and also in policy statements at Sections 8a(1)(c), <BR>

<P>(3)(f), (6)(c), 9(e), and 10(c).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State and local governments, and tribal governments, cooperate as <BR>

<P>major partners with the Federal Government in the collection, <BR>

<P>processing, and dissemination of information. For example, State <BR>

<P>governments are the principal collectors and/or producers of <BR>

<P>information in the areas of health, welfare, education, labor <BR>

<P>markets, transportation, the environment, and criminal justice. <BR>

<P>The States supply the Federal Government with data on aid to <BR>

<P>families with dependent children; medicare; school enrollments, <BR>

<P>staffing, and financing; statistics on births, deaths, and <BR>

<P>infectious diseases; population related data that form the basis <BR>

<P>for national estimates; employment and labor market data; and <BR>

<P>data used for census geography. National information resources <BR>

<P>are greatly enhanced through these major cooperating efforts.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal agencies need to be sensitive to the role of State and <BR>

<P>local governments, and tribal governments, in managing <BR>

<P>information and in managing information technology. When <BR>

<P>planning, designing, and carrying out information collections, <BR>

<P>agencies should systematically consider what effect their <BR>

<P>activities will have on cities, counties, and States, and take <BR>

<P>steps to involve these governments as appropriate. Agencies <BR>

<P>should ensure that their information collections impose the <BR>

<P>minimum burden and do not duplicate or conflict with local <BR>

<P>efforts or other Federal agency requirements or mandates. The <BR>

<P>goal is that Federal agencies routinely integrate State and local <BR>

<P>government concerns into Federal information resources management <BR>

<P>practices. This goal is consistent with standards for State and <BR>

<P>local government review of Federal policies and programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Training<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Training is particularly important in view of the changing nature <BR>

<P>of information resources management. Decentralization of <BR>

<P>information technology has placed the management of automated <BR>

<P>information and information technology directly in the hands of <BR>

<P>nearly all agency personnel rather than in the hands of a few <BR>

<P>employees at centralized facilities. Agencies must plan for <BR>

<P>incorporating policies and procedures regarding computer <BR>

<P>security, records management, protection of privacy, and other <BR>

<P>safeguards into the training of every employee and contractor.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(2). Information Collection. The PRA requires that the <BR>

<P>creation or collection of information be carried out in an <BR>

<P>efficient, effective, and economical manner. When Federal <BR>

<P>agencies create or collect information_just as when they perform <BR>

<P>any other program functions_they consume scarce resources. Such <BR>

<P>activities must be continually evaluated for their relevance to <BR>

<P>agency missions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies must justify the creation or collection of information <BR>

<P>based on their statutory functions. Policy statement 8a(2) uses <BR>

<P>the justification standard_``necessary for the proper performance <BR>

<P>of the functions of the agency''_established by the PRA (44 <BR>

<P>U.S.C. 3504(c)(2)). Furthermore, the policy statement includes <BR>

<P>the requirement that the information have practical utility, as <BR>

<P>defined in the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3502(16)) and elaborated in 5 CFR <BR>

<P>Part 1320. Practical utility includes such qualities of <BR>

<P>information as accuracy, adequacy, and reliability. In the case <BR>

<P>of general purpose statistics or recordkeeping, practical utility <BR>

<P>means that actual uses can be demonstrated (5 CFR 1320.7(o)). It <BR>

<P>should be noted that OMB's intent in placing emphasis on reducing <BR>

<P>unjustified burden in collecting information, an emphasis <BR>

<P>consistent with the Act, is not to diminish the importance of <BR>

<P>collecting information whenever agencies have legitimate program <BR>

<P>reasons for doing so. Rather, the concern is that the burdens <BR>

<P>imposed should not exceed the benefits to be derived from the <BR>

<P>information. Moreover, if the same benefit can be obtained by <BR>

<P>alternative means that impose a lesser burden, that alternative <BR>

<P>should be adopted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(3). Electronic Information Collection. Section 7l <BR>

<P>articulates a basic assumption of the Circular that modern <BR>

<P>information technology can help the government provide better <BR>

<P>service to the public through improved management of government <BR>

<P>programs. One potentially useful application of information <BR>

<P>technology is in the government's collection of information. <BR>

<P>While some information collections may not be good candidates for <BR>

<P>electronic techniques, many are. Agencies with major electronic <BR>

<P>information collection programs have found that automated <BR>

<P>information collections allow them to meet program objectives <BR>

<P>more efficiently and effectively. Electronic data interchange <BR>

<P>(EDI) and related standards for the electronic exchange of <BR>

<P>information will ease transmission and processing of routine <BR>

<P>business transaction information such as invoices, purchase <BR>

<P>orders, price information, bills of lading, health insurance <BR>

<P>claims, and other common commercial documents. EDI holds similar <BR>

<P>promise for the routine filing of regulatory information such as <BR>

<P>tariffs, customs declarations, license applications, tax <BR>

<P>information, and environmental reports.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Benefits to the public and agencies from electronic information <BR>

<P>collection appear substantial. Electronic methods of collection <BR>

<P>reduce paperwork burden, reduce errors, facilitate validation, <BR>

<P>and provide increased convenience and more timely receipt of <BR>

<P>benefits. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The policy in Section 8a(3) encourages agencies to explore the <BR>

<P>use of automated techniques for collection of information, and <BR>

<P>sets forth conditions conducive to the use of those techniques.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(4). Records Management. Section 8a(4) begins with the <BR>

<P>fundamental requirement for Federal records management, namely, <BR>

<P>that agencies create and keep adequate and proper documentation <BR>

<P>of their activities. Federal agencies cannot carry out their <BR>

<P>missions in a responsible and responsive manner without adequate <BR>

<P>recordkeeping. Section 7h articulates the basic considerations <BR>

<P>concerning records management. Policy statements concerning <BR>

<P>records management are also interwoven throughout Section 8a, <BR>

<P>particularly in subsections on planning (8a(1)(i)), information <BR>

<P>dissemination (8a(7)), and safeguards (8a(10)).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Records support the immediate needs of government_administrative, <BR>

<P>legal, fiscal_and ensure its continuity. Records are essential <BR>

<P>for protecting the rights and interests of the public, and for <BR>

<P>monitoring the work of public servants. The government needs <BR>

<P>records to ensure accountability to the public which includes <BR>

<P>making the information available to the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Each stage of the information life cycle carries with it records <BR>

<P>management responsibilities. Agencies need to record their plans, <BR>

<P>carefully document the content and procedures of information <BR>

<P>collection, ensure proper documentation as a feature of every <BR>

<P>information system, keep records of dissemination programs, and, <BR>

<P>finally, ensure that records of permanent value are preserved.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Preserving records for future generations is the archival <BR>

<P>mission. Advances in technology affect the amount of information <BR>

<P>that can be created and saved, and the ways this information can <BR>

<P>be made available. Technological advances can ease the task of <BR>

<P>records management; however, the rapid pace of change in modern <BR>

<P>technology makes decisions about the appropriate application of <BR>

<P>technology critical to records management. Increasingly the <BR>

<P>records manager must be concerned with preserving valuable <BR>

<P>electronic records in the context of a constantly changing <BR>

<P>technological environment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Records schedules are essential for the appropriate maintenance <BR>

<P>and disposition of records. Records schedules must be prepared in <BR>

<P>a timely fashion, implement the General Records Schedules issued <BR>

<P>by the National Archives and Records Administration, be approved <BR>

<P>by the Archivist of the United States, and be kept accurate and <BR>

<P>current. (See 44 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) The National Archives and <BR>

<P>Records Administration and the General Services Administration <BR>

<P>provide guidance and assistance to agencies in implementing <BR>

<P>records management responsibilities. They also evaluate agencies' <BR>

<P>records management programs to determine the extent to which they <BR>

<P>are appropriately implementing their records management <BR>

<P>responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Sections 8a(5) and 8a(6). Information Dissemination Policy. <BR>

<P>Section 8a(5). Providing information to the public. Every agency <BR>

<P>has a responsibility to inform the public within the context of <BR>

<P>its mission. This responsibility requires that agencies <BR>

<P>distribute information at the agency's initiative, rather than <BR>

<P>merely responding when the public requests information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The FOIA requires each agency to publish in the Federal Register <BR>

<P>current descriptions of agency organization, where and how the <BR>

<P>public may obtain information, the general methods and procedural <BR>

<P>requirements by which agency functions are determined, rules of <BR>

<P>procedure, descriptions of forms and how to obtain them, <BR>

<P>substantive regulations, statements of general policy, and <BR>

<P>revisions to all the foregoing (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)). The Privacy <BR>

<P>Act also requires publication of information concerning ``systems <BR>

<P>of records'' which are records retrieved by individual identifier <BR>

<P>such as name, Social Security Number, or fingerprint. The <BR>

<P>government in the Sunshine Act requires agencies to publish <BR>

<P>meeting announcements (5 U.S.C. 552b (e)(1)). The PRA (44 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>3507(a)(2)) and its implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) <BR>

<P>require agencies to publish notices when they submit information <BR>

<P>collection requests for OMB approval. The public's right of <BR>

<P>access to government information under these statutes is balanced <BR>

<P>against other concerns, such as an individual's right to privacy <BR>

<P>and protection of the government's deliberative process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As agencies satisfy these requirements, they provide the public <BR>

<P>basic information about government activities. Other statutes <BR>

<P>direct specific agencies to issue specific information <BR>

<P>dissemination products or to conduct information dissemination <BR>

<P>programs. Beyond generic and specific statutory requirements, <BR>

<P>agencies have responsibilities to disseminate information as a <BR>

<P>necessary part of performing their functions. For some agencies <BR>

<P>the responsibility is made explicit and sweeping; for example, <BR>

<P>the Agriculture Department is directed to ``.1A.1A. diffuse among <BR>

<P>people of the United States, useful information on subjects <BR>

<P>connected with agriculture. .1A.1A.'' (7 U.S.C. 2201) For other <BR>

<P>agencies, the responsibility may be much more narrowly drawn.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information dissemination is also a consequence of other agency <BR>

<P>activities. Agency programs normally include an organized effort <BR>

<P>to inform the public about the program. Most agencies carry out <BR>

<P>programs that create or collect information with the explicit or <BR>

<P>implicit intent that the information will be made public. <BR>

<P>Disseminating information is in many cases the logical extension <BR>

<P>of information creation or collection.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In other cases, agencies may have information that is not meant <BR>

<P>for public dissemination but which may be the subject of requests <BR>

<P>from the public. When the agency establishes that there is public <BR>

<P>demand for the information and that it is in the public interest <BR>

<P>to disseminate the information, the agency may decide to <BR>

<P>disseminate it automatically.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The policy in Section 8a(5)(d) sets forth several factors for <BR>

<P>agencies to take into account in conducting their information <BR>

<P>dissemination programs. First, agencies must balance two goals: <BR>

<P>maximizing the usefulness of the information to the government <BR>

<P>and the public, and minimizing the cost to both. Deriving from <BR>

<P>the basic purposes of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501), the two goals are <BR>

<P>frequently in tension because increasing usefulness usually costs <BR>

<P>more. Second, Section 8a(5)(d)(ii) requires agencies to conduct <BR>

<P>information dissemination programs equitably and in a timely <BR>

<P>manner. The word ``equal'' was removed from this Section since <BR>

<P>there may be instances where, for example, an agency determines <BR>

<P>that its mission includes disseminating information to certain <BR>

<P>specific groups or members of the public, and the agency <BR>

<P>determines that user charges will constitute a significant <BR>

<P>barrier to carrying out this responsibility. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(5)(d)(iii), requiring agencies to take advantage of <BR>

<P>all dissemination channels, recognizes that information reaches <BR>

<P>the public in many ways. Few persons may read a Federal Register <BR>

<P>notice describing an agency action, but those few may be major <BR>

<P>secondary disseminators of the information. They may be <BR>

<P>affiliated with publishers of newspapers, newsletters, <BR>

<P>periodicals, or books; affiliated with online database providers; <BR>

<P>or specialists in certain information fields. While millions of <BR>

<P>information users in the public may be affected by the agency's <BR>

<P>action, only a handful may have direct contact with the agency's <BR>

<P>own information dissemination products. As a deliberate strategy, <BR>

<P>therefore, agencies should cooperate with the information's <BR>

<P>original creators, as well as with secondary disseminators, in <BR>

<P>order to further information dissemination goals and foster a <BR>

<P>diversity of information sources. An adjunct responsibility to <BR>

<P>this strategy is reflected in Section 8a(5)(d)(iv), which directs <BR>

<P>agencies to assist the public in finding government information. <BR>

<P>Agencies may accomplish this, for example, by specifying and <BR>

<P>disseminating ``locator'' information, including information <BR>

<P>about content, format, uses and limitations, location, and means <BR>

<P>of access.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6). Information Dissemination Management System. This <BR>

<P>Section requires agencies to maintain an information <BR>

<P>dissemination management system which can ensure the routine <BR>

<P>performance of certain functions, including the essential <BR>

<P>functions previously required by Circular No. A-3. Smaller <BR>

<P>agencies need not establish elaborate formal systems, so long as <BR>

<P>the heads of the agencies can ensure that the functions are being <BR>

<P>performed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection (6)(a) carries over a requirement from OMB Circular <BR>

<P>No. A-3 that agencies' information dissemination products are to <BR>

<P>be, in the words of 44 U.S.C. 1108, ``necessary in the <BR>

<P>transaction of the public business required by law of the <BR>

<P>agency.'' (Circular No. A-130 uses the expression ``necessary for <BR>

<P>the proper performance of agency functions,'' which OMB considers <BR>

<P>to be equivalent to the expression in 44 U.S.C. 1108.) The point <BR>

<P>is that agencies should determine systematically the need for <BR>

<P>each information dissemination product.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6)(b) recognizes that to carry out effective <BR>

<P>information dissemination programs, agencies need knowledge of <BR>

<P>the marketplace in which their information dissemination products <BR>

<P>are placed. They need to know what other information <BR>

<P>dissemination products users have available in order to design <BR>

<P>the best agency product. As agencies are constrained by finite <BR>

<P>budgets, when there are several alternatives from which to <BR>

<P>choose, they should not expend public resources filling needs <BR>

<P>which have already been met by others in the public or private <BR>

<P>sector. Agencies have a responsibility not to undermine the <BR>

<P>existing diversity of information sources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At the same time, an agency's responsibility to inform the public <BR>

<P>may be independent of the availability or potential availability <BR>

<P>of a similar information dissemination product. That is, even <BR>

<P>when another governmental or private entity has offered an <BR>

<P>information dissemination product identical or similar to what <BR>

<P>the agency would produce, the agency may conclude that it <BR>

<P>nonetheless has a responsibility to disseminate its own product. <BR>

<P>Agencies should minimize such instances of duplication but could <BR>

<P>reach such a conclusion because legal considerations require an <BR>

<P>official government information dissemination product.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6)(c) makes the Circular consistent with current <BR>

<P>practice (See OMB Bulletins 88-15, 89-15, 90-09, and 91-16), by <BR>

<P>requiring agencies to establish and maintain inventories of <BR>

<P>information dissemination products. (These bulletins eliminated <BR>

<P>annual reporting to OMB of title-by-title listings of <BR>

<P>publications and the requirement for agencies to obtain OMB <BR>

<P>approval for each new periodical. Publications are now reviewed <BR>

<P>as necessary during the normal budget review process.) <BR>

<P>Inventories help other agencies and the public identify <BR>

<P>information which is available. This serves both to increase the <BR>

<P>efficiency of the dissemination function and to avoid unnecessary <BR>

<P>burdens of duplicative information collections. A corollary, <BR>

<P>enunciated in Section 8a(6)(d), is that agencies can better serve <BR>

<P>public information needs by developing finding aids for locating <BR>

<P>information produced by the agencies. Finally, Section 8a(6)(f) <BR>

<P>recognizes that there will be situations where agencies may have <BR>

<P>to take appropriate steps to ensure that members of the public <BR>

<P>with disabilities whom the agency has a responsibility to inform <BR>

<P>have a reasonable ability to access the information dissemination <BR>

<P>products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Depository Library Program<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Sections 8a(6)(g) and (h) pertain to the Federal Depository <BR>

<P>Library Program. Agencies are to establish procedures to ensure <BR>

<P>compliance with 44 U.S.C. 1902, which requires that government <BR>

<P>publications (defined in 44 U.S.C. 1901 and repeated in Section 6 <BR>

<P>of the Circular) be made available to depository libraries <BR>

<P>through the Government Printing Office (GPO).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Depository libraries are major partners with the Federal <BR>

<P>Government in the dissemination of information and contribute <BR>

<P>significantly to the diversity of information sources available <BR>

<P>to the public. They provide a mechanism for wide distribution of <BR>

<P>government information that guarantees basic availability to the <BR>

<P>public. Executive branch agencies support the depository library <BR>

<P>program both as a matter of law and on its merits as a means of <BR>

<P>informing the public about the government. On the other hand, the <BR>

<P>law places the administration of depository libraries with GPO. <BR>

<P>Agency responsibility for the depository libraries is limited to <BR>

<P>supplying government publications through GPO. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies can improve their performance in providing government <BR>

<P>publications as well as electronic information dissemination <BR>

<P>products to the depository library program. For example, the <BR>

<P>proliferation of ``desktop publishing'' technology in recent <BR>

<P>years has afforded the opportunity for many agencies to produce <BR>

<P>their own printed documents. Many such documents may properly <BR>

<P>belong in the depository libraries but are not sent because they <BR>

<P>are not printed at GPO. The policy requires agencies to establish <BR>

<P>management controls to ensure that the appropriate documents <BR>

<P>reach the GPO for inclusion in the depository library program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At present, few agencies provide electronic information <BR>

<P>dissemination products to the depository libraries. At the same <BR>

<P>time, a small but growing number of information dissemination <BR>

<P>products are disseminated only in electronic format. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB believes that, as a matter of policy, electronic information <BR>

<P>dissemination products generally should be provided to the <BR>

<P>depository libraries. Given that production and supply of <BR>

<P>information dissemination products to the depository libraries is <BR>

<P>primarily the responsibility of GPO, agencies should provide <BR>

<P>appropriate electronic information dissemination products to GPO <BR>

<P>for inclusion in the depository library program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While cost may be a consideration, agencies should not conclude <BR>

<P>without investigation that it would be prohibitively expensive to <BR>

<P>place their electronic information dissemination products in the <BR>

<P>depository libraries. For electronic information dissemination <BR>

<P>products other than online services, agencies may have the option <BR>

<P>of having GPO produce the information dissemination product for <BR>

<P>them, in which case GPO would pay for depository library costs. <BR>

<P>Agencies should consider this option if it would be a cost <BR>

<P>effective alternative to the agency making its own arrangements <BR>

<P>for production of the information dissemination product. Using <BR>

<P>GPO's services in this manner is voluntary and at the agency's <BR>

<P>discretion. Agencies could also consider negotiating other terms, <BR>

<P>such as inviting GPO to participate in agency procurement orders <BR>

<P>in order to distribute the necessary copies for the depository <BR>

<P>libraries. With adequate advance planning, agencies should be <BR>

<P>able to provide electronic information dissemination products to <BR>

<P>the depository libraries at nominal cost.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In a particular case, substantial cost may be a legitimate reason <BR>

<P>for not providing an electronic information dissemination product <BR>

<P>to the depository library program. For example, for an agency <BR>

<P>with a substantial number of existing titles of electronic <BR>

<P>information dissemination products, furnishing copies of each to <BR>

<P>the depository libraries could be prohibitively expensive. In <BR>

<P>that situation, the agency should endeavor to make available <BR>

<P>those titles with the greatest general interest, value, and <BR>

<P>utility to the public. Substantial cost could also be an <BR>

<P>impediment in the case of some online information services where <BR>

<P>the costs associated with operating centralized databases would <BR>

<P>make provision of unlimited direct access to numerous users <BR>

<P>prohibitively expensive. In both cases, agencies should consult <BR>

<P>with the GPO, in order to identify those information <BR>

<P>dissemination products with the greatest public interest and <BR>

<P>utility for dissemination. In all cases, however, where an agency <BR>

<P>discontinues publication of an information dissemination product <BR>

<P>in paper format in favor of electronic formats, the agency should <BR>

<P>work with the GPO to ensure availability of the information <BR>

<P>dissemination product to depository libraries.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Notice to the Public<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Sections 8a(6)(i) and (j) present new practices for agencies to <BR>

<P>observe in communicating with the public about information <BR>

<P>dissemination. Among agencies' responsibilities for dissemination <BR>

<P>is an active knowledge of, and regular consultation with, the <BR>

<P>users of their information dissemination products. A primary <BR>

<P>reason for communication with users is to gain their contribution <BR>

<P>to improving the quality and relevance of government <BR>

<P>information_how it is created, collected, and disseminated. <BR>

<P>Consultations with users might include participation at <BR>

<P>conferences and workshops, careful attention to correspondence <BR>

<P>and telephone communications (e.g., logging and analyzing <BR>

<P>inquiries), or formalized user surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A key part of communicating with the public is providing adequate <BR>

<P>notice of agency information dissemination plans. Because <BR>

<P>agencies' information dissemination actions affect other agencies <BR>

<P>as well as the public, agencies must forewarn other agencies of <BR>

<P>significant actions. The decision to initiate, terminate, or <BR>

<P>substantially modify the content, form, frequency, or <BR>

<P>availability of significant products should also trigger <BR>

<P>appropriate advance public notice. Where appropriate, the <BR>

<P>Government Printing Office should be notified directly. <BR>

<P>Information dissemination products deemed not to be significant <BR>

<P>require no advance notice.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Examples of significant products (or changes to them) might be <BR>

<P>those that:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a) are required by law; e.g., a statutorily mandated report to <BR>

<P>Congress;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b) involve expenditure of substantial funds;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c) by reason of the nature of the information, are matters of <BR>

<P>continuing public interest; e.g., a key economic indicator;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d) by reason of the time value of the information, command <BR>

<P>public interest; e.g., monthly crop reports on the day of their <BR>

<P>release;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(e) will be disseminated in a new format or medium; e.g., <BR>

<P>disseminating a printed product in electronic medium, or <BR>

<P>disseminating a machine-readable data file via on-line access.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Where members of the public might consider a proposed new agency <BR>

<P>product unnecessary or duplicative, the agency should solicit and <BR>

<P>evaluate public comments. Where users of an agency information <BR>

<P>dissemination product may be seriously affected by the <BR>

<P>introduction of a change in medium or format, the agency should <BR>

<P>notify users and consider their views before instituting the <BR>

<P>change. Where members of the public consider an existing agency <BR>

<P>product important and necessary, the agency should consider these <BR>

<P>views before deciding to terminate the product. In all cases, <BR>

<P>however, determination of what is a significant information <BR>

<P>dissemination product and what constitutes adequate notice are <BR>

<P>matters of agency judgment.<BR>

<P>Section 8a(6)(k) requires that the agency information <BR>

<P>dissemination management system ensure that, to the extent <BR>

<P>existing information dissemination policies or practices are <BR>

<P>inconsistent with the requirements of this Circular, an orderly <BR>

<P>transition to compliance with the requirements of this Circular <BR>

<P>is made. For example, some agency information dissemination <BR>

<P>products may be priced at a level which exceeds the cost of <BR>

<P>dissemination, or the agency may be engaged in practices which <BR>

<P>are otherwise unduly restrictive. In these instances, agencies <BR>

<P>must plan for an orderly transition to the substantive policy <BR>

<P>requirements of the Circular. The information dissemination <BR>

<P>management system must be capable of identifying these situations <BR>

<P>and planning for a reasonably prompt transition. Instances of <BR>

<P>existing agency practices which cannot immediately be brought <BR>

<P>into conformance with the requirements of the Circular are to be <BR>

<P>addressed through the waiver procedures of Section 10(b). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(7). Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices. Federal <BR>

<P>agencies are often the sole suppliers of the information they <BR>

<P>hold. The agencies have either created or collected the <BR>

<P>information using public funds, usually in furtherance of unique <BR>

<P>governmental functions, and no one else has it. Hence agencies <BR>

<P>need to take care that their behavior does not inappropriately <BR>

<P>constrain public access to government information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>When agencies use private contractors to accomplish <BR>

<P>dissemination, they must take care that they do not permit <BR>

<P>contractors to impose restrictions that undercut the agencies' <BR>

<P>discharge of their information dissemination responsibilities. <BR>

<P>The contractual terms should assure that, with respect to <BR>

<P>dissemination, the contractor behaves as though the contractor <BR>

<P>were the agency. For example, an agency practice of selling, <BR>

<P>through a contractor, on-line access to a database but refusing <BR>

<P>to sell copies of the database itself may be improperly <BR>

<P>restrictive because it precludes the possibility of another firm <BR>

<P>making the same service available to the public at a lower price. <BR>

<P>If an agency is willing to provide public access to a database, <BR>

<P>the agency should be willing to sell copies of the database <BR>

<P>itself.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>By the same reasoning, agencies should behave in an even-handed <BR>

<P>manner in handling information dissemination products. If an <BR>

<P>agency is willing to sell a database or database services to some <BR>

<P>members of the public, the agency should sell the same products <BR>

<P>under similar terms to other members of the public, unless <BR>

<P>prohibited by statute. When an agency decides it has public <BR>

<P>policy reasons for offering different terms of sale to different <BR>

<P>groups in the public, the agency should provide a clear statement <BR>

<P>of the policy and its basis.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should not attempt to exert control over the secondary <BR>

<P>uses of their information dissemination products. In particular, <BR>

<P>agencies should not establish exclusive, restricted, or other <BR>

<P>distribution arrangements which interfere with timely and <BR>

<P>equitable availability of information dissemination products, and <BR>

<P>should not charge fees or royalties for the resale or <BR>

<P>redissemination of government information. These principles <BR>

<P>follow from the fact that the law prohibits the Federal <BR>

<P>Government from exercising copyright. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should inform the public as to the limitations inherent <BR>

<P>in the information dissemination product (e.g., possibility of <BR>

<P>errors, degree of reliability, and validity) so that users are <BR>

<P>fully aware of the quality and integrity of the information. If <BR>

<P>circumstances warrant, an agency may wish to establish a <BR>

<P>procedure by which disseminators of the agency's information may <BR>

<P>at their option have the data and/or value-added processing <BR>

<P>checked for accuracy and certified by the agency. Using this <BR>

<P>method, rediseminators of the data would be able to respond to <BR>

<P>the demand for integrity from purchasers and users. This approach <BR>

<P>could be enhanced by the agency using its authority to trademark <BR>

<P>its information disseminaton product, and requiring that <BR>

<P>redisseminators who wish to use the trademark agree to <BR>

<P>appropriate integrity procedures. These methods have the <BR>

<P>possibility of promoting diversity, user responsiveness, and <BR>

<P>efficiency as well as integrity. However, an agency's <BR>

<P>responsibility to protect against misuse of a government <BR>

<P>information dissemination product does not extend to restricting <BR>

<P>or regulating how the public actually uses the information. <BR>

<P>Agencies should not attempt to condition the resale or <BR>

<P>redissemination of its information dissemination products by <BR>

<P>members of the public. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>User charges<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 (31 <BR>

<P>U.S.C. 9701) establishes Federal policy regarding fees assessed <BR>

<P>for government services, and for sale or use of government <BR>

<P>property or resources. OMB Circular No. A-25, User Charges, <BR>

<P>implements the statute. It provides for charges for government <BR>

<P>goods and services that convey special benefits to recipients <BR>

<P>beyond those accruing to the general public. It also establishes <BR>

<P>that user charges should be set at a level sufficient to recover <BR>

<P>the full cost of providing the service, resource, or property. <BR>

<P>Since Circular No. A-25 is silent as to the extent of its <BR>

<P>application to government information dissemination products, <BR>

<P>full cost recovery for information dissemination products might <BR>

<P>be interpreted to include the cost of collecting and processing <BR>

<P>information rather than just the cost of dissemination. The <BR>

<P>policy in Section 8a(8)(c) clarifies the policy of Circular No. <BR>

<P>A-25 as it applies to information dissemination products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Statutes such as FOIA and the Government in the Sunshine Act <BR>

<P>establish a broad and general obligation on the part of Federal <BR>

<P>agencies to make government information available to the public <BR>

<P>and to avoid erecting barriers that impede public access. User <BR>

<P>charges higher than the cost of dissemination may be a barrier to <BR>

<P>public access. The economic benefit to society is maximized when <BR>

<P>government information is publicly disseminated at the cost of <BR>

<P>dissemination. Absent statutory requirements to the contrary, the <BR>

<P>general standard for user charges for government information <BR>

<P>dissemination products should be to recover no more than the cost <BR>

<P>of dissemination. It should be noted in this connection that the <BR>

<P>government has already incurred the costs of creating and <BR>

<P>processing the information for governmental purposes in order to <BR>

<P>carry out its mission.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Underpinning this standard is the FOIA fee structure which <BR>

<P>establishes limits on what agencies can charge for access to <BR>

<P>Federal records. That Act permits agencies to charge only the <BR>

<P>direct reasonable cost of search, reproduction and, in certain <BR>

<P>cases, review of requested records. In the case of FOIA requests <BR>

<P>for information dissemination products, charges would be limited <BR>

<P>to reasonable direct reproduction costs alone. No search would be <BR>

<P>needed to find the product, thus no search fees would be charged. <BR>

<P>Neither would the record need to be reviewed to determine if it <BR>

<P>could be withheld under one of the Act's exemptions since the <BR>

<P>agency has already decided to release it. Thus, FOIA provides an <BR>

<P>information ``safety net'' for the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While OMB does not intend to prescribe procedures for pricing <BR>

<P>government information dissemination products, the cost of <BR>

<P>dissemination may generally be thought of as the sum of all costs <BR>

<P>specifically associated with preparing a product for <BR>

<P>dissemination and actually disseminating it to the public. When <BR>

<P>an agency prepares an information product for its own internal <BR>

<P>use, costs associated with such production would not generally be <BR>

<P>recoverable as user charges on subsequent dissemination. When the <BR>

<P>agency prepares the product for public dissemination, and <BR>

<P>disseminates it, costs associated with preparation and actual <BR>

<P>dissemination would be recoverable as user charges.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>When agencies provide custom tailored information services to <BR>

<P>specific individuals or groups, full cost recovery, including the <BR>

<P>costs of collection and processing, is appropriate. For example, <BR>

<P>if an agency prepares special tabulations or similar services <BR>

<P>from its databases in answer to a specific request from the <BR>

<P>public, all costs associated with fulfilling the request would be <BR>

<P>charged, and the requester should be so informed before work is <BR>

<P>begun.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In a few cases, agencies engaging in information collection <BR>

<P>activities augment the information collection at the request of, <BR>

<P>and with funds provided by, private sector groups. Since the <BR>

<P>1920s, the Bureau of the Census has carried out, on request, <BR>

<P>surveys of certain industries at greater frequency or at a <BR>

<P>greater level of detail than Federal funding would permit, <BR>

<P>because gathering the additional information is consistent with <BR>

<P>Federal purposes and industry groups have paid the additional <BR>

<P>information collection and processing costs. While the results of <BR>

<P>these surveys are disseminated to the public at the cost of <BR>

<P>dissemination, the existence and availability of the additional <BR>

<P>government data are special benefits to certain recipients beyond <BR>

<P>those accruing to the public. It is appropriate that those <BR>

<P>recipients should bear the full costs of information collection <BR>

<P>and processing, in addition to the normal costs of dissemination.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies must balance the requirement to establish user charges <BR>

<P>and the level of fees charged against other policies, <BR>

<P>specifically, the proper performance of agency functions and the <BR>

<P>need to ensure that information dissemination products reach the <BR>

<P>public for whom they are intended. If an agency mission includes <BR>

<P>disseminating information to certain specific groups or members <BR>

<P>of the public and the agency determines that user charges will <BR>

<P>constitute a significant barrier to carrying out this <BR>

<P>responsibility, the agency may have grounds for reducing or <BR>

<P>eliminating its user charges for the information dissemination <BR>

<P>product, or for exempting some recipients from the charge. Such <BR>

<P>reductions or eliminations should be the subject of agency <BR>

<P>determinations on a case by case basis and justified in terms of <BR>

<P>agency policies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(8). Electronic Information Dissemination. Advances in <BR>

<P>information technology have changed government information <BR>

<P>dissemination. Agencies now have available new media and formats <BR>

<P>for dissemination, including CD-ROM, electronic bulletin boards, <BR>

<P>and public networks. The growing public acceptance of electronic <BR>

<P>data interchange (EDI) and similar standards enhances their <BR>

<P>attractiveness as methods for government information <BR>

<P>dissemination. For example, experiments with the use of <BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards to advertise Federal contracting <BR>

<P>opportunities and to receive vendor quotes have achieved wider <BR>

<P>dissemination of information about business opportunities with <BR>

<P>the Federal Government than has been the case with traditional <BR>

<P>notices and advertisements. Improved information dissemination <BR>

<P>has increased the number of firms expressing interest in <BR>

<P>participating in the government market and decreased prices to <BR>

<P>the government due to expanded competition. In addition, the <BR>

<P>development of public electronic information networks, such as <BR>

<P>the Internet, provides an additional way for agencies to increase <BR>

<P>the diversity of information sources available to the public. <BR>

<P>Emerging standards such as Wide Area Information Servers (using <BR>

<P>the NISO Z39.50 standard) will be used increasingly to facilitate <BR>

<P>dissemination of government information such as environmental <BR>

<P>data, international trade information, and economic statistics in <BR>

<P>a networked environment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A basic purpose of the PRA is ``to maximize the usefulness of <BR>

<P>information collected, maintained, and disseminated by the <BR>

<P>Federal Government.'' (44 U.S.C. 3501(3)) Agencies can frequently <BR>

<P>enhance the value and practical utility of government information <BR>

<P>as a national resource by disseminating information in electronic <BR>

<P>media. Electronic collection and dissemination may substantially <BR>

<P>increase the usefulness of government information dissemination <BR>

<P>products for three reasons. First, information disseminated <BR>

<P>electronically is likely to be more timely and accurate because <BR>

<P>it does not require data re-entry. Second, electronic records <BR>

<P>often contain more complete and current information because, <BR>

<P>unlike paper, it is relatively easy to make frequent changes. <BR>

<P>Finally, because electronic information is more easily <BR>

<P>manipulated by the user and can be tailored to a wide variety of <BR>

<P>needs, electronic information dissemination products are more <BR>

<P>useful to the recipients.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As stated at Section 8a(1)(h), agencies should use voluntary <BR>

<P>standards and Federal Information Processing Standards to the <BR>

<P>extent appropriate in order to ensure the most cost effective and <BR>

<P>widespread dissemination of information in electronic formats.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies can frequently make government information more <BR>

<P>accessible to the public and enhance the utility of government <BR>

<P>information as a national resource by disseminating information <BR>

<P>in electronic media. Agencies generally do not utilize data in <BR>

<P>raw form, but edit, refine, and organize the data in order to <BR>

<P>make it more accessible and useful for their own purposes. <BR>

<P>Information is made more accessible to users by aggregating data <BR>

<P>into logical groupings, tagging data with descriptive and other <BR>

<P>identifiers, and developing indexing and retrieval systems to <BR>

<P>facilitate access to particular data within a larger file. As a <BR>

<P>general matter, and subject to budgetary, security, or legal <BR>

<P>constraints, agencies should make available such features <BR>

<P>developed for internal agency use as part of their information <BR>

<P>dissemination products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There will also be situations where the agency determines that <BR>

<P>its mission will be furthered by providing enhancements beyond <BR>

<P>those needed for its own use, particularly those that will <BR>

<P>improve the public availability of government information over <BR>

<P>the long term. In these instances, the agency should evaluate the <BR>

<P>expected usefulness of the enhanced information in light of its <BR>

<P>mission, and where appropriate construct partnerships with the <BR>

<P>private sector to add these elements of value. This approach may <BR>

<P>be particularly appropriate as part of a strategy to utilize new <BR>

<P>technology enhancements, such as graphic images, as part of a <BR>

<P>particular dissemination program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(9). Information Safeguards. The basic premise of this <BR>

<P>Section is that agencies should provide an appropriate level of <BR>

<P>protection to government information, given an assessment of the <BR>

<P>risks associated with its maintenance and use. Among the factors <BR>

<P>to be considered include meeting the specific requirements of the <BR>

<P>Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Security Act of 1987. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In particular, agencies are to ensure that they meet the <BR>

<P>requirements of the Privacy Act regarding information retrievable <BR>

<P>by individual identifier. Such information is to be collected, <BR>

<P>maintained, and protected so as to preclude intrusion into the <BR>

<P>privacy of individuals and the unwarranted disclosure of personal <BR>

<P>information. Individuals must be accorded access and amendment <BR>

<P>rights to records, as provided in the Privacy Act. To the extent <BR>

<P>that agencies share information which they have a continuing <BR>

<P>obligation to protect, agencies should see that appropriate <BR>

<P>safeguards are instituted. Appendix I prescribes agency <BR>

<P>procedures for the maintenance of records about individuals, <BR>

<P>reporting requirements to OMB and Congress, and other special <BR>

<P>requirements of specific agencies, in accordance with the Privacy <BR>

<P>Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This Section also incorporates the requirement of the Computer <BR>

<P>Security Act of 1987 that agencies plan to secure their systems <BR>

<P>commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that <BR>

<P>could result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to <BR>

<P>information contained in those systems. It includes assuring the <BR>

<P>integrity, availability, and appropriate confidentiality of <BR>

<P>information. It also involves protection against the harm that <BR>

<P>could occur to individuals or entities outside of the Federal <BR>

<P>Government as well as the harm to the Federal Government. Such <BR>

<P>protection includes limits on collection and sharing of <BR>

<P>information and procedures to assure the integrity of information <BR>

<P>as well as requirements to adequately secure the information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Incorporation of Circular No. A-114<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB Circular No. A-114, Management of Federal Audiovisual <BR>

<P>Activities, last revised on March 20, 1985, prescribes policies <BR>

<P>and procedures to improve Federal audiovisual management. <BR>

<P>Although OMB will rescind Circular No. A-114, its essential <BR>

<P>policies and procedures will continue. This revision provides <BR>

<P>information resources management policies and principles <BR>

<P>independent of medium, including paper, electronic, or <BR>

<P>audiovisual. By including the term ``audiovisual'' in the <BR>

<P>definition of ``information,'' audiovisual materials are <BR>
 
<P>incorporated into all policies of this Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The requirement in Circular No. A-114 that the head of each <BR>

<P>agency designate an office with responsibility for the management <BR>

<P>oversight of an agency's audiovisual productions and that an <BR>

<P>appropriate program for the management of audiovisual productions <BR>

<P>in conformance with 36 CFR 1232.4 is incorporated into this <BR>

<P>Circular at Section 9a(10). The requirement that audiovisual <BR>

<P>activities be obtained consistent with OMB Circular No. A-76 is <BR>

<P>covered by Sections 8a(1)(d), 8a(5)(d)(i) and 8a(6)(b).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Procurement policies contained in Circular No. A-114 will be <BR>

<P>incorporated into an Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The National Archives and Records Administration will continue to <BR>

<P>prescribe the records management and archiving practices of <BR>

<P>agencies with respect to audiovisual productions at 36 CFR <BR>

<P>1232.4, ``Audiovisual Records Management.'' <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 9a(11). Ombudsman. The senior agency official designated <BR>

<P>by the head of each agency under 44 U.S.C. 3506(b) is charged <BR>

<P>with carrying out the responsibilities of the agency under the <BR>

<P>PRA. Agency senior information resources management officials are <BR>

<P>responsible for ensuring that their agency practices are in <BR>

<P>compliance with OMB policies. It is envisioned that the agency <BR>

<P>senior information resources management official will work as an <BR>

<P>ombudsman to investigate alleged instances of agency failure to <BR>

<P>adhere to the policies set forth in the Circular and to recommend <BR>

<P>or take corrective action as appropriate. Agency heads should <BR>

<P>continue to use existing mechanisms to ensure compliance with <BR>

<P>laws and policies.<BR>

Title: Primer on Performance Measurement<BR>

<P>Author: OMB Training<BR>

<P>Date: February 28, 1995<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This primer was initially developed for OMB training<BR>

<P>purposes and may be revised again in the future. <BR>

<P>Forward comments and suggestions to Walter Groszyk<BR>

<P>via internet at GROSZYK_W@A1.EOP.GOV (1 in A1 is<BR>

<P>numerical) or to &quot;Norm Gunderson&quot; on FedWorld<BR>

<P>(703-321-8020 or TELNET FEDWORLD.GOV).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>PRIMER ON PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT<BR>

<P>    (Revised February 28, 1995)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      This &quot;primer&quot; defines several performance<BR>

<P>measurement terms, outlines areas or functions where<BR>

<P>performance measurement may be difficult, and<BR>

<P>provides examples of different types of performance<BR>

<P>measures.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>I.    Definition of Terms<BR>

<P>      No standard definitions currently exist.  In<BR>

<P>this primer, the definitions of output and outcome<BR>

<P>measures are those set out in GPRA. Input measures<BR>

<P>and impact measures are not defined in GPRA.  As<BR>

<P>GPRA is directed at establishing performance goals<BR>

<P>and targets, the definitions are prospective in<BR>

<P>nature.  Variations or divisions of these<BR>

<P>definitions can be found in other Federal programs<BR>

<P>as well as non-Federal measurement taxonomies.  For<BR>

<P>example, a measurement effort which retrospectively<BR>

<P>reports on performance might define &quot;input&quot; as<BR>

<P>resources consumed, rather than resources available. <BR>

<P>The nomenclature of measures cannot be rigidly<BR>

<P>applied;  one agency's output measure (e.g.,<BR>

<P>products produced) could be another agency's input<BR>

<P>measure (e.g., products received).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Outcome Measure<BR>

<P>GPRA Definition:   An assessment of the results of a<BR>

<P>program compared to its intended purpose.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Characteristics:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Outcome measurement cannot be done until the<BR>

<P>results expected from a program or activity have<BR>

<P>been first defined. As such, an outcome is a<BR>

<P>statement of basic expectations, often grounded in a<BR>

<P>statute, directive, or other document.  (In GPRA,<BR>

<P>the required strategic plan would be a primary means<BR>

<P>of defining or identifying expected outcomes.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Outcome measurement also cannot be done until<BR>

<P>a program (of fixed duration) is completed, or until<BR>

<P>a program (which is continuing indefinitely) has<BR>

<P>reached a point of maturity or steady state    <BR>

<P>operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      While the preferred measure, outcomes are<BR>

<P>often not susceptible to annual measurement. (For<BR>

<P>example, an outcome goal setting a target of by<BR>

<P>2005, collecting 94 percent of all income taxes<BR>

<P>annually owed cannot be measured, as an outcome,<BR>

<P>until that year.)  Also, managers are more likely to<BR>

<P>primarily manage against outputs rather than<BR>

<P>outcomes.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      The measurement of incremental progress<BR>

<P>toward a specific outcome goal is sometimes referred<BR>

<P>to as an intermediate outcome.  (Using the example<BR>

<P>above, a target of collecting 88 percent of taxes<BR>

<P>owed in 2002 might be characterized as an<BR>

<P>intermediate outcome.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Output Measure<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GPRA Definition:   A tabulation, calculation, or<BR>

<P>recording of activity or effort that can be<BR>

<P>expressed in a quantitative or qualitative manner.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Characteristics:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      The GPRA definition of output measure is very<BR>

<P>broad, covering all performance measures except<BR>

<P>input, outcome or impact measures. Thus it covers<BR>

<P>output, per se, as well as other measures. -<BR>

<P>Strictly defined, output is the goods and services<BR>

<P>produced by a program or organization and provided<BR>

<P>to the public or to other programs or organizations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> -      Other measures include process measures<BR>

<P>(e.g., paperflow, consultation), attribute measures<BR>

<P>(e.g., timeliness, accuracy, customer satisfaction),<BR>

<P>and measures of efficiency or effectiveness. -     <BR>

<P>Output may be measured either as the total quantity<BR>

<P>of a good or service produced, or may be limited to<BR>

<P>those goods or services with certain attributes<BR>

<P>(e.g., number of timely and accurate benefit<BR>

<P>payments).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Some output measures are developed and used<BR>

<P>independent of any outcome measure.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      All outputs can be measured annually or more<BR>

<P>frequently.  The number of output measures will<BR>

<P>generally exceed the number of outcome measures.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      In GPRA, both outcome and output measures are<BR>

<P>set out as performance goals or performance<BR>

<P>indicators.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     -      GPRA defines a performance goal as a<BR>

<P>target level of performance expressed as a tangible,<BR>

<P>measurable objective, against which actual<BR>

<P>performance can be compared, including a goal<BR>

<P>expressed as a quantitative standard, value, or<BR>

<P>rate. e.g., A goal might be stated as &quot;Improve<BR>

<P>maternal and child health on tribal reservations to<BR>

<P>meet 95 percent of the national standards for     <BR>

<P>healthy mothers and children by 1998&quot;.  (Note that<BR>

<P>this goal would rely on performance indicators (see<BR>

<P>below) to be measured effectively.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      GPRA defines a performance indicator as<BR>

<P>a particular value or characteristic used to measure<BR>

<P>output or outcome. e.g., Indicators for the maternal<BR>

<P>and child health goal above might include morbidity<BR>

<P>and mortality rates for this population cohort,     <BR>

<P>median infant birth weights, percentages of tribal<BR>

<P>children receiving full immunization shot series,<BR>

<P>frequency of pediatric checkups, etc.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Performance goals which are<BR>

<P>self-measuring do not require separate indicators.<BR>

<P>e.g., A performance goal stating that the FAA     <BR>

<P>would staff 300 airport control towers on a 24 hour<BR>

<P>basis in FY 1996.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Impact Measure<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Definition:  These are measures of the direct or<BR>

<P>indirect effects or consequences resulting from<BR>

<P>achieving program goals.  An example of an impact is<BR>

<P>the comparison of actual program outcomes with<BR>

<P>estimates of the outcomes that would have       <BR>

<P>occurred in the absence of the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Characteristics:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Measuring program impact often is done by<BR>

<P>comparing program outcomes with estimates of the<BR>

<P>outcomes that would have occurred in the absence of<BR>

<P>the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      One example of measuring direct impact<BR>

<P>is to compare the outcome for a randomly assigned<BR>

<P>group receiving a service with the outcome for a<BR>

<P>randomly assigned group not receiving the service.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      If the impacts are central to the purpose of a<BR>

<P>program, these effects may be stated or included in<BR>

<P>the outcome measure itself.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Impacts can be indirect, and some<BR>

<P>impacts are often factored into cost-benefit<BR>

<P>analyses.  An outcome goal might be to complete<BR>

<P>construction of a large dam; the impact of           <BR>

<P>the completed dam might be reduced incidence of<BR>

<P>damaging floods, additional acreage converted to<BR>

<P>agricultural use, and increased storage of clean<BR>

<P>water supplies, etc.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      The measurement of impact is generally done<BR>

<P>through special comparison-type studies, and not<BR>

<P>simply by using data regularly collected through<BR>

<P>program information systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Input Measure<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Definition:  Measures of what an agency or manager<BR>

<P>has available to carry out the program or activity: <BR>

<P>i.e., achieve an outcome or output.  These can<BR>

<P>include:  employees (FTE), funding, equipment or<BR>

<P>facilities, supplies on hand, goods or services<BR>

<P>received, work processes or rules.  When         <BR>

<P>calculating efficiency, input is defined as the<BR>

<P>resources used.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Characteristics:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Inputs used to produce particular outputs may<BR>

<P>be identified through cost accounting.  In a less<BR>

<P>detailed correlation, significant input costs can be<BR>

<P>associated with outputs by charging them to the<BR>

<P>appropriate program budget account.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Often, a physical or human resource base<BR>

<P>(e.g., land acreage, square footage of owned<BR>

<P>buildings, number of enrollees) at the start of the<BR>

<P>measurement period is characterized as an input.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      - Changes to the resource base (e.g., purchase<BR>

<P>of additional land) or actions taken with respect to<BR>

<P>the resource base (e.g., modernize x square footage,<BR>

<P>convert y enrollees to a different plan) are<BR>

<P>classified as outputs or outcomes.<BR>

<P>

<P>program:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Outcome:   Completely eradicate tropical spastic<BR>

<P>           paraparesis (which is a real disease<BR>

<P>           transmitted by human-to-human contact) by<BR>

<P>           2005<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Outputs:   1.)   Confine incidence in 1996 to only<BR>

<P>           three countries in South America, and no<BR>

<P>           more than 5,000 reported cases. (Some<BR>

<P>           would characterize this step toward<BR>

<P>          eradication as an intermediate outcome.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Inputs:      1.)   17 million doses of vaccine<BR>

<P>             2.)   150 health professionals<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Impact:      Eliminate a disease that affects 1 in<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Input:       $300 million in appropriations<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Impact:      Job training increases the employment<BR>

<P>rate of welfare recipients from 30 percent (the<BR>

<P>employment level of comparable welfare recipients<BR>

<P>who did not receive job training) to 40 percent (the<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Impact:      The protection of this biome as one of<BR>

<P>
<P>II.   Complexities of Measurement<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A.    Functional Areas.          Some types of<BR>

<P>programs or activities are particularly difficult to<BR>

<P>measure.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Basic Research, because often:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      likely outcomes are not calculable<BR>

<P>(can't be quantified) in advance;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      knowledge gained is not always of<BR>

<P>immediate value or application<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      results are more serendipitous than<BR>

<P>predictable;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      there is a high percentage of negative<BR>

<P>determinations or findings;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      the unknown cannot be measured.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      (Applied research, applied technology,<BR>

<P>or the &quot;D&quot; in R&amp;D is more readily measurable because<BR>

<P>it usually is directed toward a specific goal or<BR>

<P>end.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Foreign Affairs, especially for outcomes, to<BR>

<P>the extent that:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      the leaders and electorate of other<BR>

<P>nations properly act in their own national interest,<BR>

<P>which may differ from those of the United States <BR>

<P>(e.g., Free Territory of Memel does not agree with<BR>

<P>US policy goal of reducing US annual trade deficit<BR>

<P>with Memel to $1 billion);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      US objectives are stated as policy<BR>

<P>principles, recognizing the impracticality of their<BR>

<P>universal achievement;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      goal achievement relies mainly on<BR>

<P>actions by other countries (e.g., by 1999, Mayaland<BR>

<P>will reduce the volume of illegal opiates being<BR>

<P>transhipped through Mayaland to the US by 65 percent<BR>

<P>from current levels of 1250 metric tons).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Policy Advice, because often:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      it is difficult to calculate the<BR>

<P>quality or value of the advice;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      advice consists of presenting competing<BR>

<P>views by different parties with different<BR>

<P>perspectives;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      policy advice may be at odds with the<BR>

<P>practicalities of political advice.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Block Grants, to the extent that:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      funds are not targeted to particular<BR>

<P>programs or purposes;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      the recipient has great latitude or<BR>

<P>choice in how the money will be spent;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      there is little reporting on what the<BR>

<P>funds were used for or what was accomplished.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>B.    By Type of Measure. Some measures are harder<BR>

<P>to measure than others.  Some of the difficulties<BR>

<P>include:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      For outcome, output, and impact measures<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Direct Federal accountability is<BR>

<P>lessened because non-Federal parties (other than<BR>

<P>those under a procurement contract) are responsible<BR>

<P>for the administration or operation of the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      The magnitude and/or intrusiveness of<BR>

<P>the performance reporting burden.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      The nature and extent of performance<BR>

<P>validation or verification requires a substantial<BR>

<P>effort.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Individual accountability or<BR>

<P>responsibility is diffuse.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      For outcome measures<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Timetable or dates for achievement may<BR>

<P>be sporadic.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Achievement often lags by several years<BR>

<P>or more after the funds are spent.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Results frequently are not immediately<BR>

<P>evident, and can be determined only through a formal<BR>

<P>program evaluation.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Accomplishment is interrupted because<BR>

<P>of intervening factors, changes in priorities, etc.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Changing basepoints can impede<BR>

<P>achievement (e.g., recalculation of eligible<BR>

<P>beneficiaries).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Achievement depends on a major change<BR>

<P>in public behavior.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      The outcome is for a cross-agency<BR>

<P>program or policy, and assigning relative contributions or<BR>

<P>responsibilities to individual agencies is a complex<BR>

<P>undertaking.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      For output measures<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Equal-appearing outputs are not always<BR>

<P>equal (e.g., the time and cost of overhauling one type<BR>

<P>of jet engine can be very different from another type of jet<BR>

<P>engine).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      It may be difficult to weight outputs<BR>

<P>to allow different (but similar appearing) outputs to be<BR>

<P>combined in a larger aggregate.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Many efficiency and effectiveness<BR>

<P>measures depend on agencies having cost accounting systems<BR>

<P>and the capability to allocate and cumulate costs on a<BR>

<P>unit basis.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      For impact measures<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Impacts are often difficult to measure.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      A large number of other variables or<BR>

<P>factors contribute to or affect the impact, and which can be<BR>

<P>difficult to separate out when determining causality.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Federal funding or Federal program<BR>

<P>efforts are of secondary or even more marginal significance to<BR>

<P>the achieved outcome.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Determining the impact can be very<BR>

<P>expensive, and not commensurate with the value received<BR>

<P>from a policy or political standpoint.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      Holding a manager accountable for<BR>

<P>impacts can be a formidable challenge.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      For input measures<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      -      The measurement itself should not be<BR>

<P>complicated, but the alignment of inputs with outputs can be<BR>

<P>difficult.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>III.  Emphasized Measures in GPRA<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A.    GPRA emphasizes the use and reporting of<BR>

<P>performance measures that managers use to manage.  There are<BR>

<P>several reasons for this emphasis:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             GPRA increases the accountability of<BR>

<P>managers for producing results.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             Underscores that these measures are<BR>

<P>central to an agency's capacity and approach for administering<BR>

<P>programs and conducting operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             -     Because of this, the amount of<BR>

<P>additional resources to develop and improve<BR>

<P>performance measurement and reporting systems should be<BR>

<P>rather limited.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             -     The conundrum is that agencies<BR>

<P>requesting large amounts of additional resources<BR>

<P>would be conceding either that their programs were<BR>

<P>not being managed, or were being managed using an<BR>

<P>inappropriate or poor set of performance measures.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>B.    As output measures are more readily and easily<BR>

<P>developed than outcome measures, more of these are expected<BR>

<P>initially in the GPRA-required performance plans, but agencies<BR>

<P>should move toward increasing the number and quality of outcome<BR>

<P>measures.<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>Please Note:  For the purpose of these examples:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Some of the outcome measures are much more<BR>

<P>narrowly defined than would otherwise be appropriate or expected.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Some of the outcome measures are not<BR>

<P>inherently measurable, and would require use of supplementary<BR>

<P>performance indicators to set specific performance targets and<BR>

<P>determine whether these were achieved.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Some measures include several aspects of<BR>

<P>performance.  Italics are used to feature the particular<BR>

<P>characteristic of that example.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      Many of the examples of output measures are<BR>

<P>process or attribute measures.<BR>

<P>                                    PREFACE<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          On September 29, 1993, Director Leon E. Panetta issued a<BR>

<P>          memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies outlining<BR>

<P>          initiatives the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is<BR>

<P>          undertaking to facilitate the devleopment, review, and operation<BR>

<P>          of customer surveys.  These activities include:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  preparing and disseminating a Resource Manual for Customer<BR>

<P>               Surveys;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  employing &quot;generic&quot; clearances to expedite approval of<BR>

<P>               certain voluntary customer surveys; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  offering through the Joint Program in Survey Methodology<BR>

<P>               courses and consultations to enhance agency expetrise in<BR>

<P>               conducting customer surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Together, these efforts have been designed to support surveys of<BR>

<P>          Federal agency customers &quot;to determine the kind and quality of<BR>

<P>          services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing<BR>

<P>          services,&quot; as called for in President Clinton's September 11,<BR>

<P>          1993, Executive Order No. 12862.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          This edition of the Resource Manual for Customer Surveys<BR>

<P>          includes information on techniques for designing and implementing<BR>

<P>          customer satisfaction surveys, strategies for expediting their <BR>

<P>          approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and opportunities for<BR>

<P>          learning how to improve their quality. Our decision to issue the <BR>

<P>          manual in loose-leaf format reflects both philosophical and practical<BR>

<P>          considerations. From a philosophical perspective, we recognize<BR>

<P>          that customer surveys represent a new venture for many agencies;<BR>

<P>          from a practical standpoint, we acknowledge that this first<BR>

<P>          edition has been assembled in a time frmae that has limited our<BR>

<P>          sources of information.  We plan to supplement this manual as we<BR>

<P>          learn together.  In this connection, we particularly look<BR>

<P>          forward to benefitting from your insights and experiences. This <BR>

<P>          process begins with the feedback sheet for updates and suggestions<BR>

<P>          included at the end of the manual.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          In the truest sense, the production of this manual reflects a<BR>

<P>          partnership of government, academic, and business organizations.<BR>

<P>          The many individuals who shared their time and talents as the<BR>

<P>          Resource Manual for Customer Surveys was developed under the<BR>

<P>          leadership of Jerry Coffey are listed on the following page.  We<BR>

<P>          are particularly indebted to Robert Groves oft he Joint Program<BR>

<P>          in Survey Methodology and to Fritz Scheuren and Wendy Alvey of<BR>

<P>          the Internal Revenue Service for their exceptional dedication to<BR>

<P>          this effort.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>                                  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          This manual represents the contributions of a great many<BR>

<P>          individuals and organizations who provided ideas, time and<BR>

<P>          talent to the project. The idea for the manual grew out of a <BR>

<P>          Symposium on Client Satisfaction Surveys sponsored by the Social <BR>

<P>          Security Administration.  It drew support from the heads of Federal<BR>

<P>          statistical agencies who designated key staff to participate in<BR>

<P>          an Interest Group on Customer Surveys.  Robert Groves of the<BR>

<P>          Joint Program in Survey Methodology organized a consultant panel<BR>

<P>          representing the private sector, academia, and Fdeeral agencies<BR>

<P>          which provided invaluable advice and expertise.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          Executive Order 12862<BR>

<P>               &quot;Setting Customer Service Standards&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          On September 11, 1993, the President signed Executive Order<BR>

<P>          12862 aimed at --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>              &quot;Ensuring that the Federal Government provides the<BR>

<P>               highest quality service possible to the American people.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The Executive Order establishes an explicit goal for the quality<BR>

<P>          of service --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>               &quot;Customer service equal to the best in business.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          That is --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>               &quot;The highest quality of service delivered to customers by<BR>

<P>                private organizations providing a comparable or analogous<BR>

<P>                service.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The Executive Order requires three survey tasks as steps in<BR>

<P>          establishing and implementing customer service standards --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             -  Surveying &quot;customers to determine hte kind<BR>

<P>                and quality of services that they want.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             -  Surveying customers to determine &quot;their level<BR>

<P>                of satisfaction with existing services.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             -  Surveying &quot;front-line employees on barriers to,<BR>

<P>                and ideas for, matching the best in business.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Our primary focus in this manual is on the first two of these<BR>

<P>          survey tasks.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          1.1    Goals and Organization of the Manual<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The Executive Order sets a goal of matching the best customer<BR>

<P>          service achieved in the private sector.  The goal of this manual<BR>

<P>          is to present methods and practices equal to the best customer<BR>

<P>          satisfaction research and measurement performances achieved in<BR>

<P>          the private sector.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          To meet this goal the manual is organized around the following<BR>

<P>          objectives --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To describe a general approach to customer<BR>

<P>               surveys (Section 2).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To lay out the specific steps and issues involved in a data<BR>

<P>               collection program (Section 3).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To explore some further considerations in developing a plan<BR>

<P>               (Section 4).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To examine ways to streamline the statutory review process<BR>

<P>               for those data collections covered by the Paperwork<BR>

<P>               Reduction Act (Section 5).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To document sources of assistance in Federal statistical<BR>

<P>               agencies for planning and executing customer surveys<BR>

<P>               (Section 6).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            -  To outline training opportunities available from the Joint<BR>

<P>               Program in Survey Methodology (Section 7).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The manual also provides bibliographical information and<BR>

<P>          technical appendices on pertinent topics, copies of policy<BR>

<P>          documents, and a reference report on contracting for statistical<BR>

<P>          services.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          1.2 Future Manual Updates<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Just as customer service improvement is an iterative learning<BR>

<P>          process, this manual is intended to be updated and expanded as<BR>

<P>          Federal agencies gain useful experience.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The manual has been produced in loose-leaf format so that<BR>

<P>          additional material can be added from time to time.  Each<BR>

<P>          subsection begins on a new page to facilitate insertion of new<BR>

<P>          or revised material.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Planned supplements will include brief case studies prepared by<BR>

<P>          participating agencies and information on new resources as it<BR>

<P>          becomes available.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          2.     GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON<BR>

<P>                 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEYS<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          2.1  What are Customer Satisfaction Surveys?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Customer satisfaction surveys are a tool for learning about<BR>

<P>          agency services from a customer's perspective. They are a form<BR>

<P>          of evaluation pioneered in the private sector, not in goevrnment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          In fact, customer satisfaction surveys differ substantially from<BR>

<P>          methods traditionally used in evaluation of Federal programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Traditional program evaluation addresses the objective outcomes<BR>

<P>          of a program, while customer satisfaction surveys focus on<BR>

<P>          customer perceptions, preferences, and related opinions about an<BR>

<P>          agency's performance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Not only do customer surveys provide insight into customer<BR>

<P>          perceptions, they also can help identify agency operations that<BR>

<P>          need quality improvement, provide early detection of problems,<BR>

<P>          and focus attention on areas where remedial training or changes<BR>

<P>          in existing operations might improve delivery of products or<BR>

<P>          services.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The one thing that all customer satisfaction surveys have in<BR>

<P>          common is that they solicit opinions.  Both quantitative and<BR>

<P>          qualitative studies of opinions play important roles:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>            - Quantitative Studies -- In the ucrrent context, the<BR>

<P>              object of a quantitative study is to produce<BR>

<P>              statistical descriptions (careful, repeatable<BR>

<P>              measurements) of customer satisfaction related<BR>

<P>              to a fixed set of agency perceptions or<BR>

<P>              activities.  For example,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>                     a set of questions concerning satisfaction<BR>

<P>                     with timeliness, courtesy, accuracy and<BR>

<P>                     other particular aspects of your agency's<BR>

<P>                     operations, administered to a random<BR>

<P>                     sample drawn from a complete, current list<BR>

<P>                     of customers for a particular program --<BR>

<P>                     with the object of making comparative<BR>

<P>                     measurements over time.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>            - QualitativeS tudies -- Qualitative studies can play<BR>

<P>              many roles, from the basic task of<BR>

<P>              understanding customer perceptions and<BR>

<P>              expectations, to the task of developing survey<BR>

<P>              instruments (e.g., questionnaires) for a<BR>

<P>              quantitative study.  For example,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>                     a focus group of customers, sasembled to<BR>

<P>                     discuss a specific set of questions -- to<BR>

<P>                     respond in their own words about their<BR>

<P>                     expectations, to relate their own<BR>

<P>                     experiences with agency services, or to<BR>

<P>                     discuss improvements they would like to<BR>

<P>                     see;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>                                             or<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>                     a cognitive laboratory experiment that<BR>

<P>                     asks volunteer subjects to tell what they<BR>

<P>                     are thinking as they read a survey<BR>

<P>                     question -- what they understand the words<BR>

<P>                     to mean and what they think the question<BR>

<P>                     is asking.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          The most important distinction is that qualitative methods are<BR>

<P>          intended to produce understanding and insight, while<BR>

<P>          quantitative methods are intended to produce statistical <BR>

<P>          measurements describing large populations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          2.2  How are Customer Satisfaction Surveys Used?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          One example of the way the private sector uses customer<BR>

<P>          satisfaction surveys is to look at the overall gap between<BR>

<P>          customer expectations and their perceptions of actual service<BR>

<P>          performance. These overall gaps are then related to a series of<BR>

<P>          gaps within an organization that may contribute to the shortfall<BR>

<P>          in perceived performance:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - The difference between actual customer<BR>

<P>              expectations and management perceptions of<BR>

<P>              those expectations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Errors in translating management perceptions<BR>

<P>              into quality standards.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - The shortfall of service or product delivery<BR>

<P>              relative to standards.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - External communications to clients (e.g.,<BR>

<P>              advertising) that inflate or otherwise alter<BR>

<P>              expectations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          While these ideas have generated much discussion and technical<BR>

<P>          debate (identifying the components of satisfaction, the<BR>

<P>          consequences of a separate measure of expectations, etc.), they<BR>

<P>          have also motivated a valuable set of management precepts that<BR>

<P>          have been applied broadly to programs to improve customer<BR>

<P>          satisfaction. Among these are to --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Involve and ensure the support of top<BR>

<P>              management.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Define client satisfaction in the client's<BR>

<P>              terms.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Establish focused and measurable objectives.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Define measurements that are &quot;actionable.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Build customer awareness at all levels of an<BR>

<P>              organization.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Tailor measurements to actual operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Carry out satisfaction measurement<BR>

<P>              continuously.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Incorporate the results into the regular<BR>

<P>              management information system.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          One final point to consider in applying customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>          surveys to agency operations is that private sector practice may<BR>

<P>          need some modification.  Given the new ground agencies may have<BR>

<P>          to break in mounting customer surveys, it is expected that<BR>

<P>          whatever measurement process is put in place initially, your<BR>

<P>          agency may need to make a major investment to sharpen the focus<BR>

<P>          and otherwise improve on beginning efforts.<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>          2.3    How are Customer Satisfaction Surveys Connected<BR>

<P>                 to Agency Operations?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The focus of this manual is on surveys of customers, but these<BR>

<P>          surveys are not an end in themselves.  The ultimate objective is<BR>

<P>          to use survey data to direct actions to improve customer<BR>

<P>          service.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          To reach this objective, many other kinds of studies, both<BR>

<P>          qualitative and quantitative, often are required. Among the<BR>

<P>          sources of information valuable for a program to improve<BR>

<P>          customer satisfaction are --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Surveys of employees.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Inputs from all levels of management.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Reviews of agency operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Internal performance measurement systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Complaint and suggestion systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          To be useful (actionable), customer satisfaction surveys need to<BR>

<P>          be designed so the results obtained can be linked with these<BR>

<P>          other sources of information.  This may affect, for instance,<BR>

<P>          the frequency of customer satisfaction measurement and the degree to<BR>

<P>          which such measures are specific to identifiable agency missions<BR>

<P>          or activities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          It is possible that some existing agency information systems may<BR>

<P>          need to be redesigned as well.  More will be said about<BR>

<P>          integration issues in the next section, which provides a<BR>

<P>          step-by-step approach to designing a customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>          survey.<BR>

<P>                 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          3.1  Introduction<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          This section provides a step-by-step guide to mounting a<BR>

<P>          customer satisfaction survey.  The guide focuses on the <BR>

<P>          methodology of designing, conducting, and analyzing a survey, <BR>

<P>          not on administrative, clearance, or funding issues.  (OMB <BR>

<P>          clearance is covered in Section 5.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The survey-taking tasks have been divided into twelve stages --<BR>

<P>          beginning with early planning activities and ending with the<BR>

<P>          presentation and analysis of results. (See Figure 1)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          While much of what is said applies to surveys generally, there<BR>

<P>          are other features that are unique to customer surveys.  For<BR>

<P>          example, asking about customer attitudes and opinions requires<BR>

<P>          more careful consideration of the underlying concept that should<BR>

<P>          be measured than asking factual questions.  In addition, to be<BR>

<P>          useful to managers, customer survey results must be related to<BR>

<P>          actions that the agency might take to alter customer perceptions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          3.2  Top Management Role<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Top management needs to provide leadership in the activities set<BR>

<P>          out here, particularly at --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 1, where the scope of the customer<BR>

<P>              measurement program is set.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Heavy involvement is also needed by top management at --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 2, where an attempt is made to identify<BR>

<P>              the factors and characteristics that contribute<BR>

<P>              to customer satisfaction.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          After Step 2 there may be a need for top management leadership<BR>

<P>          in refining the scope of the measurement program.  In fact, an<BR>

<P>          extensive back and forth effort may occur between Steps 1 and 2<BR>

<P>          and ample time should be allowed for this.  These first two<BR>

<P>          steps are far and away the most important and the most in need of <BR>

<P>          top management attention.  On the other hand, while many of the <BR>

<P>          next steps in the survey-taking process will need monitoring by top<BR>

<P>          management, they can be carried out, for the most part, by<BR>

<P>          technical staff.  In particular --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 3, where decisions on scope are translated<BR>

<P>              into the activities needed to identify the<BR>

<P>              particular customer populations targeted for<BR>

<P>              study.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 4, where information on how to contact the<BR>

<P>              targeted customers is developed.  (This is also<BR>

<P>              referred to as constructing the sampling<BR>

<P>              frame.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 5, where the data collection method is<BR>

<P>              chosen (telephone, mail, face-to-face).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Direct top management action may again be advisable at --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 6, where decisions on who will actually<BR>

<P>              conduct the survey are made (e.g., contract it<BR>

<P>              out or do it in-house).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The remaining steps, except the last, are largely operational in<BR>

<P>          nature and need to be implemented by a team of in-house survey<BR>

<P>          experts or an outside contractor. These are --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 7, developing and pretesting the<BR>

<P>              questionnaire.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 8, designing the statistical sample.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 9, implementing techniques to achieve high<BR>

<P>              response rates.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Decisions on the overall sample size and the response rate goals<BR>

<P>          of the survey have cost implications, and top management needs<BR>

<P>          to be involved in those decisions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 10, monitoring and obtaining high uqality<BR>

<P>              data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 11, processing the survey data and<BR>

<P>              preparing it for analysis.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Obviously top management will be on the receiving end of the<BR>

<P>          survey results, as will many other levels in your agency.  For<BR>

<P>          the last step. . .<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Step 12, summarizing and delivering results<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          to work well, top management needs to spell out beforehand how<BR>

<P>          it wants to see the results and, then, to refine its requests <BR>

<P>          based on what is discovered.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          One of the key actions after a survey is completed is to<BR>

<P>          document lessons learned and recommendations for future sutdies.  <BR>

<P>          No one survey of customers will suffice; an on-going measurement<BR>

<P>          program is needed so changes in customer perceptions can be<BR>

<P>          tracked over time.  However, improvements in the way<BR>

<P>          measurements are made should be emphasized early in an on-going <BR>

<P>          effort ,even if partially at the sacrifice of consistent trend <BR>

<P>          data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          3.3  Presentation of Steps<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Each of the twelve steps covered here is discussed in a more or<BR>

<P>          less consistent fashion:  definitions of the activities are<BR>

<P>          given, suggestions on who should carry out the step are made,<BR>

<P>          considerations to think about and some cautions are provided,<BR>

<P>          and summarizations are included in separate boxes of the skills<BR>

<P>          needed for each step and the outcomes anticipated.  To make the<BR>

<P>          ideas concrete, examples are interspersed throughout.<BR>

<P>               __________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 1. Determining Scope<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          As in all large-scale activities, an extensive planning effort<BR>

<P>          is needed to mount a customer satisfaction survey.  The first<BR>

<P>          planning task is to answer the questions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - What are your agency's products/services?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Who are the customers of your agency?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          These sound so basic, but prior experience teaches that coming<BR>

<P>          to an agency consensus on the answers may be difficult.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Top and middle management should participate, along with your<BR>

<P>          agency's front-line staff, in answering these questions.  Input<BR>

<P>          from all levels of the organization is necessary, since the<BR>

<P>          products and customers look different depending on one's<BR>

<P>          position in the organization.  The Executive Order addresses <BR>

<P>          programs that serve the public directly, but you may also identify <BR>

<P>          other agencies, private organizations or your own agency staff as<BR>

<P>          customers.  It may be useful to distinguish between internal and<BR>

<P>          external customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Another major aspect in determining overall scope is deciidng --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - What should the specific survey goals be?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Part of the answer here is to look at how the survey information<BR>

<P>          will eventually be used to develop service standards.  Usually<BR>

<P>          it will be necessary to make hard choices about which key issues to<BR>

<P>          measure.  You should be preparde to rethink these choices once<BR>

<P>          initial survey results become available.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 2. Defining Customer Saitsfaction<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Customer satisfaction is a many faceted concept; it is clearly<BR>

<P>          not just the answer to the single question, &quot;How satisfied are<BR>

<P>          you?&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - How then should customer satisfaction be defined?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The agency should listen to customers and front-line employees<BR>

<P>          to obtain their defintiions of the agency's services and the<BR>

<P>          attributes that determine satisfaction/dissatisfaction.  The<BR>

<P>          agency also needs to know the criteria used b ythe customers to<BR>

<P>          evaluate the various products and services.  It is miportant to<BR>

<P>          talk to as diverse a group of customers as possible, so that no<BR>

<P>          major perspective or point of view is omitted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The ingredients of satisfaction for agency customers must be<BR>

<P>          identified. Overall satisfaction is affected by customer<BR>

<P>          expectations, their ideal or required performance, and actual<BR>

<P>          performance of the agency.  The agency must identify activities<BR>

<P>          that might affect the satisfaction of its customers and what<BR>

<P>          aspects of the service are important.  For some agencies this<BR>

<P>          may require separate measurements of satisfaction for<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - the agency's products (e.g., nature and size of benefit),<BR>

<P>              and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - the service concerning those products (e.g., helpfulness of<BR>

<P>              staff).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Important activities must be measured along with satisfaction,<BR>

<P>          so that the relationship between agency actions and customer<BR>

<P>          satisfaction can be observed.  For example, in an agency<BR>

<P>          processing benefits, the timeliness of the process (regardless<BR>

<P>          of outcome) may be a major determinant of satisfaction.  Ideally,<BR>

<P>          the agency should be able to show, quantitatively through the<BR>

<P>          survey results, the degree to which changes in agency actions<BR>

<P>          affect customer satisfaction.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 3. Identifiyng Target Customers<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          This step is where decisions on the scope of the survey program<BR>

<P>          are translated into the activities needed to identify the<BR>

<P>          customer populations targeted for study.  Federal agencies serve<BR>

<P>          distinct and diverse groups of customers. For example, some<BR>

<P>          serve individuals and families; others serve organizations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Who are the specific groups of customers you want to survey?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The customer types and the products/services have already been<BR>

<P>          identified in Step 1, and the criteria for measuring customer<BR>

<P>          satisfaciton have been agreed upon in Step 2.  Now, that work<BR>

<P>          done in Step 1 has to be translated t othe context in which the<BR>

<P>          survey is conducted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Key segments of the customer base and other characteristics of<BR>

<P>          the customers should be identified for measurement in the<BR>

<P>          survey.  For example, the agency may already have records of <BR>

<P>          contacts with some customers but may have to develop new <BR>

<P>          recordkeeping systems to survey other customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Ideally, the agency will choose for initial studies those<BR>

<P>          combinations of products and services, on one hand, and<BR>

<P>          customers, on the other, that will contribute most to the<BR>

<P>          overall performance of the agency.  It may be prudent, though, <BR>

<P>          to begin the customer survey program with studies of those on <BR>

<P>          whom records already exist, while other information soruces are <BR>

<P>          being developed.<BR>

<P>          ____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 4. Developing the Sampling Frame<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Having decided upon your target customer population, you can now<BR>

<P>          identify some means to select a sample of them.  To do so, you<BR>

<P>          should develop a &quot;sampling frame.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>             - What is a sampling frame?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          It is a list o fcustomers with addresses, telephone numbers, or<BR>

<P>          some other information indicating how customers can be<BR>

<P>          contacted.  This information can be distilled from various sources.  <BR>

<P>          For instance, reviewing administrative records; collecting names,<BR>

<P>          addresses, etc., at point of contact; or locating indirect<BR>

<P>          customers by contacting direct customers.  Bear in mind that<BR>

<P>          frames vary in quality -- completeness, rececny, inclusion of<BR>

<P>          information for contacting the customers, etc.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Certain subclasses of customers that may be of special interest<BR>

<P>          in a satisfaction survey may be difficult to enumerate.  For<BR>

<P>          example, it ca nbe challenging to contact discouraged or<BR>

<P>          infrequent customers, or the customers of agencies that have no<BR>

<P>          formal documentation of services provided.  The ability to make<BR>

<P>          general statements about your agency's customers based on the<BR>

<P>          survey results is linked to how complete and accurate your frame<BR>

<P>          is.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          A frame can include information on the transaction per se or on<BR>

<P>          the customer per se. This (whether the frame includes transaction<BR>

<P>          data or customer data) will have statistical repercussions that<BR>

<P>          must be taken into consideration.  For instance, if you are using<BR>

<P>          a frame that contains contact/episode/transaction data, single<BR>

<P>          customers can appear in the frame many times, leading to problems<BR>

<P>          of multiple records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          In many cases, the information required to construct a frame is<BR>

<P>          inaccessible or difficult to obtain because it is considered<BR>

<P>          confidential.  In other cases, once the frame is constructed, the<BR>

<P>          mix of information can be such that the frame itself becomes<BR>

<P>          confidential.  It is important to separate administrative uses of<BR>

<P>          the frame from survey uses of the frame.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 5. Choosing the Data Collection Method<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>          There are a number of different approaches to conducting a survey<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          -- self-administered mail questionnaires, telephone surveys and<BR>

<P>          face-to-face surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Which data collection method is best suited for your customer<BR>

<P>              survey?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          The type of frame developed for the survey will determine, or<BR>

<P>          limit, the choice of data collection methods.  For instance, some<BR>

<P>          frames have only customer addresses, making mailed questionnaires<BR>

<P>          the most feasible choice.  Other frames come from individual<BR>

<P>          telephone or face-to-face contact of customers with the agency.<BR>

<P>          In any case, the nature of the service may affect the type of<BR>

<P>          data collection methodology that can be used.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Each type of data collection method comes with its associated<BR>

<P>          costs. Self-administered mail surveys are the least costly, with<BR>

<P>          telephone surveys running second, and face-to-face interview<BR>

<P>          surveys being the most expensive. Data collection methods also<BR>

<P>          vary in the amount of time they take to conduct.  Telephone<BR>

<P>          surveys are the fastest, face-to-face surveys run escond, and<BR>

<P>          mail questionnaires are the slowest (because of the time required<BR>

<P>          to return questionnaires and complete follow-up activities, using<BR>

<P>          the mail).  In addition to cost and time, data collection methods<BR>

<P>          vary along other aspects that can ultimately affect the quality<BR>

<P>          of survey results -- response rates, quality of answers provided,<BR>

<P>          and credibility of confidentiality pledges.  Overall survey<BR>

<P>          quality is a complex mix of these and other features connected to<BR>

<P>          the data collection method.<BR>

<P>          ____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Step 6. Choosing the Survey Team<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Next you need to decide what group should be charged with<BR>

<P>          collecting the customer survey data.  In particular --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>            - Having decided on the basic data colleciton method, how do<BR>

<P>              you implement it?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          Data collection can be undertaken by agency staff who have direct<BR>

<P>          contact with the customer, yb agency staff removed from customer<BR>

<P>          contact, by another government agency, or by an independent<BR>

<P>          contractor.  Whatever choice your agency makes, the manner of<BR>

<P>          contacting the customer and the interviewer asking questions must<BR>

<P>          strive to elicit responses in an objective manner, giving the<BR>

<P>          sampled customers freedom to express satisfaction or<BR>

<P>          dissatisfaction.  For some contexts this objectivity will be<BR>

<P>          difficult to obtain if the staff who provide the service are<BR>

<P>          also used to collect the survey data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          When interviewers are used, they should receive training in those<BR>

<P>          aspects of the agency's services that should be known in order to<BR>

<P>          record customer feedback accurately.  This step may be needed<BR>

<P>          even if in-house staff is used in the interviewing, to assure<BR>

<P>          uniform interviewing behavior.  Regardless of who does the<BR>

<P>          interviewing, they should be trained in traditional survey<BR>

<P>          interviewing techniques.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          In addition, whoever does the data collection should have a good<BR>

<P>          track record for designing and conducting attitudinal surveys<BR>

<P>          with high cooperation rates.  Remember that prices of data<BR>

<P>          collection of equal quality can vary across units, and the agency<BR>

<P>          needs to be alert to judging the best value among alternative<BR>

<P>          sources.  Also, as the survey process can take several months to<BR>

<P>          more than a year, continuity in data collection should be<BR>

<P>          considered.<BR>

Title: Resource Manual for Customer Surveys Part 3  <BR>

<P>Author: OMB<BR>

<P>Date: Oct 1993<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This is part 3 of 7 sections of the new OMB Customer Survey Manual.<BR>

<P>Text follows:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Step 7. Developing and Pretesting the Questionnaire<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Perhaps one of the most critical components for obtaining useful<BR>

<P>feedback on customer satisfaction from surveys is the<BR>

<P>questionnaire or survey instrument.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How do you ask questions in the survey that best illuminate<BR>

<P>levels of customer satisfaction?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The key is careful development and pretesting of questions so<BR>

<P>that you can be reasonably sure that the survey answers reflect<BR>

<P>the customers' true opinions.  For instance, when answering<BR>

<P>satisfaction questions, respondents have a tendency to answer in<BR>

<P>a positive way.  The questionnaire should, therefore, deal with<BR>

<P>both attitudes and experiences, and include multiple questions<BR>

<P>for key dimensions of service quality (e.g., courtesy,<BR>

<P>competence, reliability, communication), each with a slightly<BR>

<P>different focus.  Asking about an important service attribute in<BR>

<P>several ways provides more complete and reliable measurement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Because respondents may be affected by the wording and ordering<BR>

<P>of questions, tracking satisfaction over time requires that the<BR>

<P>questionnaire remain as constant as possible for key indicators.<BR>

<P>However, most organizations find that initial satisfaction<BR>

<P>measurement techniques can be improved.  Thus, there is a tension<BR>

<P>between desire to measure change and the desire to improve the<BR>

<P>quality of the survey.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The following methods are often used to pretest a questionnaire:<BR>

<P>unstructured one-on-one interviews; investigations of<BR>

<P>respondents' comprehension of terms in proposed questions; focus<BR>

<P>group discussions of questions; use of cognitive laboratories.<BR>

<P>After a questionnaire is developed, it should be pretested under<BR>

<P>real conditions.  This kind of field testing is to a survey what<BR>

<P>a dress rehearsal is to a play.  The questionnaire is tested<BR>

<P>using a small scale version of the entire survey, with all design<BR>

<P>features in place.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There are many options for the design of a sample for a customer<BR>

<P>survey.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How do you design the sample for the customer survey?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It is the strongly held view of most experts that results of<BR>

<P>customer surveys cannot be interpreted with confidence unless<BR>

<P>probability sampling is used.  In general, the larger the sample<BR>

<P>size the more precise are the survey results, but other aspects<BR>

<P>of the sample design also affect survey quality.   For instance,<BR>

<P>stratification of customers into subgroups or classes is a<BR>

<P>commonly used technique to ensure that the customers in the frame<BR>

<P>represent the agency's actual pool of customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Oversampling of a geographic area or population subgroup may be<BR>

<P>desirable to permit the presentation of regional statistics, or<BR>

<P>characteristics by different age or ethnic groups.  If your<BR>

<P>agency has area or regional offices, separate samples of the<BR>

<P>areas served by different offices may be useful.  Each of these<BR>

<P>sample design features affects the statistical properties of the<BR>

<P>survey results.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The ideal respondent is usually the person who most directly<BR>

<P>receives the service.  In some cases the respondent may be the<BR>

<P>person who contacted the agency on behalf of someone else, e.g.,<BR>

<P>a wife calling about her husband's claim.  If an organization,<BR>

<P>rather than an individual, is the customer, the choice of<BR>

<P>respondent becomes more complex, and there may be multiple<BR>

<P>customers of interest in each organization.  In these situations,<BR>

<P>identifying and sampling several different staff members in each<BR>

<P>client organization may be desirable.<BR>

<P>
<P>Step 9. Achieving High Response Rates<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Regardless of how well the survey is designed, there will be some<BR>

<P>customers selected for the survey who will not respond.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  What can you do to achieve adequate response rates?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Low response rates can lead to misleading survey results, since<BR>

<P>the people who did not respond may be unlike the survey<BR>

<P>participants. The following methods usually prove useful in<BR>

<P>ensuring high rates of response.  Each of them also may have<BR>

<P>implications for the cost efficiency of the survey.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  Advance notification:  The respondent is contacted ahead of<BR>

<P>time and informed about the survey, including its goals and<BR>

<P>its provision of confidentiality, and is encouraged to<BR>

<P>participate.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  Ease of answering questions:  Customers will more likely<BR>

<P>answer questions that are easy to comprehend and to answer.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  &quot;Friendly&quot; questionnaires:  For mail questionnaires use a<BR>

<P>personalized graphical design that is simple, attractive and<BR>

<P>easy to read -- booklet style may make it look smaller and<BR>

<P>easier to complete.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  Repeated follow-up:  Those not immediately responding are<BR>

<P>sent postcard reminders and additional questionnaires in<BR>

<P>mail surveys. Repeated calls are used for noncontacts in<BR>

<P>telephone and face-to-face surveys.<BR>

<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Step 10. Ensuring Quality During Data Collection<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Now you are ready to conduct the survey.  However, one of the<BR>

<P>biggest management tasks remains...<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  What can you do to ensure quality while the data are being<BR>

<P>collected?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There are a number of indicators of survey quality that should be<BR>

<P>sought throughout the entire survey process.  The specific<BR>

<P>indicators that are available will depend on how the survey is<BR>

<P>conducted. Special attention should be paid to:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- the percentage of sampled customers contacted<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- interviewer response rate performance<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- extent of questions read as worded<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- extent of use of non-directive probing<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- questionnaire completion rates as the survey progresses<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- response rates of individual survey items<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- daily records on problems arising in the data collection and<BR>

<P>calls coming into the agency regarding the survey.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>If interviewers are used, they must receive high quality training<BR>

<P>and continuing supervision, including checks of a sample of their<BR>

<P>work.  The questionnaire should be administered with no variation<BR>

<P>from instructions. Any variation at this stage could give rise to<BR>

<P>biased answers from sample customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>You Should Have:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    experience in survey data collection management<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    knowledge of techniques for intervening in ongoing<BR>

<P>data collection to resolve problems and improve<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>You Should Produce:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    report on technical quality of data collection<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    documentation on limitations of data that may<BR>

<P>affect conclusions<BR>

<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Step 11. Processing the Survey Data<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Once the survey is conducted, the survey answers need to be<BR>

<P>placed in a form useful for analysis.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How do you convert the data to a useful form?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Transforming survey answers into data usually entails coding<BR>

<P>(i.e., grouping into categories answers given in the respondents'<BR>

<P>own words) and data processing steps (e.g., key entry of numeric<BR>

<P>data into computer files). To be processed and analyzed, the data<BR>

<P>must be put into computer readable form.  The data set is<BR>

<P>formatted to be compatible with a statistical software package.<BR>

<P>It is important to include in the data set information on the<BR>

<P>probabilities of selection and other design features<BR>

<P>corresponding to each interview record.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The questionnaires will seldom be &quot;perfect,&quot; in that rarely are<BR>

<P>all questions answered in their entirety. Some responses will be<BR>

<P>missing, and the survey results can be affected if those missing<BR>

<P>answers are for distinctive types of customers.  In attitudinal<BR>

<P>surveys, the answer &quot;don't know&quot; can be informative and should be<BR>

<P>maintained as a response in its own right.<BR>

<P>
<P>*    knowledge of data entry designs<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    knowledge of computer file design for statistical<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>You Should Produce:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    computer data set ready for analysis in<BR>

<P>statistical software<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*    documentation of editing and coding procedures<BR>

<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Step 12. Summarizing and Delivering Survey Results<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Once a survey data set is ready, the data must be analyzed to<BR>

<P>learn what they can tell you about customer satisfaction.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- What analytic techniques should be undertaken?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How can survey information be effectively communicated to<BR>

<P>management?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The statistical analytic techniques useful at this stage depend<BR>

<P>on the nature of the data collected.  Customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>statistics sometimes are simple percentages of respondents who<BR>

<P>chose a particular response category. At other times complex<BR>

<P>statistical models are used to summarize the answers to many<BR>

<P>questions simultaneously.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In all cases the presentation of survey statistics should be<BR>

<P>accompanied by available measures of their quality, such as<BR>

<P>standard errors, confidence intervals, levels of missing data,<BR>

<P>response rates, and statistical comparisons of multiple<BR>

<P>indicators of the same concept.  Graphical presentations of<BR>

<P>results often communicate more clearly than numbers and text.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The survey results should be disseminated to all levels of staff<BR>

<P>that were involved at the initial stages described in Step 1,<BR>

<P>with the form of presentation tailored to the audience.  Reports<BR>

<P>should be designed for the concerns of the given level.<BR>

<P>Presentations should strive for clarity and brevity.  Remember<BR>

<P>that certain key facts, such as question wordings and the<BR>

<P>population on which the statistics are based, should be included<BR>

<P>in all reports. Information that is operationally useful<BR>

<P>(actionable) should be part of the presentations.  Most<BR>

<P>importantly, the survey reports should be timely, for the value<BR>

<P>of the data diminishes as time passes.<BR>

Title: Resource Manual for Customer Surveys Part 4 <BR>

<P>Author: OMB<BR>

<P>Date: October 1993<BR>

<P>Status: RO<BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  SOME FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Most of the 12 steps that are described in Section 3 are relevant<BR>

<P>to all surveys, and if you have conducted surveys on other<BR>

<P>topics, they are familiar to you.  In conducting customer<BR>

<P>surveys, however, you may encounter some issues that you have not<BR>

<P>faced before, even if you have conducted many surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This section contains short descriptions of these problems, in an<BR>

<P>attempt to forewarn you of potential difficulties as you progress<BR>

<P>through the survey process. Because of the need to prepare this<BR>

<P>manual quickly, there has been time to discuss only a few of<BR>

<P>these even briefly (see Appendix).  Future updates of the manual<BR>

<P>will have additional appendices discussing these and other issues<BR>

<P>in greater depth.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Repeated Surveys of Similar Design Facilitate Measures of Change<BR>

<P>in Levels of Satisfaction<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The real leap in information about your agency's relationships<BR>

<P>with its customers comes by seeing how customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>changes over time in response to management decisions.<BR>

<P>Measurement of change in levels over time involves sample designs<BR>

<P>that are compatible at both times, a questionnaire that has<BR>

<P>measures that are comparable, levels of participation in the<BR>

<P>survey that are similar, and statistical analyses that directly<BR>

<P>measure change in the same statistics.  All of these issues, on<BR>

<P>first experience, contain knotty problems. Many of the problems<BR>

<P>involve finding techniques that allow you to improve the quality<BR>

<P>of the second survey by learning from your mistakes in the first,<BR>

<P>while retaining design features that make the two surveys<BR>

<P>comparable. Researchers who are experienced in using surveys to<BR>

<P>measure change can help you with these issues.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Building Customer Lists is Difficult for Some Agencies<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies that don't have direct contact with their customers may<BR>

<P>have difficulty even identifying their customers.  They may find<BR>

<P>that because there are intermediaries between the agency and the<BR>

<P>ultimate customers, the agency has no natural way of contacting<BR>

<P>them.  This is both a conceptual problem and a logistical<BR>

<P>problem.  You have to decide how important to the agency are the<BR>

<P>customers who are difficult to enumerate.  If you include them in<BR>

<P>the target population, you may have to develop ways to measure<BR>

<P>their satisfaction that are unusual.  Here survey methodologists<BR>

<P>with long experience in doing surveys on populations without<BR>

<P>conveniently available sampling frames can be helpful.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Using Multiple Questions to Measure Satisfaction is Important<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Because satisfaction held by a customer cannot be observed<BR>

<P>objectively but is an internalized state containing several<BR>

<P>components, most private sector customer surveys ask the customer<BR>

<P>many different questions, all of which are viewed as slightly<BR>

<P>different indicators of the same overall concept of satisfaction.<BR>

<P>This &quot;multiple indicator&quot; approach has been found to improve the<BR>

<P>reliability of satisfaction levels measured by surveys.  Indeed,<BR>

<P>most models of measurement suggest that the more questions used<BR>

<P>to measure satisfaction, the more stable or reliable the results<BR>

<P>will be.  Two problems arise from a multiple indicator approach:<BR>

<P>first, how many different questions should be used to measure<BR>

<P>satisfaction (with each added question, the length of the<BR>

<P>questionnaire increases) and how do you combine statistically the<BR>

<P>various questions into a useful measure of satisfaction?<BR>

<P>Statisticians, especially those experienced in attitudinal<BR>

<P>surveys, scale construction, and multivariate modeling with<BR>

<P>multiple indicators, can be helpful in guiding decisions on these<BR>

<P>points.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Respondents Tend to Answer Positively to<BR>

<P>Customer Satisfaction Questions<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Private sector customer surveys often find that customers tend to<BR>

<P>overstate their levels of satisfaction.  This produces skewed<BR>

<P>distributions for satisfaction measures, with the vast majority<BR>

<P>of respondents giving positive ratings.  Analysis on skewed<BR>

<P>variables cannot use traditional normal distribution theories for<BR>

<P>statistical inference to the full customer population.  You need<BR>

<P>to use techniques that are sensitive to these distributional<BR>

<P>issues.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The tendency to overreport satisfaction also produces a problem<BR>

<P>for the measurement of change in satisfaction levels over time.<BR>

<P>Because of the tendency to overestimate positive sentiments, it<BR>

<P>becomes increasingly difficult for levels of customer<BR>

<P>satisfaction to show large increases over time.  A law of<BR>

<P>diminishing returns affects estimates of change.  Private sector<BR>

<P>researchers have found that this issue is ameliorated somewhat by<BR>

<P>use of many different questions on satisfaction that vary in<BR>

<P>their tendency to achieve very high ratings (the multiple<BR>

<P>indicator approach mentioned above).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A related phenomenon to the tendency to answer positively is the<BR>

<P>problem of a &quot;halo&quot; effect, whereby customers answer each<BR>

<P>individual question by giving their overall impression of the<BR>

<P>agency rather than assessing the particular attribute of the<BR>

<P>product or service measured by a question.  This produces<BR>

<P>inflated correlations among different satisfaction items, that<BR>

<P>decreases the value of any one measure.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There are Many Choices for Response Scales in Satisfaction<BR>

<P>Questions<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Some customer surveys ask the respondents to report their<BR>

<P>satisfaction on a 5 point scale with each point labelled (e.g.,<BR>

<P>&quot;Not at all satisfied&quot; to &quot;Very satisfied&quot;). Others ask the<BR>

<P>respondent to use a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning<BR>

<P>&quot;Completely dissatisfied&quot; and 10 &quot;Completely satisfied.&quot;  Others<BR>

<P>use 7 point scales, or 100 point scales.  The two decisions, on<BR>

<P>the number of scale points to use and how to label the points,<BR>

<P>affect the answers the respondents give and the subsequent<BR>

<P>overall measures of satisfaction.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There is a large literature on how to construct attitude scales<BR>

<P>that can alert you to how to avoid unintended biasing of<BR>

<P>responses (see Bibliography).  No matter what response scale is<BR>

<P>chosen, however, you cannot safely use the answers from a single<BR>

<P>question on, say, a 7 point scale, as if it were a simple count<BR>

<P>of some uniform &quot;satisfaction unit.&quot;  The mean rating on a single<BR>

<P>7 point scale, for example, is likely to have very low<BR>

<P>reliability (another reason to use the techniques of scale<BR>

<P>construction and multiple indicator analysis mentioned above).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>High Response Rates for Customer Surveys Improve the<BR>

<P>Credibility and Usefulness of Results<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>When customers sampled in a satisfaction survey do not<BR>

<P>participate in the survey, the survey results are threatened.<BR>

<P>This is particularly troublesome when nonresponse is higher among<BR>

<P>certain types of customers (e.g., if those who are mildly<BR>

<P>positive to the agency choose not to respond but those who are<BR>

<P>very dissatisfied or very satisfied do respond).  The results of<BR>

<P>the survey may give a very distorted picture of agency<BR>

<P>performance among its current customers.  No survey achieves a<BR>

<P>100% participation rate, but efforts to assure that customers in<BR>

<P>different important groups (e.g., by frequency of contact with<BR>

<P>the agency, by demographic characteristics, by type of<BR>

<P>product/service used) participate at the same rate are important.<BR>

<P>In doing this, use non-threatening follow-up and<BR>

<P>&quot;respondent-friendly&quot; solicitation of participation (both for<BR>

<P>ongoing relationships with valued customers and to avoid<BR>

<P>distortion of answers to the satisfaction questions).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>New Developments in Customer Surveys Are Occurring Rapidly<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Methods to craft satisfaction measurements, conduct the surveys,<BR>

<P>and analyze the results are undergoing rapid developments, as the<BR>

<P>private and academic sectors learn how to improve techniques.<BR>

<P>Continuous improvements in your agency's customer surveys will<BR>

<P>require your staff to keep up with these developments.  Updates<BR>

<P>of this manual will highlight those developments and training<BR>

<P>opportunities on survey techniques can instruct your staff in how<BR>

<P>to implement new methodologies.<BR>

<P>
<P>5.   EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE<BR>

<P>REVIEW OF SURVEY PLANS<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.1  Public and Private Sector Surveys<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The primary differences between government surveys and private<BR>

<P>sector surveys are the standards and the oversight process<BR>

<P>imposed by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).  In the private<BR>

<P>sector, decisions concerning surveys are made by individual<BR>

<P>entrepreneurs and any specific discipline imposed on the decision<BR>

<P>process varies considerably within the overall discipline imposed<BR>

<P>by the marketplace (&quot;what the market will bear&quot;).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The discipline imposed by the PRA tends to limit the number<BR>

<P>and/or size of surveys and to set certain thresholds on the<BR>

<P>quality of survey design and implementation (depending on their<BR>

<P>use).  This discipline is enforced by agency and OMB review prior<BR>

<P>to data collection, and by close scrutiny of many results after<BR>

<P>the fact by the General Accounting Office, the Congress, and the<BR>

<P>general public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This discipline has produced some important advantages --<BR>

<P>significantly higher response rates often are achieved in<BR>

<P>government surveys -- but the oversight requirements have, on<BR>

<P>occasion, tested the ability of the Federal government to make<BR>

<P>surveys a responsive tool for public policy.  Without some<BR>

<P>attention to assuring an efficient review process, PRA review<BR>

<P>could become a significant barrier to the rapid development of<BR>

<P>customer surveys. This section spells out several proven methods<BR>

<P>to make the process more efficient and describes a new option<BR>

<P>developed to support surveys called for by E.O. 12862.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.2  Delegation<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Congress provided one mechanism in the PRA to streamline the<BR>

<P>review process -- the assumption of more substantial review<BR>

<P>responsibilities by individual agencies through the delegation<BR>

<P>authorized in the Act.  This mechanism has not been attractive to<BR>

<P>most agencies for several reasons:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  The duplication and coordination objectives of the PRA are<BR>

<P>difficult to achieve outside the centralized environment of<BR>

<P>OMB.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  Agencies have found it difficult to justify the commitment of<BR>

<P>scarce resources for an independent and sometimes highly<BR>

<P>technical in-house review.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-  Congress designed the PRA delegation process with several<BR>

<P>difficult hurdles (specific determinations and a Notice and<BR>

<P>Comment rulemaking procedure) to protect the public's<BR>

<P>interests in minimizing burden.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>5.3  Less Difficult Alternatives<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In cooperation with Federal agencies, OMB has devised other<BR>

<P>methods to streamline the review process.  The most successful of<BR>

<P>these devices have been &quot;bundled,&quot; &quot;contingency,&quot; and &quot;generic&quot;<BR>

<P>clearances.  Each of these approaches has been in use for more<BR>

<P>than a decade, but they have been continuously refined under the<BR>

<P>PRA.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- The bundled clearance involves combining many similar data<BR>

<P>collections into a single clearance package. Such bundled<BR>

<P>packages have been negotiated with agencies in cases where<BR>

<P>combined review reduced demands on both OMB and agency<BR>

<P>resources (where similar data collections present common<BR>

<P>clearance issues).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- A contingency clearance is an approved plan for a data<BR>

<P>collection that is justified by specific events -- the plan<BR>

<P>is approved in advance of the events and can be implemented<BR>

<P>immediately if those events take place, e.g., a survey to<BR>

<P>track consequences of a strike. Advance review and approval<BR>

<P>permits agencies to respond quickly to the need for data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Generic clearance also involves advance approval, but of a<BR>

<P>well-defined class of low-burden data collections that are<BR>

<P>not fully documented until they are actually used.  A<BR>

<P>generic clearance typically includes a set of agreements<BR>

<P>negotiated between the sponsoring agency and OMB, covering<BR>

<P>limitations on methods and usage, a burden cap, a periodic<BR>

<P>reporting requirement to update the OMB Docket, and a<BR>

<P>commitment by OMB to review any specific application<BR>

<P>quickly.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Many excellent customer surveys have been reviewed and approved<BR>

<P>through the existing clearance process (some examples are<BR>

<P>mentioned in the NPR report).  However, OMB expects a substantial<BR>

<P>increase in the number of customer surveys sponsored by Federal<BR>

<P>agencies within the next few years, as a result of Executive<BR>

<P>Order 12862.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In order to make customer surveys more responsive tools for<BR>

<P>agency management, OMB has proposed several types of generic<BR>

<P>clearance to expedite the data collection tasks involved in a<BR>

<P>program of customer surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Each agency subject to the PRA has a senior agency official and<BR>

<P>associated staff responsible for functions specified in the PRA,<BR>

<P>including internal review of clearance requests and coordination<BR>

<P>with OMB.  These resources are available to assist you in<BR>

<P>preparing proposals for generic clearance and any other aspects<BR>

<P>of PRA review.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The remainder of this section describes generic clearance models<BR>

<P>that may be useful for particular types of studies needed at<BR>

<P>various stages of the customer satisfaction measurement process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.4  Generic Clearance for Qualitative Studies<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This model has been used by the Census Bureau for questionnaire<BR>

<P>development and testing, by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for<BR>

<P>cognitive laboratory experiments, and by the Internal Revenue<BR>

<P>Service for a program of focus groups.  The terms of the<BR>

<P>agreements worked out with these agencies have proven workable<BR>

<P>for both the agencies and OMB.  The terms include --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- A burden cap.  The agency proposes a total annual burden<BR>

<P>that will be imposed by studies conducted under the generic<BR>

<P>clearance. Individual applications are tracked against the<BR>

<P>burden cap.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Specified methods.  The agency proposes the type(s) of data<BR>

<P>collection(s) to be performed and the method(s) to be used,<BR>

<P>with particular attention to those features and commitments<BR>

<P>that assure consistency with the guidelines of the Paperwork<BR>

<P>Rule (5 CFR 1320).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- A periodic reporting requirement.  This allows tracking of<BR>

<P>performance relative to the burden cap and updates the<BR>

<P>public docket by demonstrating actual results achieved.  The<BR>

<P>frequency of such reports is negotiable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Quick-turnaround OMB review of specific applications.  The<BR>

<P>agency submits information on each specific application to<BR>

<P>update the public docket prior to each actual data<BR>

<P>collection. OMB agrees to a quick- turnaround review of each<BR>

<P>submission (this varies from same day in the simplest cases<BR>

<P>to two weeks in more complex cases.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.5  Generic Clearance for Quantitative Surveys<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Quantitative surveys usually must meet more stringent standards<BR>

<P>than qualitative studies and are more likely to be tailored to a<BR>

<P>specific task.  For these reasons, the models for generic<BR>

<P>clearance are fewer and vary from agency to agency.  Two examples<BR>

<P>that have been operating for several years were developed with<BR>

<P>the National Park Service and the Internal Revenue Service.  Both<BR>

<P>examples include a burden cap as described above, but they differ<BR>

<P>in most other details.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The National Park Service model is built around a catalog of<BR>

<P>tested questions covering a broad spectrum of issues involved in<BR>

<P>operating a national park.  The clearance also includes several<BR>

<P>approved methods (sample designs) for administering the questions<BR>

<P>to respondents.  The components of this scheme were developed<BR>

<P>with considerable effort and extensive consultation with OMB to<BR>

<P>provide flexibility to the local managers of national parks.<BR>

<P>Using this tool, managers can quickly assemble surveys in &quot;kit&quot;<BR>

<P>form to address current problems and charge the reporting burden<BR>

<P>against the burden cap of the generic clearance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The IRS model supports the agency's program of customer<BR>

<P>satisfaction measurement.  It stipulates specific methods,<BR>

<P>including professional design, adequate follow-up, and a<BR>

<P>commitment to high response, that assure high quality statistics.<BR>

<P>The model covers opinion questions only and includes steps to<BR>

<P>ensure that response is perceived as purely voluntary.  The other<BR>

<P>features are identical to the qualitative clearance model<BR>

<P>described above. (In fact, both qualitative and quantitative data<BR>

<P>collections are managed in a single generic clearance.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.6 Simplified Generic Clearance for Voluntary Customer Surveys<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In response to the recommendations of the National Performance<BR>

<P>Review, OMB has developed a new simplified generic clearance<BR>

<P>model specifically for voluntary customer surveys.  This<BR>

<P>simplified approach is possible because the conditions proposed<BR>

<P>by NPR eliminate many of the issues that might otherwise require<BR>

<P>a more extensive review.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This form of generic clearance is available only for strictly<BR>

<P>voluntary collections of opinion information from clients who<BR>

<P>have experience with the program that is the subject of each data<BR>

<P>collection.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This option may not be used, for example --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- by regulatory agencies to survey regulated entities;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- in any situation where the respondent may perceive risks to<BR>

<P>his interests, either through potential penalties or loss of<BR>

<P>benefits;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- for collecting factual information (other than simple<BR>

<P>identifying information, where needed); or<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- for collecting data from the general public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Surveys of former customers or discouraged customers may well be<BR>

<P>useful for discovering sources of customer dissatisfaction, but<BR>

<P>such surveys may also involve some difficult statistical issues<BR>

<P>(e.g., the adequacy of coverage) that require more extensive<BR>

<P>review; hence, they are not included here.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agency proposals for this simplified generic clearance should<BR>

<P>include a description of the kinds of customer surveys the<BR>

<P>clearance will cover, as well as the agency program(s) they will<BR>

<P>address.  The clearance request should cite the authority of<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12862, and request a three year expiration date<BR>

<P>(since these data collection programs are expected to support a<BR>

<P>process of repeated measurement).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The request should propose a maximum number of burden hours (per<BR>

<P>year) against which burden will be charged for each survey<BR>

<P>actually used.  It should also include an arrangement to submit a<BR>

<P>brief summary of objectives, specific burden estimates, and all<BR>

<P>final or near final survey instruments (focus group scripts, test<BR>

<P>questions, etc.) covered by the generic clearance for inclusion<BR>

<P>in the OMB public docket prior to their use.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The proposal should specify an adequate internal review process<BR>

<P>to ensure that individual applications are consistent with the<BR>

<P>PRA, the Paperwork Rule, and the terms of the generic clearance.<BR>

<P>This requires qualified reviewers who are independent of the<BR>

<P>sponsoring programs. Review by a professional statistician may be<BR>

<P>needed in some cases (e.g., if the generic clearance will include<BR>

<P>quantitative surveys).  This review must also assure that<BR>

<P>material submitted for the public docket is accurate, timely, and<BR>

<P>complete.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Finally, the agency should propose an appropriate progress<BR>

<P>reporting schedule (e.g., at one year intervals) for summarizing<BR>

<P>actual burden, reporting results achieved, and addressing any<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.   DIRECTORY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM<BR>

<P>FEDERAL STATISTICAL AGENCIES<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Many of the decisions required to develop a customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>program draw heavily on knowledge of agency operations involved<BR>

<P>in providing services.  In many cases, however, technical survey<BR>

<P>expertise and statistical services may be more efficiently<BR>

<P>provided by sources outside the affected program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In support of the Executive Order, Federal statistical agencies<BR>

<P>will offer both advice and specific services to assist in the<BR>

<P>design and execution of customer satisfaction surveys.  The<BR>

<P>information in this section of the manual provides a reference<BR>

<P>for the kinds of expertise and services available and the names<BR>

<P>of appropriate contacts.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The weekly Group Consultation Sessions described in Section 7 of<BR>

<P>this manual will be attended by many of the experts listed here.<BR>

<P>These group sessions will be organized both to limit the demands<BR>

<P>on the time of these specialists and to provide users of this<BR>

<P>manual with &quot;one-stop&quot; opportunities to discuss particular<BR>

<P>problems with experts representing a wide range of statistical<BR>

<P>methodological experience.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Users are encouraged to take advantage of these group sessions by<BR>

<P>registering for them through the procedure described in Section 7.<BR>

<P>The names and phone numbers of selected contacts are provided<BR>

<P>here for follow-up and for future reference.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.1  Bureau of Labor Statistics<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Survey Methods Research<BR>

<P>(OSMR), has staff with expertise and experience in the following<BR>

<P>areas of survey design:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- The development of protocols for conducting focus<BR>

<P>groups,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Procedures for developing and testing questionnaires<BR>

<P>(both in the laboratory and in the field), and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Sample design.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since the primary function of OSMR staff members is related to<BR>

<P>research on methods for improving Bureau programs, their time<BR>

<P>available for consulting outside BLS is limited.  However, they<BR>

<P>are willing to provide advice to the extent they can fit requests<BR>

<P>around their primary work assignments.  For example, staff can<BR>

<P>provide advice on how to develop a focus group protocol or define<BR>

<P>a sampling design, but can only participate in the development of<BR>

<P>a protocol or sample design on a reimbursable basis.  Potential<BR>

<P>clients interested in such services should consider contracting<BR>

<P>with the Office of Survey Methods for research under an<BR>

<P>interagency agreement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Currently, OSMR has a contract with the Internal Revenue Service,<BR>

<P>which includes services related to some of their Customer<BR>

<P>Satisfaction Surveys.  OSMR also has a Behavioral Science<BR>

<P>Research Laboratory, which may be used by Federal agencies on a<BR>

<P>space-available basis. For information on these services, please<BR>

<P>contact --<BR>

<P>Clyde Tucker  (202) 606-7370.<BR>

<P>6.2  Bureau of Justice Statistics<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics will be available to consult and<BR>

<P>advise other agencies in the areas of questionnaire development<BR>

<P>and design; sample design, implementation, and follow-up methods;<BR>

<P>the procurement of high-quality statistical services; and the<BR>

<P>analysis of opinion questions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics does not have a unit dedicated<BR>

<P>to planning and implementing customer surveys.  However, staff<BR>

<P>can be made available to assist other agencies during the<BR>

<P>planning phase of customer survey development.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For further information or assistance, please contact<BR>

<P>Charles R. Kindermann  (202) 616-3489.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>6.3  Bureau of the Census<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Census Bureau collects, processes, analyzes and disseminates<BR>

<P>statistics on most aspects of the Nation's social and economic<BR>

<P>life.  It has committed resources and is using its survey<BR>

<P>expertise to achieve its own customer service objectives:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Meet or exceed customer expectations, and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Improve product lines to meet customer needs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It has undertaken the design and implementation of external<BR>

<P>customer surveys to find out what Census customers expect, how<BR>

<P>well products and services are delivered, and how to improve.<BR>

<P>This process has provided hands-on experience in most areas<BR>

<P>covered by this manual, including both management strategy and<BR>

<P>specific methods.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Census Bureau can provide a wide array of services to other<BR>

<P>Federal agencies interested in conducting customer or other type<BR>

<P>surveys, including statistical consulting, focus groups,<BR>

<P>cognitive research, questionnaire development and testing, and<BR>

<P>analysis assistance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These services are performed, via interagency agreement, on a<BR>

<P>reimbursable basis.  For further information, please contact<BR>

<P>Ken Riccini, (301)-763-5734.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>6.4  Energy Information Administration<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent<BR>

<P>entity within the Department of Energy, is the principal and<BR>

<P>authoritative source of comprehensive energy data for the<BR>

<P>Congress, the Federal Government, the States, and the public.  To<BR>

<P>fulfill its mandate EIA fields approximately 75 surveys<BR>

<P>collecting energy information, primarily from establishments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EIA has considerable experience in the areas of questionnaire<BR>

<P>design, sampling, development and implementation of survey<BR>

<P>procedures, questionnaire follow-up, and the evaluation of<BR>

<P>nonsampling errors.  Many of EIA's surveys use contractor support<BR>

<P>during the implementation phase, and the agency has considerable<BR>

<P>experience in contracting out for statistical services.  In the<BR>

<P>past several years, EIA has also begun to work with focus groups<BR>

<P>to determine user needs and design questionnaires.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For assistance or advice in the area of focus groups, please<BR>

<P>contact Lynda Carlson  (202) 586-1112, Charles Heath  (202) 586-<BR>

<P>6860, or Diane Lique  (202) 586-6090.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For assistance or advice in the other statistical areas, please<BR>

<P>contact Nancy Kirkendall  (202) 254-5363.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.5  Environmental Protection Agency<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Environmental Protection Agency has developed several<BR>

<P>customer surveys to assess the effectiveness of EPA programs and<BR>

<P>policies. The survey plans are developed by individual offices.<BR>

<P>They are reviewed in both the Regulatory Management Division for<BR>

<P>their programmatic content and the Environmental Statistics and<BR>

<P>Information Division for their adherence to accepted statistical<BR>

<P>practices.  ESID also has statistical contractors available for<BR>

<P>the Agency should extra measures of statistical design or<BR>

<P>analysis be appropriate, and has had experience in developing,<BR>

<P>reviewing, and contracting for such surveys.<BR>

<P>

<P>7.   TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO BE OFFERED BY<BR>

<P>THE JOINT PROGRAM IN SURVEY METHODOLOGY<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Joint University of Maryland - University of Michigan Program<BR>

<P>in Survey Methodology (JPSM) was founded in 1992 on the College<BR>

<P>Park campus of the University of Maryland, with funding from the<BR>

<P>National Science Foundation.  Its mission is to promote<BR>

<P>continuous improvement in government statistical activities by<BR>

<P>ongoing enhancement of staff skills.  Its major activities are to<BR>

<P>--<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Provide continuing professional training and graduate degree<BR>

<P>programs in survey statistics and survey methodology, and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Stimulate (and conduct) advanced research in survey<BR>

<P>methodology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The JPSM was founded to enhance the likelihood that government<BR>

<P>sponsored surveys would use state-of-the-art methods that are<BR>

<P>both cost efficient and of high quality.  At the present time the<BR>

<P>curriculum offers an MS Program in Survey Methodology and<BR>

<P>noncredit short courses useful to survey practitioners.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Joint Program plans three activities aimed at increasing<BR>

<P>expertise in customer surveys within Federal government agencies:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>____________________________________________________________<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Short courses presenting latest techniques on<BR>

<P>components of survey methodology<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- A lecture series with talks by prominent researchers<BR>

<P>and practitioners in customer surveys<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Group consultations for agency staff charged with the<BR>

<P>responsibility for customer surveys, conducted by<BR>

<P>experts in the Federal statistical agencies<BR>

<P>
<P>7.1  Short Courses in Survey Techniques<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These educational activities are not focused on customer surveys<BR>

<P>alone, but communicate the theory and applied skills necessary to<BR>

<P>mount surveys on all subject matters.  Relevant short courses,<BR>

<P>scheduled prior to the September 11, 1993, Executive Order, are --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Introduction to Questionnaire Design (Dr. Nora Cate Schaeffer,<BR>

<P>University of Wisconsin), November 17-18, 1993<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course gives practical guidance to those who have<BR>

<P>written questionnaires but who are not familiar with<BR>

<P>research on question design, who are beginning to<BR>

<P>design questionnaires, or who use survey data but do<BR>

<P>not themselves design questionnaires.  The course<BR>

<P>focuses on paper interview schedules, but some issues<BR>

<P>affecting self-administered and computer-assisted<BR>

<P>instruments are discussed at several points.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Cognitive and Communicative Aspects of Survey Measurement<BR>

<P>(Dr. Norbert Schwarz, University of Michigan),<BR>

<P>December 6-7, 1993<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course provides an introduction to selected<BR>

<P>theoretical principles of cognitive and social<BR>

<P>psychology and their implications for questionnaire<BR>

<P>construction.  This course is designed to alert<BR>

<P>participants to common problems in questionnaires and<BR>

<P>to apply cognitive principles in developing possible<BR>

<P>solutions.  No prior background in cognitive psychology<BR>

<P>is assumed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Self-Administered/Mail Surveys (Dr. Don A. Dillman, Washington<BR>

<P>State University), February 23-24, 1994<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course presents practical aspects of designing and<BR>

<P>implementing high quality self-administered/mail<BR>

<P>surveys.  The course provides the state-of-the-art<BR>

<P>perspective on obtaining high response rates with low<BR>

<P>measurement error from self-administered/mail surveys.<BR>

<P>It presents the latest findings on differences between<BR>

<P>telephone and self-administered survey responses.  It<BR>

<P>provides practical advice on designing questionnaires<BR>

<P>and implementation procedures.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>All three of these short courses will be held in a downtown<BR>

<P>Washington, D.C. hotel.  There are registration fees of $225 to<BR>

<P>$350 for each 2-day course.  For further information call 1-800-<BR>

<P>937-9320 and ask for registration forms for the short courses of<BR>

<P>particular interest to you.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There is also a credit bearing course in Applied Sampling from<BR>

<P>January 6 - April 19, to be held on the College Park campus.  For<BR>

<P>more information, call (301) 314-7911 or fax (301) 314-7912.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At the request of OMB for assistance in the area of customer<BR>

<P>surveys, additional short courses are being planned that will<BR>

<P>provide training in relevant survey methodology.  Among these are<BR>

<P>--<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An Introduction to Surveys (now being planned for December 1993)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course assumes no knowledge on the part of<BR>

<P>participants about surveys.  It reviews the key steps<BR>

<P>of survey design and implementation in a format not<BR>

<P>unlike the step-by-step approach contained in Section 3<BR>

<P>of this Resource Manual.  Development of sampling<BR>

<P>frames, sample design, questionnaire design, data<BR>

<P>collection methods, and analytic issues are reviewed in<BR>

<P>brief.  For each of the steps key questions that must<BR>

<P>be addressed are reviewed and key pitfalls that new<BR>

<P>survey teams face are described.  The course is<BR>

<P>designed both for those who are considering mounting<BR>

<P>their own surveys and those who will oversee the work<BR>

<P>of outside contractors.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Focus Groups as a Tool in Developing Survey Questionnaires<BR>

<P>(now being planned for January 1994)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course will introduce participants to the design<BR>

<P>and conduct of focus groups, the technique proposed for<BR>

<P>investigating customer perspectives on agency services<BR>

<P>and products.  The course will describe recruitment<BR>

<P>strategies for focus group participants, scripting the<BR>

<P>group discussion, the role of the moderator, methods of<BR>

<P>recording the group discussion, analysis of the<BR>

<P>discussion, summarization of the results, and<BR>

<P>presentation of focus group results.  It will<BR>

<P>concentrate on how focus groups can inform the process<BR>

<P>of developing a survey questionnaire to assure that the<BR>

<P>questions use language relevant to the population<BR>

<P>studied.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An Introduction to Survey Sampling<BR>

<P>(now being planned for January 1994)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course assumes no statistical training among the<BR>

<P>participants, but is designed to describe key issues in<BR>

<P>the design and implementation of probability samples.<BR>

<P>The course describes concepts and terminology key to<BR>

<P>understanding why carefully designed samples are<BR>

<P>necessary to create surveys that provide accurate<BR>

<P>information.  The course will address a variety of list<BR>

<P>formats for populations that can be used for selecting<BR>

<P>samples, with lessons on how to avoid various pitfalls.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Some additional courses that may be offered in the early months<BR>

<P>of 1994 are --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An Introduction to Measurement of Attitudes<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course will review alternative concepts of<BR>

<P>attitude measurement with focus on selection of<BR>

<P>multiple indicators, impact of alternative response<BR>

<P>scales on answers, order effects on responses, impacts<BR>

<P>of response labels, filter questions for respondents<BR>

<P>who claim to have no opinion on an issue, and other<BR>

<P>features of attitude questions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Practical Graphical Techniques to Summarize Data<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This course describes methods to summarize data<BR>

<P>visually.  Graphical techniques that are simple to<BR>

<P>understand are reviewed, with descriptions of what<BR>

<P>software can be used to create the images.  The<BR>

<P>instructor will also alert participants to visually<BR>

<P>deceptive presentations in order to avoid<BR>

<P>miscommunication graphically.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Other courses will be planned as needed.<BR>

<P>
<P>Appendix B -- Selected Technical Notes<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>B.1  Introduction<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No general recommendations will be given in this Appendix, except<BR>

<P>on focus groups and only then because of the PRA process.  One of<BR>

<P>the reasons for this is that most of the considerations commented<BR>

<P>on will have important dimensions that depend on your unique<BR>

<P>circumstances.  For example--<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Your existing knowledge of your customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- The nature of your product/service delivery.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How quickly you can modify your agency's approach to<BR>

<P>customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- The degree of satisfaction/dissatisfaction which exists with<BR>

<P>what is currently going on.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This list could be much longer, as you will find in your own<BR>

<P>experience.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While in the end your own thoughtful practice will become your<BR>

<P>principal guide, some beginning observations may help in<BR>

<P>identifying what to look for and where.  A few of these are<BR>

<P>provided here with others to be added in later versions of this<BR>

<P>manual.  In particular, private sector and existing government<BR>

<P>applications of customer surveys suggest that special attention<BR>

<P>should be paid to --<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- How you use focus groups and similar methods (B.2),<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Analysis issues in the use of opinion scales (B.3),<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Complete coverage of your targeted customers (B.4),<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Some other issues which supplement Section 4 (B.5).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>One of the best ways you may find to deal with these and other<BR>

<P>issues that may be unique to your agency  is to set aside<BR>

<P>resources that will allow you to continuously improve the<BR>

<P>measurement process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>B.2  Focus Groups and the PRA<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>One of the first tasks in developing useful customer surveys is<BR>

<P>to determine what the customer perceives to be the important<BR>

<P>service or product attributes.  Focus groups can be a valuable<BR>

<P>tool for eliciting this customer perspective and are widely used<BR>

<P>for this purpose in both government and the private sector.<BR>

<P>Focus groups fall within the coverage of the Paperwork Reduction<BR>

<P>Act and require OMB clearance, but a program of focus groups is a<BR>

<P>prime candidate for &quot;generic&quot; clearances described in Section 5.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Focus groups require planning, effort, and resources, just like<BR>

<P>any other research method.  They involve a recruitment process, a<BR>

<P>&quot;script&quot; comprising the questions to be addressed by the group,<BR>

<P>and one or more &quot;moderators&quot; to facilitate the participation of<BR>

<P>all members of the group and keep the responses focussed on the<BR>

<P>target issues.  The information collected in a focus group<BR>

<P>includes a verbatim record of the discussion (often a video tape)<BR>

<P>and may also include comments and analysis. Both the recruitment<BR>

<P>and analysis stages are generally time-consuming efforts.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Focus groups sponsored by Federal agencies often involve more<BR>

<P>highly selective recruitment than is the norm for private sector<BR>

<P>focus groups.  Vendors of such services should be advised to<BR>

<P>allow for higher recruitment costs (more telephone contacts per<BR>

<P>successful recruitment) when this is the case.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since the success of focus groups depends on full and willing<BR>

<P>participation, vendors should be discouraged from using more<BR>

<P>aggressive recruitment practices (e.g., &quot;hard sell&quot; or special<BR>

<P>incentives) to bring in marginal participants.  While OMB rules<BR>

<P>restrict the use of cash incentives generally, payments of up to<BR>

<P>$25 per participant have been routinely approved as an allowance<BR>

<P>for the estimated &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; costs (transportation, child<BR>

<P>care, etc.) of a focus group.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Well-trained moderators contribute substantially to the value of<BR>

<P>a focus group.  The &quot;script&quot; or moderator's guide should clearly<BR>

<P>lay out the questions (and follow-up issues to be addressed by<BR>

<P>the group).  A clear statement of the purposes of the focus<BR>

<P>group(s) is also needed to guide the moderator and for the PRA<BR>

<P>review process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>In some circumstances formal focus groups may not be needed.  For<BR>

<P>clients who are both sophisticated and articulate, less formal<BR>

<P>approaches (a less structured meeting or group discussion) may<BR>

<P>serve very well to elicit customer opinions.  These informal<BR>

<P>opportunities for customer input require the same attention to<BR>

<P>issues and careful selection of participants as are needed for<BR>

<P>focus groups but they do not require PRA review.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Other techniques that have been used successfully to explore<BR>

<P>customer perceptions are analysis of customer complaints,<BR>

<P>&quot;suggestion&quot; boxes, and &quot;mystery shopper&quot; studies (where a person<BR>

<P>poses as a client to observe how a service is delivered).  The<BR>

<P>&quot;mystery shopper&quot; approach was used to identify problems in the<BR>

<P>IRS taxpayer assistance program.  These other methods also do not<BR>

<P>require PRA review and may offer quick and cost effective options<BR>

<P>for identifying customer problems in some cases.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While focus groups can be very useful for exploring, specifying,<BR>

<P>and understanding customer concerns, they are not useful for<BR>

<P>generalization (e.g., quantitative measurements or comparisons).<BR>

<P>Focus groups are almost never representative of the entire<BR>

<P>customer base.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>B.3  Opinion Scales<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>One of the important tasks in quantifying satisfaction or<BR>

<P>dissatisfaction is selecting the measurement scale(s) you will<BR>

<P>use.  Now this is a very large subject but perhaps an<BR>

<P>illustration of some of the issues will be of assistance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A common strategy, for example, is to present questions about<BR>

<P>important aspects of service with Likert scales for responses<BR>

<P>(e.g., from &quot;very satisfied&quot; to &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; in some<BR>

<P>number of steps.) When numbers are placed on such scales then the<BR>

<P>means and variances computed on them do not necessarily have the<BR>

<P>same properties as on continuous variables, e.g., age or income.<BR>

<P>(One solution might be to use categorical data analysis<BR>

<P>techniques.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The use of ordinal scales has other implications as well.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For example, satisfaction is often viewed as a difference<BR>

<P>between expectations and perceived performance, but the use of<BR>

<P>an arithmetic difference between two opinion scores as a<BR>

<P>measure of satisfaction has raised both conceptual and<BR>

<P>statistical controversies in the literature.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Such issues suggest how measurement decisions and analytical<BR>

<P>objectives are intertwined.  Empirical methods and approaches<BR>

<P>have provided means to address problems that cannot be resolved<BR>

<P>within classical (mathematical) measurement theory.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In the example above, empirical results indicate that<BR>

<P>responses couched in terms of satisfaction may already be<BR>

<P>referenced to some implicit concept of expectations held by<BR>

<P>the respondent. This, in turn, suggests using this natural<BR>

<P>tendency by indicating some explicit reference point (e.g.,<BR>

<P>&quot;service that fully meets your needs&quot;).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Empirical results abound in the literature concerning opinion<BR>

<P>scales and some scale properties are almost always estimated<BR>

<P>empirically.  Clearly, your judgement, and not some mechanical<BR>

<P>manipulation of &quot;the numbers,&quot; will be crucial.  The bibliography<BR>

<P>may help.  Consultants are available (see Section 6).  Workshops<BR>

<P>are also planned (see Section 7).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>B.4  Representativeness of the Customer Survey<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Representativeness requires good frame construction and careful,<BR>

<P>probability-based sample selection.  Getting a good response rate<BR>

<P>is crucial too.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The risk of significant nonresponse bias (the answers of<BR>

<P>nonrespondents would have been different from those who<BR>

<P>responded) increases with the amount of nonresponse.  Indeed, the<BR>

<P>technical consequences of inadequate response, when superimposed<BR>

<P>on the other difficulties inherent in customer surveys can<BR>

<P>seriously undermine the usefulness of your analyses.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The issues here have both a philosophical and a technical<BR>

<P>dimension.  Chapter 2 (&quot;Putting Customers First&quot;) of the Report<BR>

<P>of the National Performance Review states the philosophical<BR>

<P>principle:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>&quot;We will ensure that all customers have a voice, and that<BR>

<P>every voice is heard.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This principle calls for survey designs that make participation<BR>

<P>convenient, simple, and free of unnecessary burden or perceived<BR>

<P>threats -- in short, the kind of designs that generally produce<BR>

<P>high response rates.  One caution, however; some techniques<BR>

<P>(e.g., incentives and aggressive follow-up) have been shown to<BR>

<P>affect the respondent's attitudes toward the sponsoring agency.<BR>

<P>(See bibliography).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In surveying customer opinions, we are not so much interested in<BR>

<P>where the mean of the distribution lies, but in determining<BR>

<P>accurately what portion of the customer population is highly<BR>

<P>satisfied or highly dissatisfied (and why.)  Nonresponse can be<BR>

<P>particularly damaging in interpreting such surveys.  For example,<BR>

<P>it is not uncommon that the respondents may be either more or<BR>

<P>less homogeneous than the full population -- both phenomena have<BR>

<P>been observed in different settings.  What will happen in your<BR>

<P>situation cannot be predicted; however, you should be on the<BR>

<P>lookout for this kind of distortion of the distribution.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>B.5 Some Other Issues<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Customer satisfaction needs to be thought of as multi-<BR>

<P>dimensional.  For example, much of the usefulness of a survey of<BR>

<P>customers may come from the specificity of the insights provided<BR>

<P>on agency practice. As already noted in Section 4, on a technical<BR>

<P>level, multiple measures should help in reducing the inherently<BR>

<P>greater uncertainties in opinion data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Whatever choices you make, the scales used for opinion research<BR>

<P>may set some practical bounds on the precision that can be<BR>

<P>achieved and the types of analysis that can be used. Indeed,<BR>

<P>opinion results may perform poorly when pressed to measure small<BR>

<P>differences or relationships that are not strong.  An<BR>

<P>understanding of these problems will help avoid overambitious<BR>

<P>analytical goals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 3 outlined a step-by-step plan for a single survey design<BR>

<P>cycle.  It is important to remember that a customer survey is not<BR>

<P>an activity to be done just once or once in a while.  Much of the<BR>

<P>benefit derived from systematically obtaining customer views<BR>

<P>depends on a commitment to conduct measurements as frequently as<BR>

<P>necessary:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- Qualitative components of the process should be<BR>

<P>repeated periodically to stay in touch with changing<BR>

<P>customer perceptions and expectations.  This will suggest<BR>

<P>revisions to quantitative surveys as well.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- The quantitative surveys themselves need to be repeated<BR>

<P>regularly, too, with or without changes in the questions<BR>

<P>being used.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since comparisons over time are an important quantitative<BR>

<P>objective of the process, your studies (both qualitative and<BR>

<P>quantitative) should include some overlap of new and old designs,<BR>

<P>in order to calibrate improved measures against prior measures.<BR>

<P>This is a common practice when significant changes are made to<BR>

<P>major Federal statistical series, and it is even more important<BR>

<P>here -- especially in the early going, when you may still be<BR>

<P>learning the best ways for your agency to conduct and use<BR>

<P>customer surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Ironically, success in increasing customer satisfaction may lead<BR>

<P>to a greater difficulty in measuring that satisfaction.<BR>

<P>Technically the shape (e.g., skewness) of the distribution may<BR>

<P>change as satisfaction grows; also the relationships (e.g.,<BR>

<P>degree of collinearity) among the (multiple) satisfaction<BR>

<P>measures may also change (as they all tend to go up together).<BR>

<P>As your success increases a carefully designed change in your<BR>

<P>measurement scheme can open up new information and rejuvenate the<BR>

<P>analytical process.<BR>

<P>
<P>OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Management of Federal Information Resources<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AGENCY:   Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of<BR>

<P>the President<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>ACTION:   Revision of OMB Circular No. A-130, Transmittal 2,<BR>

<P>Management of Federal Information Resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SUMMARY:  The Office of Management and Budget is revising<BR>

<P>Circular No. A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources<BR>

<P>(hereafter referred to as Circular A-130).  The revision is being<BR>

<P>done in stages.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Transmittal 1 to Circular A-130, effective June 25, 1993, and<BR>

<P>published on July 2, 1993 (58 FR 36068) addressed the Information<BR>

<P>Management Policy section of the Circular (Section 8a), as well<BR>

<P>as Appendix I, &quot;Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining<BR>

<P>Records About Individuals.&quot;  That issuance dealt primarily with<BR>

<P>how the Federal government manages its information holdings,<BR>

<P>particularly information exchange with the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The revisions contained herein address agencies' internal<BR>

<P>management practices for information systems and information<BR>

<P>technology (Section 8b).  These revisions to the circular:  (1)<BR>

<P>promote agency investments in information technology that improve<BR>

<P>service delivery to the public, reduce burden on the public, and<BR>

<P>lower the cost of Federal program administration; (2) encourage<BR>

<P>agencies to use information technology as a strategic resource to<BR>

<P>promote fundamental reevaluation of federal agency work<BR>

<P>processes, organizational structures, and ways of interacting<BR>

<P>with the public; and (3) recognize the changes in the technical,<BR>

<P>legal, and operational environment that agencies face when<BR>

<P>managing information technology. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Also, the revisions make minor changes to Section 5,<BR>

<P>&quot;Background,&quot; Section 6, &quot;Definitions,&quot; Section 7, &quot;Basic<BR>

<P>Considerations and Assumptions,&quot; and Appendix IV, &quot;Analysis of<BR>

<P>Key Sections&quot; of the Circular. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DATE: The revisions to the Circular are effective July 15, 1994. <BR>

<P>

<P>  <BR>

<P>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Background<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) assigns the<BR>

<P>Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)<BR>

<P>responsibility for maintaining a comprehensive set of information<BR>

<P>resources management policies, and for promoting the application<BR>

<P>of information technology to improve the use and dissemination of<BR>

<P>information in the operation of Federal programs.  To fulfill<BR>

<P>these responsibilities, OMB originally issued Circular No. A-130,<BR>

<P>Management of Federal Information Resources (50 FR 52730;<BR>

<P>December 24, 1985), which provided a policy framework for Federal<BR>

<P>information resources management (IRM).  Since the Circular was<BR>

<P>issued in 1985, Congress has enacted several laws bearing on the<BR>

<P>information technology management section of the Circular,<BR>

<P>especially amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L.<BR>

<P>99-500). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  OMB published four notices relating to this revision of the<BR>

<P>Circular.  On March 4, 1991, OMB published a notice setting forth<BR>

<P>plans for revising all of the Circular (56 FR 9026) and on April<BR>

<P>29, 1992, OMB specifically requested comments on topics for the<BR>

<P>proposed revision to Section 8b, Information Systems and<BR>

<P>Information Technology Management, of the Circular (57 FR 18296). <BR>

<P>On July 2, 1993, OMB published a notice (58 FR 36068) amending<BR>

<P>most of the Circular; in that notice, OMB stated its plans for<BR>

<P>amending other parts of the Circular (58 FR 36069-70).  On<BR>

<P>September 10, 1993, OMB published a notice (58 FR 47790)<BR>

<P>requesting comment on the proposed changes to the information<BR>

<P>technology portion of the Circular.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Structure of this Revision<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This revision substantially reorganizes Section 8b,<BR>

<P>Information Systems and Information Technology Management, which<BR>

<P>was issued in 1985 (50 FR 52736-37, December 24, 1985).  For the<BR>

<P>convenience of readers of the circular, this issuance fully<BR>

<P>incorporates and supersedes Transmittal 1 of Circular A-130,<BR>

<P>which revised Section 8a and other related sections dealing with<BR>

<P>information management (58 FR 36070, July 2, 1993).  This<BR>

<P>revision primarily addresses portions of the Circular that were<BR>

<P>not revised in the July 1993 Federal Register notice (i.e.,<BR>

<P>Section 8b and Appendix II).  However, this issuance also affects<BR>

<P>Section 5, Background, Section 6, Definitions, Section 7, Basic<BR>

<P>Considerations and Assumptions, and Appendix IV, Analysis of Key<BR>

<P>Sections, which were previously revised in the July 1993 notice. <BR>

<P>
<P>Summary of Revisions<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 5. Background.  This revision substitutes the term<BR>

<P>&quot;information resources management&quot; for the term &quot;information<BR>

<P>management&quot; in the first sentence.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6.  Definitions.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This revision to the Circular adds definitions for the terms<BR>

<P>&quot;information management,&quot; &quot;information resources,&quot; &quot;information<BR>

<P>processing service organization,&quot; and &quot;service recipient.&quot;  In<BR>

<P>addition, the revision amends the definitions for the terms &quot;full<BR>

<P>cost,&quot; &quot;information resources management,&quot; and &quot;information<BR>

<P>system.&quot;  The following summarizes the changes to Section 6.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  The term &quot;full costs&quot; describes the costs agencies should<BR>

<P>account for when charging for services provided by an Information<BR>

<P>Processing Service Organization (IPSO).  This definition is<BR>

<P>changed from the September 10, 1993, proposal (58 FR 47793).  The<BR>

<P>new definition has been made more detailed in response to agency<BR>

<P>comments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The term &quot;information management&quot; is defined to distinguish<BR>

<P>the management of information from the management of information<BR>

<P>technology where necessary.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The term &quot;information resources,&quot; implied in Circular A-130's<BR>

<P>previous definition of &quot;information resources management&quot; (Sec.<BR>

<P>6i, 58 FR 36070), is defined specifically in order to broaden the<BR>

<P>applicability of some policy statements beyond just information<BR>

<P>technology or just information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The term &quot;information resources management&quot; is changed from<BR>

<P>the July 2, 1993, issuance (Sec. 6i, 58 FR 36070) to emphasize<BR>

<P>the process of managing information resources instead of listing<BR>

<P>management activities for information resources. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  The term &quot;information system&quot; is changed from the July 2,<BR>

<P>1993, issuance (Sec. 6j, 58 FR 36070) to stress that information<BR>

<P>systems are discrete sets of resources--not just processes.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  &quot;Information systems life cycle,&quot; a term formerly contained in<BR>

<P>Appendix IV (50 FR 52749), is moved into Section 6 consistent<BR>

<P>with the discussion of information systems management oversight<BR>

<P>in Section 8b(3).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The new term &quot;information processing services organization&quot;<BR>

<P>(IPSO) replaces the term &quot;information technology facility&quot; (Sec.<BR>

<P>6l, 58 FR 36071), which is deleted.  This final issuance defines<BR>

<P>the term differently than proposed (Sec. 6l, 58 FR 47793) in<BR>

<P>response to agency comments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The definition &quot;major information system&quot; is changed slightly<BR>

<P>from the proposal (Sec. 6m, 58 FR 47790) for clarity.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  &quot;Service recipient&quot; is a new term used solely in the context<BR>

<P>of interagency sharing or cross-servicing of information<BR>

<P>resources for purposes of establishing charge-back mechanisms. <BR>

<P>This term is being adopted rather than the term &quot;user&quot; proposed<BR>

<P>in the September 10, 1993, notice (Sec. 6t, 58 FR 47793).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 7.  Basic Considerations and Assumptions.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The September 10, 1993, notice proposed to amend two statements<BR>

<P>of basic considerations and assumptions (Sec. 7i and 7l), and to<BR>

<P>add one (Sec. 7n) (58 FR 47793).  This notice amends Section 7i,<BR>

<P>as proposed; adds a new section 7n, revised from the proposal;<BR>

<P>amends section 7l, with most of the proposed revision being moved<BR>

<P>to new sections 7o and 7p; and adds a new section 7q.  These<BR>

<P>changes address:<BR>

<P>  (1) The need for agencies to apply information resources to<BR>

<P>meet the mission needs of the agency as agreed upon through<BR>

<P>agency strategic planning processes,<BR>

<P>  (2) The need for skills, training, and knowledge to support the<BR>

<P>management of information resources as the government moves<BR>

<P>toward program delivery to the public that relies more heavily on<BR>

<P>automation, and<BR>

<P>  (3) The need for federal managers with program delivery<BR>

<P>responsibilities to assume responsibility for the effective<BR>

<P>stewardship of information resources to fulfill mission needs. <BR>

<P>  (4) One basic consideration and assumption proposed (Section<BR>

<P>7l, 58 FR 47793) is split into two separate statements in this<BR>

<P>issuance to emphasize:<BR>

<P>     (a) The need for agencies to recognize the opportunity that<BR>

<P>the introduction of information technology presents for<BR>

<P>organizational streamlining, work process redesign, and making<BR>

<P>public interactions with the Federal government more &quot;user-<BR>

<P>friendly&quot;;<BR>

<P>     (b) The availability of government information in electronic<BR>

<P>forms to improve the management and use of this information for<BR>

<P>the government and the public; and <BR>

<P>  (5) The role of information resources in supporting the<BR>

<P>achievement of mission goals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b. Information Systems and Information Technology<BR>

<P>Management Policy.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (1) Evaluation and Performance Measurement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section expands on the guidance for evaluating<BR>

<P>investments in information technology previously found in Section<BR>

<P>43 of OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget<BR>

<P>Estimates, and OMB Circular No. A-94, Guidelines and Discount<BR>

<P>Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs (57 FR 53519,<BR>

<P>November 10, 1992).  Additionally, OMB broadens the criteria for<BR>

<P>evaluating information systems to include benefits to the public. <BR>

<P>This policy requires agencies to prepare a benefit-cost analysis<BR>

<P>for each information system as a management oversight tool.  The<BR>

<P>policy also requires agencies to devise an agency-wide investment<BR>

<P>strategy, using benefit-cost analyses for individual systems,<BR>

<P>that maximizes the return on investment on information technology<BR>

<P>across the agency.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section has been changed from the proposal (Sec. 8b(1),<BR>

<P>58 FR 47793-4) to emphasize the role of reengineering in ensuring<BR>

<P>the greatest return possible from investments in information<BR>

<P>technology.  Other changes add operational risk as a criterion<BR>

<P>for evaluating individual information systems and require<BR>

<P>agencies to review benefits that have accrued from implementing<BR>

<P>an information system.  Finally, this issuance requires agencies<BR>

<P>to consider the return on investments in information technology<BR>

<P>from an organization-wide perspective.  These changes reflect<BR>

<P>comments from the General Accounting Office.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (2) Strategic Information Resources Management (IRM) Planning. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section describes a planning framework that links the<BR>

<P>management of information resources to operational and strategic<BR>

<P>IRM planning and agency-wide strategic planning.  In addition, it<BR>

<P>expands the scope of the current planning requirement beyond<BR>

<P>automatic data processing equipment to planning for all<BR>

<P>information resources.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section reflects changes from the proposal (Sec. 8b(2),<BR>

<P>58 FR 47794) to provide more detailed instructions on the content<BR>

<P>of agency planning requirements, in response to agency comments. <BR>

<P>In particular, some material previously required to be reported<BR>

<P>to OMB in Section 43 of OMB Circular A-11 are now included in<BR>

<P>this Circular as required elements of agency operational<BR>

<P>information technology plans.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (3) Information Systems Management Oversight.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Section 8b(3) addresses the need for agencies to create<BR>

<P>management oversight processes that ensure information systems<BR>

<P>meet mission requirements.  This represents a slight change in<BR>

<P>language and emphasis from the proposal (Sec. 8b(3), 58 FR<BR>

<P>47794).  The language in this final issuance stresses a higher<BR>

<P>level of agency management attention to the progress of major<BR>

<P>information systems projects, with less emphasis on the term<BR>

<P>&quot;life cycle management.&quot;<BR>

<P>  A new policy at Section 8b(3)(g) links the oversight of<BR>

<P>financial management systems through Circular No. A-127,<BR>

<P>Financial Management Systems (58 FR 41014-19, July 23, 1993), to<BR>

<P>the management of information systems more generally.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (4) Use of Information Resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  A new policy is added at 8b(4) that prompts agencies to<BR>

<P>address the need for organization-wide frameworks for using<BR>

<P>information resources.  This clarifies the proposal concerning<BR>

<P>information and information technology architectures contained in<BR>

<P>the section on IRM planning (Sec. 8b(2)(c), FR 58 47794), in<BR>

<P>response to agency comments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  The policy statement on the use of Federal Information<BR>

<P>Processing Standards (FIPS) is dropped from Section 8b of the<BR>

<P>Circular (Sec. 8b(14), 50 FR 52737) because it is now covered in<BR>

<P>Section 8a(1)(h).  This change recognizes that the Computer<BR>

<P>Security Act of 1987 amended the Brooks Act to give the Secretary<BR>

<P>of Commerce the responsibility for determining the applicability<BR>

<P>of FIPS (see 40 U.S.C. 759(d)).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section incorporates guidance formerly found in Appendix<BR>

<P>II (50 FR 52741-42) into Section 8b(4).  This reflects changes in<BR>

<P>the technical environment surrounding the sharing of federal<BR>

<P>information processing services that allow for sharing of more<BR>

<P>than just mainframe computing resources.  Moving this guidance<BR>

<P>into the policy section of the Circular gives it more prominence<BR>

<P>and fosters better integration of these principles in agencies'<BR>

<P>information technology management programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Section 8b(4) also collapses and simplifies the guidance found<BR>

<P>in proposed Section 8b(5) (58 FR 47794-5).  This change reflects<BR>

<P>agency comments that the proposal for Section 8b(4) was too<BR>

<P>burdensome and detailed to serve its intended purposes cost-<BR>

<P>effectively.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Sec. 8b(4)(f) adds a policy statement stating the high-level<BR>

<P>policy principles of the Computer Security Act of 1987 (U.S.C.<BR>

<P>759 note), as requested in several comments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (5) Acquisition of Information Technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  This section applies the economic principle of maximizing<BR>

<P>return on investment when acquiring information technology.  This<BR>

<P>supports the criterion used in 8b(1) to evaluate investments in<BR>

<P>information technology for improvements in service delivery to<BR>

<P>the public.  It had been proposed as part of a different section<BR>

<P>(Sec. 8b(4), 58 FR 47794), but now stands as a separate section<BR>

<P>in this issuance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Appendix II:  Cost Accounting, Cost Recovery, and Interagency<BR>

<P>Sharing of Information Technology Facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  In the July 1993 Federal Register notice (58 FR 36069-70), OMB<BR>

<P>stated its intention to revise the guidance in Appendix II,<BR>

<P>issued in 1985 (50 FR 52741-42).  In the September 10, 1993,<BR>

<P>notice, OMB proposed to delete the guidance in Appendix II and<BR>

<P>place revised guidance in Section 8b (58 FR 47793).  This notice<BR>

<P>contains the revised guidance in Section 8b.  Accordingly, policy<BR>

<P>pertaining to cost accounting, cost recovery, and interagency<BR>

<P>sharing of information technology facilities has been deleted<BR>

<P>from Appendix II.  Appendix II will be reserved for future policy<BR>

<P>topics.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Appendix IV:   Analysis of Key Sections.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  OMB has completely revised the portion of this appendix<BR>

<P>pertaining to Section 8b, Information Systems and Information<BR>

<P>Technology Management (see 50 FR 52748-50) to reflect the changes<BR>

<P>made in Section 8b.  Accordingly, Appendix IV now consists of the<BR>

<P>discussion concerning sections 1-8 and 9a(11) of the Circular,<BR>

<P>contained herein, plus the discussion of Section 9, Assignment of<BR>

<P>Responsibilities, and 10, Oversight, in Appendix IV from the 1985<BR>

<P>issuance (50 FR 52750-51), which remains in effect. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Development of Future Topics<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Section 9, Assignment of Responsibilities and Section 10,<BR>

<P>Oversight.  As part of the final stage of revising the Circular,<BR>

<P>OMB will review the assignment of responsibilities and oversight<BR>

<P>provisions to ensure that they reflect changes in Section 8,<BR>

<P>Policies, of the Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Appendix III:  Security of Federal Automated Information<BR>

<P>Systems.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  OMB did not amend Appendix III (50 FR 52742-44) in the July<BR>

<P>1993 Federal Register notice, and is not amending Appendix III in<BR>

<P>this notice.  OMB intends to issue a proposal that would revise<BR>

<P>Appendix III to incorporate requirements of the Computer Security<BR>

<P>Act of 1987 including requirements for security plans described<BR>

<P>in OMB Bulletin 90-08.  Those revisions will incorporate changes<BR>

<P>based on the experience gained in recent computer security visits<BR>

<P>to agencies by teams of staff from OMB, the National Institute of<BR>

<P>Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Security<BR>

<P>Agency.  OMB will also work with NIST to implement<BR>

<P>recommendations of the Computer Security and Privacy Advisory<BR>

<P>Board (established by the Computer Security Act) regarding better<BR>

<P>coordination between this Circular and OMB Circular No. A-123.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  Accordingly, Circular A-130 is revised as set forth below.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  4.  Applicability and Scope:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  a.  The policies in this Circular apply to the information<BR>

<P>activities of all agencies of the executive branch of the Federal<BR>

<P>government.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  b.  Information classified for national security purposes<BR>

<P>should also be handled in accordance with the appropriate<BR>

<P>national security directives.  National security emergency<BR>

<P>preparedness activities should be conducted in accordance with<BR>

<P>Executive Order No. 12472.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  5.  Background:  The Paperwork Reduction Act establishes a<BR>

<P>broad mandate for agencies to perform their information resources<BR>

<P>management activities in an efficient, effective, and economical<BR>

<P>manner.  To assist agencies in an integrated approach to<BR>

<P>information resources management, the Act requires that the<BR>

<P>Director of OMB develop and implement uniform and consistent<BR>

<P>information resources management policies; oversee the<BR>

<P>development and promote the use of information management<BR>

<P>principles, standards, and guidelines; evaluate agency<BR>

<P>information resources management practices in order to determine<BR>

<P>their adequacy and efficiency; and determine compliance of such<BR>

<P>practices with the policies, principles, standards, and<BR>

<P>guidelines promulgated by the Director.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  6.  Definitions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  i.  The term &quot;information life cycle&quot; means the stages through<BR>

<P>which information passes, typically characterized as creation or<BR>

<P>collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and<BR>

<P>disposition.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  j.  The term &quot;information management&quot; means the planning,<BR>

<P>budgeting, manipulating, and controlling of information<BR>

<P>throughout its life cycle.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  k.  The term &quot;information resources&quot; includes both government<BR>

<P>information and information technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  l.  The term &quot;information processing services organization&quot;<BR>

<P>(IPSO) means a discrete set of personnel, information technology,<BR>

<P>and support equipment with the primary function of providing<BR>

<P>services to more than one agency on a reimbursable basis. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  m.  The term &quot;information resources management&quot; means the<BR>

<P>process of managing information resources to accomplish agency<BR>

<P>missions.  The term encompasses both information itself and the<BR>

<P>related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and<BR>

<P>information technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  n.  The term &quot;information system&quot; means a discrete set of<BR>

<P>information resources organized for the collection, processing,<BR>

<P>maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in<BR>

<P>on behalf of the Federal government to accomplish a Federal<BR>

<P>function, regardless of the technology involved, whether<BR>

<P>computers, telecommunications, or others.  It includes automatic<BR>

<P>data processing equipment as that term is defined in Section<BR>

<P>111(a)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act<BR>

<P>of 1949.  For the purposes of this Circular, automatic data<BR>

<P>processing and telecommunications activities related to certain<BR>

<P>critical national security missions, as defined in 44 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>3502(2) and 10 U.S.C. 2315, are excluded.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  q.  The term &quot;major information system&quot; means an information<BR>

<P>Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public<BR>

<P>business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that<BR>

<P>agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the<BR>

<P>organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,<BR>

<P>operations, or other activities of the government or because of<BR>

<P>the informational value of the data in them.  Library and museum<BR>

<P>material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or<BR>

<P>exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for<BR>

<P>convenience of reference, and stocks of publications and of<BR>

<P>processed documents are not included. (44 U.S.C. 3301)<BR>

<P>
<P>  s.  The term &quot;records management&quot; means the planning,<BR>

<P>controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and<BR>

<P>other managerial activities involved with respect to records<BR>

<P>creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition in<BR>

<P>order to achieve adequate and proper documentation of the<BR>

<P>policies and transactions of the Federal Government and effective<BR>

<P>and economical management of agency operations.  (44 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>2901(2))<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  t.  The term &quot;service recipient&quot; means an agency<BR>

<P>organizational unit, programmatic entity, or chargeable account<BR>

<P>that receives information processing services from an information<BR>

<P>processing service organization (IPSO).  A service recipient may<BR>

<P>be either internal or external to the organization responsible<BR>

<P>for providing information resources services, but normally does<BR>

<P>not report either to the manager or director of the IPSO or to<BR>

<P>the same immediate supervisor.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  7.  Basic Considerations and Assumptions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  a.  The Federal Government is the largest single producer,<BR>

<P>collector, consumer, and disseminator of information in the<BR>

<P>United States.  Because of the extent of the government's<BR>

<P>information activities, and the dependence of those activities<BR>

<P>upon public cooperation, the management of Federal information<BR>

<P>resources is an issue of continuing importance to all Federal<BR>

<P>agencies, State and local governments, and the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  b.  Government information is a valuable national resource. <BR>

<P>It provides the public with knowledge of the government, society,<BR>

<P>and economy -- past, present, and future.  It is a means to<BR>

<P>ensure the accountability of government, to manage the<BR>

<P>government's operations, to maintain the healthy performance of<BR>

<P>the economy, and is itself a commodity in the marketplace.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  c.  The free flow of information between the government and<BR>

<P>the public is essential to a democratic society. It is also<BR>

<P>essential that the government minimize the Federal paperwork<BR>

<P>burden on the public, minimize the cost of its information<BR>

<P>activities, and maximize the usefulness of government<BR>

<P>information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  d.  In order to minimize the cost and maximize the usefulness<BR>

<P>of government information, the expected public and private<BR>

<P>benefits derived from government information should exceed the<BR>

<P>public and private costs of the information, recognizing that the<BR>

<P>benefits to be derived from government information may not always<BR>

<P>be quantifiable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  e.  The nation can benefit from government information<BR>

<P>disseminated both by Federal agencies and by diverse nonfederal<BR>

<P>parties, including State and local government agencies,<BR>

<P>educational and other not-for-profit institutions, and for-profit<BR>

<P>organizations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  f.  Because the public disclosure of government information is<BR>

<P>essential to the operation of a democracy, the management of<BR>

<P>Federal information resources should protect the public's right<BR>

<P>of access to government information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  g.  The individual's right to privacy must be protected in<BR>

<P>Federal Government information activities involving personal<BR>

<P>information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  h.  Systematic attention to the management of government<BR>

<P>records is an essential component of sound public resources<BR>

<P>management which ensures public accountability.  Together with<BR>

<P>records preservation, it protects the government's historical<BR>

<P>record and guards the legal and financial rights of the<BR>

<P>government and the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  i.  Agency strategic planning can improve the operation of<BR>

<P>government programs.  The application of information resources<BR>

<P>should support an agency's strategic plan to fulfill its mission. <BR>

<P>The integration of IRM planning with agency strategic planning<BR>

<P>promotes the appropriate application of Federal information<BR>

<P>resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  j.  Because State and local governments are important<BR>

<P>producers of government information for many areas such as<BR>

<P>health, social welfare, labor, transportation, and education, the<BR>

<P>Federal Government must cooperate with these governments in the<BR>

<P>management of information resources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  k.  The open and efficient exchange of scientific and<BR>

<P>technical government information, subject to applicable national<BR>

<P>security controls and the proprietary rights of others, fosters<BR>

<P>excellence in scientific research and effective use of Federal<BR>

<P>research and development funds.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  l.  Information technology is not an end in itself.  It is one<BR>

<P>set of resources that can improve the effectiveness and<BR>

<P>efficiency of Federal program delivery.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  m.  Federal Government information resources management<BR>

<P>policies and activities can affect, and be affected by, the<BR>

<P>information policies and activities of other nations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  n.  Users of Federal information resources must have skills,<BR>

<P>knowledge, and training to manage information resources, enabling<BR>

<P>the Federal government to effectively serve the public through<BR>

<P>automated means.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  o.  The application of up-to-date information technology<BR>

<P>presents opportunities to promote fundamental changes in agency<BR>

<P>structures, work processes, and ways of interacting with the<BR>

<P>public that improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Federal<BR>

<P>agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  p.  The availability of government information in diverse<BR>

<P>media, including electronic formats, permits agencies and the<BR>

<P>public greater flexibility in using the information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  q.  Federal managers with program delivery responsibilities<BR>

<P>should recognize the importance of information resources<BR>

<P>management to mission performance.<BR>

<P>

<P>entities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (4)  Records Management.  Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  Ensure that records management programs provide adequate<BR>

<P>and proper documentation of agency activities;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Ensure the ability to access records regardless of form<BR>

<P>or medium;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  In a timely fashion, establish, and obtain the approval<BR>

<P>of the Archivist of the United States for, retention schedules<BR>

<P>for Federal records; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d)  Provide  training and guidance as appropriate to all<BR>

<P>agency officials and employees and contractors regarding their<BR>

<P>Federal records management responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (5)  Providing Information to the Public.  Agencies have a<BR>

<P>responsibility to provide information to the public consistent<BR>

<P>with their missions.  Agencies shall discharge this<BR>

<P>responsibility by:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  Providing information, as required by law, describing<BR>

<P>agency organization, activities, programs, meetings, systems of<BR>

<P>records, and other information holdings, and how the public may<BR>

<P>gain access to agency information resources;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Providing access to agency records under provisions of<BR>

<P>the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, subject to<BR>

<P>the protections and limitations provided for in these Acts; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  Providing such other information as is necessary or<BR>

<P>appropriate for the proper performance of agency functions; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d)  In determining whether and how to disseminate information<BR>

<P>to the public, agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (i)  Disseminate information in a manner that achieves the<BR>

<P>best balance between the goals of maximizing the usefulness of<BR>

<P>the information and minimizing the cost to the government and the<BR>

<P>public;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (ii)  Disseminate information dissemination products on<BR>

<P>equitable and timely terms;<BR>

<P>and nonfederal, including State and local governments, libraries<BR>

<P>and private sector entities, in discharging agency information<BR>

<P>dissemination responsibilities;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iv) Help the public locate government information<BR>

<P>maintained by or for the agency.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (6)  Information Dissemination Management System.  Agencies<BR>

<P>shall maintain and implement a management system for all<BR>

<P>information dissemination products which shall, at a minimum:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  Assure that information dissemination products are<BR>

<P>necessary for proper performance of agency functions (44 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>1108);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Consider whether an information dissemination product<BR>

<P>available from other Federal or nonfederal sources is equivalent<BR>

<P>to an agency information dissemination product and reasonably<BR>

<P>fulfills the dissemination responsibilities of the agency;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  Establish and maintain inventories of all agency<BR>

<P>information dissemination pr<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d)  Develop such other aids to locating agency information<BR>

<P>dissemination products including catalogs and directories, as may<BR>

<P>reasonably achieve agency information dissemination objectives;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (e)  Identify in information dissemination products the source<BR>

<P>of the information, if from another agency;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (f)  Ensure that members of the public with disabilities whom<BR>

<P>the agency has a responsibility to inform have a reasonable<BR>

<P>ability to access the information dissemination products;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (g)  Ensure that government publications are made available to<BR>

<P>depository libraries through the facilities of the Government<BR>

<P>Printing Office, as required by law (44 U.S.C. Part 19);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (h)  Provide electronic information dissemination products to<BR>

<P>the Government Printing Office for distribution to depository<BR>

<P>libraries;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (i)  Establish and maintain communications with members of the<BR>

<P>public and with State and local governments so that the agency<BR>

<P>creates information dissemination products that meet their<BR>

<P>respective needs;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (j)  Provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially<BR>

<P>modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination<BR>

<P>products; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (k)  Ensure that, to the extent existing information<BR>

<P>dissemination policies or practices are inconsistent with the<BR>

<P>requirements of this Circular, a prompt and orderly transition to<BR>

<P>compliance with the requirements of this Circular is made.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (7)  Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices.  Agencies<BR>

<P>shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  Avoid establishing, or permitting others to establish on<BR>

<P>their behalf, exclusive, restricted, or other distribution<BR>

<P>arrangements that interfere with the availability of information<BR>

<P>dissemination products on a timely and equitable basis;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Avoid establishing restrictions or regulations, including<BR>

<P>the charging of fees or royalties, on the reuse, resale, or<BR>

<P>redissemination of Federal information dissemination products by<BR>

<P>the public; and,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  Set user charges for information dissemination products<BR>

<P>at a level sufficient to recover the cost of dissemination but no<BR>

<P>higher.  They shall exclude from calculation of the charges costs<BR>

<P>associated with original collection and processing of the<BR>

<P>information.  Exceptions to this policy are:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (i)  Where statutory requirements are at variance with the<BR>

<P>  policy;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (ii)  Where the agency collects, processes, and disseminates<BR>

<P>  the information for the benefit of a specific identifiable<BR>

<P>  group beyond the benefit to the general public;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iii)  Where the agency plans to establish user charges at<BR>

<P>  less than cost of dissemination because of a determination<BR>

<P>  that higher charges would constitute a significant barrier to<BR>

<P>  properly performing the agency's functions, including reaching<BR>

<P>  members of the public whom the agency has a responsibility to<BR>

<P>  inform; or<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iv)  Where the Director of OMB determines an exception is<BR>

<P>  warranted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (8)   Electronic Information Dissemination.  Agencies shall<BR>

<P>use electronic media and formats, including public networks, as<BR>

<P>appropriate and within budgetary constraints, in order to make<BR>

<P>government information more easily accessible and useful to the<BR>

<P>public.  The use of electronic media and formats for information<BR>

<P>dissemination is appropriate under the following conditions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  The agency develops and maintains the information<BR>

<P>electronically;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Electronic media or formats are practical and cost<BR>

<P>effective ways to provide public access to a large, highly<BR>

<P>detailed volume of information;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  The agency disseminates the product frequently;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d)  The agency knows a substantial portion of users have<BR>

<P>ready access to the necessary information technology and training<BR>

<P>to use electronic information dissemination products;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (e)  A change to electronic dissemination, as the sole means<BR>

<P>of disseminating the product, will not impose substantial<BR>

<P>acquisition or training costs on users, especially State and<BR>

<P>local governments and small business entities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (9)  Safeguards.  Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a)  Ensure that information is protected commensurate with<BR>

<P>the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from the<BR>

<P>loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such<BR>

<P>information;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b)  Limit the collection of information which identifies<BR>

<P>individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for<BR>

<P>the proper performance of agency functions;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c)  Limit the sharing of information that identifies<BR>

<P>individuals or contains proprietary information to that which is<BR>

<P>legally authorized, and impose appropriate conditions on use<BR>

<P>where a continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality of<BR>

<P>the information exists;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d)  Provide individuals, upon request, access to records<BR>

<P>about them maintained in Privacy Act systems of records, and<BR>

<P>permit them to amend such records as are in error consistent with<BR>

<P>the provisions of the Privacy Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  b. Information Systems and Information Technology Management<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (1) Evaluation and Performance Measurement.  Agencies shall<BR>

<P>promote the appropriate application of Federal information<BR>

<P>resources as follows:  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a) Seek opportunities to improve the effectiveness and<BR>

<P>efficiency of government programs through work process redesign<BR>

<P>and the judicious application of information technology;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b) Prepare, and update as necessary throughout the<BR>

<P>information system life cycle, a benefit-cost analysis for each<BR>

<P>information system: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (i) at a level of detail appropriate to the size of the<BR>

<P>  investment;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (ii) consistent with the methodology described in OMB<BR>

<P>  Circular No. A-94, &quot;Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-<BR>

<P>  Cost Analysis of Federal Programs;&quot; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iii) that relies on systematic measures of mission<BR>

<P>  performance, including the:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a) effectiveness of program delivery;<BR>

<P>       (b) efficiency of program administration; and<BR>

<P>       (c) reduction in burden, including information collection<BR>

<P>     burden, imposed on the public;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c) Conduct benefit-cost analyses to support ongoing<BR>

<P>management oversight processes that maximize return on investment<BR>

<P>and minimize financial and operational risk for investments in<BR>

<P>major information systems on an agency-wide basis; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d) Conduct post-implementation reviews of information systems<BR>

<P>to validate estimated benefits and document effective management<BR>

<P>practices for broader use.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (2) Strategic Information Resources Management (IRM) Planning. <BR>

<P>Agencies shall establish and maintain strategic information<BR>

<P>resources management planning processes which include the<BR>

<P>following components:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a) Strategic IRM planning that addresses how the management<BR>

<P>of information resources promotes the fulfillment of an agency's<BR>

<P>mission.  This planning process should support the development<BR>

<P>and maintenance of a strategic IRM plan that reflects and<BR>

<P>anticipates changes in the agency's mission, policy direction,<BR>

<P>technological capabilities, or resource levels;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b) Information planning that promotes the use of information<BR>

<P>throughout its life cycle to maximize the usefulness of<BR>

<P>information, minimize the burden on the public, and preserve the<BR>

<P>appropriate integrity, availability, and confidentiality of<BR>

<P>information.  It shall specifically address the planning and<BR>

<P>budgeting for the information collection burden imposed on the<BR>

<P>public as defined by 5 C.F.R. 1320;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c) Operational information technology planning that links<BR>

<P>information technology to anticipated program and mission needs,<BR>

<P>reflects budget constraints, and forms the basis for budget<BR>

<P>requests.  This planning should result in the preparation and<BR>

<P>maintenance of an up-to-date five-year plan, as required by 44<BR>

<P>U.S.C. 3506, which includes:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (i) a listing of existing and planned major information<BR>

<P>  systems;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (ii) a listing of planned information technology<BR>

<P>  acquisitions;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iii) an explanation of how the listed major information<BR>

<P>  systems and planned information technology acquisitions relate<BR>

<P>  note); and<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>  (d)  Coordination with other agency planning processes<BR>

<P>including strategic, human resources, and financial resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (3) Information Systems Management Oversight.  Agencies shall<BR>

<P>establish information system management oversight mechanisms<BR>

<P>that:<BR>

<P>
<P>  (a) Ensure that each information system meets agency mission<BR>

<P>requirements; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b) Provide for periodic review of information systems to<BR>

<P>determine:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (i) how mission requirements might have changed;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (ii) whether the information system continues to fulfill<BR>

<P>  ongoing and anticipated mission requirements; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iii) what level of maintenance is needed to ensure the<BR>

<P>  information system meets mission requirements cost<BR>

<P>  effectively;<BR>

<P>       <BR>

<P>  (c) Ensure that the official who administers a program<BR>

<P>supported by an information system is responsible and accountable<BR>

<P>for the management of that information system throughout its life<BR>

<P>cycle;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d) Provide for the appropriate training for users of Federal<BR>

<P>information resources;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (e) Prescribe Federal information system requirements that do<BR>

<P>not unduly restrict the prerogatives of State, local, and tribal<BR>

<P>governments;<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>maintain management and technical frameworks for using<BR>

<P>information resources that document linkages between mission<BR>

<P>needs, information content, and information technology<BR>

<P>capabilities.  These frameworks should guide both strategic and<BR>

<P>operational IRM planning.  They should also address steps<BR>

<P>necessary to create an open systems environment.  Agencies shall<BR>

<P>implement the following principles:   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a) Develop information systems in a manner that facilitates<BR>

<P>same agency, from other agencies, or from the private sector;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c) Share available information systems with other agencies to<BR>

<P>the extent practicable and legally permissible;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (d) Meet information technology needs through intra-agency and<BR>

<P>inter-agency sharing, when it is cost effective, before acquiring<BR>

<P>new information technology resources;<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>  with the costs required to provide those services; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (iii) document sharing agreements between service recipients<BR>

<P>  and IPSOs; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (f) Establish a level of security for all information systems<BR>

<P>that is commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm<BR>

<P>resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or<BR>

<P>modification of the information contained in these information<BR>

<P>systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (5) Acquisition of Information Technology.  Agencies shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (a) Acquire information technology in a manner that makes use<BR>

<P>of full and open competition and that maximizes return on<BR>

<P>investment;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (b) Acquire off-the-shelf software from commercial sources,<BR>

<P>unless the cost effectiveness of developing custom software to<BR>

<P>meet mission needs is clear and has been documented;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (c) Acquire information technology in accordance with OMB<BR>

<P>Circular No. A-109, &quot;Acquisition of Major Systems,&quot; where<BR>

<P>appropriate; and<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130 - Federal Agency<BR>

<P>Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Purpose and Scope.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This Appendix describes agency responsibilities for implementing<BR>

<P>the reporting and publication requirements of the Privacy Act of<BR>

<P>1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended (hereinafter &quot;the Act&quot;).  It<BR>

<P>applies to all agencies subject to the Act.  Note that this<BR>

<P>Appendix does not rescind other guidance OMB has issued to help<BR>

<P>agencies interpret the Privacy Act's provisions, e.g., Privacy<BR>

<P>Act Guidelines (40 FR 28949-28978, July 9, 1975), or Final<BR>

<P>Guidance for Conducting Matching Programs (54 FR at 25819, June<BR>

<P>19, 1989).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Definitions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a.  The terms &quot;agency,&quot; &quot;individual,&quot; &quot;maintain,&quot; &quot;record,&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;system of records,&quot; and &quot;routine use,&quot; as used in this Appendix,<BR>

<P>are defined in the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b.  Matching Agency.  Generally, the Recipient Federal agency (or<BR>

<P>the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a nonfederal<BR>

<P>agency) is the matching agency and is responsible for meeting the<BR>

<P>reporting and publication requirements associated with the<BR>

<P>matching program.  However, in large, multi-agency matching<BR>

<P>programs, where the recipient agency is merely performing the<BR>

<P>matches and the benefit accrues to the source agencies, the<BR>

<P>partners should assign responsibility for compliance with the<BR>

<P>administrative requirements in a fair and reasonable way.  This<BR>

<P>may mean having the matching agency carry out these requirements<BR>

<P>for all parties, having one participant designated to do so, or<BR>

<P>having each source agency do so for its own matching program(s).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c.  Nonfederal Agency.  Nonfederal agencies are State or local<BR>

<P>governmental agencies receiving records from a Federal agency's<BR>

<P>automated system of records to be used in a matching program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d.  Recipient Agency.  Recipient agencies are Federal agencies or<BR>

<P>their contractors receiving automated records from the Privacy<BR>

<P>Act systems of records of other Federal agencies, or from State<BR>

<P>or local governments, to be used in a matching program as defined<BR>

<P>in the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e.  Source Agency.  A source agency is a Federal agency that<BR>

<P>discloses automated records from a system of records to another<BR>

<P>Federal agency or to a State or local agency to be used in a<BR>

<P>matching program.  It is also a State or local agency that <BR>

<P>discloses records to a Federal agency for use in a matching<BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Assignment of Responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>a.  All Federal Agencies.  In addition to meeting the agency<BR>

<P>requirements contained in the Act and the specific reporting and<BR>

<P>publication requirements detailed in this Appendix, the head of<BR>

<P>each agency shall ensure that the following reviews are conducted<BR>

<P>as often as specified below, and be prepared to report to the<BR>

<P>Director, OMB, the results of such reviews and the corrective<BR>

<P>action taken to resolve problems uncovered.  The head of each<BR>

<P>agency shall:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Section (m) Contracts.  Review every two years a random<BR>

<P>sample of agency contracts that provide for the maintenance of a<BR>

<P>system of records on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency<BR>

<P>function, in order to ensure that the wording of each contract<BR>

<P>makes the provisions of the Act binding on the contractor and his<BR>

<P>or her employees.  (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1))<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Recordkeeping Practices.  Review annually agency<BR>

<P>recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices in order to<BR>

<P>assure compliance with the Act, paying particular attention to<BR>

<P>the maintenance of automated records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Routine Use Disclosures.  Review every four years the<BR>

<P>routine use disclosures associated with each system of records in<BR>

<P>order to ensure that the recipient's use of such records<BR>

<P>continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the<BR>

<P>disclosing agency collected the information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4)  Exemption of Systems of Records.  Review every four years<BR>

<P>each system of records for which the agency has promulgated<BR>

<P>exemption rules pursuant to Section (j) or (k) of the Act in<BR>

<P>order to determine whether such exemption is still needed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5)  Matching Programs.  Review annually each ongoing matching<BR>

<P>program in which the agency has participated during the year,<BR>

<P>either as a source or as a matching agency, in order to ensure<BR>

<P>that the requirements of the Act, the OMB guidance, and any<BR>

<P>agency regulations, operating instructions, or guidelines have<BR>

<P>been met.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(6)  Privacy Act Training.  Review annually agency training<BR>

<P>practices in order to ensure that all agency personnel are<BR>

<P>familiar with the requirements of the Act, with the agency's<BR>

<P>implementing regulation, and with any special requirements of<BR>

<P>their specific jobs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(7)  Violations.  Review annually the actions of agency personnel<BR>

<P>that have resulted either in the agency being found civilly<BR>

<P>liable under Section (g) of the Act, or an employee being  found<BR>

<P>criminally liable under the provisions of Section (i) of the Act,<BR>

<P>in order to determine the extent of the problem and to find the<BR>

<P>most effective way to prevent recurrence of the problem.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(8)  Systems of Records Notices.  Review annually each system of<BR>

<P>records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system<BR>

<P>of records.  Where minor changes are needed, e.g., the name of<BR>

<P>the system manager, ensure that an amended notice is published in<BR>

<P>the Federal Register.  Agencies may choose to make one annual<BR>

<P>comprehensive publication consolidating such minor changes.  This<BR>

<P>requirement is distinguished from and in addition to the<BR>

<P>requirement to report to OMB and Congress significant changes to<BR>

<P>systems of records and to publish those changes in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register (See paragraph 4c of this Appendix).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>b.  Department of Commerce.  The Secretary of Commerce shall,<BR>

<P>consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB, develop<BR>

<P>and issue standards and guidelines for ensuring the security of<BR>

<P>information protected by the Act in automated information<BR>

<P>systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>c.  The Department of Defense, General Services Administration,<BR>

<P>and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  These<BR>

<P>agencies shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the<BR>

<P>Director, OMB, ensure that instructions are issued on what<BR>

<P>agencies must do in order to comply with the requirements of<BR>

<P>Section (m) of the Act when contracting for the operation of a<BR>

<P>system of records to accomplish an agency purpose.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>d.  Office of Personnel Management.  The Director of the Office<BR>

<P>of Personnel Management shall, consistent with guidelines issued<BR>

<P>by the Director, OMB:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Develop and maintain government-wide standards and<BR>

<P>procedures for civilian personnel information processing and<BR>

<P>recordkeeping directives to assure conformance with the Act.<BR>

<P>(2)  Develop and conduct Privacy Act training programs for agency<BR>

<P>personnel, including both the conduct of courses in various<BR>

<P>substantive areas (e.g., administrative, information technology)<BR>

<P>and the development of materials that agencies can use in their<BR>

<P>own courses.  The assignment of this responsibility to OPM does<BR>

<P>not affect the responsibility of individual agency heads for<BR>

<P>developing and conducting training programs tailored to the<BR>

<P>specific needs of their own personnel.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>e.  National Archives and Records Administration.  The Archivist<BR>

<P>of the United States through the Office of the Federal Register,<BR>

<P>shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1)  Issue instructions on the format of the agency notices and<BR>

<P>rules required to be published under the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2)  Compile and publish every two years, the rules  promulgated<BR>

<P>under 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) and agency notices published under 5<BR>

<P>U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) in a form available to the public at low cost.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3)  Issue procedures governing the transfer of records to<BR>

<P>Federal Records Centers for storage, processing, and servicing<BR>

<P>pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3103.  For purposes of the Act, such<BR>

<P>records are considered to be maintained by the agency that<BR>

<P>deposited them.  The Archivist may disclose deposited records<BR>

<P>only according to the access rules established by the agency that<BR>

<P>deposited them.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>f.  Office of Management and Budget.  The Director of the <BR>

<P>Office of Management and Budget will:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (1)  Issue guidelines and directives to the agencies to<BR>

<P>implement the Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  (2)  Assist the agencies, at their request, in implementing<BR>

<P>
<P>  a.  Biennial Privacy Act Report.  To provide the necessary<BR>

<P>information for the biennial report of the President, agencies<BR>

<P>shall submit a biennial report to OMB, covering their Privacy Act<BR>

<P>activities for the calendar years covered by the reporting<BR>

<P>period.  The exact format of the report will be established by<BR>

<P>OMB.  At a minimum, however, agencies should collect and be<BR>

<P>prepared to report the following data on a calendar year basis:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  A listing of publication activity during the year<BR>

<P>showing the following:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* Total Number of Systems of Records (Exempt/NonExempt)<BR>

<P>* Number of New Systems of Records Added (Exempt/NonExempt)<BR>

<P>* Number Routine Uses Added<BR>

<P>* Number Exemptions Added to Existing Systems<BR>

<P>* Number Exemptions Deleted from Existing Systems<BR>

<P>* Total Number of Automated Systems of Records (Exempt/NonExempt)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The agency should provide a brief narrative describing those<BR>

<P>activities in detail, e.g., &quot;the Department added a (k)(1)<BR>

<P>exemption to an existing system of records entitled<BR>

<P>&quot;Investigative Records of the Office of Investigations;&quot; or &quot;the<BR>

<P>agency added a new routine use to a system of records entitled<BR>

<P>&quot;Employee Health Records&quot; that would permit disclosure of health<BR>

<P>data to researchers under contract to the agency to perform<BR>

<P>workplace risk analysis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (2)  A brief description of any public comments received on<BR>

<P>agency publication and implementation activities, and agency<BR>

<P>response.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  Number of access and amendment requests from record<BR>

<P>subjects citing the Privacy Act that were received during the<BR>

<P>calendar year of the report.  Also the disposition of requests<BR>

<P>from any year that were completed during the calendar year of the<BR>

<P>report: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*  Total Number of Access Requests<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>Number For Which No Record Found<BR>

<P>*  Total Amendment Requests<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>*  Number of Appeals of Denials of Access<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>Number For Which No Record Found<BR>

<P>*  Number of Appeals of Denials of Amendment<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Whole<BR>

<P>Number Granted in Part<BR>

<P>Number Wholly Denied<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (4)  Number of instances in which individuals brought suit<BR>

<P>under section (g) of the Privacy Act against the agency and the<BR>

<P>results of any such litigation that resulted in a change to<BR>

<P>agency practices or affected guidance issued by OMB.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (5)  Results of any reviews undertaken in response to<BR>

<P>paragraph 3a of this Appendix.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (6)  Description of agency Privacy Act training activities<BR>

<P>conducted in accordance with paragraph 3a(6) of this Appendix.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  b.  Biennial Matching Activity Report (See 5 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>552a(u)(3)(D)).  At the end of each calendar year, the Data<BR>

<P>Integrity Board of each agency that has participated in matches<BR>

<P>covered by the computer matching provisions of the Privacy Act<BR>

<P>will collect data summarizing that year's matching activity.  The<BR>

<P>Act requires that such activity be reported every two years.  OMB<BR>

<P>will establish the exact format of the report, but agencies' Data<BR>

<P>Integrity Boards should be prepared to report the data identified<BR>

<P>below both to the agency head and to OMB.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  A listing of the names and positions of the members of<BR>

<P>the Data Integrity Board and showing separately the name of the<BR>

<P>Board Secretary, his or her agency mailing address, and telephone<BR>

<P>number. Also show and explain any changes in membership or<BR>

<P>structure occurring during the reporting year.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (2)  A listing of each matching program, by title and<BR>

<P>purpose, in which the agency participated during the reporting<BR>

<P>year.  This listing should show names of participant agencies,<BR>

<P>give a brief description of the program, and give a citation<BR>

<P>including the date to the Federal Register notice describing the<BR>

<P>program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  For each matching program, an indication of whether the<BR>

<P>cost/benefit analysis performed resulted in a favorable ratio. <BR>

<P>The Data Integrity Board should explain why the agency proceeded<BR>

<P>with any matching program for which an unfavorable ratio was<BR>

<P>reached. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (4)  For each program for which the Board waived a<BR>

<P>cost/benefit analysis, reasons for the waiver and the results of<BR>

<P>match, if tabulated.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (5)  A description of each matching agreement the Board<BR>

<P>rejected and an explanation of why it was rejected.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (6)  A listing of any violations of matching agreements that<BR>

<P>have been alleged or identified, and a discussion of any action<BR>

<P>taken.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (7)  A discussion of any litigation involving the agency's<BR>

<P>participation in any matching program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (8)  For any litigation based on allegations of inaccurate<BR>

<P>records, an explanation of the steps the agency used to ensure<BR>

<P>the integrity of its data as well as the verification process it<BR>

<P>used in the matching program, including an assessment of the<BR>

<P>adequacy of each.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  c.  New and Altered System of Records Report.  The Act<BR>

<P>requires agencies to publish notices in the Federal Register<BR>

<P>describing new or altered systems of records, and to submit<BR>

<P>reports to OMB, and to the Chair of the Committee on Government<BR>

<P>Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Chair of the<BR>

<P>Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. The reports must<BR>

<P>be transmitted at least 40 days prior to the operation of the new<BR>

<P>system of records or the date on which the alteration to an<BR>

<P>existing system takes place.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  When to Report Altered Systems of Records.  Minor<BR>

<P>changes to systems of records need not be reported.  For example,<BR>

<P>a change in the designation of the system manager due to a<BR>

<P>reorganization would not require a report, so long as an<BR>

<P>individual's ability to gain access to his or her records is not<BR>

<P>affected.  Other examples include changing applicable safeguards<BR>

<P>as a result of a risk analysis or deleting a routine use when<BR>

<P>there is no longer a need for the disclosure.  The following<BR>

<P>changes are those for which a report is required:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  A significant increase in the number of individuals<BR>

<P>about whom records are maintained.  For example, a decision to<BR>

<P>expand a system that originally covered only residents of public<BR>

<P>housing in major cities to cover such residents nationwide would<BR>

<P>require a report.  Increases attributable to normal growth should<BR>

<P>not be reported.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  A change that expands the types or categories of<BR>

<P>information maintained.  For example, a file covering physicians<BR>

<P>that has been expanded to include other types of health care<BR>

<P>providers, e.g., nurses, technicians, etc., would require a<BR>

<P>report.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c)  A change that alters the purpose for which the<BR>

<P>information is used.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (d)  A change to equipment configuration (either hardware<BR>

<P>or software) that creates substantially greater access to the<BR>

<P>records in the system of records.  For example, locating<BR>

<P>interactive terminals at regional offices for accessing a system<BR>

<P>formerly accessible only at the headquarters would require a<BR>

<P>report.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (e)  The addition of an exemption pursuant to Section (j)<BR>

<P>or (k) of the Act.  Note that, in examining a rulemaking for a<BR>

<P>Privacy Act exemption as part of a report of a new or altered<BR>

<P>system of records, OMB will also review the rule under applicable<BR>

<P>regulatory review procedures and agencies need not make a<BR>

<P>separate submission for that purpose.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (f)  The addition of a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>552a(b)(3).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (2)  Reporting Changes to Multiple Systems of Records.  When<BR>

<P>an agency makes a change to an information technology<BR>

<P>installation or a telecommunication network, or makes any other<BR>

<P>general changes in information collection, processing,<BR>

<P>dissemination, or storage that affect multiple systems of<BR>

<P>records, it may submit a single, consolidated report, with<BR>

<P>changes to existing notices and supporting documentation included<BR>

<P>in the submission.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  Contents of the New or Altered System Report.  The<BR>

<P>report for a new or altered system has three elements:  a<BR>

<P>transmittal letter, a narrative statement, and supporting<BR>

<P>documentation that includes a copy of the proposed Federal<BR>

<P>Register notice.  There is no prescribed format for either the<BR>

<P>letter or the narrative statement.  The notice must appear in the<BR>

<P>format prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's<BR>

<P>Document Drafting Handbook.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  Transmittal Letter.  The transmittal letter should<BR>

<P>be signed by the senior agency official responsible for<BR>

<P>implementation of the Act within the agency and should contain<BR>

<P>the name and telephone number of the individual who can best<BR>

<P>answer questions about the system of records.  The letter should<BR>

<P>contain the agency's assurance that the proposed system does not<BR>

<P>duplicate any existing agency or government-wide systems of<BR>

<P>records.  The letter sent to OMB may also include requests for<BR>

<P>waiver of the time period for the review.   The agency should<BR>

<P>indicate why it cannot meet the established review period and<BR>

<P>what will be the consequences of not obtaining the waiver, (see<BR>

<P>paragraph 4e below).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  Narrative Statement.  The narrative statement should<BR>

<P>be brief.  It should make reference, as appropriate, to<BR>

<P>information in the supporting documentation rather than restating<BR>

<P>such information.  The statement should:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          1.  Describe the purpose for which the agency is<BR>

<P>establishing the system of records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          2.  Identify the authority under which the system of<BR>

<P>records is maintained.  The agency should avoid citing<BR>

<P>housekeeping statutes, but rather cite the underlying<BR>

<P>programmatic authority for collecting, maintaining, and using the<BR>

<P>information.  When the system is being operated to support an<BR>

<P>agency housekeeping program, e.g., a carpool locator, the agency<BR>

<P>may, however, cite a general housekeeping statute that authorizes<BR>

<P>the agency head to keep such records as necessary.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          3.  Provide the agency's evaluation of the probable or<BR>

<P>potential effect of the proposal on the privacy of individuals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          4.  Provide a brief description of the steps taken by<BR>

<P>the agency to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the<BR>

<P>system of records.  A more detailed assessment of the risks and<BR>

<P>specific administrative, technical, procedural, and physical<BR>

<P>safeguards established shall be made available to OMB upon<BR>

<P>request.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          5.  Explain how each proposed routine use satisfies the<BR>

<P>compatibility requirement of subsection (a)(7) of the Act.  For<BR>

<P>altered systems, this requirement pertains only to any newly<BR>

<P>proposed routine use.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          6.  Provide OMB Control Numbers, expiration dates, and<BR>

<P>titles of any OMB approved information collection requests (e.g.,<BR>

<P>forms, surveys, etc.) contained in the system of records.  If the<BR>

<P>request for OMB clearance of an information collection is<BR>

<P>pending, the agency may simply state the title of the collection<BR>

<P>and the date it was submitted for OMB clearance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c)  Supporting Documentation.  Attach the following to<BR>

<P>all new or altered system of records reports:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          1.  A copy of the new or altered system of records<BR>

<P>notice in Federal Register format, consistent with the provisions<BR>

<P>of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). For proposed altered systems the agency<BR>

<P>should supply a copy of the original system of records notice to<BR>

<P>ensure that reviewers can understand the changes proposed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          2.  A copy in Federal Register format of any new<BR>

<P>exemption rules or changes to published rules (consistent with<BR>

<P>the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(f),(j), or (k)) that the agency<BR>

<P>proposes to issue for the new or altered system.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (4)  OMB Concurrence.  Agencies may assume that OMB concurs<BR>

<P>in the Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not<BR>

<P>commented within 40 days from the date the transmittal letter was<BR>

<P>signed.  Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted<BR>

<P>expeditiously after they are signed.  Agencies may publish system<BR>

<P>of records and routine use notices as well as proposed exemption<BR>

<P>rules in the Federal Register at the same time that they send the<BR>

<P>new or altered system report to OMB and Congress.  The period for<BR>

<P>OMB and congressional review and the notice and comment period<BR>

<P>for routine uses and exemptions will then run concurrently.  Note<BR>

<P>that exemptions must be published as final rules before they are<BR>

<P>effective.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  d.  New or Altered Matching Program Report.  The Act requires<BR>

<P>agencies to publish notices in the Federal Register describing<BR>

<P>new or altered matching programs, and to submit reports to OMB,<BR>

<P>and to Congress.  The report must be received at least 40 days<BR>

<P>prior to the initiation of any matching activity carried out<BR>

<P>under a new or substantially altered matching program.  For<BR>

<P>renewals of continuing programs, the report must be dated at<BR>

<P>least 40 days prior to the expiration of any existing matching<BR>

<P>agreement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  When to Report Altered Matching Programs.  Agencies<BR>

<P>need not report minor changes to matching programs.  The term<BR>

<P>&quot;minor change to a matching program&quot; means a change that does not<BR>

<P>significantly alter the terms of the agreement under which the<BR>

<P>program is being carried out.  Examples of significant changes<BR>

<P>include: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  Changing the purpose for which the program was<BR>

<P>established.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  Changing the matching population, either by<BR>

<P>including new categories of record subjects or by greatly<BR>

<P>increasing the numbers of records matched.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c)  Changing the legal authority covering the matching<BR>

<P>program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (d)  Changing the source or recipient agencies involved<BR>

<P>in the matching program.<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>     (2) Contents of New or Altered Matching Program Report.  <BR>

<P>The report for a new or altered matching program has three<BR>

<P>elements:  a transmittal letter, a narrative statement, and<BR>

<P>supporting documentation that includes a copy of the proposed<BR>

<P>Federal Register notice.  There is no prescribed format for<BR>

<P>either the letter or the narrative statement.  The notice must<BR>

<P>appear in the format prescribed by the Office of the Federal<BR>

<P>Register's Document Drafting Handbook.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  Transmittal Letter.  The transmittal letter should<BR>

<P>be signed by the senior agency official responsible for<BR>

<P>implementation of the Privacy Act within the agency and should<BR>

<P>contain the name and telephone number of the individual who can<BR>

<P>best answer questions about the matching program.  The letter<BR>

<P>should state that a copy of the matching agreement has been<BR>

<P>distributed to Congress as the Act requires.  The letter to OMB<BR>

<P>may also include a request for waiver of the review time period.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  Narrative Statement.  The narrative statement should<BR>

<P>be brief.  It should make reference, as appropriate, to<BR>

<P>information in the supporting documentation rather than restating<BR>

<P>such information.  The statement should provide:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          1.  A description of the purpose of the matching<BR>

<P>program and the authority under which it is being carried out.<BR>

<P>     <BR>

<P>          2.  A description of the security safeguards used to<BR>

<P>protect against any unauthorized access or disclosure of records<BR>

<P>used in the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          3.  If the cost/benefit analysis required by Section<BR>

<P>(u)(4)(A) indicated an unfavorable ratio or was waived pursuant<BR>

<P>to OMB guidance, an explanation of the basis on which the agency<BR>

<P>justifies conducting the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c) Supporting Documentation.  Attach the following:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          1.  A copy of the Federal Register notice describing<BR>

<P>the matching program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>          2.  For the Congressional report only, a copy of the<BR>

<P>matching agreement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  OMB Concurrence.  Agencies may assume that OMB concurs<BR>

<P>in the Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not<BR>

<P>commented within 40 days from the date the transmittal letter was<BR>

<P>signed.  Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted<BR>

<P>expeditiously after they are signed. Agencies may publish<BR>

<P>matching program notices in the Federal Register at the same time<BR>

<P>that they send the matching program report to OMB and Congress. <BR>

<P>The period for OMB and congressional review and the notice and<BR>

<P>comment period will then run concurrently.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  e.  Expediting the Review Process.  The Director, OMB, may<BR>

<P>grant a waiver of the 40-day review period for either systems of<BR>

<P>records or matching program reviews.  The agency must ask for the<BR>

<P>waiver in the transmittal letter and demonstrate compelling<BR>

<P>reasons.  When a waiver is granted, the agency is not thereby<BR>

<P>relieved of any other requirement of the Act.  If no waiver is<BR>

<P>granted, agencies may presume concurrence at the expiration of<BR>

<P>the 40 day review period.  Note that OMB cannot waive time<BR>

<P>periods specifically established by the Act such as the 30 days<BR>

<P>notice and comment period required for the adoption of a routine<BR>

<P>use proposal pursuant to Section (b)(3) of the Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Publication Requirements.  The Privacy Act requires agencies<BR>

<P>to publish notices or rules in the Federal Register in the<BR>

<P>following circumstances:  when adopting a new or altered system<BR>

<P>of records, when adopting a routine use or exemption for a system<BR>

<P>of records, or when proposing to carry out a new or altered<BR>

<P>matching program.  (See paragraph 4c(1) and 4d(1) above on what<BR>

<P>constitutes a reportable alteration.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  a.  Publishing New or Altered Systems of Records Notices and<BR>

<P>Exemption Rules.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  Who Publishes.  The agency responsible for operating<BR>

<P>the system of records makes the necessary publication. <BR>

<P>Publication should be carried out at the departmental or agency<BR>

<P>level.  Where a system of records is to be operated exclusively<BR>

<P>by a component, the department rather than the component should<BR>

<P>publish the notice.  Thus, for example, the Department of the<BR>

<P>Treasury would publish a system of records notice covering a<BR>

<P>system operated exclusively by the Internal Revenue Service. <BR>

<P>Note that if the agency is proposing to exempt the system under<BR>

<P>Section (j) or (k) of the Act, it must publish a rule in addition<BR>

<P>to the system of records notice.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  Government-wide Systems of Records.  Certain<BR>

<P>agencies publish systems of records containing records for which<BR>

<P>they have government-wide responsibilities.  The records may be<BR>

<P>located in other agencies, but they are being used under the<BR>

<P>authority of and in conformance with the rules mandated by the<BR>

<P>publishing agency.  The Office of Personnel Management, for<BR>

<P>example, has published a number of government-wide systems of<BR>

<P>records relating to the operation of the government's personnel<BR>

<P>program.  Agencies should not publish systems of records that<BR>

<P>wholly or partly duplicate existing government-wide systems of<BR>

<P>records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  Section (m) Contract Provisions.  When an agency<BR>

<P>provides by contract for the operation of a system of records, it<BR>

<P>should ensure that a system of records notice describing the<BR>

<P>system has been published.  It should also review the notice to<BR>

<P>ensure that it contains a routine use under Section (e)(4)(D) of<BR>

<P>the Act permitting disclosure to the contractor and his or her<BR>

<P>personnel.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (2)  When to Publish. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  System Notice.  It must appear in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register before the agency begins to operate the system, e.g.,<BR>

<P>collect and use the information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (b)  Routine Use.  Must be published in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register 30 days before agency discloses records pursuant to its<BR>

<P>terms.  If the sole change to an existing system of records is to<BR>

<P>add a routine use, the agency should either republish the entire<BR>

<P>system of records notice, a condensed description of the system<BR>

<P>of records, or a citation to the last full text Federal Register<BR>

<P>publication.  (Note that the addition of a routine use to an<BR>

<P>existing system of records requires a report to OMB and Congress,<BR>

<P>and that the review period for this report is 40 days.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c)  Exemption Rule.  Must be established through<BR>

<P>informal rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. <BR>

<P>This process generally requires publication of a proposed rule, a<BR>

<P>period during which the public may comment, publication of a<BR>

<P>final rule, and the adoption of the final rule.  Agencies may not<BR>

<P>withhold records under an exemption until these requirements have<BR>

<P>been met. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  Format.  Agencies should follow the publication format<BR>

<P>contained in the Office of the Federal Register's Document<BR>

<P>Drafting Handbook obtainable from the Government Printing Office.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  b.  Publishing Matching Notices.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (1)  Who Publishes.  Generally, the Recipient Federal agency<BR>

<P>(or the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a<BR>

<P>nonfederal agency) is responsible for publishing in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register a notice describing the new or altered matching program. <BR>

<P>However, in large, multi-agency matching programs, where the<BR>

<P>recipient agency is merely performing the matches, and the<BR>

<P>benefit accrues to the source agencies, the partners should<BR>

<P>assign responsibility for compliance with the administrative<BR>

<P>requirements in a fair and reasonable way.  This may mean having<BR>

<P>the matching agency carry out these requirements for all parties,<BR>

<P>having one participant designated to do so, or having each source<BR>

<P>so for its own matching program(s). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (2)  Timing.  Publication must occur at least 30 days prior<BR>

<P>to the initiation of any matching activity carried out under a<BR>

<P>new or substantially altered matching program.  For renewals of<BR>

<P>programs agencies wish to continue past the 30 month period of<BR>

<P>initial eligibility (i.e., the initial 18 months plus a 1 year<BR>

<P>extension), publication must occur at least 30 days prior to the<BR>

<P>expiration of the existing matching agreement.  (But note that a<BR>

<P>report to OMB and the Congress is also required with a 40 day<BR>

<P>review period).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (3)  Format.  The matching notice shall be in the format<BR>

<P>prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's Document<BR>

<P>Drafting Handbook and contain the following information:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (a)  The name of the Recipient Agency.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>       (b)  The Name(s) of the Source Agencies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (c)  The beginning and ending dates of the match.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (d)  A brief description of the matching program,<BR>

<P>including its purpose; the legal authorities authorizing its<BR>

<P>operation;  categories of individuals involved; and<BR>

<P>identification of records used, including name(s) of Privacy Act<BR>

<P>Systems of  records.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>       (e)  The identification, address, and telephone number of<BR>

<P>a Recipient Agency official who will answer public inquiries<BR>

<P>about the program.<BR>

<P>
<P>Appendix IV to OMB Circular No. A-130 - Analysis of Key Sections<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Purpose<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a general context and<BR>

<P>explanation for the contents of the key Sections of the Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Background<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 94<BR>

<P>Stat. 2812, codified at Chapter 35 of Title 44 of the United<BR>

<P>States Code, establishes a broad mandate for agencies to perform<BR>

<P>their information activities in an efficient, effective, and<BR>

<P>economical manner.  Section 3504 of the Act provides authority to<BR>

<P>the Director, OMB, to develop and implement uniform and<BR>

<P>consistent information resources management policies; oversee the<BR>

<P>development and promote the use of information management<BR>

<P>principles, standards, and guidelines; evaluate agency<BR>

<P>information management practices in order to determine their<BR>

<P>adequacy and efficiency, and determine compliance of such<BR>

<P>practices with the policies, principles, standards, and<BR>

<P>guidelines promulgated by the Director.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> The Circular implements OMB authority under the Act with respect<BR>

<P>to Section 3504(b), general information policy, Section 3504(e),<BR>

<P>records management, Section 3504(f), privacy, and Section<BR>

<P>3504(g), Federal automatic data processing and<BR>

<P>telecommunications; the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a); the<BR>

<P>Chief Financial Officers Act (31 U.S.C. 3512 et seq.); Sections<BR>

<P>111 and 206 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services<BR>

<P>Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 759 and 487, respectively);<BR>

<P>the Computer Security Act (40 U.S.C. 759 note); the Budget and<BR>

<P>Accounting Act of 1921 (31 U.S.C. 1 et seq.); and Executive Order<BR>

<P>No. 12046 of March 27, 1978, and Executive Order No. 12472 of<BR>

<P>April 3, 1984, Assignment of National Security and Emergency<BR>

<P>Telecommunications Functions.  The Circular complements 5 CFR<BR>

<P>Part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public, which<BR>

<P>implements other Sections of the PRA dealing with controlling the<BR>

<P>reporting and recordkeeping burden placed on the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> In addition, the Circular revises and consolidates policy and<BR>

<P>procedures in seven previous OMB directives and rescinds those<BR>

<P>directives, as follows:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-3   - Government Publications<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-71  - Responsibilities for the Administration and Management of<BR>

<P>Automatic Data Processing Activities Transmittal Memorandum No. 1<BR>

<P>to Circular No. A-71 - Security of Federal Automated Information<BR>

<P>Systems <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-90  - Cooperating with State and Local Governments to<BR>

<P>Coordinate and Improve Information Systems<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-108 - Responsibilities for the Maintenance of Records about<BR>

<P>Individuals by Federal Agencies<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-114 - Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A-121 - Cost Accounting, Cost Recovery, and Interagency Sharing<BR>

<P>of Data Processing Facilities <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3. Analysis<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6, Definitions.  Access and Dissemination.  The original<BR>

<P>Circular No. A-130 distinguished between the terms &quot;access to<BR>

<P>information&quot; and &quot;dissemination of information&quot; in order to<BR>

<P>separate statutory requirements from policy considerations.  The<BR>

<P>first term means giving members of the public, at their request,<BR>

<P>information to which they are entitled by a law such as the FOIA. <BR>

<P>The latter means actively distributing information to the public<BR>

<P>at the initiative of the agency.  The distinction appeared useful<BR>

<P>at the time Circular No. A-130 was written, because it allowed<BR>

<P>OMB to focus discussion on Federal agencies' responsibilities for<BR>

<P>actively distributing information.  However, popular usage and<BR>

<P>evolving technology have blurred differences between the terms<BR>

<P>&quot;access&quot; and &quot;dissemination&quot; and readers of the Circular were<BR>

<P>confused by the distinction.  For example, if an agency<BR>

<P>&quot;disseminates&quot; information via an on-line computer system, one<BR>

<P>speaks of permitting users to &quot;access&quot; the information, and<BR>

<P>on-line &quot;access&quot; becomes a form of &quot;dissemination.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Thus, the revision defines only the term &quot;dissemination.&quot; <BR>

<P>Special considerations based on access statutes such as the<BR>

<P>Privacy Act and the FOIA are explained in context.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Government Information.  The definition of &quot;government<BR>

<P>information&quot; includes information created, collected, processed,<BR>

<P>disseminated, or disposed of both by and for the Federal<BR>

<P>Government.  This recognizes the increasingly distributed nature<BR>

<P>of information in electronic environments.  Many agencies, in<BR>

<P>addition to collecting information for government use and for<BR>

<P>dissemination to the public, require members of the public to<BR>

<P>maintain information or to disclose it to the public.  Sound<BR>

<P>information resources management dictates that agencies consider<BR>

<P>the costs and benefits of a full range of alternatives to meet<BR>

<P>government objectives.  In some cases, there is no need for the<BR>

<P>government actually to collect the information itself, only to<BR>

<P>assure that it is made publicly available.  For example, banks<BR>

<P>insured by the FDIC must provide statements of financial<BR>

<P>condition to bank customers on request.  Particularly when<BR>

<P>information is available in electronic form, networks make the<BR>

<P>physical location of information increasingly irrelevant.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The inclusion of information created, collected, processed,<BR>

<P>disseminated, or disposed of for the Federal Government in the<BR>

<P>definition of &quot;government information&quot; does not imply that<BR>

<P>responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Circular<BR>

<P>itself extends beyond the executive agencies to other entities. <BR>

<P>Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with Section 4,<BR>

<P>Applicability, and with existing law.  For example, the courts<BR>

<P>have held that requests to Federal agencies for release of<BR>

<P>information under the FOIA do not always extend to those<BR>

<P>performing information activities under grant or contract to a<BR>

<P>Federal agency.  Similarly, grantees may copyright information<BR>

<P>where the government may not.  Thus the information<BR>

<P>responsibilities of grantees and contractors are not identical to<BR>

<P>those of Federal agencies except to the extent that the agencies<BR>

<P>make them so in the underlying grants or contracts.  Similarly,<BR>

<P>agency information resources management responsibilities do not<BR>

<P>extend to other entities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information Dissemination Product.  This notice defines the term<BR>

<P>&quot;information dissemination product&quot; to include all information<BR>

<P>that is disseminated by Federal agencies.  While the provision of<BR>

<P>access to on-line databases and search software included on<BR>

<P>compact disk, read-only memory (CD-ROM) are often called<BR>

<P>information services rather than products, there is no clear<BR>

<P>distinction and, moreover, no real difference for policy purposes<BR>

<P>between the two.  Thus, the term &quot;information dissemination<BR>

<P>product&quot; applies to both products and services, and makes no<BR>

<P>distinction based on how the information is delivered.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(1).  Information Management Planning.  Parallel to new<BR>

<P>Section 7, Basic Considerations and Assumptions, Section 8a<BR>

<P>begins with information resources management planning.  Planning<BR>

<P>is the process of establishing a course of action to achieve<BR>

<P>desired results with available resources.  Planners translate<BR>

<P>organizational missions into specific goals and, in turn, into<BR>

<P>measurable objectives.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The PRA introduced the concept of information resources<BR>

<P>management and the principle of information as an institutional<BR>

<P>resource which has both value and associated costs.  Information<BR>

<P>resources management is a tool that managers use to achieve<BR>

<P>agency objectives.  Information resources management is<BR>

<P>successful if it enables managers to achieve agency objectives<BR>

<P>efficiently and effectively.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information resources management planning is an integral part of<BR>

<P>overall mission planning.  Agencies need to plan from the outset<BR>

<P>for the steps in the information life cycle.  When creating or<BR>

<P>collecting information, agencies must plan how they will process<BR>

<P>and transmit the information, how they will use it, how they will<BR>

<P>protect its integrity, what provisions they will make for access<BR>

<P>to it, whether and how they will disseminate it, how they will<BR>

<P>store and retrieve it, and finally, how the information will<BR>

<P>ultimately be disposed of.  They must also plan for the effects<BR>

<P>their actions and programs will have on the public and State and<BR>

<P>local governments.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Role of State and Local Governments.  OMB made additions at<BR>

<P>Sections 7a, 7e, and 7j, Basic Considerations and Assumptions,<BR>

<P>concerning State and local governments, and also in policy<BR>

<P>statements at Sections 8a(1)(c), (3)(f), (5)(d)(iii), and (8)(e).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State and local governments, and tribal governments, cooperate as<BR>

<P>major partners with the Federal Government in the collection,<BR>

<P>processing, and dissemination of information.  For example, State<BR>

<P>governments are the principal collectors and/or producers of<BR>

<P>information in the areas of health, welfare, education, labor<BR>

<P>markets, transportation, the environment, and criminal justice. <BR>

<P>The States supply the Federal Government with data on aid to<BR>

<P>families with dependent children; medicare; school enrollments,<BR>

<P>staffing, and financing; statistics on births, deaths, and<BR>

<P>infectious diseases; population related data that form the basis<BR>

<P>for national estimates; employment and labor market data; and<BR>

<P>data used for census geography.  National information resources<BR>

<P>are greatly enhanced through these major cooperating efforts.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal agencies need to be sensitive to the role of State and<BR>

<P>local governments, and tribal governments, in managing<BR>

<P>information and in managing information technology.  When<BR>

<P>planning, designing, and carrying out information collections,<BR>

<P>agencies should systematically consider what effect their<BR>

<P>activities will have on cities, counties, and States, and take<BR>

<P>steps to involve these governments as appropriate.  Agencies<BR>

<P>should ensure that their information collections impose the<BR>

<P>minimum burden and do not duplicate or conflict with local<BR>

<P>efforts or other Federal agency requirements or mandates.  The<BR>

<P>goal is that Federal agencies routinely integrate State and local<BR>

<P>government concerns into Federal information resources management<BR>

<P>practices.  This goal is consistent with standards for State and<BR>

<P>local government review of Federal policies and programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Training.  Training is particularly important in view of the<BR>

<P>changing nature of information resources management. <BR>

<P>Decentralization of information technology has placed the<BR>

<P>management of automated information and information technology<BR>

<P>directly in the hands of nearly all agency personnel rather than<BR>

<P>in the hands of a few employees at centralized facilities. <BR>

<P>Agencies must plan for incorporating policies and procedures<BR>

<P>regarding computer security, records management, protection of<BR>

<P>privacy, and other safeguards into the training of every employee<BR>

<P>and contractor.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(2).  Information Collection.  The PRA requires that<BR>

<P>the creation or collection of information be carried out in an<BR>

<P>efficient, effective, and economical manner.  When Federal<BR>

<P>agencies create or collect information -- just as when they<BR>

<P>perform any other program functions -- they consume scarce<BR>

<P>resources.  Such activities must be continually evaluated for<BR>

<P>their relevance to agency missions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies must justify the creation or collection of information<BR>

<P>based on their statutory functions.  Policy statement 8a(2) uses<BR>

<P>the justification standard -- &quot;necessary for the proper<BR>

<P>performance of the functions of the agency&quot; -- established by the<BR>

<P>PRA (44 U.S.C. 3504(c)(2)).  Furthermore, the policy statement<BR>

<P>includes the requirement that the information have practical<BR>

<P>utility, as defined in the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3502(16)) and<BR>

<P>elaborated in 5 CFR Part 1320.  Practical utility includes such<BR>

<P>qualities of information as accuracy, adequacy, and reliability. <BR>

<P>In the case of general purpose statistics or recordkeeping,<BR>

<P>practical utility means that actual uses can be demonstrated (5<BR>

<P>CFR 1320.7(o)).  It should be noted that OMB's intent in placing<BR>

<P>emphasis on reducing unjustified burden in collecting<BR>

<P>information, an emphasis consistent with the Act, is not to<BR>

<P>diminish the importance of collecting information whenever<BR>

<P>agencies have legitimate program reasons for doing so.  Rather,<BR>

<P>the concern is that the burdens imposed should not exceed the<BR>

<P>benefits to be derived from the information.  Moreover, if the<BR>

<P>same benefit can be obtained by alternative means that impose a<BR>

<P>lesser burden, that alternative should be adopted.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(3).  Electronic Information Collection.  Section 7l<BR>

<P>articulates a basic assumption of the Circular that modern<BR>

<P>information technology can help the government provide better<BR>

<P>service to the public through improved management of government<BR>

<P>programs.  One potentially useful application of information<BR>

<P>technology is in the government's collection of information.<BR>

<P>While some information collections may not be good candidates for<BR>

<P>electronic techniques, many are.  Agencies with major electronic<BR>

<P>information collection programs have found that automated<BR>

<P>information collections allow them to meet program objectives<BR>

<P>more efficiently and effectively.  Electronic data interchange<BR>

<P>(EDI) and related standards for the electronic exchange of<BR>

<P>information will ease transmission and processing of routine<BR>

<P>business transaction information such as invoices, purchase<BR>

<P>orders, price information, bills of lading, health insurance<BR>

<P>claims, and other common commercial documents.  EDI holds similar<BR>

<P>promise for the routine filing of regulatory information such as<BR>

<P>tariffs, customs declarations, license applications, tax<BR>

<P>information, and environmental reports.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Benefits to the public and agencies from electronic information<BR>

<P>collection appear substantial.  Electronic methods of collection<BR>

<P>reduce paperwork burden, reduce errors, facilitate validation,<BR>

<P>and provide increased convenience and more timely receipt of<BR>

<P>benefits. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The policy in Section 8a(3) encourages agencies to explore the<BR>

<P>use of automated techniques for collection of information, and<BR>

<P>sets forth conditions conducive to the use of those techniques.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(4).  Records Management.  Section 8a(4) begins with<BR>

<P>the fundamental requirement for Federal records management,<BR>

<P>namely, that agencies create and keep adequate and proper<BR>

<P>documentation of their activities.  Federal agencies cannot carry<BR>

<P>out their missions in a responsible and responsive manner without<BR>

<P>adequate recordkeeping.  Section 7h articulates the basic<BR>

<P>considerations concerning records management.  Policy statements<BR>

<P>concerning records management are also interwoven throughout<BR>

<P>Section 8a, particularly in subsections on planning (8a(1)(j)),<BR>

<P>information dissemination (8a(6)), and safeguards (8a(9)).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Records support the immediate needs of government --<BR>

<P>administrative, legal, fiscal -- and ensure its continuity.<BR>

<P>Records are essential for protecting the rights and interests of<BR>

<P>the public, and for monitoring the work of public servants.  The<BR>

<P>government needs records to ensure accountability to the public<BR>

<P>which includes making the information available to the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Each stage of the information life cycle carries with it records<BR>

<P>management responsibilities.  Agencies need to record their<BR>

<P>plans, carefully document the content and procedures of<BR>

<P>information collection, ensure proper documentation as a feature<BR>

<P>of every information system, keep records of dissemination<BR>

<P>programs, and, finally, ensure that records of permanent value<BR>

<P>are preserved.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Preserving records for future generations is the archival<BR>

<P>mission.  Advances in technology affect the amount of information<BR>

<P>that can be created and saved, and the ways this information can<BR>

<P>be made available.  Technological advances can ease the task of<BR>

<P>records management; however, the rapid pace of change in modern<BR>

<P>technology makes decisions about the appropriate application of<BR>

<P>technology critical to records management.  Increasingly the<BR>

<P>records manager must be concerned with preserving valuable<BR>

<P>electronic records in the context of a constantly changing<BR>

<P>technological environment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Records schedules are essential for the appropriate maintenance<BR>

<P>and disposition of records.  Records schedules must be prepared<BR>

<P>in a timely fashion, implement the General Records Schedules<BR>

<P>issued by the National Archives and Records Administration, be<BR>

<P>approved by the Archivist of the United States, and be kept<BR>

<P>accurate and current.  (See 44 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.)  The National<BR>

<P>Archives and Records Administration and the General Services<BR>

<P>Administration provide guidance and assistance to agencies in<BR>

<P>implementing records management responsibilities. They also<BR>

<P>evaluate agencies' records management programs to determine the<BR>

<P>extent to which they are appropriately implementing their records<BR>

<P>management responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Sections 8a(5) and 8a(6).  Information Dissemination Policy.<BR>

<P>Section 8a(5).  Every agency has a responsibility to inform the<BR>

<P>public within the context of its mission.  This responsibility<BR>

<P>requires that agencies distribute information at the agency's<BR>

<P>initiative, rather than merely responding when the public<BR>

<P>requests information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The FOIA requires each agency to publish in the Federal Register<BR>

<P>current descriptions of agency organization, where and how the<BR>

<P>public may obtain information, the general methods and procedural<BR>

<P>requirements by which agency functions are determined, rules of<BR>

<P>procedure, descriptions of forms and how to obtain them,<BR>

<P>substantive regulations, statements of general policy, and<BR>

<P>revisions to all the foregoing (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)).  The Privacy<BR>

<P>Act also requires publication of information concerning &quot;systems<BR>

<P>of records&quot; which are records retrieved by individual identifier<BR>

<P>such as name, Social Security Number, or fingerprint.  The<BR>

<P>Government in the Sunshine Act requires agencies to publish<BR>

<P>meeting announcements (5 U.S.C. 552b (e)(1)).  The PRA (44 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>3507(a)(2)) and its implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320)<BR>

<P>require agencies to publish notices when they submit information<BR>

<P>collection requests for OMB approval.  The public's right of<BR>

<P>access to government information under these statutes is balanced<BR>

<P>against other concerns, such as an individual's right to privacy<BR>

<P>and protection of the government's deliberative process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As agencies satisfy these requirements, they provide the public<BR>

<P>basic information about government activities.  Other statutes<BR>

<P>direct specific agencies to issue specific information<BR>

<P>dissemination products or to conduct information dissemination<BR>

<P>programs.  Beyond generic and specific statutory requirements,<BR>

<P>agencies have responsibilities to disseminate information as a<BR>

<P>necessary part of performing their functions.  For some agencies<BR>

<P>the responsibility is made explicit and sweeping; for example,<BR>

<P>the Agriculture Department is directed to &quot;...diffuse among<BR>

<P>people of the United States, useful information on subjects<BR>

<P>connected with agriculture....&quot;  (7 U.S.C. 2201)  For other<BR>

<P>agencies, the responsibility may be much more narrowly drawn.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information dissemination is also a consequence of other agency<BR>

<P>activities.  Agency programs normally include an organized effort<BR>

<P>to inform the public about the program.  Most agencies carry out<BR>

<P>programs that create or collect information with the explicit or<BR>

<P>implicit intent that the information will be made public. <BR>

<P>Disseminating information is in many cases the logical extension<BR>

<P>of information creation or collection.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In other cases, agencies may have information that is not meant<BR>

<P>for public dissemination but which may be the subject of requests<BR>

<P>from the public.  When the agency establishes that there is<BR>

<P>public demand for the information and that it is in the public<BR>

<P>interest to disseminate the information, the agency may decide to<BR>

<P>disseminate it automatically.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The policy in Section 8a(5)(d) sets forth several factors for<BR>

<P>agencies to take into account in conducting their information<BR>

<P>dissemination programs.  First, agencies must balance two goals: <BR>

<P>maximizing the usefulness of the information to the government<BR>

<P>and the public, and minimizing the cost to both.  Deriving from<BR>

<P>the basic purposes of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501), the two goals are<BR>

<P>frequently in tension because increasing usefulness usually costs<BR>

<P>more.  Second, Section 8a(5)(d)(ii) requires agencies to conduct<BR>

<P>information dissemination programs equitably and in a timely<BR>

<P>manner.  The word &quot;equal&quot; was removed from this Section since<BR>

<P>there may be instances where, for example, an agency determines<BR>

<P>that its mission includes disseminating information to certain<BR>

<P>specific groups or members of the public, and the agency<BR>

<P>determines that user charges will constitute a significant<BR>

<P>barrier to carrying out this responsibility.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(5)(d)(iii), requiring agencies to take advantage of<BR>

<P>all dissemination channels, recognizes that information reaches<BR>

<P>the public in many ways.  Few persons may read a Federal Register<BR>

<P>notice describing an agency action, but those few may be major<BR>

<P>secondary disseminators of the information.  They may be<BR>

<P>affiliated with publishers of newspapers, newsletters,<BR>

<P>periodicals, or books; affiliated with on-line database<BR>

<P>providers; or specialists in certain information fields.  While<BR>

<P>millions of information users in the public may be affected by<BR>

<P>the agency's action, only a handful may have direct contact with<BR>

<P>the agency's own information dissemination products.  As a<BR>

<P>deliberate strategy, therefore, agencies should cooperate with<BR>

<P>the information's original creators, as well as with secondary<BR>

<P>disseminators, in order to further information dissemination<BR>

<P>goals and foster a diversity of information sources.  An adjunct<BR>

<P>responsibility to this strategy is reflected in Section<BR>

<P>8a(5)(d)(iv), which directs agencies to assist the public in<BR>

<P>finding government information.  Agencies may accomplish this,<BR>

<P>for example, by specifying and disseminating &quot;locator&quot;<BR>

<P>information, including information about content, format, uses<BR>

<P>and limitations, location, and means of access.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6).  Information Dissemination Management System. <BR>

<P>This Section requires agencies to maintain an information<BR>

<P>dissemination management system which can ensure the routine<BR>

<P>performance of certain functions, including the essential<BR>

<P>functions previously required by Circular No. A-3.  Smaller<BR>

<P>agencies need not establish elaborate formal systems, so long as<BR>

<P>the heads of the agencies can ensure that the functions are being<BR>

<P>performed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection (6)(a) carries over a requirement from OMB Circular<BR>

<P>No. A-3 that agencies' information dissemination products are to<BR>

<P>be, in the words of 44 U.S.C. 1108, &quot;necessary in the transaction<BR>

<P>of the public business required by law of the agency.&quot;  (Circular<BR>

<P>No. A-130 uses the expression &quot;necessary for the proper<BR>

<P>performance of agency functions,&quot; which OMB considers to be<BR>

<P>equivalent to the expression in 44 U.S.C. 1108.)  The point is<BR>

<P>that agencies should determine systematically the need for each<BR>

<P>information dissemination product.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6)(b) recognizes that to carry out effective<BR>

<P>information dissemination programs, agencies need knowledge of<BR>

<P>the marketplace in which their information dissemination products<BR>

<P>are placed.  They need to know what other information<BR>

<P>dissemination products users have available in order to design<BR>

<P>the best agency product.  As agencies are constrained by finite<BR>

<P>budgets, when there are several alternatives from which to<BR>

<P>choose, they should not expend public resources filling needs<BR>

<P>which have already been met by others in the public or private<BR>

<P>sector.  Agencies have a responsibility not to undermine the<BR>

<P>existing diversity of information sources.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At the same time, an agency's responsibility to inform the public<BR>

<P>may be independent of the availability or potential availability<BR>

<P>of a similar information dissemination product.  That is, even<BR>

<P>when another governmental or private entity has offered an<BR>

<P>information dissemination product identical or similar to what<BR>

<P>the agency would produce, the agency may conclude that it<BR>

<P>nonetheless has a responsibility to disseminate its own product. <BR>

<P>Agencies should minimize such instances of duplication but could<BR>

<P>reach such a conclusion because legal considerations require an<BR>

<P>official government information dissemination product.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(6)(c) makes the Circular consistent with current<BR>

<P>practice (See OMB Bulletins 88-15, 89-15, 90-09, and 91-16), by<BR>

<P>requiring agencies to establish and maintain inventories of<BR>

<P>information dissemination products.  (These bulletins eliminated<BR>

<P>annual reporting to OMB of title-by-title listings of<BR>

<P>publications and the requirement for agencies to obtain OMB<BR>

<P>approval for each new periodical.  Publications are now reviewed<BR>

<P>as necessary during the normal budget review process.) <BR>

<P>Inventories help other agencies and the public identify<BR>

<P>information which is available.  This serves both to increase the<BR>

<P>efficiency of the dissemination function and to avoid unnecessary<BR>

<P>burdens of duplicative information collections.  A corollary,<BR>

<P>enunciated in Section 8a(6)(d), is that agencies can better serve<BR>

<P>public information needs by developing finding aids for locating<BR>

<P>information produced by the agencies.  Finally, Section 8a(6)(f)<BR>

<P>recognizes that there will be situations where agencies may have<BR>

<P>to take appropriate steps to ensure that members of the public<BR>

<P>with disabilities whom the agency has a responsibility to inform<BR>

<P>have a reasonable ability to access the information dissemination<BR>

<P>products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Depository Library Program.  Sections 8a(6)(g) and (h) pertain to<BR>

<P>the Federal Depository Library Program.  Agencies are to<BR>

<P>establish procedures to ensure compliance with 44 U.S.C. 1902,<BR>

<P>which requires that government publications (defined in 44 U.S.C.<BR>

<P>1901 and repeated in Section 6 of the Circular) be made available<BR>

<P>to depository libraries through the Government Printing Office<BR>

<P>(GPO).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Depository libraries are major partners with the Federal<BR>

<P>Government in the dissemination of information and contribute<BR>

<P>significantly to the diversity of information sources available<BR>

<P>to the public.  They provide a mechanism for wide distribution of<BR>

<P>government information that guarantees basic availability to the<BR>

<P>public.  Executive branch agencies support the depository library<BR>

<P>program both as a matter of law and on its merits as a means of<BR>

<P>informing the public about the government.  On the other hand,<BR>

<P>the law places the administration of depository libraries with<BR>

<P>GPO.  Agency responsibility for the depository libraries is<BR>

<P>limited to supplying government publications through GPO.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies can improve their performance in providing government<BR>

<P>publications as well as electronic information dissemination<BR>

<P>products to the depository library program.  For example, the<BR>

<P>proliferation of &quot;desktop publishing&quot; technology in recent years<BR>

<P>has afforded the opportunity for many agencies to produce their<BR>

<P>own printed documents.  Many such documents may properly belong<BR>

<P>in the depository libraries but are not sent because they are not<BR>

<P>printed at GPO.  The policy requires agencies to establish<BR>

<P>management controls to ensure that the appropriate documents<BR>

<P>reach the GPO for inclusion in the depository library program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At present, few agencies provide electronic information<BR>

<P>dissemination products to the depository libraries.  At the same<BR>

<P>time, a small but growing number of information dissemination<BR>

<P>products are disseminated only in electronic format.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB believes that, as a matter of policy,  electronic information<BR>

<P>dissemination products generally should be provided to the<BR>

<P>depository libraries.  Given that production and supply of<BR>

<P>information dissemination products to the depository libraries is<BR>

<P>primarily the responsibility of GPO, agencies should provide<BR>

<P>appropriate electronic information dissemination products to GPO<BR>

<P>for inclusion in the depository library program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While cost may be a consideration, agencies should not conclude<BR>

<P>without investigation that it would be prohibitively expensive to<BR>

<P>place their electronic information dissemination products in the<BR>

<P>depository libraries.  For electronic information dissemination<BR>

<P>products other than on-line services, agencies may have the<BR>

<P>option of having GPO produce the information dissemination<BR>

<P>product for them, in which case GPO would pay for depository<BR>

<P>library costs.  Agencies should consider this option if it would<BR>

<P>be a cost effective alternative to the agency making its own<BR>

<P>arrangements for production of the information dissemination<BR>

<P>product.  Using GPO's services in this manner is voluntary and at<BR>

<P>the agency's discretion.  Agencies could also consider<BR>

<P>negotiating other terms, such as inviting GPO to participate in<BR>

<P>agency procurement orders in order to distribute the necessary<BR>

<P>copies for the depository libraries.  With adequate advance<BR>

<P>planning, agencies should be able to provide electronic<BR>

<P>information dissemination products to the depository libraries at<BR>

<P>nominal cost.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In a particular case, substantial cost may be a legitimate reason<BR>

<P>for not providing an electronic information dissemination product<BR>

<P>to the depository library program.  For example, for an agency<BR>

<P>with a substantial number of existing titles of electronic<BR>

<P>information dissemination products, furnishing copies of each to<BR>

<P>the depository libraries could be prohibitively expensive.  In<BR>

<P>that situation, the agency should endeavor to make available<BR>

<P>those titles with the greatest general interest, value, and<BR>

<P>utility to the public.  Substantial cost could also be an<BR>

<P>impediment in the case of some on-line information services where<BR>

<P>the costs associated with operating centralized databases would<BR>

<P>make provision of unlimited direct access to numerous users<BR>

<P>prohibitively expensive.  In both cases, agencies should consult<BR>

<P>with the GPO, in order to identify those information<BR>

<P>dissemination products with the greatest public interest and<BR>

<P>utility for dissemination.  In all cases, however, where an<BR>

<P>agency discontinues publication of an information dissemination<BR>

<P>product in paper format in favor of electronic formats, the<BR>

<P>agency should work with the GPO to ensure availability of the<BR>

<P>information dissemination product to depository libraries.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Notice to the Public.  Sections 8a(6)(i) and (j) present new<BR>

<P>practices for agencies to observe in communicating with the<BR>

<P>public about information dissemination.  Among agencies'<BR>

<P>responsibilities for dissemination is an active knowledge of, and<BR>

<P>regular consultation with, the users of their information<BR>

<P>dissemination products.  A primary reason for communication with<BR>

<P>users is to gain their contribution to improving the quality and<BR>

<P>relevance of government information -- how it is created,<BR>

<P>collected, and disseminated.  Consultations with users might<BR>

<P>include participation at conferences and workshops, careful<BR>

<P>attention to correspondence and telephone communications (e.g.,<BR>

<P>logging and analyzing inquiries), or formalized user surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A key part of communicating with the public is providing adequate<BR>

<P>notice of agency information dissemination plans. Because<BR>

<P>agencies' information dissemination actions affect other agencies<BR>

<P>as well as the public, agencies must forewarn other agencies of<BR>

<P>significant actions.  The decision to initiate, terminate, or<BR>

<P>substantially modify the content, form, frequency, or<BR>

<P>availability of significant products should also trigger<BR>

<P>appropriate advance public notice.  Where appropriate, the<BR>

<P>Government Printing Office should be notified directly.<BR>

<P>Information dissemination products deemed not to be significant<BR>

<P>require no advance notice.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Examples of significant products (or changes to them) might be<BR>

<P>those that:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(a)are required by law; e.g., a statutorily mandated report to<BR>

<P>Congress;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(b)involve expenditure of substantial funds;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(c)by reason of the nature of the information, are matters of<BR>

<P>continuing public interest; e.g., a key economic indicator;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(d)by reason of the time value of the information, command public<BR>

<P>interest; e.g., monthly crop reports on the day of their release;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(e)will be disseminated in a new format or medium; e.g.,<BR>

<P>disseminating a printed product in electronic medium, or<BR>

<P>disseminating a machine-readable data file via on-line access.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Where members of the public might consider a proposed new agency<BR>

<P>product unnecessary or duplicative, the agency should solicit and<BR>

<P>evaluate public comments.  Where users of an agency information<BR>

<P>dissemination product may be seriously affected by the<BR>

<P>introduction of a change in medium or format, the agency should<BR>

<P>notify users and consider their views before instituting the<BR>

<P>change.  Where members of the public consider an existing agency<BR>

<P>product important and necessary, the agency should consider these<BR>

<P>views before deciding to terminate the product.  In all cases,<BR>

<P>however, determination of what is a significant information<BR>

<P>dissemination product and what constitutes adequate notice are<BR>

<P>matters of agency judgment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Achieving Compliance with the Circular's Requirements. Section<BR>

<P>8a(6)(k) requires that the agency information dissemination<BR>

<P>management system ensure that, to the extent existing information<BR>

<P>dissemination policies or practices are inconsistent with the<BR>

<P>requirements of this Circular, an orderly transition to<BR>

<P>compliance with the requirements of this Circular is made.  For<BR>

<P>example, some agency information dissemination products may be<BR>

<P>priced at a level which exceeds the cost of dissemination, or the<BR>

<P>agency may be engaged in practices which are otherwise unduly<BR>

<P>restrictive.  In these instances, agencies must plan for an<BR>

<P>orderly transition to the substantive policy requirements of the<BR>

<P>Circular.  The information dissemination management system must<BR>

<P>be capable of identifying these situations and planning for a<BR>

<P>reasonably prompt transition.  Instances of existing agency<BR>

<P>practices which cannot immediately be brought into conformance<BR>

<P>with the requirements of the Circular are to be addressed through<BR>

<P>the waiver procedures of Section 10(b).  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(7).  Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices.<BR>

<P>Federal agencies are often the sole suppliers of the information<BR>

<P>they hold.  The agencies have either created or collected the<BR>

<P>information using public funds, usually in furtherance of unique<BR>

<P>governmental functions, and no one else has it.  Hence agencies<BR>

<P>need to take care that their behavior does not inappropriately<BR>

<P>constrain public access to government information.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>When agencies use private contractors to accomplish<BR>

<P>dissemination, they must take care that they do not permit<BR>

<P>contractors to impose restrictions that undercut the agencies'<BR>

<P>discharge of their information dissemination responsibilities.<BR>

<P>The contractual terms should assure that, with respect to<BR>

<P>dissemination, the contractor behaves as though the contractor<BR>

<P>were the agency.  For example, an agency practice of selling,<BR>

<P>through a contractor, on-line access to a database but refusing<BR>

<P>to sell copies of the database itself may be improperly<BR>

<P>restrictive because it precludes the possibility of another firm<BR>

<P>making the same service available to the public at a lower price. <BR>

<P>If an agency is willing to provide public access to a database,<BR>

<P>the agency should be willing to sell copies of the database<BR>

<P>itself.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>By the same reasoning, agencies should behave in an even-handed<BR>

<P>manner in handling information dissemination products.  If an<BR>

<P>agency is willing to sell a database or database services to some<BR>

<P>members of the public, the agency should sell the same products<BR>

<P>under similar terms to other members of the public, unless<BR>

<P>prohibited by statute.  When an agency decides it has public<BR>

<P>policy reasons for offering different terms of sale to different<BR>

<P>groups in the public, the agency should provide a clear statement<BR>

<P>of the policy and its basis.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should not attempt to exert control over the secondary<BR>

<P>uses of their information dissemination products.  In particular,<BR>

<P>agencies should not establish exclusive, restricted, or other<BR>

<P>distribution arrangements which interfere with timely and<BR>

<P>equitable availability of information dissemination products, and<BR>

<P>should not charge fees or royalties for the resale or<BR>

<P>redissemination of government information.  These principles<BR>

<P>follow from the fact that the law prohibits the Federal<BR>

<P>Government from exercising copyright.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should inform the public as to the limitations inherent<BR>

<P>in the information dissemination product (e.g., possibility of<BR>

<P>errors, degree of reliability, and validity) so that users are<BR>

<P>fully aware of the quality and integrity of the information.  If<BR>

<P>circumstances warrant, an agency may wish to establish a<BR>

<P>procedure by which disseminators of the agency's information may<BR>

<P>at their option have the data and/or value-added processing<BR>

<P>checked for accuracy and certified by the agency.  Using this<BR>

<P>method, redisseminators of the data would be able to respond to<BR>

<P>the demand for integrity from purchasers and users.  This<BR>

<P>approach could be enhanced by the agency using its authority to<BR>

<P>trademark its information dissemination product, and requiring<BR>

<P>that redisseminators who wish to use the trademark agree to<BR>

<P>appropriate integrity procedures.  These methods have the<BR>

<P>possibility of promoting diversity, user responsiveness, and<BR>

<P>efficiency as well as integrity.  However, an agency's<BR>

<P>responsibility to protect against misuse of a government<BR>

<P>information dissemination product does not extend to restricting<BR>

<P>or regulating how the public actually uses the information. <BR>

<P>Agencies should not attempt to condition the resale or<BR>

<P>redissemination of its information dissemination products by<BR>

<P>members of the public.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>User charges.  Title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriations<BR>

<P>Act of 1952 (31 U.S.C. 9701) establishes Federal policy regarding<BR>

<P>fees assessed for government services, and for sale or use of<BR>

<P>government property or resources.  OMB Circular No. A-25, User<BR>

<P>Charges, implements the statute.  It provides for charges for<BR>

<P>government goods and services that convey special benefits to<BR>

<P>recipients beyond those accruing to the general public.  It also<BR>

<P>establishes that user charges should be set at a level sufficient<BR>

<P>to recover the full cost of providing the service, resource, or<BR>

<P>property.  Since Circular No. A-25 is silent as to the extent of<BR>

<P>its application to government information dissemination products,<BR>

<P>full cost recovery for information dissemination products might<BR>

<P>be interpreted to include the cost of collecting and processing<BR>

<P>information rather than just the cost of dissemination.  The<BR>

<P>policy in Section 8a(7)(c) clarifies the policy of Circular No.<BR>

<P>A-25 as it applies to information dissemination products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Statutes such as FOIA and the Government in the Sunshine Act<BR>

<P>establish a broad and general obligation on the part of Federal<BR>

<P>agencies to make government information available to the public<BR>

<P>and to avoid erecting barriers that impede public access.  User<BR>

<P>charges higher than the cost of dissemination may be a barrier to<BR>

<P>public access.  The economic benefit to society is maximized when<BR>

<P>government information is publicly disseminated at the cost of<BR>

<P>dissemination.  Absent statutory requirements to the contrary,<BR>

<P>the general standard for user charges for government information<BR>

<P>dissemination products should be to recover no more than the cost<BR>

<P>of dissemination.  It should be noted in this connection that the<BR>

<P>government has already incurred the costs of creating and<BR>

<P>processing the information for governmental purposes in order to<BR>

<P>carry out its mission.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Underpinning this standard is the FOIA fee structure which<BR>

<P>establishes limits on what agencies can charge for access to<BR>

<P>Federal records.  That Act permits agencies to charge only the<BR>

<P>direct reasonable cost of search, reproduction and, in certain<BR>

<P>cases, review of requested records.  In the case of FOIA requests<BR>

<P>for information dissemination products, charges would be limited<BR>

<P>to reasonable direct reproduction costs alone.  No search would<BR>

<P>be needed to find the product, thus no search fees would be<BR>

<P>charged.  Neither would the record need to be reviewed to<BR>

<P>determine if it could be withheld under one of the Act's<BR>

<P>exemptions since the agency has already decided to release it. <BR>

<P>Thus, FOIA provides an information &quot;safety net&quot; for the public.<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>While OMB does not intend to prescribe procedures for pricing<BR>

<P>government information dissemination products, the cost of<BR>

<P>dissemination may generally be thought of as the sum of all costs<BR>

<P>specifically associated with preparing a product for<BR>

<P>dissemination and actually disseminating it to the public.  When<BR>

<P>an agency prepares an information product for its own internal<BR>

<P>use, costs associated with such production would not generally be<BR>

<P>recoverable as user charges on subsequent dissemination.  When<BR>

<P>the agency prepares the product for public dissemination, and<BR>

<P>disseminates it, costs associated with preparation and actual<BR>

<P>dissemination would be recoverable as user charges.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>When agencies provide custom tailored information services to<BR>

<P>specific individuals or groups, full cost recovery, including the<BR>

<P>cost of collection and processing, is appropriate.  For example,<BR>

<P>if an agency prepares special tabulations or similar services<BR>

<P>from its databases in answer to a specific request from the<BR>

<P>public, all costs associated with fulfilling the request would be<BR>

<P>charged, and the requester should be so informed before work is<BR>

<P>begun.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In a few cases, agencies engaging in information collection<BR>

<P>activities augment the information collection at the request of,<BR>

<P>and with funds provided by, private sector groups.  Since the<BR>

<P>1920's, the Bureau of the Census has carried out, on request,<BR>

<P>surveys of certain industries at greater frequency or at a<BR>

<P>greater level of detail than Federal funding would permit,<BR>

<P>because gathering the additional information is consistent with<BR>

<P>Federal purposes and industry groups have paid the additional<BR>

<P>information collection and processing costs.  While the results<BR>

<P>of these surveys are disseminated to the public at the cost of<BR>

<P>dissemination, the existence and availability of the additional<BR>

<P>government data are special benefits to certain recipients beyond<BR>

<P>those accruing to the public.  It is appropriate that those<BR>

<P>recipients should bear the full costs of information collection<BR>

<P>and processing, in addition to the normal costs of dissemination.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies must balance the requirement to establish user charges<BR>

<P>and the level of fees charged against other policies,<BR>

<P>specifically, the proper performance of agency functions and the<BR>

<P>need to ensure that information dissemination products reach the<BR>

<P>public for whom they are intended.  If an agency mission includes<BR>

<P>disseminating information to certain specific groups or members<BR>

<P>of the public and the agency determines that user charges will<BR>

<P>constitute a significant barrier to carrying out this<BR>

<P>responsibility, the agency may have grounds for reducing or<BR>

<P>eliminating its user charges for the information dissemination<BR>

<P>product, or for exempting some recipients from the charge.  Such<BR>

<P>reductions or eliminations should be the subject of agency<BR>

<P>determinations on a case by case basis and justified in terms of<BR>

<P>agency policies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(8).  Electronic Information Dissemination.  Advances<BR>

<P>in information technology have changed government information<BR>

<P>dissemination.  Agencies now have available new media and formats<BR>

<P>for dissemination, including CD-ROM, electronic bulletin boards,<BR>

<P>and public networks.  The growing public acceptance of electronic<BR>

<P>data interchange (EDI) and similar standards enhances their<BR>

<P>attractiveness as methods for government information<BR>

<P>dissemination.  For example, experiments with the use of<BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards to advertise Federal contracting<BR>

<P>opportunities and to receive vendor quotes have achieved wider<BR>

<P>dissemination of information about business opportunities with<BR>

<P>the Federal Government than has been the case with traditional<BR>

<P>notices and advertisements.  Improved information dissemination<BR>

<P>has increased the number of firms expressing interest in<BR>

<P>participating in the government market and decreased prices to<BR>

<P>the government due to expanded competition.  In addition, the<BR>

<P>development of public electronic information networks, such as<BR>

<P>the Internet, provides an additional way for agencies to increase<BR>

<P>the diversity of information sources available to the public. <BR>

<P>Emerging applications such as Wide Area Information Servers and<BR>

<P>the World-wide Web (using the NISO Z39.50 standard) will be used<BR>

<P>increasingly to facilitate dissemination of government<BR>

<P>information such as environmental data, international trade<BR>

<P>information, and economic statistics in a networked environment.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A basic purpose of the PRA is &quot;to maximize the usefulness of<BR>

<P>information collected, maintained, and disseminated by the<BR>

<P>Federal Government.&quot;  (44 U.S.C. 3501(3))  Agencies can<BR>

<P>frequently enhance the value and practical utility of government<BR>

<P>information as a national resource by disseminating information<BR>

<P>in electronic media.  Electronic collection and dissemination may<BR>

<P>substantially increase the usefulness of government information<BR>

<P>dissemination products for three reasons.  First, information<BR>

<P>disseminated electronically is likely to be more timely and<BR>

<P>accurate because it does not require data re-entry.  Second,<BR>

<P>electronic records often contain more complete and current<BR>

<P>information because, unlike paper, it is relatively easy to make<BR>

<P>frequent changes.  Finally, because electronic information is<BR>

<P>more easily manipulated by the user and can be tailored to a wide<BR>

<P>variety of needs, electronic information dissemination products<BR>

<P>are more useful to the recipients.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As stated at Section 8a(1)(h), agencies should use voluntary<BR>

<P>standards and Federal Information Processing Standards to the<BR>

<P>extent appropriate in order to ensure the most cost effective and<BR>

<P>widespread dissemination of information in electronic formats.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies can frequently make government information more<BR>

<P>accessible to the public and enhance the utility of government<BR>

<P>information as a national resource by disseminating information<BR>

<P>in electronic media.  Agencies generally do not utilize data in<BR>

<P>raw form, but edit, refine, and organize the data in order to<BR>

<P>make it more accessible and useful for their own purposes. <BR>

<P>Information is made more accessible to users by aggregating data<BR>

<P>into logical groupings, tagging data with descriptive and other<BR>

<P>identifiers, and developing indexing and retrieval systems to<BR>

<P>facilitate access to particular data within a larger file.  As a<BR>

<P>general matter, and subject to budgetary, security or legal<BR>

<P>constraints, agencies should make available such features<BR>

<P>developed for internal agency use as part of their information<BR>

<P>dissemination products.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There will also be situations where the agency determines that<BR>

<P>its mission will be furthered by providing enhancements beyond<BR>

<P>those needed for its own use, particularly those that will<BR>

<P>improve the public availability of government information over<BR>

<P>the long term.  In these instances, the agency should evaluate<BR>

<P>the expected usefulness of the enhanced information in light of<BR>

<P>its mission, and where appropriate construct partnerships with<BR>

<P>the private sector to add these elements of value.  This approach<BR>

<P>may be particularly appropriate as part of a strategy to utilize<BR>

<P>new technology enhancements, such as graphic images, as part of a<BR>

<P>particular dissemination program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8a(9).  Information Safeguards.  The basic premise of<BR>

<P>this Section is that agencies should provide an appropriate level<BR>

<P>of protection to government information, given an assessment of<BR>

<P>the risks associated with its maintenance and use.  Among the<BR>

<P>factors to be considered include meeting the specific<BR>

<P>requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Security<BR>

<P>Act of 1987. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In particular, agencies are to ensure that they meet the<BR>

<P>requirements of the Privacy Act regarding information retrievable<BR>

<P>by individual identifier.  Such information is to be collected,<BR>

<P>maintained, and protected so as to preclude intrusion into the<BR>

<P>privacy of individuals and the unwarranted disclosure of personal<BR>

<P>information.  Individuals must be accorded access and amendment<BR>

<P>rights to records, as provided in the Privacy Act.  To the extent<BR>

<P>that agencies share information which they have a continuing<BR>
 
<P>obligation to protect, agencies should see that appropriate<BR>

<P>safeguards are instituted.  Appendix I prescribes agency<BR>

<P>procedures for the maintenance of records about individuals,<BR>

<P>reporting requirements to OMB and Congress, and other special<BR>

<P>requirements of specific agencies, in accordance with the Privacy<BR>

<P>Act.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This Section also incorporates the requirement of the Computer<BR>

<P>Security Act of 1987 that agencies plan to secure their systems<BR>

<P>commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that<BR>

<P>could result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to<BR>

<P>information contained in those systems.  It includes assuring the<BR>

<P>integrity, availability, and appropriate confidentiality of<BR>

<P>information.  It also involves protection against the harm that<BR>

<P>could occur to individuals or entities outside of the Federal<BR>

<P>Government as well as the harm to the Federal Government.  Such<BR>

<P>protection includes limits on collection and sharing of<BR>

<P>information and procedures to assure the integrity of information<BR>

<P>as well as requirements to adequately secure the information.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Incorporation of Circular No. A-114.  OMB Circular No. A-114,<BR>

<P>Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities, last revised on<BR>

<P>March 20, 1985, prescribes policies and procedures to improve<BR>

<P>Federal audiovisual management.  Although OMB will rescind<BR>

<P>Circular No. A-114, its essential policies and procedures will<BR>

<P>continue.  This revision provides information resources<BR>

<P>management policies and principles independent of medium,<BR>

<P>including paper, electronic, or audiovisual.  By including the<BR>

<P>term &quot;audiovisual&quot; in the definition of &quot;information,&quot;<BR>

<P>audiovisual materials are incorporated into all policies of this<BR>

<P>Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The requirement in Circular No. A-114 that the head of each<BR>

<P>agency designate an office with responsibility for the management<BR>

<P>oversight of an agency's audiovisual productions and that an<BR>

<P>appropriate program for the management of audiovisual productions<BR>

<P>in conformance with 36 CFR 1232.4 is incorporated into this<BR>

<P>Circular at Section 9a(10).  The requirement that audiovisual<BR>

<P>activities be obtained consistent with OMB Circular No. A-76 is<BR>

<P>covered by Sections 8a(1)(d), 8a(5)(d)(i) and 8a(6)(b).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Procurement policies contained in Circular No. A-114 will be<BR>

<P>incorporated into an Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The National Archives and Records Administration will continue to<BR>

<P>prescribe the records management and archiving practices of<BR>

<P>agencies with respect to audiovisual productions at 36 CFR<BR>

<P>1232.4, &quot;Audiovisual Records Management.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<P>Section 8b. Information Systems and Information Technology<BR>

<P>Management<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(1).  Evaluation and Performance Measurement.  OMB<BR>

<P>encourages agencies to stress several types of evaluation in<BR>

<P>their oversight of information systems.  As a first step,<BR>

<P>agencies must assess the continuing need for the mission<BR>

<P>function. If the agency determines there is a continuing need for<BR>

<P>a function, agencies should reevaluate existing work processes<BR>

<P>prior to creating new or updating existing information systems. <BR>

<P>Without this analysis, agencies tend to develop information<BR>

<P>systems that improve the efficiency of traditional paper-based<BR>

<P>processes which may be no longer needed.  The application of<BR>

<P>information technology presents an opportunity to reevaluate<BR>

<P>existing organizational structures, work processes, and ways of<BR>

<P>interacting with the public to see whether they still efficiently<BR>

<P>and effectively support the agency's mission. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Benefit-cost analyses provide vital management information on the<BR>

<P>most efficient allocation of human, financial, and information<BR>

<P>resources to support agency missions.  Agencies should conduct a<BR>

<P>benefit-cost analysis for each information system to support<BR>

<P>management decision making to ensure: (a) alignment of the<BR>

<P>planned information system with the agency's mission needs; (b)<BR>

<P>acceptability of information system implementation to users<BR>

<P>inside the Government; (c) accessibility to clientele outside the<BR>

<P>Government; and (d) realization of projected benefits.  When<BR>

<P>preparing benefit-cost analyses to support investments in<BR>

<P>information technology, agencies should seek to quantify the<BR>

<P>improvements in agency performance results through the<BR>

<P>measurement of program outputs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The requirement to conduct a benefit-cost analysis need not<BR>

<P>become a burdensome activity for agencies.  The level of detail<BR>

<P>necessary for such analyses varies greatly and depends on the<BR>

<P>nature of the proposed investment.  Proposed investments in<BR>

<P>&quot;major information systems&quot; as defined in this Circular require<BR>

<P>detailed and rigorous analysis.  This analysis should not merely<BR>

<P>serve as budget justification material, but should be part of the<BR>

<P>ongoing management oversight process to ensure prudent allocation<BR>

<P>of scarce resources.  Proposed investments for information<BR>

<P>systems that are not considered &quot;major information systems&quot; <BR>

<P>should be analyzed and documented more informally.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While it is not necessary to create a new benefit-cost analysis<BR>

<P>at each stage of the information system life cycle, it is useful<BR>

<P>to refresh these analyses with up-to-date information to ensure<BR>

<P>the continued viability of an information system prior to and<BR>

<P>during implementation.  Reasons for updating a benefit-cost<BR>

<P>analysis may include such factors as significant changes in<BR>

<P>projected costs and benefits, significant changes in information<BR>

<P>technology capabilities, major changes in requirements (including<BR>

<P>legislative or regulatory changes), or empirical data based on<BR>

<P>performance measurement gained through prototype results or pilot<BR>

<P>experience.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should also weigh the relative benefits of proposed<BR>

<P>investments in information technology across the agency.  Given<BR>

<P>the fiscal constraints facing the Federal government in the<BR>

<P>upcoming years, agencies should fund a portfolio of investments<BR>

<P>across the agency that maximizes return on investment for the<BR>

<P>agency as a whole.  Agencies should also emphasize those proposed<BR>

<P>investments that show the greatest probability (i.e., display the<BR>

<P>lowest financial and operational risk) of achieving anticipated<BR>

<P>benefits for the organization.  OMB and GAO are creating a<BR>

<P>publication that will provide agencies with reference materials<BR>

<P>for setting up such evaluation processes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should complete a retrospective evaluation of<BR>

<P>information systems once operational to validate projected<BR>

<P>savings, changes in practices, and effectiveness in serving<BR>

<P>affected publics.  These post-implementation reviews may also<BR>

<P>serve as the basis for agency-wide learning about effective<BR>

<P>management practices.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(2).  Strategic Information Resources Management (IRM)<BR>

<P>Planning.  Agencies should link to, and to the extent possible,<BR>

<P>integrate IRM planning with the agency strategic planning<BR>

<P>required by the Government Performance and Results Act (P.L. 103-<BR>

<P>62).  Such a linkage ensures that agencies apply information<BR>

<P>resources to programs that support the achievement of agreed-upon<BR>

<P>mission goals.  Additionally, strategic IRM planning by agencies<BR>

<P>may help avoid automating out-of-date, ineffective, or<BR>

<P>inefficient procedures and work processes. <BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>Agencies should also devote management attention to operational<BR>

<P>information resources management planning.  This operational IRM<BR>

<P>planning should provide a one to five year focus to agency IRM<BR>

<P>activities and projects.  Agency operational IRM plans should<BR>

<P>also provide a listing of the major information systems covered<BR>

<P>by the management oversight processes described in Section 8b(3). <BR>

<P>Agency operational planning for IRM should also communicate to<BR>

<P>the public how the agency's application of information resources<BR>

<P>might affect them.  For the contractor community, this includes<BR>

<P>articulating the agency's intent to acquire information<BR>

<P>technology from the private sector.  These data should not be<BR>

<P>considered acquisition sensitive, so that they can be distributed<BR>

<P>as widely as possible to the vendor community in order to promote<BR>

<P>competition.  Agencies should make these acquisition plans<BR>

<P>available to the public through government-wide information<BR>

<P>dissemination mechanisms, including electronic means.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Operational planning should also include initiatives to reduce<BR>

<P>the burden, including information collection burden, an agency<BR>

<P>imposes on the public.  Too often, for example, agencies require<BR>

<P>personal visits to government offices during office hours<BR>

<P>inconvenient to the public.  Instead, agencies should plan to use<BR>

<P>information technology in ways that make the public's dealing<BR>

<P>with the Federal government as &quot;user-friendly&quot; as possible.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Each year, OMB issues a bulletin, requesting copies of agencies'<BR>

<P>latest strategic IRM plans and annual updates to operational<BR>

<P>plans for information and information technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(3). Information Systems Management Oversight. <BR>

<P>Agencies should consider what constitutes a &quot;major information<BR>

<P>system&quot; for purposes of this Circular when determining the<BR>

<P>appropriate level of management attention for an information<BR>

<P>system.  The anticipated dollar size of an information system or<BR>

<P>a supporting acquisition is only one determinant of the level of<BR>

<P>management attention an information system requires.  Additional<BR>

<P>criteria to assess include the maturity and stability of the<BR>

<P>technology under consideration, how well defined user<BR>

<P>requirements are, the level of stability of program and user<BR>

<P>requirements, and security concerns.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For instance, certain risky or &quot;cutting-edge&quot; information systems<BR>

<P>require closer scrutiny and more points of review and evaluation. <BR>

<P>This is particularly true when an agency uses an evolutionary<BR>

<P>life cycle strategy that requires a technical and financial<BR>

<P>evaluation of the project's viability at prototype and pilot<BR>

<P>testing phases.  Projects relying on commercial off-the-shelf<BR>

<P>technology and applications will generally require less oversight<BR>

<P>than those using custom-designed software.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While each phase of an information system life cycle may have<BR>

<P>unique characteristics, the dividing line between the phases may<BR>

<P>not always be distinct.  For instance, both planning and<BR>

<P>evaluation should continue throughout the information system life<BR>

<P>cycle.  In fact, during any phase, it may be necessary to revisit<BR>

<P>the previous stages based on new information or changes in the<BR>

<P>environment in which the system is being developed.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The policy statements in this Circular describe an information<BR>

<P>system life cycle.  It does not, however, make a definitive<BR>

<P>statement that there must be four versus five phases of a life<BR>

<P>cycle because the life cycle varies by the nature of the<BR>

<P>information system.  Only two phases are common to all<BR>

<P>information systems - a beginning and an end.  As a result, life<BR>

<P>cycle management techniques that agencies can use may vary<BR>

<P>depending on the complexity and risk inherent in the project.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>One element of this management oversight policy is the<BR>

<P>recognition of imbedded and/or parallel life cycles.  Within an<BR>

<P>information system's life cycle there may be other subsidiary<BR>

<P>life cycles.  For instance, most Federal information systems<BR>

<P>projects include an acquisition of goods and services that have<BR>

<P>life cycle characteristics.  Some projects include software<BR>

<P>development components, which also have life cycles.  Effective<BR>

<P>management oversight of major information systems requires a<BR>

<P>recognition of all these various life cycles and an integrated<BR>

<P>information systems management oversight with the budget and<BR>

<P>human resource management cycles that exist in the agency.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(2) of the Circular underscores the need for agencies<BR>

<P>to bring an agency-wide perspective to a number of information<BR>

<P>resources management issues.  These issues include policy<BR>

<P>formulation, planning, management and technical frameworks for<BR>

<P>using information resources, and management oversight of major<BR>

<P>information systems.  Agencies should also provide for<BR>

<P>coordinated decision making (Section 8b(3)(f)) in order to bring<BR>

<P>together the perspectives from across an agency, and outside if<BR>

<P>appropriate.  Such coordination may take place in an agency-wide<BR>

<P>management or IRM committee.  Interested groups typically include<BR>

<P>functional users, managers of financial and human resources,<BR>

<P>information resources management specialists, and, as<BR>

<P>appropriate, the affected public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(4).  Use of Information Resources.  Agency management<BR>

<P>of information resources should be guided by management and<BR>

<P>technical frameworks for agency-wide information and information<BR>

<P>technology needs.  The technical framework should serve as a<BR>

<P>reference for updates to existing and new information systems. <BR>

<P>The management framework should assure the integration of<BR>

<P>proposed information systems projects into the technical<BR>

<P>framework in a manner that will ensure progress towards achieving<BR>

<P>an open systems environment.  Agency strategic IRM planning<BR>

<P>should describe the parameters (e.g., technical standards) of<BR>

<P>such a technical framework.  The management framework should<BR>

<P>drive operational planning and should describe how the agency<BR>

<P>intends to use information and information technology consistent<BR>

<P>with the technical framework. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agency management and technical frameworks for information<BR>

<P>resources should address agency strategies to move toward an open<BR>

<P>systems environment.  These strategies should consist of one or<BR>

<P>multiple profiles (an internally consistent set of standards),<BR>

<P>based on the current version of the NIST's Application<BR>

<P>Portability Profile.  These profiles should satisfy user<BR>

<P>requirements, accommodate officially recognized or de facto<BR>

<P>standards, and promote interoperability, application portability,<BR>

<P>and scalability by defining interfaces, services, protocols, and<BR>

<P>data formats favoring the use of nonproprietary specifications.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should focus on how to better utilize the data they<BR>

<P>currently collect from the public.  Because agencies generally do<BR>

<P>not share information, the public often must respond to<BR>

<P>duplicative information collections from various agencies or<BR>

<P>their components.  Sharing of information about individuals<BR>

<P>should be consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,<BR>

<P>and Appendix I of this Circular.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Services provided by IPSOs to components of their own agency are<BR>

<P>often perceived to be &quot;free&quot; by the service recipients because<BR>

<P>their costs are budgeted as an &quot;overhead&quot; charge.  Service<BR>

<P>recipients typically do not pay for IPSO services based on actual<BR>

<P>usage.  Since the services are perceived to be free, there is<BR>

<P>very little incentive for either the service recipients or the<BR>

<P>IPSO managers to be watchful for opportunities to improve<BR>

<P>productivity or to reduce costs.  Agencies are encouraged to<BR>

<P>institute chargeback mechanisms for IPSOs that provide common<BR>

<P>information processing services across a number of agency<BR>

<P>components when the resulting economies are expected to exceed<BR>

<P>the cost of administration. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 8b(5).  Acquisition of Information Technology. <BR>

<P>Consistent with the requirements of the Brooks Act and the<BR>

<P>Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies should acquire information<BR>

<P>technology to improve service delivery, reduce the cost of<BR>

<P>Federal program administration, and minimize burden of dealing<BR>

<P>with the Federal government.  Agencies may wish to ask potential<BR>

<P>offerors to propose different technical solutions and approaches<BR>

<P>to fulfilling agency mission requirements.  Evaluating<BR>

<P>acquisitions of information technology must assess both the<BR>

<P>benefits and costs of applying technology to meet such<BR>

<P>requirements.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The distinction between information system life cycles and<BR>

<P>acquisition life cycles is important when considering the<BR>

<P>implications of OMB Circular A-109, Acquisition of Major Systems,<BR>

<P>to the acquisition of information resources.  Circular A-109<BR>

<P>presents one strategy for acquiring information technology when:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>i) The agency intends to fund operational tests and<BR>

<P>demonstrations of system design;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>ii) The risk is high due to the unproven integration of custom<BR>

<P>designed software and/or hardware components; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>iii) The estimated cost savings or operational improvements from<BR>

<P>such a demonstration will further improve the return on<BR>

<P>investment; or<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>iv) The agency wants to acquire a solution based on state-of-the-<BR>

<P>art, unproven technology.<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>Agencies should comply with OMB Circular A-76, Performance of<BR>

<P>Commercial Activities, when considering conversion to or from in-<BR>

<P>house or contract performance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agencies should ensure that acquisitions for new information<BR>

<P>technology comply with GSA regulations concerning information<BR>

<P>technology accessibility for individuals with disabilities [41<BR>

<P>C.F.R. 201-20.103-7].<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 9a(11).  Ombudsman.  The senior agency official<BR>

<P>designated by the head of each agency under 44 U.S.C. 3506(b) is<BR>

<P>charged with carrying out the responsibilities of the agency<BR>

<P>under the PRA.  Agency senior information resources management<BR>

<P>officials are responsible for ensuring that their agency<BR>

<P>practices are in compliance with OMB policies.  It is envisioned<BR>

<P>that the agency senior information resources management official<BR>

<P>will work as an ombudsman to investigate alleged instances of<BR>

<P>agency failure to adhere to the policies set forth in the<BR>

<P>Circular and to recommend or take corrective action as<BR>

<P>appropriate.  Agency heads should continue to use existing<BR>

<P>mechanisms to ensure compliance with laws and policies.<BR>

<P>April 4, 1996<BR>

<P><B>MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS</B><BR>

<P>FROM:              Alice M. Rivlin<BR>
Director<BR>

<P>SUBJECT:	<B>Implementation of the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996</B><BR>

<P>This memorandum provides preliminary guidance to Federal agencies on the implementation of the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996  (ITMRA), Pub. L. 104-106, which President Clinton signed into law on February 10, 1996.  ITMRA repeals Section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (popularly referred to as the Brooks Act) and establishes a new statutory scheme for information technology management and acquisition within the Executive branch.  The Acts provisions take effect on August 8, 1996, 180 days after enactment. This memorandum  addresses two areas -- the designation of the chief information officer (CIO) and the role of the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) in information technology protests.<BR>

<P>In addition to this memorandum, OMB Circulars will be revised to provide further guidance to agencies. OMB will seek agency and public comment of draft revisions to Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, so that these revisions will be final by early August 1996. In addition, OMB Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates, will be revised as part of the annual update of that Circular.<BR>

<P><B>Agency Chief Information Officers</B><BR>

<P>Section 5125(a) of ITMRA amends Section 3506 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA),  Pub. L. 104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, by establishing the position of Chief Information Officer in place of the designated senior official for information resources management previously established by the PRA.  This provision is intended to establish clear accountability for agency information resources management activities, provide for greater coordination among the agencys information activities, and ensure greater visibility of such activities within each agency.<BR>

<P>One of the most important responsibilities of the CIO is to promote effective agency operations by implementing budget-linked capital planning for, and performance-based management of, information technology systems.  Under the ITMRA, agencies are to determine, before making an investment in a new information system to support a particular function, whether the function should be performed or supported by the private sector or another agency.  Agencies should also, where appropriate, reorganize and revise the way a function is performed to improve its effectiveness before making significant IT investments to support that work. To ensure that these strategic issues are addressed by the agency, the Act makes the CIO explicitly responsible for promoting improvements in agency work processes.<BR>

<P>The CIO is also charged with facilitating the development, implementation, and maintenance of a sound and integrated information technology architecture for the agency, and promoting the effective design and operation of all major information resources management processes.  The duties of the CIO are set forth at section 5125(c) of the ITMRA.<BR>

<P><B>Designation and Organizational Placement of the Chief Information Officer.</B><BR>

<P>Each agency head is expected to select and position a CIO to ensure the effective acquisition and use of IT and to carry out the agencys information resources management responsibilities.  While the organizational placement of the CIO is to be determined by the agency head, the person selected should report to the agency head directly, and not through another official.  The CIO must actively participate, with the agency head and other senior agency officials, in planning and budgeting deliberations, support of work process redesign in areas being considered for IT investment, and the development of information technology program performance measures.  Consistent with the ITMRA, for the agencies listed in the Attachment, information resources management shall be the primary duty of the CIO.<BR>

<P>The agency head may designate as the CIO any individual who has the professional qualifications and experience required for the duties of the position. The position may be filled  by recruiting and appointing someone from outside the agency, by the current senior information resources management official, or by someone holding another position in the agency.(superscript: 1)<BR>

<P>Agencies may also establish CIOs for major subcomponents or bureaus, and may also appoint deputy CIOs that have additional experience in work process redesign, design and management of information technology architectures, and data and telecommunications management.<BR>

<P>________________________<BR>

<P>(superscript: 1 )In agencies listed in the Attachment, if the<BR>
position is placed in the Senior Executive Service (career or non-career), the agency head may set the pay of the incumbent at any rate of the Senior Executive Service in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5383. Relation to Chief Financial Officer (CFO).<BR>

<P>The head of the agency is responsible for defining the operating relationship between the CIO and CFO functions and ensuring coordination in the implementation of the ITMRA, the PRA, the Chief Financial Officers Act, and the Government Performance and Results Act.  The CFO continues to be responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the financial management systems as provided for in the CFO Act.(superscript:<BR>
) In agencies where financial systems represent a substantial part of<BR>
the agency's information systems portfolio, it may be appropriate for the same person to serve as both CIO and CFO, so long as the mix of the CFO/CIO duties and qualifications is consistent with the intent of ITMRA. Finally, Section 5126 of the ITMRA encourages the CIO and CFO to work together under the direction of the agency head to ensure that the agency's information systems provide reliable, consistent, and timely program performance information.<BR>

<P><B>Appointment Process.</B><BR>

<P>By August 8, 1996, the head of each agency shall designate its Chief Information Officer, as required by ITMRA and the PRA.<BR>

<P>Each agency listed in the Attachment should consult with the OMB Deputy Director for Management prior to establishing and filling the position, and provide the following information:<BR>

<P>the CIOs name, background and experience.<BR>

<P>an organization chart which identifies the CIOs position relative to the<BR>
head of the agency, and other senior agency officials, and the agency staff and associated resources assigned, or to be assigned, to the CIO for the performance of  functions assigned by the PRA and ITMRA.<BR>

<P>a description of the CIOs authority and responsibilities.<BR>

<P>All agencies should provide the name, title, and phone number for the CIO to OMB once the position is filled.  This information should be mailed to Room 10236, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503.  This information should be updated as changes occur.<BR>

<P><B>Role of the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA)</B><BR>

<P>The repeal of the Brooks Act revokes the GSBCA's authority to hear and decide bid protests.  The GSBCA will continue to hear and decide protests received up to and including August 7, 1996.  The GSBCA will not accept any protest received on or after August 8, 1996.<BR>

<P><B>Inquiries. </B> Inquiries or suggestions regarding the role of the Chief Information Officer may be directed to the Information Policy and Technology Branch in OMBs Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (202) 395-3785.  Inquiries regarding the role of the GSBCA should be directed to OMBs Office of Federal Procurement Policy (202) 395-6803.<BR>

<P>
<P>INTRODUCTION<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     On December 19, 1994, President Clinton formally initiated Phase II <BR>

<P>of the work of the National Performance Review (NPR).  From its <BR>

<P>inception in early 1993, the work of the NPR focused on four powerful <BR>

<P>themes:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Putting Customers First,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Cutting Red Tape, <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Empowering Employees To Get Results, and <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Cutting Back to Basics.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The results of the first year's efforts dealt primarily with the <BR>

<P>first three themes.  As a consequence, Cutting Back to Basics became an <BR>

<P>important focus for Phase II.  Cutting Back to Basics means taking a <BR>

<P>hard look at the things which government does and determining what <BR>

<P>changes to make in federal programs and functions, if any.  It also <BR>

<P>means moving the service delivery capability to the most effective <BR>

<P>provider and putting incentives into place to bring about the desired <BR>

<P>results.  In general, a refocusing and downsizing of federal activities <BR>

<P>will result.    <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     There are five basic ways of downsizing the federal government.  <BR>

<P>From the broadest to narrowest perspective, they include;<BR>

<P>     <BR>

<P>1     .Service Termination.  This approach reflects a government review <BR>

<P>of the existing commercial, State or local government service market and <BR>

<P>a decision that a service need not be provided by the federal <BR>

<P>government.  This option includes many federalism concepts.  Electrical <BR>

<P>power generation and distribution (rural electrification), and helium <BR>

<P>production and sales are also examples of services that fit into this <BR>

<P>category.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2     .Privatization.  Privatization implies that the government is <BR>

<P>currently providing the service, but no longer sees the need to be in <BR>

<P>direct control of its provision, operations or maintenance.  <BR>

<P>Privatization reflects the sale of assets and related service <BR>

<P>requirements (rights) by the government.  However, it also includes <BR>

<P>assumptions that services are necessary and must be provided in the <BR>

<P>future.  It is rarely simple divestiture, as outlined above.  The sale <BR>

<P>agreements themselves establish and refer to the regulatory and <BR>

<P>oversight environment that will continue to exist to assure that public <BR>

<P>and/or agency access and service requirements are maintained.  This may <BR>

<P>or may not include agreed-upon user fees or rate commission (utility) <BR>

<P>oversight.  Privatization can include sale to or forgiveness of debt <BR>

<P>from other public authorities or to private sector investors.   Simple <BR>

<P>examples include waste water treatment plants, airports, ports, bridges, <BR>

<P>parks, and recreation facilities.  Government exerts control through <BR>

<P>regulatory and sale covenants.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3     .Quasi-Government Corporations.  This approach recognizes that <BR>

<P>there is a definite public need for a service at the federal level.  <BR>

<P>Generally it is a service that can readily be provided by the private <BR>

<P>sector, but there is no commercial service market able or willing to <BR>

<P>take on the responsibility.  In effect, instead of providing the service <BR>

<P>directly as a public (in-house) good, the government opts to create a <BR>

<P>corporation and a market where there is none today.  Fannie Mae, Connie <BR>

<P>Mack, etc. are examples.  Another example is Conrail, where there was a <BR>

<P>public need and no private sector interest in providing the financial or <BR>

<P>operating assets necessary--the risks were simply too high relative to <BR>

<P>expected returns.  Amtrak is currently considered a part of this <BR>

<P>category.  Government exerts control through a combination of limited <BR>

<P>operational and management controls, (board member, owner of <BR>

<P>preferential stock, budget review authority, appropriations, etc.) and <BR>

<P>regulatory controls.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4     .Creation of Public/Private Partnerships.  This approach reflects <BR>

<P>a joint public and private sector investment relationship.  The <BR>

<P>government may share in the ownership of assets and may share in <BR>

<P>operational responsibilities.   Many hub airports facilities and <BR>

<P>regional transportation Authorities (e.g., the Port Authority of New <BR>

<P>York) fall into this category.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     5     .Competition.  This is the &quot;outsourcing&quot; or &quot;contracting out&quot; <BR>

<P>alternative (FAR recompetitions and OMB Circular A-76 make/buy <BR>

<P>decisions).  It reflects a decision by the government to remain fully <BR>

<P>responsible for the provision of all services and management decisions.  <BR>

<P>The question is whether the service can be more effectively procured <BR>

<P>through in-house or contract sources.  Management efforts to improve in-<BR>

<P>house productivity, accountability, increase the incentives to be cost <BR>

<P>effective and customer oriented and to better define work are severely <BR>

<P>limited without competition.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     How do you sort through programs and functions to make these <BR>

<P>considerations?  To begin with, at a meeting on January 12, 1995 with <BR>

<P>agency representatives, the Vice President asked the agencies to develop <BR>

<P>a decision process similar to that shown in Exhibit 1.  As a first step, <BR>

<P>agencies must first determine whether the program or function is <BR>

<P>critical to the agencies mission based upon &quot;customer input.&quot;  The <BR>

<P>criticality of &quot;customer input&quot; can be seen as agencies think through <BR>

<P>the rest of the process and are confronted by decisions which require <BR>

<P>prioritization and insight as to how well the activities are performed.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Divesting of those activities that are no longer an appropriate <BR>

<P>agency line of business may not be easy, and the options shown in Figure <BR>

<P>1 of &quot;terminate&quot; or &quot;privatize&quot; require a separate analysis as to timing <BR>

<P>and appropriateness of the mechanism(s) to be employed.      <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The second decision point shown in Exhibit 1 is that of devolution <BR>

<P>to the state or local level, which may also involve some joint <BR>

<P>partnership on a short-term or continuing basis.  Again, aspects of <BR>

<P>&quot;privatization&quot; emerge.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     At the third level of decision, the question of cutting costs and <BR>

<P>improving performance through the injection of competition.  Discussion <BR>

<P>of the options for franchising and privatization are provided in the <BR>

<P>sections which follow.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Five agencies have already analyzed their activities along similar <BR>

<P>lines.  These include the Department of Housing and Urban Development <BR>

<P>(HUD), GSA, the Department of Energy, the Office of Personnel <BR>

<P>Management, and DOT.  The results of their efforts and the mechanisms <BR>

<P>employed are summarized in Exhibit 2.<BR>

<P>EXHIBIT 2.  SUMMARY OF MECHANISMS USED BY FIVE AGENCIES<BR>

<P>TO SAVE $20 BILLION<BR>

<P>**********************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Consolidation<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>HUD is consolidating 60 grant programs into 3 performance grants:  <BR>

<P>Housing Certificates, Affordable Housing Fund, and Community Opportunity <BR>

<P>Fund.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOT will consolidate its 10 agencies into 3 around the themes of either <BR>

<P>(a) land, sea, or air, or (b) infrastructure, safety, and Coast Guard.<BR>

<P>DOT will consolidate its 30 grant programs into 3:  a unified grant to <BR>

<P>states and cities, new state infrastructure banks, and discretionary <BR>

<P>grants.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Vouchers<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>HUD is shifting funding from 3,400 public housing authorities to tenants <BR>

<P>who can then determine where to purchase support (similar to G.I. Bill).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Devolution<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>DOT will give states more power over transportation-related spending as <BR>

<P>part of $6.7 billion package.<BR>

<P>GSA will delegate additional responsibility to federal agencies <BR>

<P>regarding their performance of administrative and support activities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Program Cancellation<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>DOE will shave $1.2 billion over five years from its applied research <BR>

<P>programs, including the Clean Coal Technology Program, and close at <BR>

<P>least one laboratory facility.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Administrative Changes<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>HUD will save $800 million through administrative changes, attrition, <BR>

<P>and buyouts over five years.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOE will make unspecified cuts in the management and operations of its <BR>

<P>nuclear and chemical waste clean up program to save $4.4 billion.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM will eliminate 1,800 more positions over the next five years.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Privatization<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>DOE will sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves at Elk Hills and Teapot Dome <BR>

<P>to private industry and save $1.6 billion.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>******************<BR>

<P>Other Divesting<BR>

<P>******************<BR>

<P>HUD will establish the Federal Housing Administration as a government-<BR>

<P>owned corporation.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOT will move air traffic control operations and its 40,000 employees to <BR>

<P>a semi-public corporation as part of $6.7 billion package.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA will review each of its operational business lines to determine <BR>

<P>which should be transferred to the agencies or privatized.  GSA will <BR>

<P>also consider the use of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs).  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOE will sell uranium no longer needed for national defense purposes <BR>

<P>after rendering it suitable for commercial power reactors.<BR>

<P>
<P>FRANCHISING<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     For purposes of this discussion, &quot;franchising&quot; is an <BR>

<P>entrepreneurial activity within a government organization which provides <BR>

<P>common administrative support services to other federal agencies or <BR>

<P>other components within the same federal agency.      <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The establishment of a Franchise Fund Pilot Program was authorized <BR>

<P>by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) to give federal <BR>

<P>managers improved management tools and incentives to operate more cost-<BR>

<P>effectively.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The federal government has employed a variety of funding mechanisms <BR>

<P>in the past for common administrative services under such titles as <BR>

<P>working capital funds, revolving funds, industrial funds, and supply and <BR>

<P>service funds, and there was wide variety in their methods operation.  <BR>

<P>Currently, agencies are providing construction management, financial, <BR>

<P>security, purchasing, warehousing, transportation, education and <BR>

<P>numerous other services, as well as, products to federal agencies which <BR>

<P>are inside and outside their own departments.  Significant savings may <BR>

<P>be available to agencies as sellers and purchases of services from <BR>

<P>federal franchises.<BR>

Title: Privatization Resource Guide and Status Report Part II<BR>

<P>Date: February 13, 1995<BR>

<P>Author: National Performance Review and OMB<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Despite the very positive aspects offered by many of these prior <BR>

<P>arrangements, there were enough improprieties historically, that cause <BR>

<P>for concern about their operation was often justified.  The Franchise <BR>

<P>Fund concept, on the other hand, can be thought of as an approach which <BR>

<P>incorporates the best of these earlier mechanisms and avoids the worst.  <BR>

<P>In general, franchise funds incorporate at least three important <BR>

<P>characteristics; they are fully reimbursable, competitive, and meet <BR>

<P>standards.  Performance within a franchise may be accomplished with <BR>

<P>either in-house federal staff or by contractors.        <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Under the auspices of the federal Chief Financial Officers' Council <BR>

<P>(CFOC), a Franchise Fund Working Group has been laying the groundwork to <BR>

<P>implement the provisions of the GMRA, with the result that a Franchise <BR>

<P>Fund Pilot Program Application was forwarded to agency Chief Financial <BR>

<P>Officers and the Chairman of the Small Agency Council by OMB Director <BR>

<P>for Management John Koskinen on February 6, 1995.  An Applicants' <BR>

<P>Conference will be held on February 17, 1995 to review the scope and <BR>

<P>benefits of the program, and to provide information on how to complete <BR>

<P>the Application.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Awards to the pilot programs are scheduled for May 1995.  A <BR>

<P>Directory of the more than 150 organizations currently offering one or <BR>

<P>more common administrative services will be available for the February <BR>

<P>17th Conference.  (Copies of the Directory after February 17th can be <BR>

<P>obtained from Phil LaBonte, GSA, 202-273-4665.)  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     A two-day conference is now in the planning stages for June 1995 <BR>

<P>which will focus on how to establish and operate a franchise fund and <BR>

<P>guide is now being developed to help agencies in their implementation <BR>

<P>efforts.  The conference is being planned jointly by the CFOC Franchise <BR>

<P>Fund Working Group and Association for Public Policy Analysis and <BR>

<P>Management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     A final word on franchising.  The benefits cited most often with <BR>

<P>regard to &quot;franchise&quot; type activities tie to the funding and service <BR>

<P>flexibilities the approach provides to agencies.  Many overlook the <BR>

<P>sense of &quot;order&quot; it brings to employees who want to do a good job and <BR>

<P>are constantly frustrated by the demands on their time.  Customer <BR>

<P>service standards are usually not well-defined and the expectations of <BR>

<P>both the employee and the customer remain unmet.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     By entering into a fee-for-service environment, employees find that <BR>

<P>economics become the great leveler.  Fee schedules are tied to work <BR>

<P>products; economics helps customers and employees adjust their <BR>

<P>priorities and predefine expectations.  Employees of the Defense <BR>

<P>Logistics Agency, for example, found that when they moved into a fee-<BR>

<P>for-service environment, they are able to provide quality service at a <BR>

<P>much lower cost.  Their time is more productive--job satisfaction <BR>

<P>improved.  Everyone wins! <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     It is further worth noting before we move on to the section on <BR>

<P>Privatization, that Franchising is a step in that direction.  In some <BR>

<P>cases, the organizational dynamics may be such that it is the first step <BR>

<P>in a sequence of actions which ultimately move the entity into one of <BR>

<P>the privatization options discussed in the next section.            <BR>

<P>PRIVATIZATION<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>BACKGROUND<BR>

<P>
<P>     This Resource Guide and Status Report is designed to provide <BR>

<P>federal managers with a starting point in their consideration of <BR>

<P>privatization as an option for Phase II reinvention.  The Resource Guide <BR>

<P>and Status Report is not an exhaustive review of privatization, but <BR>

<P>rather is a glimpse at what is becoming an increasingly important and <BR>

<P>dynamic public management tool.  Privatization seeks to optimize the in-<BR>

<P>house and contract workload mix and, thereby, achieve cost-effective <BR>

<P>federal services.  Privatization is defined as one of the following:  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1) the private development and operation of public-use infrastructure <BR>

<P>and the provision of public services that have traditionally been <BR>

<P>provided by the state; (2) contracting out of services, which does not <BR>

<P>usually include private sharing of financial responsibility; (3) the <BR>

<P>sale of state-owned enterprises to private firms, with the expectation <BR>

<P>that the buyer will improve operating efficiency, invest new capital, <BR>

<P>and take full advantage of the enterprises's commercial development <BR>

<P>potential, all at lower cost to the state.&quot;  (Source:  Gregory Fishbein, <BR>

<P>202-331-3623, Price-Waterhouse Transportation and Utility Finance <BR>

<P>Group.)  <BR>

<P>
<P>     While the concept of privatization of federal services is not new, <BR>

<P>it is experiencing a period of heightened awareness. Government services <BR>

<P>have been contracted-out (sometimes referred to as &quot;outsourcing,&quot; to <BR>

<P>private providers almost since the start of the Republic.  In addition, <BR>

<P>concessions to conduct business with the public have been granted in <BR>

<P>numerous situations where it was to the advantage of the government to <BR>

<P>have the service provided by the private sector.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The public most often hears about federal privatization efforts in <BR>

<P>the form of &quot;government corporations,&quot; of which some 22 have been <BR>

<P>established under the Government Corporation Control Act of 1945.  (For <BR>

<P>more information on this, see the article entitled &quot;Government Inc.,&quot; in <BR>

<P>the February 1995 issue of Government Executive.  It is also worth <BR>

<P>noting that Susan Lee of the Department of Transportation prepared &quot;A <BR>

<P>Study of Government Corporations&quot;which addresses the role of government, <BR>

<P>how government corporations differ from a revolving fund, and <BR>

<P>considerations for auditing, budgeting, procurement, and personnel.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Setting up a government corporation, however, is only one of <BR>

<P>several privatization-like approaches which can be taken.  In fact, some <BR>

<P>have said that &quot;delegating a governmental function to a government <BR>

<P>corporation is not the same thing as privatizing it.&quot;  The point to be <BR>

<P>made here is that the focus of NPR Phase II is to enable the government <BR>

<P>to more effectively focus on those things which it should and can do, <BR>

<P>and to put incentives in place to cause these things to perform <BR>

<P>optimally.  New and different types of partnerships continue to emerge <BR>

<P>to meet this challenge, including some that are not easily categorized. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Increasingly, major federal programs have been operated by the <BR>

<P>private sector.  In the 1980's and early 1990's, the Department of <BR>

<P>Defense (DOD) contracted for more than 12,000 units of leased military <BR>

<P>family housing for its personnel.  GSA leases over 150 million square <BR>

<P>feet of private full-service office space for government agencies.  <BR>

<P>Contractors fight forest fires on government land, while private day <BR>

<P>care providers tend to the children of federal employees at numerous <BR>

<P>locations, including the CIA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Training aircraft at several military bases are maintained by <BR>

<P>contractor personnel, while the Marine Corps' Maritime Prepositioning <BR>

<P>Ships are owned and crewed by civilian companies. Cafeterias and mess <BR>

<P>halls have been privatized to feed civilian and military personnel <BR>

<P>better, faster, and cheaper than had their government predecessors.  <BR>

<P>Federal property is used by banks, credit unions, retail stores, and <BR>

<P>fast-food restaurants which cater to the needs of federal employees and <BR>

<P>the public.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Local and state governments have been deeply involved in <BR>

<P>privatization and have a wealth of experience that should be reviewed <BR>

<P>when considering this approach.  The list of local initiatives is long <BR>

<P>and growing constantly.  Services such as health care, school bus <BR>

<P>maintenance, prisons, warehousing, road maintenance, water treatment, <BR>

<P>fire services, ambulance/emergency medical care, computer <BR>

<P>operation/maintenance, elementary education, golf course operation, and <BR>

<P>food service, are just a few of the services that have been successfully <BR>

<P>transferred to the private sector. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In the past two decades privatization has also taken hold in many <BR>

<P>foreign countries.  The British rail system has been privatized, along <BR>

<P>with water and telecommunications providers. In New Zealand, public <BR>

<P>sector employment has been cut in half as state owned enterprises have <BR>
been sold.  Argentina has sold its rail system, power plants, airports, <BR>

<P>telecommunications satellite network, toll road concessions, and <BR>

<P>water/sewer service systems to the private sector.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In country after country governments have turned to the private <BR>

<P>sector to improve service and lower costs.  Many of the companies that <BR>

<P>are now operating these privatized services are based in the United <BR>

<P>States and have invested billions of U.S. dollars in these projects.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Section 5 (g) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act requires <BR>

<P>the President to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies do not <BR>

<P>convert the work of employees included in the 272,900 reduction target <BR>

<P>or the work of employees that accept a buyout to contract performance, <BR>

<P>unless a cost comparison demonstrates that there is a financial <BR>

<P>advantage to the government.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In those cases where contracting out may be appropriate, agencies <BR>

<P>have been advised by Acting OMB Director Rivlin to comply with section <BR>

<P>5(g) of the Act through the conduct of OMB Circular A-76 comparisons, <BR>

<P>where applicable.  In those cases where Circular A-76 does not apply, <BR>

<P>such as Research and Development activities and activities that involve <BR>

<P>less than 10 Full-Time-Equivalents (FTEs), agencies may develop <BR>

<P>alternative cost comparison approaches that respond to the requirements <BR>

<P>of Section 5(g) or they may use Circular A-76 procedures.  We <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>believe that this guidance appropriately addresses the concern that <BR>

<P>agencies might otherwise be inclined to contract out activities to meet <BR>

<P>personnel ceilings, without a cost comparison to demonstrate a net <BR>

<P>benefit to the government.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Agencies that have pursued A-76 competitions, to both contract out <BR>

<P>performance and to contract in, indicate that it has been an effective <BR>

<P>mechanism for achieving savings without reducing the provision of needed <BR>

<P>services.  It has also been effective in ensuring that the determination <BR>

<P>of a financial advantage to the government is fair, open to all parties <BR>

<P>and based upon a level playing field.  Savings are achieved through <BR>

<P>efficiencies identified as a part of the competition process, both in-<BR>

<P>house and through contract bids, and through the implementation of <BR>

<P>improved contracting techniques.  Circular A-76 cost comparison and <BR>

<P>appeals procedures have ensured that all parties to the competitions <BR>

<P>have an equal access to the information and input to the decision <BR>

<P>process.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR is not interested in promoting contracting out simply to <BR>

<P>make FTE reductions.  Section 5(g) and the requirements of Circular A-76 <BR>

<P>will ensure that conversions to or from contract are authorized only <BR>

<P>when shown to be cost-effective.  In its letter to agencies of August <BR>

<P>19, 1994, for example, OMB specifically requested that agencies maintain <BR>

<P>information on the status of their Section 5(g) contracting efforts, <BR>

<P>including information on the number of contracts awarded, FTE impacts <BR>

<P>and related dollar savings.  This same point was made in a February 4, <BR>

<P>1995, Washington Post article:  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>&quot;This is not a privatization exercise....This is a most cost-effective <BR>

<P>alternative exercise.  It would be irresponsible to do privatization for <BR>

<P>the sake of privatization.  Privatization itself is not the goal.  It's <BR>

<P>only a tool.&quot; <BR>

<P>                              Julia Stasch, GSA Deputy Administrator<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Our objective is to restore the public's faith in government by <BR>
managing our resources more effectively and by giving citizens and <BR>

<P>taxpayers more value for the dollar.  This requires that we look at the <BR>

<P>way work is performed and permit agencies the flexibility to manage <BR>

<P>their increasingly limited resources.   At the same time, we recognize <BR>

<P>our obligation to current employees, and to the taxpayer to minimize the <BR>

<P>adverse affect these changes could have on them.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In almost every case where the operation of a federal agency is to <BR>

<P>be reviewed, privatization should be considered in whole or in part.  <BR>

<P>When making an initial decision concerning the retention of a federal <BR>

<P>program or function, the sample decision tree illustrated in Figure 1 <BR>

<P>should be helpful. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Federal privatization should not be viewed only with respect to the <BR>

<P>operations and maintenance of federal services.  Federal agencies are <BR>

<P>also influential in the opportunities to privatize at the state and <BR>

<P>local levels.  The privatization of federally-financed State and local <BR>

<P>infrastructure, for example, has been proposed as a means to leverage <BR>

<P>the equity in existing infrastructure for investment in new or expanded <BR>

<P>infrastructure. <BR>

<P>
<P>     The federal experience with privatization has shown that the <BR>

<P>private sector is often ready, willing and able to provide goods and <BR>

<P>services to federal customers that have reasonable goals, commercially <BR>

<P>acceptable risks, and an expectation of profitability.  The private for-<BR>

<P>profit sector, however, has neither the will nor the capability to <BR>

<P>undertake activities that do not meet these standards.  The private non-<BR>

<P>profit sector may fill some gaps, but usually will not take risks that <BR>

<P>will jeopardize the financial health of the institution.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Programs and functions (including services) which have little or no <BR>

<P>hope of being commercially viable should be eliminated or provided <BR>

<P>directly by federal resources.  In considering options to consolidate, <BR>

<P>terminate, franchise, incorporate, devolve, or outsource, agencies may <BR>

<P>want to seek answers to the following questions: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Is the continued performance of the activity necessary to the <BR>

<P>mission of the agency?  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Would either service delivery, customer decisionmaking (vouchers), <BR>

<P>cost recognition, quality, or cost-effectiveness be enhanced through <BR>
franchising or privatization? <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Is the private sector physically, financially, and technologically <BR>

<P>capable of providing the program or function?  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Is there a legislative or regulatory prohibition or other barrier <BR>

<P>to private sector performance?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Can the requirement be defined with enough certainty to allow for <BR>

<P>competitive award of a contract for the program or function, and if not, <BR>

<P>why not?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Is there a consensus for the privatization of the project or <BR>

<P>function?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Is there sufficient time for procurement of the project or <BR>

<P>service?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     Can the human resource management needs be accommodated and dealt <BR>

<P>with fairly and expeditiously?  And, where applicable, has consideration <BR>

<P>been given to the provisions of FAR Section 52.207-3, Right of First <BR>

<P>Refusal? <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>EXECUTIVE ORDER 12893, PRINCIPLES FOR <BR>

<P>INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     This order, which was issued in January 1994, requires agencies to <BR>

<P>perform systematic analysis of benefits and costs of infrastructure <BR>

<P>programs.  The analysis should be quantitative and monetized to the <BR>

<P>maximum extent practicable, and it should consider a comprehensive set <BR>

<P>of policy options.  The order also is intended to promote efficient <BR>

<P>management through periodic reviews of operations and maintenance, <BR>

<P>pricing, demand management, and related strategies.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Private-sector participation is also encouraged, as agencies should <BR>

<P>work to reduce barriers to private provision of infrastructure.  <BR>

<P>Finally, agencies should encourage State and local recipients of federal <BR>

<P>grants to implement planning and information systems that support the <BR>

<P>above principles and enable the agencies to conduct system-level reviews <BR>

<P>of their programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Major programs (those with annual budgetary resources of $50 <BR>

<P>million or more) should be justified using the principles described <BR>

<P>above.  The order applies to direct spending and grant programs in the <BR>
following areas:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     transportation (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad <BR>

<P>Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Aviation <BR>

<P>Administration, and Coast Guard);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     water resources (Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, <BR>

<P>and Department of Agriculture);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     environmental protection (EPA Clean Water State Revolving Funds <BR>

<P>and proposed Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, and USDA rural water <BR>

<P>and wastewater facilities grants and loans); and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o     energy (Power Marketing Administrations).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>EXECUTIVE ORDER 12803, INFRASTRUCTURE <BR>

<P>PRIVATIZATION<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Executive Order 12803 was issued in April 1992, to encourage <BR>

<P>federal, State and local governments to leverage public and private <BR>

<P>sector investment in infrastructure and to use the equity in existing  <BR>

<P>infrastructure for new or expanded infrastructure.  Prior to E.O. 12803, <BR>

<P>the disposition of Federally-financed infrastructure was controlled by <BR>

<P>the &quot;Common Rule.&quot;  E.O. 12803 added to the &quot;Common Rule,&quot; as follows: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1     .States/locals could consider the sale/lease of assets that would <BR>

<P>continue to be used for original purposes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2     .Federal recoupment for the sale/lease of these assets may be <BR>

<P>calculated by multiplying the original contribution rate by the <BR>

<P>depreciated value.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3     .State/local proceeds could be used for infrastructure, debt or <BR>

<P>tax relief.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The goal is to operate more efficiently and to provide better <BR>

<P>service at the lowest possible cost.  As suggested by Exhibit 3, <BR>

<P>privatization options can be thought of as a continuum; each option is <BR>

<P>effected by changes in personnel, asset ownership, cost, and other <BR>

<P>factors.  The selection of the appropriate option is difficult, and <BR>

<P>agencies should look to whether the option enables them to improve <BR>

<P>customer service (i.e., works better) and/or costs less.  Making this <BR>

<P>determination without customer input will be difficult.

Title: Privatization Resource Guide and Status Report Part III<BR>

<P>Date: February 13, 1995<BR>

<P>Author: National Performance Review and OMB<BR>

<P>ADDITIONAL PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Set forth below is just a sampling of successful privatization <BR>

<P>efforts at federal agencies.  It should not be surprising that the <BR>

<P>Department of Defense seems to have the &quot;lions share&quot; of actions <BR>

<P>underway.  Approximately 70 to 75 percent of the type of initiatives <BR>

<P>which have lent themselves historically to &quot;privatization&quot; fall within <BR>

<P>DOD.  Creativeness and innovation are necessary ingredients to learning <BR>

<P>from the examples at hand and developing new avenues of action.  <BR>

<P>Appendix A contains information about privatization initiatives from the <BR>

<P>recently released fiscal year 1996 budget of the United States.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Department of Defense<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     801-Leased Family Housing Program.  This program created more than <BR>

<P>12,000 military family housing units, on and off-base, which were built, <BR>

<P>financed and in some cases operated by private developers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     802-Rental Guarantee Program.  This program was used to develop <BR>

<P>privately built, operated and financed housing on-base for military <BR>

<P>families.  The owner collects rents directly from qualified tenants. The <BR>
government guarantees a specific occupancy level.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Land Leasing under 10 USC 2667 for Military Family Housing.  <BR>

<P>Started as a test program, the Army awarded two long-term leases to <BR>

<P>private sector developers to build and operate housing developments for <BR>

<P>military families at a base which had a critical housing shortage.  The <BR>

<P>developers received no guarantees and were required to collect rents <BR>

<P>directly for tenants.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Navy Limited Housing Partnership Program.  The Congress recently <BR>

<P>granted the Navy the authority to provide equity capital to developers <BR>

<P>of private sector affordable housing for military families.  The <BR>

<P>government's risk will be limited to its equity contribution, and it may <BR>

<P>share in future profits of each project funded.  Eligible projects must <BR>

<P>be built on privately owned land and will be open to civilian tenants.  <BR>

<P>All tenants will pay rent directly to the owner-operator.<BR>

<P>deployed equipment and supplies for the Marine Corps, this 13 ship fleet <BR>

<P>is owned, crewed and maintained by the private sector.  In times of <BR>

<P>crisis, such as the recent Gulf War, the ships sail from their <BR>

<P>deployment areas to ports near the crisis and off-load cargos of <BR>

<P>equipment to Marines for use in combat or related missions.  Several <BR>

<P>similar government-owned ships are operated by government-contracted <BR>

<P>crews for the other services.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Army Family Medical Care.  The U.S. Army, in support of DOD <BR>

<P>eligible beneficiaries in the Northern Virginia area, has joined with a <BR>

<P>private contractor to provide primary care services within a specific <BR>

<P>geographical area.  Primary care offices (outpatient clinics) have been <BR>

<P>established in civilian residential neighbors which have high <BR>

<P>concentrations of military families.  The offices are manned by <BR>

<P>uniformed and contractor medical personnel.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>     Military Member, Dependent and Retiree Medical Care.  In places <BR>

<P>where eligible service members, their families, and miliary retirees can <BR>

<P>not receive medical care from military hospitals, the DOD contracts with <BR>
private doctors to provide health services.  The administration of this <BR>

<P>program, has been privatized in several areas for the country.  The <BR>

<P>contractor of this billion dollar program provides claims processing and <BR>

<P>provider qualification services that reduce the administrative burden on <BR>

<P>the miliary services.<BR>

<P>       <BR>

<P>     Day Care Centers.  At the Pentagon and Tracy Depot, California, the <BR>

<P>day care centers are owned and operated by private day care providers.  <BR>

<P>The buildings in which the service is provided sit on leased government <BR>

<P>land and have been privately financed.  Users of these services pay <BR>

<P>directly to the provider, who has guaranteed that federal employee <BR>

<P>dependents will have priority in placement and reduced rates.  Day care <BR>

<P>slots not needed for dependents of federal employees can be sold to <BR>

<P>private sector users.  If there is insufficient demand for day care <BR>

<P>services to meet the debt service on the buildings, DOD has committed to <BR>

<P>make-up the short-fall.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Utility Systems.  DOD has privatized power generation, energy <BR>

<P>savings, and water treatment at various bases.  It has purchased utility <BR>

<P>services from private, as well as public, providers.  Utility systems <BR>

<P>have been transferred to communities and utility companies, in exchange <BR>

<P>for continued service, upgrades or cost reductions. <BR>

<P>     Pershing Hall.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently <BR>

<P>entered into a 99-year lease with a private sector developer to <BR>

<P>rehabilitate and operate the famed Pershing Hall in the heart of Paris, <BR>

<P>France.  Built after World War I as a monument to General Pershing and <BR>

<P>American Forces, it fell into disrepair.  The Congress authorized the <BR>

<P>Department to grant the lease in exchange for rehabilitation of the <BR>

<P>building, future cash lease payments and free administrative space and <BR>

<P>ceremonial use during the lease term. The developer is also required to <BR>

<P>establish and maintain a memorial honoring General Pershing.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Day Care.  The VA recently awarded contracts to two day care <BR>

<P>providers to build and operate centers on land owned by the VA in <BR>

<P>Washington, D.C. and New Haven, Connecticut.  In each case, the land was <BR>

<P>leased for 35 years at a nominal ground rent. The providers are required <BR>

<P>to build day care centers that will accommodate a specified number of <BR>

<P>federal employee dependents at set rates. Day care slots in excess of <BR>

<P>those required for federal employee dependents can be used by private <BR>

<P>
<P>EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS (ESOPs) <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     When considering an agency function for privatization, careful <BR>

<P>consideration should be given to transferring that activity to the <BR>

<P>workers who are most familiar with it--the current federal employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>     The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed the potential for <BR>

<P>the creation of &quot;Employee Stock Ownership Programs,&quot; which are also <BR>

<P>known as ESOPs.  In the private sector, employees are taking over their <BR>

<P>businesses and providing competitive services at an ever increasing <BR>

<P>rate.  Over the past ten years an innovative approach to the conversion <BR>

<P>of employees to owners, called a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan <BR>

<P>(ESOP), has created new opportunities for employees to become owners of <BR>

<P>their companies, while protecting jobs and creating new pension <BR>

<P>opportunities.    <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Successful ESOP's have been created in the airline, construction, <BR>

<P>consulting, and car rental industries, just to name a few.  Federal <BR>

<P>employees have generally not been considered potential owners by <BR>

<P>managers seeking to privatize federal functions or projects.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     From relative obscurity in the early 1970's, there are now over <BR>

<P>10,000 employee ownership plans, involving 11 million workers - and the <BR>

<P>numbers are growing.  According to the National Center for Employee <BR>

<P>Ownership, ESOPs control over $150 billion in corporate stock, excluding <BR>

<P>$140 billion owned through 401(k) plans.  <BR>

<P>
<P>     An equity-based, deferred compensation plan, ESOPs are IRS <BR>

<P>recognized, tax qualified, defined contribution plans that invest <BR>

<P>primarily in the stock of the employer.  Though there are several forms <BR>

<P>of employee stock ownership, this document is designed to provide a <BR>

<P>conceptual framework for the inclusion of ESOPs as a part of agency <BR>

<P>reviews that consider the conversion of work from in-house to contract <BR>

<P>performance.  It briefly describes the legal and financial structures <BR>

<P>necessary to establish ESOPs and the restrictions posed by Federal <BR>

<P>Acquisition Regulations, ethics and conflict of interest statutes.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The information should be useful to employees whose work is being <BR>

<P>considered for conversion to private sector performance and to those <BR>

<P>interested in submitting offers to perform such work.  It should be <BR>

<P>particularly helpful to federal employees involved in DOD Base Closures, <BR>

<P>service termination decisions, OMB Circular A-76 cost comparisons or <BR>

<P>other privatization initiatives, permitted or required by law.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The Federal Employee Conversion to Ownership Plan (FED CO-OP) <BR>

<P>incorporates ESOP concepts to facilitate the transition of Federal <BR>

<P>employees to private sector performance, provide limited employment <BR>

<P>guarantees, pension portability, stock ownership, opportunities to share <BR>

<P>profits, and other incentives that may serve to mitigate the potential <BR>

<P>adverse employee impacts of an agency's conversion decision.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>HOW THEY OPERATE<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     An employee-owned business is a voluntary association of <BR>

<P>individuals who incorporate themselves to do business for profit.  The <BR>

<P>business is both owned and operated, in whole or in part, by the <BR>

<P>employees.  To create an ESOP, the employees involved must form an <BR>

<P>association that is designed to work toward the creation of an ESOP.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The association borrows money--often from the company itself--to <BR>

<P>purchase corporate stock, which is then placed in trust for the <BR>

<P>employees.  The trust, acting for the employees, buys an established <BR>

<P>number of shares of company stock at predetermined rates over a number <BR>

<P>of years, until it owns the negotiated percentage.  The sponsoring <BR>

<P>company invests in the ESOP by making defined contributions to the plan <BR>

<P>each year, which is then used by the trust to repay the loans taken out <BR>

<P>to buy the stock.  <BR>

<P>
<P>     The trust then allocates the shares to individual employee accounts <BR>

<P>in accordance with a pre-determined formula, which may include salary, <BR>

<P>seniority and other vesting considerations.  The employees receive <BR>

<P>salaries, other fringe benefits, including pensions, as well as <BR>

<P>dividends or profits.  The shares entitle the employees to some control <BR>

<P>over the business through the stock held in trust and through direct <BR>

<P>ownership.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Because the corporate contributions to the ESOP are fully tax <BR>

<P>deductible, both the principle and the interest payments on ESOP loans <BR>

<P>(to purchase stock) are tax deductible to the sponsoring corporation.  <BR>

<P>Indeed ESOPs are unique in that lending institutions may deduct 50 <BR>

<P>percent of their interest income on loans to leveraged ESOPs if the ESOP <BR>

<P>owns more than 50 percent of the corporate sponsor's stock.  When an <BR>

<P>employee leaves the firm, the company or the trust buys back the shares <BR>

<P>at an appraised value, if not otherwise publicly available. <BR>

<P>    <BR>

<P>     FED CO-OP should be considered by agencies as a part of their <BR>

<P>overall contracting out review strategy.  Once a commercial requirement <BR>

<P>is identified for possible conversion to contract performance, Federal <BR>

<P>employees may opt to form an association for the purposes of developing <BR>

<P>an ESOP bid.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The government, in concert with existing ethics and conflict of <BR>

<P>interest statutes, may award a service contract to any firm bidding with <BR>

<P>ESOPs as a part of their overall approach and may opt to limit offers to <BR>

<P>those that include ESOP provisions.  The government may also include the <BR>

<P>ESOP provisions in their overall evaluation and selection of best <BR>

<P>offers.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If an ESOP service contract is awarded, the employees would be <BR>

<P>performing essentially their same jobs--but as private contractors not <BR>

<P>as federal employees.  This is a win-win situation for the Government <BR>

<P>and the employees.  The Government benefits from continuity of service, <BR>
 
<P>increases in productivity, cost efficiencies and efforts to mitigate the <BR>

<P>adverse impacts on employees.  The employees have continued employment, <BR>

<P>stock ownership, increased control over their lives and the opportunity <BR>

<P>for increased financial rewards.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     FED CO-OP service contracts may be awarded non-competitively or <BR>

<P>competitively using a wide variety of sole source, source selection, <BR>

<P>partnerships, and other procurements.  In return for a commitment to set <BR>

<P>up an ESOP, an agency could simply transfer the existing employees who <BR>

<P>want to participate, personal property and equipment to the new (ESOP) <BR>

<P>service contractor.  The ESOP would then hire any additional employees <BR>

<P>needed.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Equipment transfers could be made at no cost, minimal cost, on a <BR>

<P>leveraged buy-out basis or transferred at book value.  Real property <BR>

<P>assets could be retained by the Government and made available to the <BR>

<P>ESOP on a case-by-case basis.  Another alternative would be to provide <BR>

<P>existing equipment and facilities as Government Owned and Contractor <BR>

<P>Operated (GOCO).  Again, the service contractor could be owned in whole <BR>

<P>or in part by employees.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The contract and the assets transferred or otherwise made available <BR>

<P>should be sufficient for the ESOP to obtain financing and perform <BR>

<P>required services.  Indeed, the service contract could be structured to <BR>

<P>require offerors to provide a stated percentage of the initial <BR>

<P>capitalization necessary to fund the ESOP.  Thus, the Government could <BR>

<P>transfer some portion of its short term (3 to 5 years) savings to the <BR>

<P>affected federal workers.  After the initial performance period, the <BR>

<P>function will be available for competitive award.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The goal of FED CO-OP is to change the workplace culture by <BR>

<P>creating incentives for cost effective services and to mitigate the <BR>

<P>adverse impacts of an agency decision to convert to private sector <BR>

<P>performance.  ESOPs can, however, also be expensive to set up and run.  <BR>

<P>The legal, accounting, actuarial, and appraisal fees for a small or even <BR>

<P>mid-sized ESOP can total $50,000.  Annual expenses in the administration <BR>

<P>of trust accounts and annual appraisals should be expected to exceed <BR>

<P>$10,000 per year.  Thus, it is recommended that agencies and employees <BR>

<P>consider only activities with a minimum  annual payroll of over $500,000 <BR>

<P>for FED CO-OP. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>SELECTING ACTIVITIES FOR FED CO-OP<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The agency, in conjunction with the employee unions and the private <BR>

<P>sector, must identify a specific level of commercial work that is <BR>

<P>subject to conversion to contract performance, in accordance with the <BR>

<P>Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) Policy Letter 92-1, dated  <BR>

<P>September 23, 1992.  Only commercial work is subject to FED CO-OP.  Four <BR>

<P>additional criteria should also be considered.  They are:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1     .In addition to being a recurring commercial activity, the <BR>

<P>business line should be one for which there is also a continuing need in <BR>

<P>the private sector.  This will permit the ESOP to diversify and enter <BR>

<P>into non-Federal markets, thereby strengthening the ESOPs viability and <BR>

<P>the potential benefits to employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2     .The agency or association must have a reasonable expectation that <BR>

<P>the ESOP is a financially viable option.  Revenue and cost, market, <BR>

<P>capitalization and even a merger and acquisition analysis may be <BR>

<P>required.  Without a strong potential for earning a reasonable profit, a <BR>

<P>company does not qualify for an ESOP.  General feasibility studies may <BR>

<P>be conducted by the government, in cooperation with the employees union <BR>

<P>or association.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3     .The activity or business line must be large enough to be <BR>

<P>financially viable as a business entity.  By law, the ESOP may cover the <BR>

<P>lessor of 50 employees or 40 percent of all employees in the <BR>
corporation.  Activities that could involve less that 50 employees must <BR>

<P>be approved by the Department of Labor, which must determine that the <BR>

<P>plan covers only employees of a collective bargaining unit.  (see IRC <BR>

<P>401 (a)(26)(d) and 410 (b)(3)(A).)  This may mean that certain <BR>

<P>management employees included in the conversion will need to become <BR>

<P>bargaining unit employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4     .The agency must have the authority to contract out for commercial <BR>

<P>services.  In recent years, Congress has restricted the Executive <BR>

<P>Branch's and certain agencies' ability to contract out, or levied <BR>

<P>specific requirements affecting how conversions may be accomplished.  In <BR>

<P>addition to specific agency authorization or appropriations language, <BR>

<P>the provisions of Section 5(g) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring <BR>

<P>Act (103-226) and OMB Circular A-76 may apply.  An agency's General <BR>

<P>Counsel or A-76 Program Manager should be consulted to determine any <BR>

<P>limitations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     To the extent that the provision of Section 5(g) or OMB Circular A-<BR>

<P>76 apply, and absent any other enabling legislation, a cost savings <BR>

<P>must, generally, be identified in order to justify the conversion of <BR>

<P>work from in-house to contract performance.  Experience with A-76 <BR>
indicates that costs average twenty to 30 percent less in functions <BR>

<P>which are converted to contract.

<P>
<P>OTHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND FEDERAL <BR>

<P>ETHICS LIMITATIONS<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Employee support and participation in the development of any <BR>

<P>privatization initiative is fundamental to the success of the process.  <BR>

<P>However, to ensure compliance with conflict-of-interest laws (18 USC 201 <BR>

<P>et. seq.) and ethics considerations and to protect employee interests, <BR>

<P>care must be taken to insulate employees from the government's decision <BR>

<P>process.  Care must also be taken to ensure that employees do not <BR>

<P>represent the interests of potential or current contractors, while still <BR>

<P>federal employees.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Any employee involved in the performance of the function under <BR>

<P>review and any employee that is directly involved in the development of <BR>

<P>the government's procurement documents is potentially at risk.  The risk <BR>

<P>is that their involvement could qualify them as &quot;procurement officials&quot; <BR>
and, therefore, not eligible for employment by the service contractor in <BR>

<P>a role which they helped create.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     For example, the Procurement Integrity Act and the Federal <BR>

<P>Acquisition Regulations define a procurement official as any civilian or <BR>

<P>military official or employee who has participated &quot;personally and <BR>

<P>substantially&quot; in any of the following activities:  drafting a <BR>

<P>specification or statement of work; review or approval of a <BR>

<P>specification or statement of work; preparation or development of a <BR>

<P>procurement or purchase request; preparation or issuance of a <BR>

<P>solicitation; evaluation of bids or proposals; source selection; <BR>

<P>contract negotiation or the review and approval of a contract award or <BR>

<P>modification.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If the award is contingent upon a cost comparison conducted <BR>

<P>pursuant to Section 5(g) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act or <BR>

<P>OMB Circular A-76, employees who are substantially involved in the <BR>

<P>development and approval of the Management Plan, Most Efficient <BR>

<P>Organization and Government Bid may also be considered procurement <BR>

<P>officials.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The Procurement Integrity Act, 41 USC 423, governs the <BR>

<P>relationships between Government officials and current or potential <BR>
contractors.  The conflict of interest statutes, which include 18 USC <BR>

<P>210, 203, 205 and 208, generally prohibit any Federal employee from <BR>

<P>engaging in official activities that could conflict with personal <BR>

<P>interests.  The &quot;revolving door&quot; or post- employment restrictions at 18 <BR>

<P>USC 207 may also apply.  In some cases, Part 3.601 of the FAR may apply, <BR>

<P>which prohibits the award of a contract to a government employee or to a <BR>

<P>business concern or other organization owned or substantially owned or <BR>

<P>controlled by one or more government employees.  As noted in the FAR, <BR>

<P>however, this restriction is intended to avoid any conflict of interest <BR>

<P>that might arise between the employee's interests and the employee's <BR>

<P>continuing government duties.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     As privatization does not propose to award contracts to federal <BR>

<P>employees while still employed by the federal government, this is not <BR>

<P>seen as a major cause for concern.  Other restrictions, such as those of <BR>

<P>10 USC 2397 or Section 3.104 of the FAR, may apply to specific agency <BR>

<P>employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     As a practical matter, these restrictions do not materially affect <BR>

<P>most privatization initiatives or most of the employees involved, but <BR>
they could.  Employees should be consulted prior to making the actual <BR>

<P>decision to participate in a privatization initiative, but they must be <BR>

<P>protected from violating these conflict-of-interest laws.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Office of Government Ethics attorneys have stated that they &quot;do not <BR>

<P>believe that involvement in making an &quot;initial cut&quot; in potentially <BR>

<P>privatizable operations would create an actionable conflict of interest <BR>

<P>because the likelihood of financial gain would be too speculative.&quot;  The <BR>

<P>GSA General Counsel, Emily Hewitt, has assembled a file on these <BR>

<P>considerations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The point of this discussion is that agencies should factor this <BR>

<P>consideration in their early planning to minimize the risk that it could <BR>

<P>later dislodge their plans or prejudice the post-employment <BR>

<P>opportunities of the employees most knowledgeable about the agency's <BR>

<P>functions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>OVER-REACTION TO PROCUREMENT PROBLEMS <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Several corporatizing initiatives focus on the need to take the <BR>

<P>activity from under the Brooks Act and similar statutes.  Where <BR>

<P>inadequacies of the federal procurement process are the principal reason <BR>

<P>for undertaking the change in the nature of the entity, it is suggested <BR>

<P>that it might be easier to obtain Congressional action to waive the <BR>

<P>offending statutes rather than setting up a totally new entity.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Federal agencies do undertake timely procurements without protest.  <BR>

<P>The National Aeronautic and Space Administration's $800 million dollar <BR>

<P>&quot;SEWP&quot; procurement for seven classes of computer workstations and <BR>

<P>integration services is a case in point.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     It was recently highlighted by officials of the Congressional <BR>

<P>Research Service that &quot;procurement is only one of 15 or so activities of <BR>

<P>management...Because it involves money, and it's in the area where <BR>

<P>government and private industry interface, it has a high risk.  But <BR>

<P>still, it's only one aspect.&quot;  The remedy should fit the need.<BR>

<P>PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES IN THE FY 1996 BUDGET<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     The President's FY 1996 Federal Budget includes a number of new and <BR>

<P>creative privatization initiatives.  Because of the format used, many of <BR>

<P>these initiatives are not contained in a single section of the Budget.  <BR>

<P>Therefore, the following is a resource compilation, using the titles of <BR>

<P>sections and page numbers, of the initiatives discussed with quotes or <BR>

<P>summaries for each initiative.  This summary is designed to enhance an <BR>

<P>understanding of the initiatives included in the FY 1996 Budget and to <BR>

<P>assist Federal managers as they review current approaches to existing <BR>

<P>programs.  <BR>

<P>
<P>     Page 137 - Using Performance Information in the Budget Process.  <BR>

<P>&quot;OMB's budget review of the Housing and Urban Development Department <BR>

<P>(HUD) found that the quality of public housing compared unfavorably with <BR>

<P>private low-income housing and subsidized housing alternatives in terms <BR>

<P>of their physical condition, crime problems and neighborhood <BR>

<P>environment.  Partly due to such information, OMB agreed with HUD to <BR>

<P>&quot;end public housing as we know it&quot; by shifting assistance to portable <BR>

<P>vouchers by 1998.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 137 - Integrating Financial and Performance Information.  &quot;In <BR>

<P>addition, we will propose legislation to require that the full accruing <BR>

<P>cost of pensions (and other costs) be reflected in future agency budgets <BR>

<P>to help link program resources with the outputs and outcomes they <BR>

<P>generate.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>Reinventing the Federal Government--Phase II<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;While preparing this Budget, the President asked his senior <BR>

<P>advisors as well as the departments and agencies for bold, creative, <BR>

<P>innovative, new ideas about how to deliver services and benefits to the <BR>

<P>American people...  In the reviews that produced the five major <BR>

<P>restructuring in this budget, the Administration organized its ideas <BR>

<P>around a few basis themes:  Consolidation, Devolution, Privatization and <BR>

<P>Termination.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 144 - HUD.  &quot;These reforms will create new performance <BR>

<P>partnerships between HUD, State and local governments, the private <BR>

<P>by over 4,000 as a direct result...<BR>

<P>physical assets such as military hardware and highways.  Automobiles and <BR>

<P>consumer appliances are also included in this category.  The total <BR>

<P>1994.  By comparison, GDP was less than $7 trillion.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;The Federal Government's contribution to this stock of capital <BR>

<P>includes its own physical assets plus $0.5 trillion in accumulated <BR>

<P>Fund.  In addition, it plans to sell excess uranium and a portion of the <BR>

<P>Weeks Island, Louisiana, site.&quot;  &quot;The five year 1996- 2000 total <BR>

<P>proceeds are estimated at $7,324 million.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 94 - Physical Investment.  &quot;Outlays for the acquisition of <BR>

<P>major equipment are estimated to be $6.4 billion in 1996.  The largest <BR>

<P>items are for the space program and the air traffic control system.  <BR>

<P>Collections for the sale of facilities are expected to exceed <BR>

<P>disbursements by $0.3 billion, largely due to the proposed sale of the <BR>

<P>United States Enrichment Corporation.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;Grants to State and local governments for physical investments are <BR>

<P>estimated to be $39.3 billion in 1996.  More than half of these outlays <BR>

<P>or $22.9 billion, are to assist States and localities with <BR>

<P>transportation infrastructure, including the proposed new unified <BR>

<P>transportation infrastructure block grant for 1996.  Other major grants <BR>

<P>for physical investment fund sewage treatment plants, community <BR>

<P>development, and public housing.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>     Page 100 - OMB Bulletin 94-08.  &quot;OMB Bulletin 94-08, Planning and <BR>

<P>Budgeting for the Acquisition of Fixed Assets was developed to provide <BR>
guidance for agencies on what fixed asset planning should include.  <BR>

<P>Agencies were requested to approach planning for fixed assets in the <BR>

<P>context of strategic plans to carry out their missions, and to consider <BR>

<P>alternative methods of meeting their goals.  Systematic analysis of the <BR>

<P>full life-cycle expected costs and benefits was required, along with <BR>

<P>risk analysis and assessment of alternative means of acquiring assets.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 100 - Funding Mechanisms.  &quot;This budget proposes to make <BR>

<P>agencies responsible for fixed assets by giving them the authority to <BR>

<P>acquire and manage such assets in the most cost effective manner <BR>

<P>available.&quot;  This proposal would transform the General Services <BR>

<P>Administration into a government-wide policy and oversight organization <BR>

<P>for administrative services, except for personnel services.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 101 - Major Acquisition Proposals.  &quot;The 1996 budget requests <BR>

<P>$1.0 billion for GSA for the construction or acquisition of buildings.  <BR>

<P>GSA has traditionally funded the construction, as well as operations and <BR>

<P>renovations, through the Federal Buildings Fund.  However, this budget <BR>

<P>proposes a direct appropriation for the construction and acquisition of <BR>

<P>general and special purpose space to house Federal agency requirements.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>     Page 113 - Investments in National Capital.  &quot;Table 7-11 <BR>

<P>illustrates the unified budget reorganized as GAO recommends to have a <BR>

<P>separate component for investment in national capital.  The component is <BR>

<P>roughly estimated to be $120 billion in 1996.  It includes <BR>

<P>infrastructure outlays financed by Federal grants to State and local <BR>

<P>governments, such as highways and sewer projects, as well as direct <BR>

<P>Federal purchases of infrastructure, such as electric power generation <BR>

<P>flood insurance program has raised the possibility of investigating ways <BR>

<P>to privatize non-catastrophic portions of the program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;Also, consistent with the flood insurance program, future <BR>

<P>are three proposals in this year's budget that recommend such <BR>

<P>privatization.<BR>

<P>       &quot;The Administration is considering submitting legislation which <BR>

<P>would fully privatize The College Construction Loan Insurance <BR>

<P>Association (Connie Lee) by divesting the Secretary of Education's stock <BR>

<P>ownership in the corporation and repealing the Corporation's enabling <BR>

<P>legislation.&quot;  &quot;The Administration is also considering proposing <BR>

<P>legislation to privatize the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie <BR>

<P>Mae).&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;The budget proposes to completely privatize the Rural Telephone <BR>

<P>Bank (RTB) at the beginning of 1996, after which it would continue its <BR>

<P>mission as a private lender.&quot;   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Page 167 - Aid to State and Local Governments - Highlights of the <BR>

<P>Federal Aid Program.  &quot;The Administration is proposing a variety of <BR>

<P>consolidations to provide greater flexibility and increase <BR>

<P>accountability.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;Over three years, HUD will consolidate 60 programs into three <BR>

<P>flexible, performance based funds and transform public housing into a <BR>
system that works for people and communities.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     &quot;At DOT, the proposed State Infrastructure Banks program will <BR>

<P>provide $2 billion to capitalize new State infrastructure banks.  These <BR>

<P>banks will enable jurisdictions to leverage more easily public and <BR>

<P>private resources for transportation infrastructure and encourage more <BR>

<P>business like strategies for financing the national transportation <BR>

<P>system.&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;GOGO TO GOCO--ON THE ROAD TO PRIVATIZATION&quot; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR PETROLEUM AND ENERGY RESEARCH<BR>

<P>BARTLESVILLE, OKLAHOMA<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     In October 1983, the Department of Energy (DOE) began the move to <BR>

<P>privatize its center in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  In 1983, it was a <BR>

<P>Government-owned and Government-operated (GOGO) facility with a staff of <BR>

<P>about 160.  Today, it is a Government-owned but Contractor-operated <BR>

<P>(GOCO) facility with a staff of about 250.  Renamed as the National <BR>

<P>Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER), the center is run <BR>

<P>by the BDM Corporation, and does an increasing volume of business with <BR>

<P>the private sector.  This is a ten-year success story along the road to <BR>

<P>privatization, and the lessons learned along the way may be useful to <BR>

<P>others.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     To establish NIPER, the DOE issued a request for proposals to not-<BR>

<P>for-profit corporations with the long term idea that the winner would <BR>

<P>bring new energy to the endeavor, that existing civil servants would <BR>

<P>move into positions with the new entity, and that over a period of <BR>

<P>several years, DOE would divest itself of the activity entirely.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The IIT Research Institute in Chicago won the initial competition, <BR>

<P>and while they brought in new business from outside of government, the <BR>

<P>volume was affected greatly by the precipitous drop in oil prices from <BR>

<P>$42 to $22 for a barrel of crude oil.  The industry was confused on how <BR>

<P>to make research and other investment decisions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The initial contract with IITRI was for five years with an option, <BR>

<P>which was extended--DOE was not able to totally divest itself of NIPER <BR>

<P>during the initial term of the contract as planned.  In 1993, DOE made <BR>

<P>the decision to open the competition to for-profit corporations, and it <BR>

<P>was won by the BDM Corporation.  Some believe in retrospect, that the <BR>

<P>initial contract should have been open to for-profit corporations as <BR>

<P>well as not-for-profit entities for a variety of reasons, including the <BR>

<P>initial need for investment capital in undertaking such a venture.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The parameters of the BDM contract with DOE are that the facility <BR>

<P>is operated as a Government-Owned-Contractor Operated Facility much like <BR>

<P>other DOE Management and Operations (M&amp;O) contracts.  The contract is <BR>

<P>cost plus award fee for five years at a ceiling of $211 million, <BR>

<P>excluding work for others.  A subcontractor is the University of Tulsa.  <BR>

<P>The NIPER facility covers a 17-acre campus of 16 buildings with over <BR>

<P>155,000 square feet of laboratory space with a variety of high-tech <BR>

<P>equipment including CT and NMR Scans, mass spectroscopy, and multiphase <BR>

<P>permeability apparatus.  In addition to DOE, its clients include <BR>

<P>Phillips Petroleum, Akzo Chemicals, Intratech, Design Institute for <BR>

<P>Physical Properties Measurement, America Petroleum Institute, ARCO, <BR>

<P>Shell, the Department of the Navy, the Advanced Research Program Agency, <BR>

<P>and the Defense Fuel Supply Command.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Even though the price of oil is still low, there is an increasing <BR>

<P>demand for NIPER's services by the private sector.  It seems that <BR>

<P>companies are divesting themselves of their research interests and <BR>

<P>buying the capability from NIPER.    <BR>

<TITLE>Background on Oregon Option</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<H1 align=center>Background on Oregon Option</H1>
The announcement was made in Portland, OR, a state that has pioneered
an outstanding federal-state-local partnership. For several years, Oregon
has experimented with results-driven government based on "benchmarks,"
standards that all levels of government can share in achieving, such as
higher reading levels for children.
<P>
In 1994, Oregon proposed to use these community-developed benchmarks
to turn the federal-state relationship upside down. The federal government
said yes. On December 5, 1994, Vice President Gore signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Governor and other officials to carry out the
<a href="http://libmail.chemek.cc.or.us/~rilg/OR_OPT/contents.htm">"Oregon Option."</a> 
Under the agreement--the first of its kind--federal, state,
and local officials are working together to test service delivery based on
the results that Oregon plans to achieve. The agreement stresses outcomes,
not processes, and puts faith in state and localities' decisions ahead 
of rigid regulations that dictate how federal monies can be spent. 
<P>
The Oregon Option led to greater interagency cooperation and a series of
federal waivers and flexibilities that the state is using to leapfrog over
bureaucratic barriers. Federal partners are the Departments of Housing and
Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Labor, Commerce,
Education, Justice, and Interior and the Office of Management and Budget.
<P>
For more information about the Oregon Option, call Connie Revell in Oregon at
(503) 986-0246. If there's no answer, call (503) 986-0244.

<TITLE>	Clinton Admin. has Forged New Partnerships with States and Localities</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<P>
<B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS FORGED NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH STATES AND LOCALITIES</B><BR>

<P><B>Waivers for Welfare, Medicaid, and Food Stamp Reform -- President Clinton has given 35 States welfare reform waivers and 12 States statewide Medicaid waivers</B>, waiving provisions of the Social Security Act so States can test better ways to provide for health and human services to their low-income populations.  The Clinton Administration has also provided over 700 specific waivers to the Food Stamp Act, 167 related to welfare reform projects and over 500 for other purposes request by states.<BR>

<P><B>Waivers for Education Reform</B> -- The Department of Education has approved 84 waivers under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Goals 2000 to provide flexibility in order to improve academic achievement.  The Department of Education also determined that for 47 additional requests, no waiver was required.  In addition, the Administration has approved five Ed-Flex applications, delegating the Secretary of Educations Goals 2000 waiver authority to Oregon, Kansas, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Texas.  What this means is these five States can now provide waiver authority to their local school districts WITHOUT coming to the U.S. Department of Education for permission.  Some of the examples of waivers that have been approved to date:<BR>

<P>	The Fort Worth, Texas School District received a waiver allowing it to target an extra portion of its Title I dollars to four high poverty, inner-city elementary schools.  The schools were chosen for a complete overhaul due to low achievement of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills an other factors.  Each school uses Title I funds to improve instruction for all its students and is reorganizing staff, lengthening the school year, focusing on teaching reading and math, providing extensive teacher training, and strengthening links to the community.<BR>
	<BR>
	As part of Oregons comprehensive school improvement efforts, the States Department of Education received a waiver to form innovative consortia, including both community colleges and school districts, for the use of Perkins funds.  The consortia will receive Perkins funds to provide high quality vocational education programs to both high school and post-secondary students.  Without the waiver, this type of collaboration would not have been possible.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>Reduced Regulations</B> --All Federal departments continue to eliminate and reduce burdensome regulations.  The Department of Education for example has eliminated two-thirds of its regulations for elementary and education programs that have been reauthorized since the beginning of the Clinton Administration).  In total, federal workers are sending 16,000 pages of obsolete regulations to the scrap heat and reworking 31,000 more pages of 86,000 pages of regulations which have been reviewed.<BR>

<P><B>Unfunded Mandates</B> -- As a former governor, the President fully understands the burdens state and localities face when the federal government imposes mandates without providing adequate funding.  In October 1993 President Clinton signed the first Executive Order requiring all federal agencies to consult with state and local organizations before promulgating any new rules or regulations that impose new unfunded mandates.  The President also signed the Unfunded Mandates Act into law March 1995, a law which now requires Congress to address statutory unfunded mandates.<BR>

<P><B>Environmental Reform</B>:<BR>

<P>	EPA has already removed over 25,000 of its 38,000 sites from the Superfund tracking system.  These were sites that EPA had already investigated and determined No further remedial action planned.  Thousands of these sites have no contamination at all while others are being addressed by State cleanup programs.  These sites can be candidates for redevelopment, but potential developers were shying away from them simply because they were in the federal tracking system.<BR>
	<BR>
	Under the Brownsfields Initiative, EPA is working with States and cities to redevelop inner city industrial sites, returning contaminated land to productive use and creating jobs.<BR>

<P><B>School to Work</B> -- A joint initiative of the Departments of Education and Labor, the School-to-Work initiative is focused on helping States build statewide school-to-work systems.  The initiatives offer young Americans access to programs designed to prepare them for first jobs in high-skill, high-wage careers, and increase their opportunities for further education and training.  State and local partnerships may apply for waivers of regulatory or legislative requirements under numerous education and training programs to achieve these outcomes.<BR>

<P>The <B>Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community</B> initiatives in 105 localities have strengthened the bond not only between the federal government and states and localities, but directly between states and their communities.  As part of a new way of doing business, the federal government is working with communities in response to over 200 requests for flexibility from the federal government.  The federal efforts include working directly with states as partners in responding to solutions that best fit the need of each community.  Each Governor as well as State agency staff have been invited to a White Empowerment Zone Conference at the end of February.<BR>

<P><B>More Flexibility Needed</B> -- The Administration supports legislation -- the Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act, introduced by Senator Hatfield -- to provide bottom up solutions from states and localities to provide much greater flexibility in the use of federal funds in exchange for accountability for results.<BR>

<P><B>Existing Performance Partnerships</B> -- We are working in partnership with several States to provide increased flexibility and improve results Americans care about.  An intergovernmental, interagency partnership was begin with Oregon in December 1994 to work together towards specific measurable goals  -- with all partners breaking down barriers to meeting those goals.  We focus on outcomes such as the number of teenage girls per 1,000 who become pregnant, as opposed to the number of visits to clinics.  We also have ongoing partnerships with Indiana and West Virginia as those States explore ways to consolidate requirements for 199 federal grant programs targeted to children and families.  We are about to enter into a partnership with the State of Connecticut based on that States innovative new law, the Neighborhood Revitalization Act, which requires the State to break down barriers in response to neighborhoods comprehensive plans and measurable goals to revitalize their economies and their neighborhoods.  We have similar performance partnerships with several cities.<BR>

<P><B>Presidents Proposals for More Performance Partnerships</B> -- The Presidents FY 1996 Budget proposed a set of Performance Partnerships to increase state and local flexibility on HOW a program is run in exchange for increased accountability for results.  These proposals are still in various stages of the legislative process.<BR>

<P>	At HUD, the President proposed to consolidate 60 programs into three flexible performance-based funds.<BR>
	<BR>
	At HHS, the President proposed to consolidate over 100 public health programs into several performance partnership grants.<BR>
	<BR>
	At EPA, the President proposed to allow States to consolidate up to 12 media-specific grants (such as air, water, and hazardous waste), enabling states to target resources toward  their most pressing priorities while still abiding by Federal law.<BR>
	<BR>
	At Agriculture, the President proposed to combine funding for 14 rural development loan and grant programs.<BR>
	<BR>
	At the Departments of Labor and Education, the President proposed to combine 70 education and job training programs into one system to provide substantial flexibility for state and local governments to design systems, to empower individuals to choose their own training, and to hold providers accountable for program performance. <BR>

<P> ****************<BR>

<P> ACCOMPLISHMENTS:<BR>

<P> **************** <BR>

<P> Legislation Enacted<BR>

<P> *******************<BR>

<P> Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities -- The Omnibus <BR>

<P> Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) includes a new grant program <BR>

<P> under Title XX of the Social Security Act for the establishment of <BR>

<P> empowerment zones and enterprise communities. This initiative is <BR>

<P> designed to revitalize communities through both economic and human <BR>

<P> development using bottom up (community level) comprehensive and <BR>

<P> collaborative strategic planning.  Grants and tax incentives will be <BR>

<P> provided to 105 communities (9 empowerment zones and 95 enterprise <BR>

<P> communities) in urban and rural areas who demonstrate economic <BR>

<P> distress.  By a Presidential Directive issued September 9, 1993, the <BR>

<P> President established an interagency Community Enterprise Board, <BR>

<P> chaired by the Vice President, to oversee the initiative. Through <BR>

<P> this board, for which the President's Assistants for economic and <BR>

<P> domestic policy serve as vice-chairs and heads of key Federal <BR>

<P> Departments serve as members, communities will be given broad <BR>

<P> flexibility and assistance in coordinating and integrating services <BR>

<P> in the target areas. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Goals 2000: Educate America Act -- <BR>

<P> Goals 2000, P.L. 103-227, has been established to improve learning <BR>

<P> and teaching by providing a national framework for education reform; <BR>

<P> to promote the research, consensus building, and systemic changes <BR>

<P> needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities and high levels <BR>

<P> of educational achievement for all students; to provide a framework <BR>

<P> for reauthorization of all Federal education programs; and, to <BR>

<P> promote the development and adoption of a voluntary national system <BR>

<P> of skill standards and certifications, as well as for other purposes.  <BR>

<P> The Act contains measures for systemic educational reform using both <BR>

<P> top-down and bottoms-up strategies.  State and local educational <BR>

<P> agencies are encouraged to develop comprehensive improvement plans <BR>

<P> that will provide a coherent framework for the implementation of <BR>

<P> reauthorized Federal education and related programs in an integrated <BR>

<P> fashion.  States may receive an allotment of funds for systemic <BR>

<P> improvement efforts and must submit a State Improvement Plan after <BR>

<P> its first year of funding.  The Secretary has been given authority to <BR>

<P> waive Federal statutory and regulatory requirements to enhance <BR>

<P> flexibility in the implementation of systemic improvement plans.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, Goals 2000 establishes six flexibility demonstration <BR>

<P> projects under the &quot;Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration <BR>

<P> Act&quot;.  Under this demonstration, States can apply for designation as <BR>

<P> one of the six &quot;Ed-Flex Partnership States&quot; which would give them the <BR>

<P> authority to waiver any statutory or regulatory requirement <BR>

<P> applicable to any program or Act as described in the law without <BR>

<P> seeking approval from the Department of Education.  States will be <BR>

<P> eligible for designation if they have prepared an improvement plan, <BR>

<P> have waived State statutory and regulatory requirements for the local <BR>

<P> authorities within the demonstration area, and have established <BR>

<P> performance measures for ensuring accountability to outcomes in the <BR>

<P> improvement plans.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Strategic Management Framework <BR>

<P> (RCRA) -- EPA's RCRA governs the disposal of solid waste.  Beginning <BR>

<P> in 1992, the RCRA program established a flexible process for <BR>

<P> allocating RCRA permitting funds.  States and EPA prioritize among <BR>

<P> the facilities that they want to permit using a numerical ranking <BR>

<P> system called the Priority Ranking System.  If certain facilities of <BR>

<P> concern to the state do not fall within the high-priority ranking, <BR>

<P> states have the option of &quot;bumping them up&quot; by demonstrating that <BR>

<P> permitting these facilities would be of considerable environmental <BR>

<P> benefit such as providing new capacity or demonstrating a new <BR>

<P> technology, cross- media approach, or waste minimization method.  An <BR>

<P> additional 15% of all state facilities may be moved into the high-<BR>

<P> priority rank if they are of particular concern to the public or the <BR>

<P> state.  The RCRA enforcement program uses a similarly flexible <BR>

<P> program called RIP FLEX (RCRA Implementation Plan Flexibility).<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Amendments -- <BR>

<P> These amendments give states discretion to establish State Human <BR>

<P> Resource Investment Councils (HRIC) to coordinate Federal human <BR>

<P> resource assistance programs.  The amendments also create a new <BR>

<P> youth-focused title (Title IIC) that enhances state flexibility and <BR>

<P> encourages greater state innovation to find effective ways to <BR>

<P> increase youth employment and earnings.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Mickey Leland Hunger Prevention Act -- <BR>

<P> This bill contained several provisions to improve the conformity of <BR>

<P> certain Food Stamp Program rules with Aid to Families with Dependent <BR>

<P> Children Program rules.  These provisions were to:<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P>      o    Exclude non-title IV educational assistance.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Exclude from income determination up to $50 in child <BR>

<P> support for all FSP households. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Increase the Employment and Training Program (E&amp;T) <BR>

<P> dependent care reimbursement limits to $200 for children under age 2 <BR>

<P> and $175 for all other children.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Increase the dependent care deduction caps to $200 for <BR>

<P> children under age 2 and $175 for all other dependents.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Allow States the option to increase the E&amp;T participant <BR>

<P> reimbursement cap for expenses other than dependent care above a <BR>

<P> minimum of $25.<BR>

<P>      <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Congress enacted the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act.  The <BR>

<P> Act adopted the Mickey Leland Hunger Prevention Act provisions to <BR>

<P> increase the E&amp;T dependent care reimbursement limits and dependent <BR>

<P> care deduction caps.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Childhood Immunization -- <BR>

<P> Enacted in 1993, the President's Vaccines for Children program, which <BR>

<P> guarantees low-income children access to free immunizations against <BR>

<P> preventable diseases, gives states the flexibility and responsibility <BR>

<P> for managing vaccine purchases and distribution, recruiting <BR>

<P> providers, enhancing the immunization infrastructure, and <BR>

<P> implementing outreach strategies. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Family Preservation and Support Act -- <BR>

<P> The Family Preservation and Support Program will provide <BR>

<P> approximately $1 billion to states over the next five years to <BR>

<P> provide services to families in efforts to keep families intact.  HHS <BR>

<P> is implementing the new program to provide maximum flexibility to <BR>

<P> states and local communities in how they design and carry out family <BR>

<P> preservation activities.  HHS has been collaborating with State <BR>

<P> officials on the Federal guidance for this program.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) -- <BR>

<P> ISTEA has provided local and State decisionmakers with unprecedented <BR>

<P> flexibility in the development of transportation investment <BR>

<P> strategies which meet both regional and community goals and <BR>

<P> objectives.  Based upon the needs identified through ISTEA's <BR>

<P> enhanced, multimodal transportation planning process, State and local <BR>

<P> authorities may now 1) use certain highway funds for appropriate <BR>

<P> transit purposes, and vice versa; 2) fund non- traditional <BR>

<P> &quot;enhancement&quot; projects such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, the <BR>

<P> preservation of historic areas and buildings; and 3) through the $6 <BR>

<P> billion Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program, <BR>

<P> develop projects and programs which reduce transportation-borne <BR>

<P> pollutants and provide relief to congested roads and highways.  Since <BR>

<P> ISTEA became effective, the States have obligated over $954 million <BR>

<P> flexibly, that is, transferring highway dollars to transit.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Furthermore, ISTEA fosters economic and community development by <BR>

<P> requiring that land-use, social equity, and environmental concerns be <BR>

<P> incorporated into the transportation planning process and that the <BR>

<P> general public have a much stronger voice in transportation <BR>

<P> investment decisionmaking.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The HUD Demonstration Act (P.L. 103-120) -- <BR>

<P> This Act authorized three program initiatives that will test new ways <BR>

<P> of providing affordable housing and rebuilding our communities.  They <BR>

<P> include the National Community Development Initiative, the Innovative <BR>

<P> Homeless Fund, and Pension Fund Leveraging.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> NCDI -- <BR>

<P> The National Community Development Initiative has been instrumental <BR>

<P> in increasing the capacity and reach of community development <BR>

<P> corporations (CDCs) which today develop and manage a significant <BR>

<P> portion of the low-cost housing portfolio.  HUD's investment of $20 <BR>

<P> million matches $66 million in philanthropic <BR>

<P> funds, all of which, in turn, is leveraged at the local level to <BR>

<P> support housing and community development.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Innovative Homeless Fund -- <BR>

<P> Congress appropriated $100 million for the Innovative Homeless Fund.  <BR>

<P> This highly flexible fund will permit HUD to undertake comprehensive <BR>

<P> initiatives with cities that commit to addressing the full continuum <BR>

<P> of care.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Pension Fund Leveraging -- <BR>

<P> Congress appropriated $100 million to the Community Investment <BR>

<P> Demonstration project to foster affordable housing partnerships with <BR>

<P> the AFL-CIO and other pension funds, leveraging billions of dollars <BR>

<P> in private investment.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Unemployment Insurance Flexibility -- <BR>

<P> NAFTA legislation gives states the option to establish self-<BR>

<P> employment assistance programs as part of the State UI system.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Human Services Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103-252, signed by the <BR>

<P> President on May 18, 1994, created the Community-Based Family <BR>

<P> Resource Program by consolidating four HHS programs:  the Family <BR>

<P> Resource and Support Program; Emergency Child Protective Services <BR>

<P> Grants; the Child Abuse Community-Based Prevention Program;  and the <BR>

<P> Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).  The purpose of the <BR>

<P> new consolidated program is to assist each state to develop and <BR>

<P> implement, or expand and enhance, a comprehensive, statewide system <BR>

<P> of family resource services through collaboration with existing <BR>

<P> education, vocational rehabilitation, health, mental health, <BR>

<P> employment and training, child welfare, and other social services <BR>

<P> agencies within the state.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Regulatory Changes<BR>

<P> ******************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> User Fees for Export Certification -- <BR>

<P> In July 1993, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) <BR>

<P> at USDA amended regulations to provide an alternative method of <BR>

<P> calculating the fees States may charge when they issue Federal <BR>

<P> phytosanitary certificates.  Now, states may calculate fees on a <BR>

<P> &quot;cost-per- certificate&quot; or &quot;cost-per-hour&quot; basis.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Postentry Quarantine -- <BR>

<P> In July of 1993, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service <BR>

<P> (APHIS) at USDA amended regulations requiring postentry quarantine <BR>

<P> for certain imported plants.  The amended regulations limit the <BR>

<P> importation of some plants unless they are destined for States that <BR>

<P> have signed an agreement with APHIS to inspect and monitor postentry <BR>

<P> quarantine sites and to supervise and enforce importer compliance <BR>

<P> with postentry quarantine requirements.  APHIS made several changes <BR>

<P> to the proposed rule to more clearly recognize State enforcement <BR>

<P> authority.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Rural Business Enterprise Grant -- <BR>

<P> Noting that small, rural businesses require technical assistance as <BR>

<P> well as capital to start or keep the enterprise viable, the Rural <BR>

<P> Development Administration at USDA responded by changing regulations <BR>

<P> in the Rural Business Enterprise Grant to allow recipients to use a <BR>

<P> large portion of the grant on technical assistance.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Changes to WIC Regulations -- <BR>

<P> The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at USDA increased flexibility to <BR>

<P> States through numerous regulations.    <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    FNS published a Women Infant and Children (WIC) regulation <BR>

<P> giving additional flexibility to States in mailing food instruments <BR>

<P> to WIC participants.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    FNS published a WIC regulation permitting recipients of <BR>

<P> Medicaid, Food Stamps, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children <BR>

<P> (AFDC) to be deemed automatically income eligible for WIC.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    FNS published a WIC regulation permitting an individual to <BR>

<P> be deemed automatically income eligible for WIC if a family member <BR>

<P> receives Medicaid, Food Stamps, or AFDC. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    FNS published a WIC regulation giving additional <BR>

<P> flexibility to States in documenting nutrition education contacts to <BR>

<P> participants.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Also, FNS issued a formal instruction permitting additional <BR>

<P> flexibility to States for use of WIC funds to purchase, renovate, and <BR>

<P> repair WIC clinic facilities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Commodity Distribution Reform Final Regulations -- <BR>

<P> The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at USDA has adopted regulations <BR>

<P> that provide states and local areas flexibility in three ways:<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Accommodate State computer systems by allowing several <BR>

<P> options for selecting commodity value;<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Permit States to make less frequent than monthly commodity <BR>

<P> deliveries to local organizations when requested; and <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      o    Extend the time frame for States to report commodity losses <BR>

<P> to FNS.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Meal Supplements Regulation -- <BR>

<P> This regulation authorizes reimbursement under the National School <BR>

<P> Lunch program for meal supplements served in after-school care <BR>

<P> programs operated by schools that were participating in the Child and <BR>

<P> Adult Care Food Program as of May 15, 1989.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Food Stamp Program Management Evaluation System -- <BR>

<P> In 1993, the Food and Nutrition Service at USDA significantly changed <BR>

<P> the Food Stamp Program Management Evaluation System to give greater <BR>

<P> flexibility to State agencies.  Previously, the National Office <BR>

<P> established priority areas for the Food Stamp Program and mandated <BR>

<P> that these areas be included in the States' reviews of local office <BR>

<P> operations.  In 1993, the National Office listed National areas of <BR>

<P> concern and each State agency was given the opportunity to work with <BR>

<P> the FNS Regional Office to select those areas that were appropriate <BR>

<P> for review in each individual State.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Revamped Commodity Allocation Procedures -- <BR>

<P> The Food and Nutrition Service at USDA has revamped commodity <BR>

<P> allocation procedures in The Emergency Food Assistance Program to <BR>

<P> permit States to select those products which best serve their needs.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Consolidation of Talmadge-Aiken and Cross Utilization Inspection <BR>

<P> Programs -- The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at USDA has <BR>

<P> allowed State agencies that participated in the Cooperative <BR>

<P> Inspection Program and that dedicated less than 10 staff years to <BR>

<P> Federal inplant inspection to convert their Talmadge-Aiken program to <BR>

<P> a Cross Utilization Program.  Those State agencies that have <BR>

<P> converted will administer only one of these programs instead of two.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Legislative Proposals<BR>

<P> *********************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HR 820, National Competitiveness Act of 1994 -- <BR>

<P> The National Competiveness Act of 1994 passed by the Senate (as S4) <BR>

<P> on March 16, 1994, waiting for conferees to be named.  Includes (as <BR>

<P> Title XI) the &quot;Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act of 1994&quot;  This <BR>

<P> legislation establishes a pilot program (maximum of 30 communities in <BR>

<P> maximum of 6 states) to empower and provide communities the <BR>

<P> flexibility to integrate programs and program funds across existing <BR>

<P> Federal assistance categories.  Localities must develop a local <BR>

<P> flexibility plan which includes, among other things, specific goals <BR>

<P> and measurable performance and a system for the comprehensive <BR>

<P> evaluation of the impact of the plan on the participants, the <BR>

<P> commun<BR>

<P> Board authority to waive any requirements applicable under Federal <BR>

<P> law necessary for the implementation of local flexibility plans.  <BR>

<P> Conferees have been named in the Senate but have not yet been named <BR>

<P> in the House.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Department of Education Report to Congress -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Education submitted a report to the House <BR>

<P> Appropriations Committee in response to a request that the Department <BR>

<P> review the feasibility of consolidating programs which serve the same <BR>

<P> populations and are directed toward the same outcomes.  The <BR>

<P> report and recommendations are to be considered in the context of <BR>

<P> Congressional Action on legislative proposals (described below) and <BR>

<P> the FY 1995 budget.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Improving America's Schools Act -- <BR>

<P> This reauthorization proposal provided DoEd the opportunity to weigh <BR>

<P> the benefits of continuing its elementary and secondary programs and <BR>

<P> to propose consolidation and termination where appropriate.  The Act <BR>

<P> proposes to:  consolidate the National Diffusion Network and the <BR>

<P> various technical assistance centers in elementary and secondary <BR>

<P> education into a single network of ten regional centers; consolidate <BR>

<P> the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education program and the <BR>

<P> Chapter 2 State Grants program into the Eisenhower Professional <BR>

<P> Development program; consolidate the Drug-Free Schools and <BR>

<P> Communities Act and the Safe Schools Act into a Safe and Drug-Free <BR>

<P> Schools program; and, consolidate the current Immigrant Education <BR>

<P> program into the Bilingual Education authority which would create a <BR>

<P> targeted discretionary grant program for school districts heavily <BR>

<P> affected by immigration instead of the current formula grant program.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The reauthorization of Improving America's Schools Act of 1992 is <BR>

<P> also calling for the discontinuation of a list of the elementary and <BR>

<P> secondary programs mentioned in the NPR report, including Education <BR>

<P> for Native Hawaiians, Foreign Languages Assistance, Territorial <BR>

<P> Teacher Training, Ellender fellowships, the FIRST program, <BR>

<P> Educational Partnerships, General Assistance to the Virgin Islands, <BR>

<P> Law-Related Education, Dropout Prevention Demonstrations, Civics <BR>

<P> Education, and the payments made under sections 2, 3(b), and 3(e) of <BR>

<P> the P.L. 81-874, the Impact Aid maintenance and operations statute.  <BR>

<P> In addition, a number of other funded and unfunded program <BR>

<P> authorizations would also be terminated.  Authority to carry <BR>

<P> activities in areas now funded under certain of these programs, such <BR>

<P> as foreign languages education and school recognition, would be <BR>

<P> included in the authorization for the Fund for the Improvement of <BR>

<P> Education, a broad discretionary program.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> This bill also includes additional provisions that would allow <BR>

<P> consolidated activities.  For example, it would allow both state and <BR>

<P> local educational agencies to submit consolidated plans -- rather <BR>

<P> than a separate plan for each program -- in order to present a <BR>

<P> single, comprehensive strategy for moving the state or community  <BR>

<P> toward achievement of the National Education Goals.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, the bill would permit Title I schoolwide programs to <BR>

<P> incorporate funding from other programs, so that children attending <BR>

<P> high-poverty schools can benefit from a cohesive educational program <BR>

<P> rather than receiving separate, often disconnected, categorical <BR>

<P> services.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> School-to-Work Opportunities Act -- <BR>

<P> As proposed to Congress, this joint initiative of the Departments of <BR>

<P> Labor and Education gives broad discretion in planning and <BR>

<P> implementing state-wide school- to-work transition systems.  DOL, in <BR>

<P> coordination with DoEd, has awarded grants to each State to develop <BR>

<P> plans for bridging the gap between efforts of the State and local <BR>

<P> entities to provide services to youth in their transition school to <BR>

<P> work.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Reemployment Act -- <BR>

<P> As part of the FY 95 budget, DOL has proposed a new Workforce <BR>

<P> Security Act that will combine and expand six DOL programs for <BR>

<P> dislocated workers.  The expansion dollars are based on savings from <BR>

<P> the elimination of several programs proven ineffective.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Worker Adjustment Career Centers (WACC) and One-stop Career Centers -<BR>

<P> - As proposed in the Reemployment Act, states would have the <BR>

<P> discretion to designate the number of WACC and One-stop career <BR>

<P> centers and the geographic areas they cover in the state.  In the <BR>

<P> case of One-stop career centers, states have the discretion to <BR>

<P> determine what programs in addition to JTPA programs will be included <BR>

<P> under the one-stop umbrella.  States also have the option of <BR>

<P> providing dislocated worker services through WACCs or One-stop Career <BR>

<P> Centers.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Health Care Reform -- <BR>

<P> Under the President's health care reform proposal, the Health <BR>

<P> Security Act, states will play a crucial role in assuring quality <BR>

<P> health services for all Americans.  Within a broad federal framework, <BR>

<P> states will have substantial flexibility to design and implement <BR>

<P> their overall health care strategy; establish health alliances; <BR>

<P> certify accountable health plans; monitor the quality of and access <BR>

<P> to care; implement insurance and malpractice reforms; and design and <BR>

<P> administer a home and community-based long-term care program.  The <BR>

<P> Health Security Act would also provide federal assistance to states <BR>

<P> in restructuring their public health systems.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD's 1994 Legislation and FY 1995 Budget -- <BR>

<P> This proposed legislation and budget will dramatically transform the <BR>

<P> way key departmental programs are authorized and administered.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD is the locus of the Federal Government's efforts to reduce <BR>

<P> homelessness.  A reorganized McKinney program will provide a <BR>

<P> &quot;continuum of care&quot; for homeless persons through coordinated grants, <BR>

<P> rental assistance and a food and shelter program.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Department has begun an intensive effort to redesign the Nation's <BR>

<P> most distressed public housing.  Public housing modernization and <BR>

<P> revitalization of distressed public housing programs will be <BR>

<P> restructured to give public housing authorities greater flexibility <BR>

<P> to use Federal funds and greater ability to leverage other public- <BR>

<P> and private-sector resources in support of their goals.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD's community empowerment programs were redesigned to provide the <BR>

<P> flexibility necessary to address local needs and provide others the <BR>

<P> tools and resources they need to carry out their strategies.  <BR>

<P> Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) remains the most flexible <BR>

<P> community-building tool.  The President's Empowerment Zone Initiative <BR>

<P> will provide grants for a range of activities at local discretion.  <BR>

<P> The Neighborhood LIFT Initiative is a new project-based grant-loan <BR>

<P> program to promote and leverage private investment in retail, <BR>

<P> commercial, or mixed-use development projects in distressed areas.  <BR>

<P> The Community Viability Fund is a new flexible fund designed to build <BR>

<P> the organizational capacity of community-based groups and <BR>

<P> institutions to conduct strategic planning and support the design and <BR>

<P> development of public amenities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> National Transportation System -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Transportation has formulated the National <BR>

<P> Transportation System, a planning device that will emphasize the <BR>

<P> interconnectedness of the Nation's transportation facilities.  An <BR>

<P> illustration of how this will work is found in the Department's <BR>

<P> proposed reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration's <BR>

<P> programs.  In this reauthorization, DOT has proposed a more flexible <BR>

<P> approach to integrated airport system planning.  This approach will <BR>

<P> allow regional planning organizations to consider non-airport <BR>

<P> components of the transportation system, provided <BR>

<P> that airport users would benefit from these components.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Department of Transportation has also proposed to eliminate grant <BR>

<P> programs for rail freight and for boating safety. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Pilot Projects and Waivers<BR>

<P> **************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Multi-year Grant Pilots -- EPA has awarded two multi-year pilot <BR>

<P> projects for the water quality program whereby states receive waivers <BR>

<P> from the regulatory requirement to submit annual grant applications.  <BR>

<P> The intent is to streamline the grants process and reduce the <BR>

<P> administrative burden on the States.  As part of the pilots, EPA <BR>

<P> prepares a two-year program guidance, State and Federal program <BR>

<P> managers have face-to-face negotiations, and a conflict resolution <BR>

<P> process is established.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Plant Protection and Quarantine Service --  <BR>

<P> In August 1993, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service <BR>

<P> (APHIS) at USDA established a reinvention laboratory to enhance plant <BR>

<P> protection and quarantine service delivery through decentralization <BR>

<P> in the Southeastern Region of the United States.  The project <BR>

<P> involves eliminating the Assistant Regional Director layer of <BR>

<P> hierarchy and empowering State Plant Health Directors to carry out <BR>

<P> their functions in the most effective manner.  Elements of the lab <BR>

<P> include involving State and local officials in the planning and <BR>

<P> evaluation of programs and integrating selected State and Federal <BR>

<P> Programs.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Employment and Training Cooperative Agreements -- <BR>

<P> USDA has entered into cooperative agreements with five State agencies <BR>

<P> to test improved conformance between the Food Stamp Employment and <BR>

<P> Training Program (E&amp;T) and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills <BR>

<P> Program for AFDC participants.  It is hoped that the project will <BR>

<P> improve consistency and cooperation among employment and training <BR>

<P> programs, reduce costs, eliminate barriers to appropriate services, <BR>

<P> and enhance current E&amp;T activities.  The demonstrations will operate <BR>

<P> for up to four years.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Distance Learning and Medical Link Program and Economic Development <BR>

<P> Grants  -- The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) at USDA has <BR>

<P> two grant programs.  One grant program, the Distance Learning and <BR>

<P> Medical Link projects, brings medical and educational services to <BR>

<P> rural areas through telecommunications.  The other grant program, <BR>

<P> Economic Development Grants, provides revolving funds for local rural <BR>

<P> economic development projects.  Both programs encourage applicants to <BR>

<P> combine these grants with other funding programs by giving priority <BR>

<P> consideration points for such combining.    <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Food Stamp Program Waivers -- <BR>

<P> The Food Stamp Program (FSP) at USDA approved 153 waiver requests in <BR>

<P> FY 1993.  The waivers provide State agencies with greater flexibility <BR>

<P> in administering the program.  Waivers were approved in such areas as <BR>

<P> recertification, length of certification periods, interview <BR>

<P> requirements, issuance, quality control procedures, and application <BR>

<P> requirements.  The FSP also has granted a waiver in the area of <BR>

<P> nutrition education that would allow Federal match of alternate <BR>

<P> funding sources that will enhance the State agencies efforts at <BR>

<P> developing nutrition education plans.  In addition, the FSP approved <BR>

<P> waivers for the New York, Oregon, and Arkansas State agencies <BR>

<P> allowing them to implement a new type of reporting system known as <BR>

<P> quarterly reporting.  Under quarterly reporting, participating <BR>

<P> households report changes in their circumstances on a quarterly <BR>

<P> basis.  The new reporting system helps to alleviate State agencies' <BR>

<P> workloads while also insuring that they have accurate information <BR>

<P> about their caseloads.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Food Stamp Waivers -- <BR>

<P> In the past year, USDA has approved Food Stamp waivers as part of <BR>

<P> welfare reform demonstrations in l3 States.  The waivers enable <BR>

<P> states to coordinate their experimentation with the policies of both <BR>

<P> AFDC and Food Stamps.  Approved waivers affect income disregards, <BR>

<P> resource exclusions, and the cashing out of food stamp benefits.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the Improving America's Schools <BR>

<P> Act, and the School-to-Work Act all contain provisions to permit <BR>

<P> States and localities to obtain waivers from Federal statutory and <BR>

<P> regulatory requirements where they can show that those requirements <BR>

<P> impede the education reform process and when they have a plan in <BR>

<P> place for achieving better educational outcomes for all students.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Statewide Health Reform Experiments -- <BR>

<P> HHS has approved waivers allowing five states to conduct major <BR>

<P> statewide experiments, including OR, HI, RI, TN, and KY.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Medicaid Program Waivers for Home and Community Based services (HCBS) <BR>

<P> and Freedom of Choice (FOC) programs in HHS -- <BR>

<P> HCBS waivers permit states to expand non-institutional long-term care <BR>

<P> services to Medicaid recipients.  FOC waivers enhance states' ability <BR>

<P> to implement managed care programs and has made special efforts to <BR>

<P> assist states which have not had substantial experience with managed <BR>

<P> care.  HHS is working with The National Governors' Association to <BR>

<P> strengthen these waiver processes.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> State Welfare Reform Experiments -- <BR>

<P> HHS has approved numerous welfare waiver packages that provide <BR>

<P> considerable flexibility to states in designing welfare demonstration <BR>

<P> projects.  HHS has approved 7 state packages in 1993 with several <BR>

<P> more expected to be approved in 1994.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Public Health Service Research Demonstration for Community Services <BR>

<P> Network -- <BR>

<P> HHS' PHS is conducting a demonstration project through the Office of <BR>

<P> Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for the purpose of learning <BR>

<P> how contemporary computer and communication technologies can support <BR>

<P> and enhance the coordination of health and human services at the <BR>

<P> community level.  Called the Community Services Workstation, the <BR>

<P> project is underway in D.C. to test the use of advanced information <BR>

<P> technology as a tool to assist community-level collaboration.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HOPE 6 -- <BR>

<P> Hope 6 or the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program (URD) was <BR>

<P> created for the purpose of revitalizing severely distressed or <BR>

<P> obsolete public housing developments in the 40 most populous U.S. <BR>

<P> cities.  The program allows the flexibility to provide complex <BR>

<P> packages of physical improvements and supportive services.  Resources <BR>

<P> will be available to provide job-training, literacy training, day <BR>

<P> care, youth activities, health services, community policing and drug <BR>

<P> treatment.  Participating housing authorities must also establish a <BR>

<P> community service program, such as youth conservation corps or <BR>

<P> school-based service programs like literacy training.  Housing <BR>

<P> authorities were given the greatest degree to flexibility to redesign <BR>

<P> Comprehensive Cities Program -- <BR>

<P> In FY 1994, the Department of Justice will initiate a comprehensive <BR>

<P> crime control/community mobilization program in five or six cities <BR>

<P> across the country that will involve comprehensive planning and <BR>

<P> improved intergovernmental relationships.  Under this program, cities <BR>

<P> faced with high rates of drug and violent crime will develop a <BR>

<P> comprehensive strategy for crime and drug-control which requires the <BR>

<P> police and other city agencies to work in partnership with the <BR>

<P> community to address crime and violence-related problems and the <BR>

<P> environment which fosters them.  Each strategy must include a <BR>

<P> jurisdiction-wide commitment to community policing, coordination <BR>

<P> among public and private agencies, and efforts to encourage citizens <BR>

<P> to take an active role in problem solving.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Reinvention Activities in Atlanta, GA-- <BR>

<P> The Atlanta Federal Executive Board, in cooperation with the regional <BR>

<P> Social Security Office, the National Treasury Employees Union, <BR>

<P> Georgia Department of HHS,  Georgia State University, and the Atlanta <BR>

<P> Project is implementing a pilot project for a common access <BR>

<P> application for AFDC, Food Stamps, WIC, Medicaid, SSI and Housing <BR>

<P> Assistance.  The application will eliminate the collection of <BR>

<P> unnecessary information and allow the agency &quot;intake&quot; worker to make <BR>

<P> the eligibility determination without additional interviews.  This <BR>

<P> initiative will provide one-stop customer service and reduce the <BR>

<P> paper application from more than 50 pages to 8.  The pilot will be <BR>

<P> introduced in a local community center with staff from the Atlanta <BR>

<P> Project and volunteers trained to assist all applicants in completing <BR>

<P> the form and explaining the programs for which they qualify.  A <BR>

<P> customer survey will be conducted at the end of March to determine <BR>

<P> customer satisfaction and agency efficiency with <BR>

<P> this one-stop shopping program.  Future plans are for the common <BR>

<P> access application forms to be available in all community centers as <BR>

<P> well as offices of each of the participating agencies. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Alamo Federal Executive Board Reinvention Lab -- <BR>

<P> The FEB for San Antonio, TX has been designated as a reinvention lab <BR>

<P> to highlight and assist their efforts to facilitate cooperation among <BR>

<P> federal and local government agencies.  The Alamo FEB is working to <BR>

<P> remove unnecessary regulations and red tape and to improve internal <BR>

<P> operations so that intergovernmental employees may work together as <BR>

<P> partners to create flexibility and to solve problems in the <BR>

<P> community.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Federal Highway Administration -- <BR>

<P> DOT's Federal Highway Administration has successfully tested the use <BR>

<P> of an electronic signature to speed part of its grant delivery <BR>

<P> process and is expanding the program to additional phases of grant <BR>

<P> delivery and to all the administrative processes for opportunities to <BR>

<P> eliminate and modify current requirements.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) ISTEA study <BR>

<P> -- The Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration) <BR>

<P> is working with ACIR to perform case studies of approximately 12 <BR>

<P> Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to be completed by <BR>

<P> December 1994 with conclusions about the capacity of MPOs to carry <BR>

<P> out the expanded responsibilities given to them by ISTEA.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ACIR's Study on the Impacts of Federal Mandates and Regulations on <BR>

<P> Effective Schools -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Education has funded ACIR to conduct a study in <BR>

<P> four States on the positive and negative impacts of federal mandates <BR>

<P> and regulations on the institutionalization of the factors commonly <BR>

<P> associated with effective schools.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> California Earthquake Relief -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Transportation initiated many actions to cut red <BR>

<P> tape and provided regulatory relief for the California Earthquake <BR>

<P> recovery effort.  A supplemental appropriation of $1.35 billion was <BR>

<P> requested for the emergency relief program for federal aid highways.  <BR>

<P> The request included language to waive the current legislative cap of <BR>

<P> $100 million per State per emergency, clarify that all costs incurred <BR>

<P> during the first 180 days are federally funded, and give the DOT <BR>

<P> Secretary and EPA Administrator authority to waive environmental laws <BR>

<P> and regulations as needed to facilitate project reconstruction.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) immediately <BR>

<P> approved nine contracts totalling $4.1 million for demolition and <BR>

<P> shoring of damaged highway structures.  The first contracts were <BR>

<P> placed 16 hours after the earthquake occurred.  FHWA also <BR>

<P> approved a variety of innovative techniques to &quot;shortcut&quot; the normal <BR>

<P> contracting process, thus expediting restoration of the <BR>

<P> transportation system.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Also, FHWA issued an emergency declaration relieving motor carriers <BR>

<P> who provided direct assistance to the earthquake effort of certain <BR>

<P> Federal regulations on driver hours of service.  Another DOT agency, <BR>

<P> the Federal Railroad Administration, granted a waiver of safety <BR>

<P> regulations for 32 Canadian passenger cares from Toronto's transit <BR>

<P> system to supplement capacity on the Los Angeles Metrolink commuter <BR>

<P> rail system.  Certain passenger car construction standards differ <BR>

<P> between the U.S. and Canada which, without waivers, would have <BR>

<P> prevented even temporary operation in California.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Forest Service -- <BR>

<P> The Forest Service at USDA has allowed its State and Private Programs <BR>

<P> area to allow state agencies to consolidate annual programs into one <BR>

<P> cooperative agreement or grant and to receive consolidated payments. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Rural Development Administration (RA) -- <BR>

<P> RA and the National Rural Development Partnership (NRDP) at USDA have <BR>

<P> undertaken several efforts to be more flexible and responsive to the <BR>

<P> needs of rural communities across the United States.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> o    Noting that rural entrepreneurs seeking federal and state <BR>

<P> assistance for small businesses faced a mountain of forms asking for <BR>

<P> similar information, the Kansas State Rural Development Council of <BR>

<P> the NRDP worked together with federal and state agencies to a create <BR>

<P> a single loan application.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> o    Frustrated local development officials complained that the audit <BR>

<P> costs for modest-sized loans received from RA Community Facility were <BR>

<P> too high, the South Dakota State Rural Development Council asked RA <BR>

<P> for relief.  RA responded and waived audit requirements on smaller <BR>

<P> loans, saving rural communities $400 million nationwide.<BR>

<P> Inter-Agency Action<BR>

<P> *******************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Employment and Training Administration (ETA) -- <BR>

<P> DOL's ETA has accomplished and embarked on a number of joint funding <BR>

<P> efforts with several Federal agencies to eliminate duplication of <BR>

<P> efforts thereby increasing the availability of resources to States <BR>

<P> through single funding actions.  Where legislation provided <BR>

<P> flexibility in the award of certain grants, ETA was instrumental in <BR>

<P> working jointly with the Departments of Education, Justice, Defense, <BR>

<P> HUD and Transportation in the planning, funding and award of grants <BR>

<P> to state and local entities.  Specific examples include Defense <BR>

<P> Conversion, Skill Standards, Youth Fair Chance, and School-to-Work <BR>

<P> initiatives.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Defense Conversion -- <BR>

<P> DOL works with DOD in awarding grants to areas with significant <BR>

<P> numbers of base closures.  These grants are designed to provide <BR>

<P> retraining and/or employment services to individuals displaced as a <BR>

<P> result of these base closings.  Through coordination efforts, DOL and <BR>

<P> DOD have eliminated the requirement for grantees to report to both <BR>

<P> departments on performance activity.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Pacific Northwest Economic Adjustment and Community Assistance <BR>

<P> Response -- The Rural Development Administration (RA) at USDA played <BR>

<P> a major role in preparing the Pacific Northwest Economic Adjustment <BR>

<P> and Community Assistance Response, a step that became necessary as a <BR>

<P> result of Federal action to curtail harvesting of old-growth timber <BR>

<P> in certain areas of the Pacific Northwest.  Eleven federal <BR>

<P> departments and agencies, including the White House, are involved in <BR>

<P> the public/private sector effort to develop a financial plan to <BR>

<P> respond to the economic diversification needs of the region.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Defense Automation Resources Information Center has a <BR>

<P> redistribution and sharing program which allows local schools (both <BR>

<P> public and private) and community non-profit organizations to get <BR>

<P> excess information processing and computing equipment from military <BR>

<P> bases under streamlined excess property procedures.  These programs <BR>

<P> include a primary and secondary school donation program and a support <BR>

<P> program to lease excess computing gear, at no cost, to historically <BR>

<P> black colleges and universities and minority institutions.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In April of 1993, DoEd and HHS jointly developed and published <BR>

<P> Together We Can: A Guide for Crafting a Profamily System of Education <BR>

<P> and Human Services.  This was developed to help communities improve <BR>

<P> coordination of education, health and human services for at-risk <BR>

<P> children and families. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Fair Lending Task Force -- <BR>

<P> HUD, DOJ, the Comptroller of the Currency and seven other agencies <BR>

<P> forged an historic cooperative relationship to bring the resources <BR>

<P> and powers of all three agencies to bear on ending mortgage lending <BR>

<P> discrimination.  For the first time, joint investigation and <BR>

<P> enforcement efforts will be undertaken and information will be <BR>

<P> shared.  <BR>

<P> Funding Flexibility<BR>

<P> *******************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FEMA's Reorganization of Program and Budget Structure -- <BR>

<P> FEMA was reorganized from a programmatic to a functionally based <BR>

<P> structure in November of 1993.  This functional structure was <BR>

<P> designed to streamline the process for FEMA's goal of customer-<BR>

<P> oriented service to the States.  The FEMA FY 95 budget has been <BR>

<P> revised to correspond to the functional structure.  For example, FEMA <BR>

<P> restructured its civil defense program to emphasize an all- hazards, <BR>

<P> integrated emergency management approach.  Several line items in the <BR>

<P> program were integrated to provide the States greater flexibility in <BR>

<P> the use of FEMA resources to develop this all-hazards emergency <BR>

<P> management capability.  FEMA is also restructuring its Comprehensive <BR>

<P> Cooperative Agreement (CCA) from a programmatic to a functional <BR>

<P> approach for FY 1995.  This approach will more closely reflect the <BR>

<P> States' annual program planning and will eliminate duplicative work <BR>

<P> activities and reduce associated reporting burdens; provide a more <BR>

<P> flexible basis for Federal/State negotiations; provide greater <BR>

<P> flexibility in the use of Federal funds to develop emergency <BR>

<P> management capabilities; and integrate and functionally organize work <BR>

<P> activities.  The restructuring of CCA was established through a <BR>

<P> collaborative, intergovernmental partnership between FEMA and NEMA <BR>

<P> State representatives.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> DOT has implemented two of NPR's recommendations to reduce <BR>

<P> regulations and processing times which have improved customer service <BR>

<P> to grantees and have provided flexibility to the grantees in terms of <BR>

<P> &quot;pre-award authority&quot; to permit grantees to incur costs prior to <BR>

<P> final Federal approval when reimbursement conditions are met.<BR>

<P> Strengthened Partnerships<BR>

<P> *************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> State Capacity Implementation Steering Committee -- <BR>

<P> EPA has developed an intergovernmental steering committee to guide <BR>

<P> efforts towards an Agency/State environmental partnership.  Through <BR>

<P> this committee, the EPA has established principles for a more <BR>

<P> flexible grant process and are in the process of establishing the <BR>

<P> necessary legislative strategy.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> National Community Development Initiative (NCDI) -- <BR>

<P> HUD has formed a partnership with a consortium of philanthropic <BR>

<P> foundations to help build the capacity of community development <BR>

<P> corporations.  HUD's investment of $20 million has been used to <BR>

<P> leverage an additional $60 million of foundation funds -- making it <BR>

<P> the largest single fund for such activity in the nation.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Reinvention Lab for Intergovernmental Partnership -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable <BR>

<P> Energy is sponsoring a reinvention lab on &quot;Reinventing Federal, <BR>

<P> State, and Local Partnerships.&quot;  The mission of this pilot project is <BR>

<P> to broaden DOE's network of external stakeholders, to increase <BR>

<P> understanding of capabilities and goals, and to invent better <BR>

<P> partnerships.  Three specific activities are the focus of this <BR>

<P> reinvention lab: 1) involve stakeholders earlier and more completely <BR>

<P> in strategic operating and budget planning; 2) to invent more <BR>

<P> effective and flexible ways to implement state and local provisions <BR>

<P> of the Energy Policy Act of 1992; and 3) to build stronger public and <BR>

<P> private collaborations to deploy new energy efficiency and renewable <BR>

<P> energy technologies in the marketplace.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Welfare Reform -- <BR>

<P> Outreach to state and local officials has been a central component of <BR>

<P> the Administration's welfare reform policy development process.  The <BR>

<P> White House Working Group on Welfare Reform, Family Support and <BR>

<P> Independence, established by the President in May, 1993, has sought <BR>

<P> and received considerable input from state and local leaders in <BR>

<P> welfare reform.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Streamlining Internal Processes<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Waiver Process Streamlining -- <BR>

<P> HHS has taken steps to simplify their waiver approval process, <BR>

<P> including:  providing concurrent review of state waiver applications <BR>

<P> by different components of the Executive Branch;  increasing <BR>

<P> technical assistance; measuring budget neutrality over the life of <BR>

<P> the waiver instead of annually; and, considering alternative <BR>

<P> evaluation designs.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Streamlining and Reduction of Management Barriers -- <BR>

<P> Commerce has undergone a variety of efforts in the past year to <BR>

<P> streamline the internal grants processes which has resulted in <BR>

<P> reduced paperwork and faster processing of application for financial <BR>

<P> assistance.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) -- <BR>

<P> ETA at Labor has streamlined its internal procurement process to <BR>

<P> ensure a more responsive system for the solicitation, selection and <BR>

<P> award of grants to recipients at the state and local levels.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Financial Management of Cooperative Inspection Program -- <BR>

<P> The Food and Inspection Service (FSIS) at USDA has analyzed and is <BR>

<P> currently in the process of simplifying procedures for coordination <BR>

<P> and control of financial management of the Cooperative Meat and <BR>

<P> Poultry Inspection programs with State agencies.  In the past, all <BR>

<P> documentation relating to budgeting and fiscal matters was processed <BR>

<P> through FSIS Regional Offices.  Now, the State agencies will deal <BR>

<P> directly with FSIS headquarters in these matters, permitting a faster <BR>

<P> turn-around and eliminating additional processing steps.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> International Cooperation and Development Grants and Agreements -- <BR>

<P> The Office of International Cooperation and Development (ICD) at the <BR>

<P> USDA has taken steps to reduce record-keeping and paper work by grant <BR>

<P> recipients.  ICD has cut back on the number of forms required and the <BR>

<P> back-up material that recipients must retain.    <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Grant Process Streamlining at DOT -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Transportation is working to streamline the <BR>

<P> processing of grant applications and reporting forms.  Electronic <BR>

<P> submission of grant forms and reductions in the number and frequency <BR>

<P> of certifications should reduce the red tape associated with the <BR>

<P> grants process.  The Department is also working to make the single <BR>

<P> audit process more effective to reduce the oversight <BR>

<P> demands on Federal managers and grantees.<BR>

<P> *********************************<BR>

<P> INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS UNDERWAY:<BR>

<P> *********************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Cross-medial Flexibility for Improved Environmental Performance -- <BR>

<P> The Internal EPA Performance Review has put forth a recommendation <BR>

<P> that the Agency approve state and local pilot projects to demonstrate <BR>

<P> cross-media flexibility for improved environmental performance.  In <BR>

<P> exchange for a certain degree of flexibility within their grants, <BR>

<P> states will demonstrate that they are targeting high risk <BR>

<P> environmental needs and addressing environmental concerns in a multi-<BR>

<P> media, holistic manner.  The Agency is currently drafting an action <BR>

<P> plan for immediate implementation of this recommendation and is <BR>

<P> seeking state and local demonstration projects.  The State of <BR>

<P> Massachusetts is currently developing an innovative pilot whereby, <BR>

<P> through increased grant flexibility, the State will target high-<BR>

<P> priority polluting facilities for multi-media inspection and <BR>

<P> enforcement actions.  Instead of having air, water, and waste <BR>

<P> inspectors do three individual inspections on a polluting facility, <BR>

<P> Massachusetts wants to have the flexibility to do all three <BR>

<P> inspections at once.  The State believes that multi-media inspections <BR>

<P> will lead to improved compliance and enable them to identify <BR>

<P> opportunities to reduce emissions.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Ecosystems Management Project -- <BR>

<P> EPA, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Interior and <BR>

<P> several other Federal agencies are working together to develop <BR>

<P> ecosystem management projects in regions throughout the country.  <BR>

<P> This project will involve intergovernmental collaboration and <BR>

<P> partnership.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Community Planning and Development -- <BR>

<P> HUD is developing a strategy to consolidate seven separate community <BR>

<P> planning and development plans that state and local jurisdictions are <BR>

<P> required to prepare.  The development process is highly inclusive and <BR>

<P> involves recipients from around the nation.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD's Public and Indian Housing has formed working groups with <BR>

<P> industry to accomplish a number of objectives including the review of <BR>

<P> statutes and regulations to consolidate and enhance flexibility.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Multi-Purpose Water Grant Provision in the Clean Water Act -- <BR>

<P> The Administration is considering incorporating grant flexibility <BR>

<P> into the reauthorization of the Clean Water Act (CWA). States <BR>

<P> adopting a watershed approach to water quality management would be <BR>

<P> able to apply for the various grants available under the CWA using a <BR>

<P> single, integrated application.  States would prepare an integrated <BR>

<P> workplan to use the multi-purpose grant which would include defined <BR>

<P> outputs and commitments, however, the States would have the latitude <BR>

<P> of applying these funds to their highest- risk problems.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> USDA has begun negotiations with the Department of Treasury to <BR>

<P> provide States an opportunity to include direct Federal payment <BR>

<P> programs in their Electronic Benefit Transfer systems.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Weights and Measures Training at USDA -- <BR>

<P> Scale accuracy is of paramount importance to the Packers and <BR>

<P> Stockyards Administration's (P&amp; SA).  P&amp; A relies heavily on State <BR>

<P> and local weights and measures jurisdictions to provide tests and <BR>

<P> reports on subject scales under cooperative agreements.  P&amp; A <BR>

<P> personnel are certified to provide training on testing of livestock <BR>

<P> and monorail scales under a national training program of the National <BR>

<P> Conference on Weights and Measures.  P&amp;SA personnel conducted three <BR>

<P> training programs for State weights and measures officials this past <BR>

<P> year and will conduct at least two this year, one of which will be <BR>

<P> customized to meet the needs of a particular State.  This program <BR>

<P> provides specialized training to State weights and measures officials <BR>

<P> that would not otherwise be available.   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Revisions to the Advance Planning Document Process -- <BR>

<P> The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at USDA has been meeting with a <BR>

<P> joint Federal-State policy group to revise the Advance Planning <BR>

<P> Document (APD) process.  The initial effort is to focus on provisions <BR>

<P> which may be changed without regulatory action.  Included in the <BR>

<P> proposed changes is the suggestion to increasing the dollar threshold <BR>

<P> for Federal approval.  This proposal will eliminate federal <BR>

<P> involvement in minor systems changes that normally are not a problem, <BR>

<P> but which require staff resources to produce, review, and approve the <BR>

<P> outlays.   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Food Stamp Program (FSP) at USDA has drafted two proposed rules <BR>

<P> that would simplify current regulations and increase State agency <BR>

<P> flexibility in administering the FSP.  The first rule, entitled <BR>

<P> Simplification of Program Rules, proposes changes in the areas of <BR>

<P> recertification, standard utility allowances, residency, length of <BR>

<P> certification periods, and notice requirements.  As well as providing <BR>

<P> State agencies with  greater flexibility, many of the changes promote <BR>

<P> conformance with procedures in the Aid to Facilities with Dependent <BR>

<P> Children (AFDC) Program.  The second rule, entitled Provisions on <BR>

<P> General Assistance Vendor Payments and Student Earnings form Pub. L. <BR>

<P> 103-66 and changes in Requirements for Anticipating Income and <BR>

<P> Reporting Changes, includes provisions that would simplify procedures <BR>

<P> for handling reported changes in household circumstances.  Both rules <BR>

<P> are currently in clearance in USDA.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Business and Industry Audited Financial Statements -- <BR>

<P> The Rural Development Administration (RA) at the USDA has proposed, <BR>

<P> subject to final clearance, to relax the requirements for Business <BR>

<P> and Industry borrowers to furnish annual, audited financial <BR>

<P> statements.  Currently, the regulations require audited statements <BR>

<P> from all borrowers, except seasoned loans, with a balance of $100,000 <BR>

<P> or less.  The proposal would allow RA to accept unaudited annual <BR>

<P> statements from new borrowers receiving loans not exceeding $500,000.  <BR>

<P> The proposal also will allow unaudited annual statements from all <BR>

<P> borrowers that have provided audits for three years, are current on <BR>

<P> repayment, and have a loan balance not exceeding $1,000,000.  This <BR>

<P> action will make the program more attractive and effective for small <BR>

<P> businesses.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Child Support Enforcement Program as a GPRA Lab-- <BR>

<P> This pilot program will collaborate with State and local governments <BR>

<P> in establishing and achieving performance goals related to <BR>

<P> establishment of paternity, court orders, cases in payment, and <BR>

<P> collections compared to targets.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Cooperative Extension Service as a GPRA Lab -- <BR>

<P> The Extension Service currently conducts 7 base programs and 8 <BR>

<P> national initiatives.  Four of the 8 national initiatives would form <BR>

<P> the pilot program.  These are:  (1) Communities in Economic <BR>

<P> Transition, including job, business, and market creation and increase <BR>

<P> in tourism;  (2) Plight of young children, including fostering <BR>

<P> development of children in limited resource families and closing gaps <BR>

<P> in services to these families;  (3) Decisions for health including <BR>

<P> childhood immunization and community health initiatives;  (4) Food <BR>

<P> safety and quality, including reducing the incidence of food-borne <BR>

<P> illness.  This pilot involves 1200 FTEs at the State and local <BR>

<P> levels.<BR>

<P> Labor is considering waivers of regulations pertaining to its <BR>

<P> programs in connection with state efforts to develop comprehensive <BR>

<P> school-to-work transition systems and to provide comprehensive <BR>

<P> employment and training services One-stop Career Centers.  In <BR>

<P> addition, DOL will also consider regulatory waivers affecting its <BR>

<P> programs that deliver services in enterprise communities and <BR>

<P> empowerment zones.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> DOT Training Summit -- <BR>

<P> The Department of Transportation is convening a training summit which <BR>

<P> will involve federal, state, metropolitan planning organizations, <BR>

<P> city, county, transit officials and others in understanding the <BR>

<P> Intermodal Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 which expanded  <BR>

<P> opportunities to use transportation funding in a flexible manner.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> DOT is also developing training courses in topics including public <BR>

<P> participation in transportation planning, systems planning, <BR>

<P> congestion management, and intermodal management systems.  The <BR>

<P> Department is also preparing a video for metropolitan planning <BR>

<P> officials and a catalog of DOT supported training and outreach on <BR>

<P> transportation planning and programming.  Other measures are also <BR>

<P> being taken to aid local officials in taking advantage of new <BR>

<P> opportunities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HHS Workgroup -- <BR>

<P> The Department has established an ongoing workgroup comprised of <BR>

<P> staff offices and operating units to focus on improving customer <BR>

<P> services through service integration and other approaches to program <BR>

<P> innovation, comprehensiveness and Federal flexibility.  With an <BR>

<P> initial focus on children/families and the aging, the workgroup is <BR>

<P> developing recommendations concerning:  opportunities for <BR>

<P> consolidating application and reporting requirements for Federal <BR>

<P> programs; innovative criteria for evaluating coordinated or <BR>

<P> integrated service systems at the local level; model training <BR>

<P> programs for integrated or coordinated service staff at the local <BR>

<P> level; and, potential opportunities for compatible program <BR>

<P> eligibility requirements, program consolidations and/or <BR>

<P> organizational improvements.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, other HHS activities include: the development of a <BR>

<P> continuing locus of assistance to state and local governments in <BR>

<P> removing barriers in federal rules (or, in other words, a single <BR>

<P> point of contact approach);  the coordination of planning with other <BR>

<P> departments on reducing violence; and, the establishment of better <BR>

<P> linkages among selected programs at the community level.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD is currently take steps to create better linkages across programs <BR>

<P> that are focusing on discrete elements of a related problem.  For <BR>

<P> example, HUD has designed economic opportunity grants to compliment <BR>

<P> the family investment center initiative.  Likewise, the allocation of <BR>

<P> child care services and apprenticeship funds have been coordinated <BR>

<P> with the overall strategy on the Jobs for Residents objective.  HUD's <BR>

<P> homeownership strategy will also draw the necessary linkages between <BR>

<P> the National Homeownership Trust, the consolidated HOPE program, <BR>

<P> homeownership counseling and the traditional FHA insurance for single <BR>

<P> family homes.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD's Public Housing Modernization Regulations -- <BR>

<P> Public housing authorities will be given far more flexibility to <BR>

<P> administer funds that have been backlogged, partially because of <BR>

<P> burdensome regulatory requirements.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD's Five Component Reinvention Plan includes efforts for program <BR>

<P> consolidation and simplification, reorganization of field structure <BR>

<P> to simplify processes, revision of HUD Reform Act, and development of <BR>

<P> work measurement indicators for each program office.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Department of Commerce -- <BR>

<P> As a part of the NPR effort, the United States Travel and Tourism <BR>

<P> Administration (USTTA) is currently coordinating an extensive review <BR>

<P> by the legislatively-established Tourism Policy Council (TPC) of all <BR>

<P> Federal tourism programs in an effort to develop a coordinated and <BR>

<P> comprehensive Federal tourism strategy.  The TPC is comprised of the <BR>

<P> heads of 15 Federal Departments and agencies that are involved in <BR>

<P> travel and tourism.  It is anticipated that by May 1994, the Council <BR>

<P> will submit a report to the Vice President which will address <BR>

<P> coordination and consolidation of activities.  While current grant <BR>

<P> activity in support of tourism appears to be limited, it is plausible <BR>

<P> that the final strategy could call for consolidation of grant <BR>

<P> programs.  In addition, USTTA and the Economic Development Agency are <BR>

<P> already cooperating in coordinating and administering disaster relief <BR>

<P> grants related to travel and tourism.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Federal Housing Administration -- <BR>

<P> Under HUD, FHA has established a series of working groups to explore <BR>

<P> transforming the mission of the agency as well as the way it does <BR>

<P> business.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, HUD, with the assistance of Price Waterhouse, has <BR>

<P> reviewed two programs and established plans to completely restructure <BR>

<P> the public modernization programs and the FHIP using business <BR>

<P> reengineering to achieve increased efficiency.<BR>

<P>____________________________<BR>

<P>     Performance measurement has become the center of a substantial movement that is rethinking the way government operates. This movement is rooted in the experience and work of many government managers.  At the core of it is the belief that now, more then ever, governments must focus on the results we achieve. Why?  For at least three reasons:<BR>

<P>(1) It's good sense and good management.  Performance measurement allows managers to focus organizational efforts, assess how they are doing, compare their performance to others, and identify opportunities for improvement.<BR>

<P>(1) It facilitates the efficient and effective use of resources. Performance measurement helps managers do their jobs better - it helps them better identify priorities, better allocate resources, and better manage tight finances. <BR>

<P>(3) It counters the growing tide of taxpayer skepticism.  This skepticism can be best addressed by effectively communicating what government does.  Systematically documenting and reporting performance in concrete terms allows governments to demonstrate how much they do, how well they do it, and when they are doing better.<BR>

<P>The following pages provide brief descriptions of some performance measurement activities that are already going on in cities. It is the initial draft of what we expect will be a more comprehensive compilation. We hope the information provided is useful.  If you are not already doing work in this area, we also hope it captures your imagination and helps generate new ideas.  <BR>

<P>

<B>2. common questions asked about measuring performance</B><BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>  	What is &quot;performance measurement?&quot;<BR>
<B>A:</B>	Performance measurement refers to a management process which involves (1) identifying important objectives consistent with your organization's mission, (2) measuring how you are doing against those objectives (in terms of outputs and outcomes), (3) using what you learn to inform decisions and improve performance, and (4) reporting how you are doing to your customers, the public.  <BR>

<P><B>Q:	</B>What kind of performance measures exist?<BR>
<B>A:</B>	The following is a summary of performance measures. It is based on information provided by the Government Accounting Office:<BR>

<BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>	What is the difference between inputs, outputs, and outcomes?<BR>
<B>A:	</B>Consider an example from industry:  the inputs are the materials, labor, and equipment costs that go into producing a product, a widget for instance.  The output is the number of widgets produced.  The outcome is the profit realized from selling widgets.<BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>	Elaborate on this distinction using a government sector example.<BR>
<B>A:</B>	Think about building inspection efforts - the number of hours spent inspecting buildings for code violations is an input.  Outputs include the number of buildings inspected or the number of citations written. An outcome would be a decrease in the number of accidents that occur because of building code violations. <BR>
    	Inputs focus on the resources expended to do something.  Outputs generally focus on the numbers of things done, on activities.  Outcomes take it a step further and focus on either the impact or the quality of those activities.  <BR>

<P><B>Q:</B> 	Aren t there case where a variety of outcomes exist?<BR>
<B>A:</B>	Yes, in almost all cases a spectrum of results exists.  For example, a youth program may mentor at-risk youth. This mentoring (we hope) leads to improved attitudes about school, which leads to increased attendance, which leads to increased academic performance, which leads to increased graduation rates. <BR>
		In the above example, there are several possible outcomes - the number of kids who show improved attitudes toward school, the number who have improved attendance, the number who have improved grades, or the number who graduate.<BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>	What process should be used to select the most important outcomes?<BR>
<B>A:</B>	Ask your key stakeholders - the people who have an interest in the results you are trying to achieve.  Stakeholders include such groups as the public, city council members, mayors, city managers, and department heads and staff.  To get stakeholder feedback consider surveys, retreats, focus groups, special meetings, task forces, and public forums.<BR>
		When identifying the outcomes you will focus on, also consider whether or not an outcome can be measured and how expensive measuring it will be. It may be prudent to focus on outcomes that can be more readily measured as long as the measures are still meaningful, reliable, and valid measures.  <BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>	How do you ensure that the performance measures collected are used?<BR>
<B>A:	</B>Ensure they are useful.  Methods to do this are included in Eleven Ways to Make Performance Measurements More Useful to Public Managers in the September 1994 edition of <I>Public Management</I>. <BR>

<P><B>Q:	</B>What is &quot;benchmarking?&quot;<BR>
<B>A:</B>	Richard J. Fischer in the September 1994 edition of<I> Public Management</I> defines benchmarks as standard performance measures.  Benchmarking  involves comparing the performance of similar organizations using these standard measures.  The comparison is made to determine who is best, to find out why, and then to use the best practices identified as a means of improving your own organization. As Mr. Fischer points out, benchmarks are everywhere: golf course pars, company earnings ratios, baseball bating averages.  Several initiatives are underway to develop benchmarks for cities, including an effort on the part of ICMA and a consortium of cities.  <BR>

<P><B>Q:</B>	What practices contribute to successful performance measurement systems?<BR>
<B>A:</B>	According to Stuart Grifel in the September 1994 edition of<I> Public Management</I>, there are six key things to remember:<BR>
(1) Start with a few measures and don t be too concerned if initial targets are low. Targets can be tightened up once a system is in place and staff are comfortable with it.<BR>
(2) Use existing data whenever possible.  The value of reporting on a particular measure should be weighed against the effort of data collection.<BR>
(3) Audit the data periodically.<BR>
(4) Allow program managers to provide explanatory information on data gathering and reporting forms so that they can explain why performance has deviated if necessary.<BR>
(5) Report measures that are meaningful at the various decision-making levels.  Find a balance between reporting too few and too many measures.<BR>
(6) Ensure that the information is used at all levels, particularly, the operating mangers level.<BR>

<P><B>3. City Descriptions </B><BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>City:  </B>Atlanta, GA<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>Atlanta is committed to developing performance measures that help identify opportunities for improvement and that are based on what is important to the citizens - its primary customers. With this in mind, the city has implemented a management plan that incorporates outcome measures in addition to the traditional output measures. It has also initiated an annual citizens  survey.  <BR>
     In its management plan, the city has identified three priority areas for which outcome measures will be tracked - public safety, quality customer service, and neighborhood vitality/economic development. By focusing on these priorities and corresponding outcome measures, the city more effectively assesses the impact of its actions and allocates the city s budget. The city is also transitioning from a line-item budget to one with more of a programmatic focus. Additional information will come from the citizen survey which will determine (1) how citizens feel about the services the city provides and (2) identify services that need to be improved.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Applicable publications or source material: </B>Atlanta publishes their performance measures in quarterly public reports released to the Finance Committee and the City Manager.  Next year they hope to publish the results of a their citizens  survey.<BR>

<P><B>City:  </B>Austin, TX<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>In fiscal year 1993 Austin initiated performance based budgeting.  As part of this initiative, the city manager and city council held a retreat where they identified ten city priorities. These priorities generally cut across department lines, so inter-department teams (lead by department heads) were formed to develop specific goals and corresponding performance measures.  For instance one of the council s priorities was to improve opportunities for youth.  Several goals were established around this priority, including reducing child abuse and neglect (as measured by the number of incidents in targeted areas) and reducing teen pregnancy (as measured by the pregnancy rate for 13-17 year olds in targeted areas). <BR>
     Similarly, the Austin police department has turned to more meaningful performance measures than the number of arrests made or number of tickets given. They have started to focus on more outcome-oriented measures, like crime rates and customer satisfaction.  They have also recently begun to review their performance-based pay system, so that it rewards officers when outcome measures show a positive change.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Boston, Massachusetts<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>Eight years ago, Boston began to systematically collect performance measures. Two year ago, they took a step back and decided that they needed to focus on fewer, more important indicators.  As part of this process they sponsored a two-day workshop for Department heads.  The purposes of the workshop was two-fold: first, to train staff so that they were able to recognize and develop appropriate outcome measures; and second, to get staff to consider and then answer the question, what information about what we do is most important to the public?  Fifteen departments now have solid performance measures and outcome-based reports.  Moreover, performance measures are used to inform budget decisions, enhance accountability, flag potential problems, and track city priorities. Finally, as the focus on outcomes becomes more and more a part of the city s culture, the Office of Budget and Management is moving away from an enforcement role towards an advisory one - they no longer need to dictate key outcomes to departments.  Instead, they work collaboratively with departments to define pertinent outcomes and measures.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Charlotte, North Carolina<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Twenty years ago Charlotte, with the help of a NASA engineer, instituted a system of management by objectives.  Over time, however, the city realized that they were getting too caught up in the numbers and setting goals based only on what was readily measurable - they had lost the forest for the trees. So they decided to do two things: they decided to develop comprehensive business plans for each of their departments (the business plans include performance objectives) and they decided to set goals and performance measures based first and foremost on what was important to their customers. <BR>
	In order to get public input, the city uses citizen satisfaction surveys, surveys of citizen priorities, and customer comment cards at department offices.  Charlotte has also established a Customer Service Center: one-stop-shopping for citizens who have questions, who need to order work, or who have a problem to report - regardless of the city service or department involved. Information from these customer service mechanisms feeds back into the process in which performance measures are refined.    <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Applicable publications or source material:</B> Charlotte publishes performance measures in their Balance Scorecard report, which is based on the balance scorecard model (this Harvard Business Review model reviews organizational performance along four dimensions - financial, customer service, internal management processes, and innovation and learning).<BR>

<P><B>City:	</B>Cincinnati, Ohio<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> The city council of Cincinnati, with input from the public, council members, and department heads, has identified 10 service delivery priority areas. Corresponding performance measures have also been developed.  While the priority areas cut across department lines (e.g., community relations, economic development), the corresponding performance goals are department specific.  In addition to the performance measures mentioned above, each department also identifies measures that are incorporated into their budget submission. Every other year, a citizens  survey is conducted and the information collected helps inform both the city council and the city administration about citizen priorities.<BR>
	Because performance measurement has become an important part of the city s management strategy, training on developing appropriate outcome measures has been given to over 150 of the city s managers.  As this training increases capacity,  the city is upgrading the measures it uses so that they are fewer in number, but more meaningful in nature.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Applicable publications or source material:</B> Cincinnati publishes performance measures in their biennial budget.  They also publish several key measures as part of their annual Measures of Success report for the city council and the public. Finally, every other year, they publish the results of their citizen survey.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Cleveland, Ohio<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Cleveland has initiated a process of public self-examination called Rating the Region.  It is an area-wide, civic equivalent of the benchmarking process that corporations are using to gauge critical elements of the productivity and effectiveness.  The Citizens League of Greater Cleveland selected the Cleveland and Gund Foundations to assist in launching the effort.  British Petroleum America provided $80,000 in funds and provided expertise on how it uses benchmarking.  BP America s counsel suggested the Citizen League set-up a steering committee, hold public conferences, survey residents by phone, and consider over 300 performance factors.  Ultimately 89 indicators were selected.  Comparable data  was collected from 13 other cities.  The Rating the Region process goes beyond providing comparisons of performance.  It also lets the region plan and manage smarter.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Dallas, Texas<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Dallas employs an interactive and integrated approach to performance measurement with the predominate goal of making local government more customer-driven.  Performance-based budgeting, strategic planing and a performance-based compensation system are all linked together and all focus on results.  <BR>
     During the annual budget process, departments identify primary services and detail appropriate input, output, efficiency, and outcome measures.  Goals and objectives from the strategic plan are incorporated into the performance-based budgeting process where appropriate.  This procedure allows for an informed assessment of budget impacts on service levels and facilitates the evaluation of city services. Major features from both the budget and strategic plan are linked to employee performance plans.  <BR>
     As part of a 1994 reengineering effort, the city created six Service Coordination Teams, covering different sections of the city.  Each team is lead by an assistant city manager and is comprised of representatives from ten primary service delivery departments.  The teams use biennial citizen surveys and neighborhood focus sessions to identify important citizen concerns and find permanent solutions to problems that fall outside those of day-to-day service delivery.  The Teams are also empowered to develop service delivery partnerships with other government entities, non-profits, and the private sector, so that resources can be leveraged and service delivery strategies improved.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>Kansas City is focusing primarily on outcome measures in the areas of code enforcement, fire services, police/corrections, and neighborhood services, but other departments are also attempting to develop outcomes for their services. In order to most effectively use resources, the City Council is also working on setting priorities and goals.  The criteria is based on those areas that show the greatest potential for progress.  Focus groups were conducted and several task forces were created to develop key performance goals.  Additionally, the city has looked at the outcome measures of other communities to compare their performance and to identify effective practices.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Long Beach, California<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> While the city of Long Beach collects performance measures for many of its city services, they have targeted police services as a particular priority. Several years ago the city (facing rapid increases in violent crime and drug activities, coupled with low officer morale) was considering contracting out police functions to the county sheriff s office.  Instead of going this route, the city and Police Department decided to try another approach.  They developed and implemented a strategic plan incorporating goals and performance measures.<BR>
  	Through a series of customer surveys, the city obtained feedback on the things that were important to its citizens. Armed with this feedback, they created three visions for the city: people in Long Beach will feel safer, work together to solve community problems, and have a high level of respect, trust, and confidence in their Police Department.  Strategies and performance measures for addressing these goals were then identified with the help of focus groups and department wide working groups. <BR>
	Some of the performance measures Long Beach uses include: incidence of violent crime, incidence of gang-related violent crime, police response times, percent of citizens who feel safe in their community, and percent of citizens who rate the Police Department s performance as excellent or good. Long Beach is seeing improvement - violent crime went down 13% between 1993 and 1994.  Gang related violent crime went down 26%.  Response times are improving, citizens are feeling safer, and 61% of the public rate the quality of service good or better, versus 54% in 1993. (Note: information provided by Scott Bryant, Long Beach s Director of Strategic Management).<BR>

<B>City:</B> Milwaukee<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>In 1993, Milwaukee initiated an integrated strategic planning and budgeting system called System 94: Mission, Management, Service Delivery. The objectives of the system are to focus attention on longer time horizons, to shift the emphasis from departmental issues and needs to the needs of the city s residents, to give departmental mangers more flexibility in devising strategies to reach their objectives, and to shift the performance emphasis from inputs to outcomes.  <BR>
     Each department has developed a strategic plan that follows from the citywide strategic plan.  These plans include outcome indicators, and are reviewed by the mayor before department budgets requests are prepared. System 94 guidelines limit the number of objectives and related outcomes to five per department so that only the most important outcomes are identified.<BR>
     The established department outcomes are also incorporated into the city budget.  During the annual budget review process, budget analysts assess whether department plans and objectives are consistent with the city plan and whether the links between activities, objectives, and spending are clear. Sixty-eight outcome-oriented objectives and indicators now replace 600 old performance measures and thousands of line items as principle units of analysis for the budget. (Note: information for this summary was taken from Mission, Management, and Service Delivery: Integrating Strategic Planning and Budgeting in Milwaukee, an article by Anne Spray Kinney to be published in the October edition of <I>Government Finance Review</I>.)<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>Oklahoma City s Budget Department began to investigate performance measures several years ago.  Through literature reviews, discussions with other cities, and the ICMA, they developed sets of performance measures for a variety of their city services.  About a year-and-a-half ago, Oklahoma City created a reinventing government task force that was tasked, in part, to review and assess those performance measures.  The task force has been using neighborhood meetings to get both public input and support.  <BR>
	Performance measures are used to develop city priorities and as guideposts for resource allocation.  They are also used for internal department improvement. For instance, the Police Department was able to justify the need for additional officers and their performance measures are providing early indications that a new focus on prevention is working.  The city plans to do a yearly performance report as part of their State of the City report and hopes eventually to participate in some inter-city performance comparisons. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>About two years ago Philadelphia began a city-wide initiative to develop performance measures. While the system created is still quite new, much progress has been made.  Initially, the city budget office, which is taking the lead on the initiative, received primarily output measures from the departments, so it began talking to other cities and researching the literature to see what outcome measures existed.  They took what they learned back to the department heads and began a deliberative process that focused on developing outcome-oriented measures that made sense to department staffs and were consistent with department missions.  <BR>
	Performance measures are now reported quarterly to City Council, the Financial Oversight Board, and the press. Additionally, they are included in the budget testimony of department heads. Three to four key measures per department are also incorporated into the city s five year plan. The city uses performance measures to document improvements for city council and the public, to help allocate resources, and as part of quarterly budget meetings with departments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Applicable publications or source material:</B> Philadelphia publishes performance measures in quarterly service reports, their five year plan, and in the budget testimony of Department heads.

<P><B>City: </B>Phoenix, Arizona<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>With an eye toward learning and improvement, Phoenix began working with results-oriented performance measures five years ago.  Results are currently expressed in terms of 1) customer satisfaction, 2) responsiveness, 3) unit cost, and 4) mission.  Phoenix places a high priority on customer input, and citizen focus groups have been created to get public feedback.  A customer satisfaction survey is also conducted every two years. Finally, on a five-year rotating schedule, each department s mission and programs are given a top-to-bottom review by the budget office. <BR>
	Presently, Phoenix is observing impacts in five departments that have incorporated results-oriented performance measures into their budget process.  Other departments are using them for internal management and decision-making.  They key to success, according to Phoenix managers, is developing a system that is flexible, allows for experimentation, and uses customer input when defining key outcomes.<BR>

<P><B>City: </B>Portland, Oregon<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Portland has put in place a comprehensive performance measurement system. Important outcomes and corresponding measures are based on established missions and goals adopted by the city council in concert with the public.  Public input is solicited through community forums, advisory committees, and a variety of citizen surveys conducted by the Office of the City Auditor, the Mayor s office, and several city departments.<BR>
	The city publishes a <I>Service Efforts and Accomplishments</I>  report which is used by city council to identify successes and potential problems.  They also use it during the budget process.  Departments use performance information for internal management purposes.  Performance information is audited by the Office of the City Auditor and is widely distributed to the public.<BR>
	In 1993 the city also embarked on a community benchmarks initiative when it joined forces with Multnomah County and formed the Portland-Multnomah Progress Board.  This community-wide board is responsible for maintaining benchmarks that measure progress toward key goals.  These goals and corresponding outcome measures cut across public, private, and jurisdictional lines of responsibility. The benchmarks initiative has become a magnet for collaboration as groups join forces to make changes in their community.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Applicable publications or source material:</B> Portland publishes performance information through their annual <I>Service Efforts and Accomplishments</I> report.

<P><B>City: </B>Sunnyvale, California<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description: </B>Sunnyvale has been doing this for a while.  They first started instituting performance measures as part of city management in 1978.  Over the years they have refined both their measures and how they use them.  This review process now centers around three questions:  are the identified outcomes appropriate, are the quality standards developed suitable, and are the measurement and tracking systems used the best ones?  <BR>
	Currently all eleven city departments measure outcome indicators.  These indicators are an integral part the city s pay for performance system, through which managers receive bonuses and sanctions based on the outcomes their department achieve.  The system is about incentives as reflected by the fact that about 50% of the city s managers receive annual bonuses and only 2-3% are sanctioned.  Outcome measures are also an essential element of the city s planning process.  The city council develops work plans consistent with the city s 20 year plan.  The work plans identify priorities and relevant performance measures.  During budget review these performance measures and others department measures are reviewed and assessed. In order to ensure that the system has integrity and is credible, Sunnyvale performs random performance measure audits on all their departments. The success of Sunnyvale s performance-based management strategy is apparent - the city has increased productivity more than 30% in the last six years, maintained low fees, and delivered excellent service with fewer staff than other comparable cities. According to Sunnyvale, the mechanics of identifying and collecting outcome measures gets much easier over time.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Virginia Beach develops its performance measures through two streams.  In the first, the City Council holds a two-day retreat every year during which they develop several city-wide goals - big picture goals that they call destination points.  Department heads then form teams that turns these into more concrete outcomes and action plans.  In the second complimentary stream, Department heads, middle managers, and staff (who are trained to think in terms of outcomes) have been tasked with establishing two key objectives for the department and several corresponding measures. Virginia Beach has incorporated objectives and performance indicators into its budget and hopes in the future to report regularly on the progress they are making.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Description:</B> Through an agreement with Wichita State University, Wichita tapped into the expertise of a professor in residence, who was located in the City Managers office full-time for a year.  During that year department staffs received training on performance measurement and began to flush out key performance indicators. The departments had already been measuring performance to some extent, but they needed to focus their efforts and develop more tailored measures and system for collecting them.  Departments are now refining their measures and doing a review to ensure they are useful.  Community input is being solicited through Neighborhood Council meetings and documentation of frequently asked public questions.  <BR>
	Outcomes have become an integral part of city management. The city manager sets goals with his department heads, who in turn set goals with their staff.  Within departments, performance measures are used to improve performance from year to year as well as to foster friendly competition between department teams.  For instance the crew that does the best job sweeping streets, is rewarded and given special recognition.  Similarly, police from various districts compete to see who provides the best response times.<BR>

<P><B>Applicable publications or source material:</B>  Wichita publishes some performance measures as part of their annual budget.  They hope to develop an annual performance report to the public in the near future.<BR>

<TITLE>	MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONNECTICUT NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION PARTNERSHIP</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<P>
<B> MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</B><BR>
<B>CONNECTICUT NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION PARTNERSHIP</B><BR>
<B>                       </B><BR>

<P><U><B>Purpose </U></B><BR>

<P>The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to encourage and facilitate cooperation among Federal, State and local entities to promote economic development and neighborhood revitalization in Connecticut's neighborhoods and to improve outcomes for Connecticut's residents.  This special partnership will serve as a demonstration of principles and practices which may serve as a model for improvements nationwide.<BR>

<P>Short term action plans or project agreements will supplement this Memorandum of Understanding as the partners work together on specific issues identified as barriers to economic development and neighborhood revitalization.  Examples of  areas where Connecticut would like to begin working together include: exploring innovative financing structures;  developing a common property disposition agreement to dispose of abandoned and foreclosed property through a coordinated approach; modification of historical preservation requirements in low-income neighborhoods; reviewing lead paint abatement, asbestos removal, and urban site remediation procedures and regulations to develop ways to reduce the barriers yet retain necessary safeguards of public health and welfare .<BR>

<P><U><B>Background</U></B> <BR>

<P>A six-year recession with the loss of more than 200,000 jobs, from which Connecticut is only now emerging, has caused Connecticut to completely reshape the landscape of community development and neighborhood revitalization. Public Act 95-340, An Act Establishing a Neighborhood Revitalization Zone Process was developed to articulate a new paradigm and vision.  The Act represents the integration of three policy documents:<BR>

<P>    o	 <U>Connecticut's Goals and Benchmarks for the Year 2000 and Beyond</U><BR>
    o<U>	The Conservation and Development Policies Plan for the State of Connecticut</U> <BR>
    o	<U>Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development</U><BR>

<P>The goals, objectives and strategies embraced by Connecticut represent an innovative approach to community development requiring a major shift in roles and responsibilities for local, state and federal stakeholders -- one which moves all levels towards working together to solve problems and achieve results rather than focusing on specific rules.<BR>

<P>These efforts led Connecticut, with overwhelming bipartisan support, to pass an extremely innovative law, &quot;An Act Establishing a Neighborhood Revitalization Zone Process,&quot;  Public Act No. 95-340, which took effect on October 1, 1995.  This Act creates a new model for economic revitalization of deteriorating neighborhoods -- the creation of Neighborhood Revitalization Zones (NRZ's) and a process for communities and governments to work together to support them.  The law aims to empower local communities to make decisions; provide relief from burdensome state and local regulations and systems barriers, and provide for federal, state and local collaboration to coordinate governmental functions and personnel to develop and implement locally-driven strategic plans for neighborhood revitalization.  <BR>

<P>Numerous Connecticut State and local officials and the entire Congressional delegation approached the Vice President asking the federal government to partner with Connecticut in these efforts.  This Memorandum of Understanding establishes the parameters for that partnership.<BR>

<P><U><B>Principles to Guide Partnership</U></B><BR>

<P>The following principles should guide the parties' cooperation in this undertaking.  The partnership will:<BR>

<P>    o	Be structured, managed, and evaluated on the basis of results (i.e., progress in achieving Connecticut's stated goals or benchmarks).  Moves toward measurement of results rather than micro-management and red tape.<BR>

<P>    o	Focus on customers.<BR>

<P>    o	Shift the impetus of planning and service design and delivery to the local level.  Empower municipalities, neighborhood leaders, regional entities, and community constituency groups to foster neighborhood development.<BR>

<P>    o	Maximize use of federal, state, local and private resources through enhanced coordination and communication. Encourage a problem solving approach between communities and government (local, state and federal) based on mutual trust, collaboration and consensus decision making, where creative solutions to provide flexibility to achieve better results are negotiated and implemented, while streamlining the government's bureaucracy.<BR>

<P>   o	Integrate planning to account for the social, economic and physical development strengths and needs of communities.<BR>

<P><U><B>Responsibilities of the Parties</U></B><BR>

<P><U><B>Federal Role </U></B><BR>

<P>The Community Empowerment Board, the National Performance Review, and federal agencies will work together to support this federal-state-local partnership with Connecticut in the following ways.  Federal partners will showcase Connecticut as a national model, to furnish information to Connecticut and federal agencies about related efforts,  to provide maximum flexibility, to ensure interagency involvement, to designate staff to work with the federal representatives and Connecticut as needed, and to inform and involve the Vice President as needed. <BR>

<P>National Model:  Federal partners will promote and highlight Connecticut as a national model for innovative community revitalization and will share lessons learned from this partnership with federal agencies and other States and localities.  As part of this effort, Connecticut officials will be invited to address other States at national forums.  Federal partners will share available information with Connecticut on potential resources in conjunction with this effort.<BR>

<P>Single Point of Contact and HUD Support:  As the Connecticut Plan focuses on neighborhood revitalization, economic development, and housing issues, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will take the lead on this partnership and assign a field representative as the ongoing single point of contact with Connecticut for purposes of this partnership.  The State and HUD single point of contact will meet at least quarterly to review the progress in implementation of this Partnership.  Additional HUD staff will partner with Connecticut as specific issues arises.  The HUD single point of contact will serve as an interagency representative and will serve as convener on interagency issues to bring together other federal representatives as needed.  Intergovernmental Project Teams will be formed to work through specific issues.<BR>

<P>EPA Support:   Connecticut is also focusing on environment, health and safety codes and regulations, as well as using &quot;Brownfields&quot; and other foreclosed and abandoned properties as a primary tool to revitalize neighborhoods.  Therefore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also assign one person as a primary EPA liaison for the Connecticut partnership with additional EPA staff support as relevant issues arise.  EPA's Region I Office will provide the primary EPA liaison for the Connecticut partnership with support from EPA headquarters.  The EPA staff will collaborate with the HUD contact to work regularly with Connecticut on this partnership.<BR>

<P>Interagency Support:  Other federal agencies will participate as needed throughout this partnership to support Connecticut and its communities.<BR>

<P>  o	The single point of contact (from HUD) will serve as convener on interagency issues.<BR>

<P>  o	Through the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) Task Force, the HUD lead will notify other agencies of waiver/barrier removal requests affecting their agencies and will process these requests.<BR>

<P>  o	Through the Community Empowerment Board (CEB) Working Group, HUD and EPA will notify other agencies of policy and other issues affecting their agencies.  CEB Working Group Members will identify appropriate experts and staff from their agencies to work with Connecticut as needed.<BR>

<P>  o	Connecticut will be able to access the technical assistance being provided to the EZ/EC cities.<BR>

<P>Flexibility: To the fullest extent feasible in terms of authority and available resources and without compromising public health and welfare, the federal partners will help provide flexibility to Connecticut by processing waiver requests, removing barriers, using regulatory discretion, and providing technical assistance to identify possible alternatives to enhance local flexibility.<BR>
  <BR>
     o	The HUD and EPA liaisons will process waiver/barrier removal requests that fall within their respective jurisdictions.<BR>

<P>     o	The HUD single point of contact for Connecticut will work with the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community task force to ensure that flexibility requests from Connecticut that impact agencies other than HUD and EPA are processed by the relevant agencies.<BR>
  <BR>
    o	The HUD liaison will  present to the Community Empowerment Board working group any interagency policy issues or requests for assistance as they arise.<BR>

<P>Information and Technical Assistance:  To the extent feasible, the federal partners will provide  Connecticut and its municipalities information and technical assistance as needed (e.g., benchmarking, performance measurement, data, capacity building, community development financing, negotiated environmental strategies, public safety strategies).<BR>

<P><U><B>State Role</U></B> <BR>

<P>Single Point of Contact:  The Connecticut Office of Policy and Management will provide a single point of contact between the Neighborhood Revitalization Zones (NRZs) and the federal government.  <BR>

<P>Coordination:  The State will process waiver requests from municipalities and will look systematically across NRZs to analyze, synthesize, determine common requests, and coordinate waiver/barrier requests from the NRZs.  The State will negotiate creative solutions which overcome barriers to community development.  The State will help NRZs determine which flexibility requests require federal action and will then notify federal partners through the HUD single point of contact.  To allow federal partners to address the State's most pressing needs and achieve the greatest results, the State will prioritize requests for flexibility based on the priority needs and the degree to which the alternatives offered by neighborhoods are likely to lead to superior results.  The State will also identify common or &quot;generic&quot; requests to eliminate duplication.<BR>
Measure Results:  The State will work with NRZs to help them meet the requirement of the law that they monitor and evaluate the progress of their plan.  This will include the use of outcome and performance measures.  The State will work with NRZ's to develop measures to track performance towards established goals.<BR>

<P>Flexibility:  The State will  process waiver/modification requests from municipalities.  The state official responsible for code enforcement will hold a public hearing after notification from the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) and must notify the municipal chief executive after the hearing of the decision regarding the waiver request.<BR>

<P>Interagency Support:  The State will review all NRZ Committee plans and provide feedback.  The Connecticut Office of Policy and Management will coordinate multiagency collaboration to provide services,<B> </B>fund reallocation, technical support and training to neighborhoods.  For example, the State may recommend models for community outreach, job training and education, conflict resolution, environmental and health performance standards, new technologies, and public safety strategies.<BR>

<P><U><B>Local (Municipality) Role</U></B> <BR>

<P>Create Neighborhood Revitalization Zones:  Through municipal resolutions, municipalities may create Neighborhood Revitalization Zones (NRZs) -- in areas where a significant number of properties are foreclosed, abandoned, blighted, substandard, or pose a public safety hazard.  The municipalities will jointly determine zone boundaries with neighborhood committees. <BR>

<P>Support NRZs:  Municipalities will facilitate neighborhood planning processes, assign municipal staff, provide information to neighborhood committees, and modify municipal procedures to assist NRZs.<BR>

<P>Planning:  Municipalities will hold public hearings prior to the adoption of a neighborhood committee's strategic revitalization plan.  Municipalities will submit proposed plans to the State (Secretary, Connecticut Office of Policy and Management) for review and comment.  The municipality will then adopt the plan through municipal ordinance<BR>

<P>Flexibility:  Municipalities will review requests for waivers/modifications of local codes and regulations and forward relevant requests for waivers/modifications to state officials.  Upon receipt of waiver requests from the neighborhood committees, the municipal chief executive official must notify the local official responsible for code enforcement and the Secretary of Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management.  The local official will hold a public hearing and provide to the municipal chief executive after the hearing a decision regarding the waiver request and a reason if the waiver is denied.<BR>

<P>Interagency Support:  Municipalities will establish multi-agency collaborative delivery teams and will collaborate to identify regional solutions to achieve community development results.<BR>

<P><U><B>Neighborhood Role</U></B><BR>

<P>Strategic Planning:  Neighborhoods will form Neighborhood Revitalization Planning Committees  (tenants, property owners, community organizations, businesses with property in neighborhood, municipal official) to create and approve the neighborhood strategic plan for short term and long term revitalization of the neighborhood.  The strategic plan:<BR>

<P>  o	will promote self-reliance in the neighborhood, home ownership, property management, sustainable economic development, effective relations between landlords and tenants, coordinated and comprehensive delivery of services to the neighborhood and creative leveraging of financial resources and shall build neighborhood capacity for self-empowerment;<BR>
 <BR>
  o	will include provisions for obtaining funds from public and private sources;<BR>

<P>  o	will consider provisions for property usage, neighborhood design, traditional and nontraditional financing of developing, marketing and outreach, property management, utilization of municipal facilities by communities, recreation, and the environment;<BR>

<P>  o	will include recommendations for waivers of state and local environment, health and safety codes, and regulations that unreasonably jeopardize implementation of the plan;<BR>

<P>  o	will assign responsibility for implementing each aspect of the plan;<BR>

<P>  o	may contain an inventory of abandoned, foreclosed and deteriorated property; <BR>

<P>  o	may analyze federal, state and local environmental, health and safety codes and regulations that impact revitalization of neighborhoods;<BR>

<P>  o	 may include components for public safety, education, job training, youth, the elderly, and arts and culture; and<BR>

<P>  o	may contain recommendations for establishment of municipal multi-agency collaborative delivery teams, including code enforcement teams.<BR>

<P>Flexibility:  Neighborhood Committees may request waivers and/or barrier removal regarding rules and regulations that impede the plan, particularly state and local environment, health and safety codes and regulations that unreasonably jeopardize implementation of the plan.  Neighborhood Committees may also request local and state government to reallocate funds and personnel to the NRZs.<BR>

<P>Measure Results:  Neighborhoods will monitor and evaluate the progress of the plan.  Neighborhoods will report on the plan's implementation to the local legislative body, municipal chief executive official, and the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management -- every 6 months during the first year; annually thereafter.<BR>

<P><U><B>Authorities</U></B><BR>

<P>The principles and responsibilities covered in this memorandum are intended to improve the process of communities and government working together to revitalize neighborhoods.  This memorandum does not commit any of the parties to a particular level of resources; nor is it intended to create any right or benefit or diminish any existing right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, State of Connecticut, any state or federal agency, any state or federal official, any part of this agreement, or any person.  While significant changes to the intergovernmental system are anticipated as a result of this effort, this is not a legally binding or enforceable agreement.  Nothing in this memorandum alters the responsibilities or statutory authorities of the Federal agencies, or State or local governments.

Title: NPR Recommendations Affecting Services to Children and Families<BR>

<P>Author: National Performance Review<BR>

<P>Date:  3-30-94<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> National Performance Review<BR>

<P> Recommendations Affecting Services<BR>

<P> To Children and Families<BR>

<P> **********************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Principles of the National Performance Review<BR>

<P> We will invent a government that puts people first, by:<BR>

<P> Cutting Unnecessary Spending<BR>

<P> Serving It's Customers<BR>

<P> Empowering Its Employees<BR>

<P> Helping Communities to Solve Their Own Problems<BR>

<P> Fostering Excellence   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Here's how.  We will:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Create a clear sense of mission<BR>

<P> Steer more, row less<BR>

<P> Delegate authority and responsibility<BR>

<P> Replace regulations with incentives<BR>

<P> Develop budgets based on outcomes<BR>

<P> Expose Federal operations to competition<BR>

<P> Search for market, not administrative solutions<BR>

<P> Measure our success by customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> The principles laid out above underpin all of the recommendations to <BR>

<P> reinvent government developed by the National Performance Review <BR>

<P> (NPR).  In  developing recommendations,  the NPR looked internally at <BR>

<P> each of the 25 largest agencies as well as across the Federal system <BR>

<P> at 13 functions that are critical to making government work better <BR>

<P> and cost less.  Many recommendations within each of these areas <BR>

<P> affect services to children and families.  Those NPR recommendations <BR>

<P> that affect -- both directly and indirectly -- services to children <BR>

<P> and families are summarized below, and are categorized by the NPR <BR>

<P> agency and system reports which accompany the September 1993 NPR <BR>

<P> summary report, &quot;From Red Tape to Results:  Making Government Work <BR>

<P> Better and Cost Less&quot;.  More detail can be found on each of these <BR>

<P> recommendations in the accompanying reports.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> These recommendations have been compiled here to serve as a tool for <BR>

<P> stimulating cross-cutting actions and efforts to collaborate and <BR>

<P> coordinate the hundreds of Federal programs serving children and <BR>

<P> families.  Some of these recommendations directly improve children <BR>

<P> and family programs.  Others improve all government services and <BR>

<P> operations, including those to children and families.  Explanatory <BR>

<P> notes (in italics) follow those recommendations where the <BR>

<P> relationship to children and family programs may not be entirely <BR>

<P> clear.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> With at least 340 children and families programs administered by 11 <BR>

<P> different Federal agencies, it is imperative in our efforts to <BR>

<P> improve the delivery of service to the customers of this country that <BR>

<P> we look across departments and agencies as well as at our fundamental <BR>

<P> operation of  governmental systems.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> While this compilation lists the relevant  recommendations made in <BR>

<P> the NPR reports, many additional efforts are underway all across <BR>

<P> government.  As communities and governments at all levels strive to <BR>

<P> implement these efforts and to improve services to children and <BR>

<P> families, the NPR principles can serve as a guide.Major <BR>

<P> Recommendations by Agency<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> There are eleven federal agencies predominately responsible for <BR>

<P> providing or funding services to children and families.  The relevant <BR>

<P> recommendations from the NPR reports covering these agencies are <BR>

<P> summarized below.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Improving service delivery requires partnership at all levels, <BR>

<P> intergovernmentally as well as internally within the Federal <BR>

<P> government.  Efforts to strengthen services within each agency <BR>

<P> impacts services to that agency's customers, as well as services <BR>

<P> provided or funded by other agencies that serve the same customers.  <BR>

<P> In order to keep this customer in focus, we must recognize these <BR>

<P> interconnections from the customer's perspective and work to better <BR>

<P> coordinate our efforts.  Many of the systems' recommendations <BR>

<P> (summarized below following the specific agency recommendations) are <BR>

<P> aimed at improving inter-agency coordination.<BR>

<P> USDA06   Encourage Better Food Package Management Practices and <BR>

<P> Facilitate Multi-State Contracts for Infant Food and Formula Cost <BR>

<P> Containment in the WIC program<BR>

<P>  The recommendation encourages increased competition among infant <BR>

<P> formula vendors and manufacturers of other items in the USDA's <BR>

<P>  FEMA's early focus was on preparedness for nuclear war.  The <BR>

<P> current world situation and recent natural disasters highlight the <BR>

<P> need for FEMA to continue to shift its resources to respond to all <BR>

<P> hazards.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FEMA02   Develop a More Anticipatory and Customer-Driven Response to <BR>

<P> ***************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> ICS01   Create Customer-driven Programs in All Departments and<BR>

<P> Agencies that Provide Services Directly to the Public <BR>

<P>  Establish an overall policy for quality of federal services<BR>

<P> delivered to the public and initiate customer service programs in<BR>

<P> all agencies that provide services directly to the public.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ICS02   Customer Service Performance Standards--Internal Revenue <BR>

<P> Service <BR>

<P>  As part of its participation in the NPR, the Internal Revenue<BR>

<P> Service is publishing customer service performance standards.  To<BR>

<P> speed the delivery of taxpayer refunds, the Secretary of the<BR>

<P> Treasury should delegate disbursing authority to IRS in 1993 and<BR>

<P> future tax seasons.  IRS serves the same customers as several other<BR>

<P> Federal programs.  With the expansion of the Earned Income Tax<BR>

<P> Credit (EITC), IRS's responsiveness to it's customers becomes even <BR>

<P> more relevant to Federal programs such as Aid to Families with<BR>

<P> Dependent Children and Food Stamps.  The effective disbursement of<BR>

<P> these EITC payments could prevent the need for families to seek<BR>

<P> assistance in these other Federal programs.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ICS03   Customer Service Performance Standards--Social <BR>

<P> Security Administration <BR>

<P>  As part of its participation in the NPR, the Social Security <BR>

<P> Administration is publishing customer service performance standards.  <BR>

<P> SSA will also obtain customer opinions on all the goals and<BR>

<P> objectives of their strategic plan, using that input to revise the<BR>

<P> goals and objectives as needed, set priorities, and establish<BR>

<P> interim objectives.<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P> ICS05   Streamline Ways to Collect Customer Satisfaction and Other <BR>

<P> Information from the Public <BR>

<P>  For voluntary information collection requests directed at<BR>

<P> customers, OMB will delegate authority to approve such requests if<BR>

<P> departments certify that they will fully comply with Paperwork<BR>

<P> Reduction Act requirements.  OMB will also clarify rules on the use<BR>

<P> of focus groups and streamline renewals of previously approved<BR>

<P> survey requests.<BR>

<P> Services <BR>

<P>  Use electronic funds transfer to pay and reimburse expenses for all <BR>

<P> federal employees, to handle all interagency payments, to make<BR>

<P> payments to state and local governments, and to pay for purchases<BR>

<P> from the private sector.  Similarly, all payments to individuals<BR>

<P> should be done electronically.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Individual and Organizational Performance<BR>

<P>  Authorize agencies to design their own performance management<BR>

<P> programs which define and measure success based on each agency's<BR>

<P> unique needs.  In departments charged with serving children and<BR>

<P> families, human resource tools which reinforce a clear sense of<BR>

<P> mission, performance goals, and expected results will help to<BR>

<P> improve outcomes of all programs. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HRM04   Authorize Agencies to Develop Incentive Award and Bonus <BR>

<P> Systems to Improve Individual and Organizational Performance<BR>

<P>  Authorize agencies to develop their own incentive award and bonus<BR>

<P> systems.  Encourage agencies to establish productivity gainsharing<BR>

<P> programs to support their reinvention and change efforts.  These<BR>

<P> actions are among the human resource tools which can be used to<BR>

<P> improve government performance in all programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> HRM06   Clearly Define the Objective of Training as the Improvement <BR>

<P> of Individual and Organizational Performance;  Make Training More <BR>

<P> Market-Driven<BR>

<P>  Reduce restrictions on training to allow managers to focus on <BR>

<P> organizational mission and to take advantage of the available<BR>

<P> training marketplace.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HRM07   Enhance Programs to Provide Family-Friendly Workplaces<BR>

<P>  Implement family-friendly workplace practices (flex-time,<BR>

<P> flexiplace, job sharing, telecommuting) while ensuring<BR>

<P> accountability for customer service.  Provide telecommunications and<BR>

<P> administrative support necessary for employees participating in<BR>

<P> flexiplace and telecommuting work arrangements.  Expand the<BR>

<P> authority to establish and fund dependent care programs.  Allow <BR>

<P> employees to use sick leave to care for dependents.  Allow employees<BR>

<P> who leave and then re-enter federal service to be given credit for<BR>

<P> prior sick leave balances.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Reinventing Federal Procurement<BR>

<P> *******************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> PROC07   Enhance Programs for Small Business and Small Disadvantaged <BR>

<P> Business Concerns<BR>

<P>  Repeal statutory limitations on subcontracting and substitute<BR>

<P> regulatory limitations to provide greater flexibility.  Authorize<BR>

<P> civilian agencies to establish small disadvantaged business set-<BR>

<P> asides.  These actions will affect economic development in<BR>

<P> distressed communities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> PROC10   Ensure Customer Focus in Procurement<BR>

<P>  Revise Procurement Management Reviews to incorporate NPR principles <BR>

<P> such as &quot;focusing on results&quot; for the  line managers.<BR>

<P> Information and Service <BR>

<P>  Use information technology initiatives to improve customer service<BR>

<P> by creating a one-stop &quot;800&quot; calling service, integrated one-stop<BR>

<P> service &quot;kiosks,&quot; and a government-wide electronic bulletin board<BR>

<P> system.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> IT04   Establish a National Law Enforcement/Public Safety Network <BR>

<P>  Establish a national law enforcement/public safety data network for<BR>

<P> use by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials.  <BR>

<P> information to improve government service.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> IT10  Develop Systems and Mechanisms to Ensure Privacy and Security <BR>

<P>  Establish a Privacy Protection Board.  Establish uniform privacy<BR>

<P> protection practices and generally acceptable implementation methods<BR>

<P> for these practices.  Develop a digital signature standard for<BR>

<P> sensitive, unclassified data by January 1994.  In children and<BR>

<P> family programs, confidentiality concerns have impeded some past<BR>

<P> efforts for interagency and interdisciplinary collaboration.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>

<P> **************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> DES01   Activate Program Design as a Formal Discipline<BR>

<P>  The President's Management Council should commission the<BR>

<P> development of a handbook to help federal managers understand the<BR>

<P> Information Highway<BR>

<P>  To assist in the distribution of government information to private <BR>

<P> citizens, Commerce should build a business and economic information <BR>

<P> node to the &quot;information highway.&quot;<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P>  Department of Defense<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> DOD07   Create a Healthy and Safe Environment for Department of <BR>

<P> Defense Activities<BR>

<P>  To create a safe environment, DOD must take action in the areas of <BR>

<P> clean-up of hazardous wastes, use of environmental technology, and <BR>

<P> pollution prevention.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> DOD12   Streamline and Reorganize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<BR>

<P>  NPR recommends implementing a 1992 reorganization proposal that <BR>

<P> would reduce the number of division offices from 11 to six and would <BR>

<P> allow the Corps to work with OMB and other agencies to make maximum <BR>

<P> use of Corps' engineering and technical capabilities.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> Department of Education<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED01   Redesign Chapter 1 of Elementary and Secondary Education Act <BR>

<P>  Recommendations focus education funds on the neediest students and <BR>

<P> simplify requirements on schools receiving federal education aid.  <BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED03   Consolidate the Eisenhower Math and Science Education Program <BR>

<P> with Chapter 2<BR>

<P>  NPR proposes combining this teacher training program, which is <BR>

<P> largely consumed with short-term training, with other ED programs to <BR>

<P> create a new program with a more coherent national focus on teacher <BR>

<P> training and professional development.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED05   Streamline and Improve the Department of Education's Grants <BR>

<P> Process<BR>

<P>  Statutory restrictions on the department's rulemaking process should <BR>

<P> be removed, flexibility added to certain procedures, and unnecessary <BR>

<P> requirements eliminated to shorten the grant award process.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED07   Simplify and Strengthen Institutional Eligibility and <BR>

<P> Certification for Participation in Federal Student Aid<BR>

<P>  NPR recommends developing ways of measuring default indicators, <BR>

<P> creating profiles of high-risk institutions, and removing <BR>

<P> eligibility of institutions to participate in federal financial aid <BR>

<P> programs once the schools have become ineligible to receive federal <BR>

<P> student loan funds.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED08   Create a Single Point of Contact for Program and Grant <BR>

<P> Information<BR>

<P>  ED should create an electronic system that can be used by students, <BR>

<P> parents, researchers and administrators to learn about department <BR>

<P> programs, funding opportunities, best practices and other <BR>

<P> information.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED10   Eliminate the Grantback Statutory Provision of the General <BR>

<P> Education Provisions Act<BR>

<P>  NPR recommends repealing this provision which permits the department <BR>

<P> to return to a grantee a percentage of funds recovered from the grantee<BR>

<P> as a result of an audit.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> ED12   Develop a Strategy for Technical Assistance and Information <BR>

<P> Dissemination<BR>

<P>  ED should develop a strategy for its $290 million technical assistance<BR>

<P> efforts designed to promote the National Goals 2000 themes.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  Department of Energy<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> DOE01   Improve Environmental Contract Management<BR>

<P>  NPR proposes improvements in DOE environmental clean-up contracts to <BR>

<P> achieve efficiency.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> DOE02   Incorporate Land Use Planning in Cleanup<BR>

<P>  NPR recommends that DOE incorporate land use planning into the <BR>

<P> nuclear facilities clean-up process.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> DOE08   Support the Sale of the Alaska Power Administration <BR>

<P>  The federal government should divest its interests in the Alaska <BR>

<P> Power Administration.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  Environmental Protection Agency<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> EPA01   Improve Environmental Protection Through Increased <BR>

<P> Flexibility for Local Government<BR>

<P>  EPA should amend the regulations it determines are most troublesome <BR>

<P> for local governments pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of <BR>

<P> 1980.  The goal is to provide alternative, flexible approaches to <BR>

<P> meeting environmental mandates.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> EPA02   Streamline EPA's Permit Program<BR>

<P>  Streamlining efforts include establishing a permit clearinghouse to <BR>

<P> serve as a single point of contact and piloting a cross-program <BR>

<P> permit tracking system.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> EPA04   romote the Use of Economic and Market-Based Approaches to <BR>

<P> Reduce Water Pollution<BR>

<P>  EPA should work with Congress to propose language amending the Clean <BR>

<P> Water Act to explicitly encourage market-based approaches to reduce <BR>

<P> water pollution.  EPA should also identify wastewater discharge fees <BR>

<P> that could be included in the Clean Water Act reauthorization.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> Executive Office of the President<BR>

<P> issues.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  Federal Emergency Management Agency<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FEMA01   Shift Emphasis to Preparing for and Responding to the <BR>

<P> Consequences of All Disasters<BR>

<P>  FEMA's early focus was on preparedness for nuclear war.  The current <BR>

<P> world situation and recent natural disasters highlight the need for <BR>

<P> FEMA to continue to shift its resources to respond to all hazards.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FEMA02   Develop a More Anticipatory and Customer-Driven Response to <BR>

<P> Catastrophic Disasters<BR>

<P>  These recommendations should make FEMA respond faster and more <BR>

<P> effectively to catastrophic disasters.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FEMA03   Create Results-Oriented Incentives to Reduce the Costs of a <BR>

<P> Disaster<BR>

<P>  The Midwest floods, Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew and the Loma Prieta <BR>

<P> Earthquake all illustrate the enormous costs of disaster to society. <BR>

<P> These recommendations will move toward reducing that cost.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  Department of Health and Human Services<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HHS01   Promote Effective, Integrated Service Delivery for Customers <BR>

<P> by Increasing Collaborative Efforts<BR>

<P>  These recommendations outline a number of steps needed to better <BR>

<P> integrate and deliver social services to communities and families.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HHS02   Reengineer the HHS Process for Issuing Regulations <BR>

<P> and should involve stakeholders in the development of regulations.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HHS05   Restructure the Management of Railroad Industry Benefit <BR>

<P> Programs<BR>

<P>  Railroad Retirement Board functions should be integrated into <BR>

<P> existing programs administered by federal, state, and private sector <BR>

<P> service providers.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HHS08   Coordinate Collection and Dissemination of Social Security <BR>

<P> Administration Death Information to Protect Federal Program Assets<BR>

<P>  SSA's clearinghouse for death information and &quot;best practices&quot; can <BR>

<P> be used by dozens of federal and state agencies to reduce federal <BR>

<P> program outlays.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> HHS13   Review the Field and Regional Office Structure of the HHS <BR>

<P> and Develop a Plan for Shifting Resources to Match Workload Demands <BR>

<P>  The review should emphasize customer service, results and increased <BR>

<P> accountability.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>  Department of Housing and Urban Development<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD01   Reinvent Public Housing<BR>

<P>  HUD should create pilot programs to devolve greater authority over <BR>

<P> housing funds to sound local agencies.  It should create demonstrations<BR>

<P> of mixed-income public housing with portable subsidies.  HUD should<BR>

<P> also streamline public housing rules and take other steps to improve<BR>

<P> public housing management.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD02   Improve Multi-Family Asset Management and Disposition <BR>

<P>  HUD should use public-private partnerships to manage and sell HUD-<BR>

<P> held loans and real estate for non-subsidized housing projects.  <BR>

<P> Congress should reduce restrictions on HUD sale of multi-family <BR>

<P> properties, including use of portable subsidies for tenants when the <BR>

<P> Secretary determines that to be best for tenant needs.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> HUD03   Improve Single-Family Asset Management and Disposition <BR>

<P>  HUD should use a combination of early assistance to borrowers <BR>

<P> having financial difficulties, contract loan servicing, contract <BR>

<P> mortgage assistance programs and public-private partnerships to <BR>

<P> streamline and improve management of HUD- assigned single-family <BR>

<P> mortgages.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HUD04   Create an Assisted-Housing/Rent Subsidy Demonstration Project<BR>

<P>  HUD should be authorized to experiment in negotiated restructuring <BR>

<P> of privately owned assisted-housing projects to improve management, <BR>

<P> promote mixed-income housing and save taxpayer funds.<BR>

<P>   <BR>

<P> HUD05   Establish a New Housing Production Program<BR>

<P>  HUD should stimulate housing production through FHA risk-sharing <BR>

<P> arrangements with housing finance agencies, stimulate a secondary <BR>

<B>Current Federal grant system.</B><P>

A great deal of the current grant system has broken down in a tangle of good intentions gone
awry.  There are too many funding categories, suffocating regulations and paperwork,
misdirected emphasis on remediating rather than preventing problems, and no clear focus on
measurable outcomes.  The system stifles initiative and squanders resources without achieving
sufficient results.  Performance partnerships offer improvements to the current system.<P>


<B>What is a performance partnership?</B><P>


Performance partnerships provide increased flexibility on how a program is run in exchange for
increased accountability for results.<P>

<UL>
<LI>    Increased flexibility includes:<BR>
      <UL>
     <LI>consolidated funding streams
     <LI>elimination of micromanagement,
     <LI>devolved decision-making (national goals and objectives, with much more flexibility
                        for State and local partners to determine HOW these are achieved), and
      <LI>reduced wasteful paperwork.
     </UL>

<LI> Increased accountability for results means the partners will:
        <UL>
       <LI> begin to treat outcomes and outputs as the basic measure of success (e.g., teenage
              pregnancy rate rather than number of visits to a clinic), and 
        <LI>create funding and other incentives to reward desirable results and performance
              towards results.
        </UL>
</UL>
<B>Where do performance partnerships make sense?</B><P>

Performance partnerships work best:<P>
<UL>
<LI>    When the Federal Government intends to deliver services at State and local levels,
<LI>    Where there is shared agreement among Federal, State and local partners about 
       national goals and objectives, and
<LI>    Where progress toward the goals and objectives can be measured.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Checklist of Guiding Principles for Designing a Performance Partnership</B><P>

A number of key characteristics should be considered designing and implementing performance
partnerships:<P>
<OL>
<LI>    Program consolidations       
<LI>    Partnership
<LI>    Increased Flexbility
<LI>    Improved Accountability
<LI>    Measuring Performance
<LI>    Performance Incentives
<LI>    Shift in the Locus of Decision-making
<LI>    Administrative Simplification
<LI>    Administrative Savings
<LI>    Implementation
<LI>    Entitlement Programs
</OL>

The checklist which follows contains principles which build upon the description of the
Administration's  six proposed "performance partnerships" in the President's FY 1996 FY 1996
Budget (see pages 152-154).  The guiding principles should be regarded as <B>"rebuttable
presumptions"</B>:<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>(a)</TD><TD>  In any policy arena in which there is a strong national interest and a history of Federal
          grants and other assistance to State and local governments, agencies should give strong
          consideration to developing one or more performance partnerships.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>(b)</TD><TD>  If a proposed performance partnership is not consistent with a particular principle, there
     should be a compelling argument about how the program is otherwise addressing local
     needs, stops micromanagement, and holds its partners accountable for results.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<B>     1.   Program consolidations</B>
<UL>
<LI> Proposals should structure current grant program authorizations to consolidate
          programs and/or funding streams and eliminate overlapping authorities:

               <UL>
               <LI> Every effort should be made to merge funding streams which now force
                recipients to wastefully isolate administration and delivery of one program
                from another to avoid being penalized by auditors.
                </UL>
</UL>
<B>     2.   Partnership</B>
<UL>
<LI> Federal, State and local partners should jointly design the partnership and the strategies to implement it.
     
<LI> Performance partnerships should accommodate different program strategies with different state and local partners.
</UL>
<B>     3.   Increased Flexibility</B>
<UL>
<LI>Performance partnerships should:</TD></TR>
               <UL>
                <LI> Promote multiple approaches to meeting national objectives,
                <LI> Allow federally-funded activities to be fully integrated with State, local 
               provider activities, and
                <LI> Allow flexibility so that State and local institutional forces and incentives
               achieve the desired results.
               </UL> 

<LI> If State plans are necessary, multiple "State Plan" requirements should be replaced
          with one "community-based strategic plan.  "Such a plan would outline basic
          strategies and tactics, and accommodate much more diversity from community-to-community and state-to-state than existing approaches.

<LI>  Partnerships should:
                <UL>
                 <LI>   Minimize "required" service requirements, and
                 <LI>  Provide multi-year funding.
                  </UL>
</UL>
<B>     4.   Improved Accountability </B>
<UL>
<LI>Federal agencies and State or local partners should develop, communicate, and monitor measurable program goals and report progress toward achieving them:
     <UL>
      <LI>Think in terms of shared accountability.
      </UL>
<LI> Performance partnerships should focus on outputs and outcomes (real results) rather than detailed assessment of the inputs and process used by States and localities:
          <UL>
         <LI>An emphasis on results means, for example, concentrating on getting cleaner air (not the  existence of State environmental regulations) or whether educational goals are being achieved (not the level of school expenditures).
           </UL>
<LI>Notwithstanding increased flexibility, performance partnerships will maintain
Constitutional and critical, national public policy requirements:
             <UL>
            <LI>Non-discrimination requirements, for example, will apply.</TD></TR>
             </UL>
</UL>
<B>     5.   Measuring Performance</B>
<UL>
     <LI>   Performance partnerships should be structured, managed, and evaluated on the
          basis of results (i.e., progress in terms of agreed upon measures of performance).

   <LI>   Performance measures will typically include a mix of outcome and output
          measures, including both measures of progress toward national goals and
          measures of important negative consequences that are likely to result from
          program activities.

    <LI>    Partnerships should focus on outcomes (not process) as the principal criteria by
          which to measure success.

     <LI>    Authorizing legislation should include a statement of:
          <UL>
            <LI>"National goals and objectives" that the partnership seeks to help achieve.<BR>

               For example:  "parental responsibility."

            <LI>Types of "performance information that would indicate what types of information would indicate progress toward the national goals and objectives.<BR>
                For example:  "paternities established"

         <LI>The Federal Agency should be authorized to develop National goals and objectives where the authorizing legislation does not specify them.<BR>
                 For example: "The Secretary shall, in conjunction with the states, local governments, providers and Consumers develop national goals and objectives."
          </UL>

 <LI>    "Performance measures" and performance targets should not be incorporated in
          authorizing legislation.<P>

          For example:  "The Secretary shall, in conjunction with States, local governments,
          providers and consumers, develop and update measures for determining State or
          local performance in achieving progress toward the national goals and objectives.<P>

          Accordingly, performance measures and targets should be:
      <UL>
          <LI> Mutually developed by the partners, or
          <LI>  In the case of certain core indicators, developed by the Federal Government in 
                    consultation with grantees, and supplemented with indicators mutually agreed 
                    to by the grantees.
          <LI>  Refined over time in consultation with the grantees.
       </UL>
         Performance measures require specification of at least the following:<P>

          (1)  Type of performance information.<BR>
          (2)  Data source (or sources).<BR>
          (3)  Acceptable levels of precision and accuracy.<BR>
          (4)  Domains of estimations (e.g., Sates, counties, etc.)<BR>
          (5)  Frequency of data collection.<BR>
          (6)  Time period covered.<P>
       <DD> <TABLE>
               <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>For example:  for "paternities established"</TD></TR>
               <TR><TD>(1.1)</TD><TD>Percentage of new welfare cases for which paternities have been established,  for each fiscal year cohort of new welfare recipients.</TD></TR>
               <TR><TD>(1.2)</TD><TD> Percentage of the total welfare caseload for which paternities have
                         been established, as of the close of each fiscal year.</TD></TR>

                    1% at the State level.</TD></TR>
              <TR><TD>(4)</TD><TD>The sample design must support precision and accuracy
                    requirements for State (county) level estimates or for the
                    population generally (e.g., the entire sample may be allocated per
                    county, or even"n" cases per 1,000 per county).</TD></TR>

               </TABLE>
    <LI>    Performance agreements:
          <UL>
          <LI>  Federal agencies should develop individual performance agreements with each 
                    State/locality receiving funds.<BR>
               For example:  "The Secretary shall, in conjunction with the States, local
               governments,providers and consumers, develop individual performance
             agreements which specify the program performance measures, performance 
              targets, and the timeframes for achieving the performance targets.
           </UL>
 <LI> Assessing progess:
         <UL>
          <LI>   The authorizing legislation should include a requirement that the Federal 
            agency work with  the partners to develop a system for assessing the extent of
                 progress toward national objectives.<BR>

                     For example:  "The Secretary shall, in conjunction with the States, local
                 governments, providers  and consumers, develop a system for assessing the
                 extent of progress  toward the national objectives."

          <LI>    At least annually, the partners should assess the level of performance achieved,
                   the extent to which performance meets or exceeds agreed-on performance
               targets, and the extent to which performance has changed over time.  These 
               reports should acknowledge the influence of important external factors that
       may have affected the performance levels achieved.

                <LI>    From time to time, annual performance r  eports should be supplemented by  
             program evaluations that estimate the net program impacts caused by the
              program.  These program evaluations would use research designs to estimate
       the difference that the program makes  (i.e., the difference between (a) the
       actual performance levels achieved, and (b) the  performance levels that would
                 have been achieved in the absence of the program).
                 </UL>
<LI>    Data collection:
        <UL>
          <LI>    The partners will have to identify or develop data systems to define and assess                      "results" and  "improvement in results.
           <BR>
          For example:  "The Secretary is authorized to withhold up to 5 percent of the
          amount appropriated the program to support the development and updating of data
          systems tied closely to the national goals; the development of performance
          agreements with States;  and data quality assurance and data quality improvement;
          and research and development of performance measurement methodology."

          <LI>    Partners should consider whether and how to get data that is generalizable, and
                    consistent among and within States overtime.
        </UL>

<LI>    Refining the measures over time:
       <UL>
          <LI>    It is expected that the performance measurement process and indicators will                evolve over time, as Federal agencies and grantees develop greater experience             with this approach.
         </UL>
</UL>
  <B>   6.   Performance Incentives</B><P>
<UL>
     <LI>    Agencies should consider whether funds should be allocated in part on
          performance (but other factors such as need may also be determinants, including
          population, poverty, disease incidence, morbidity, and morality, as appropriate).

     <LI>    Partners should be recognized and rewarded for success -- both high performance
          and improved performance.

     <LI>    Recipients should be rewarded for achieving ambitious, rather than readily-attainable, performance targets.

     <LI>    Some portion of the funding should be based on actual performance:
        <UL>
          <LI>    Some portion of funding should be available to the Federal agency as an               incentive States and localities that make improvement.<BR>

               For example:  "The Secretary is authorized to reserve up to 10 percent of the funds 
               to be used for performance incentive awards for recipients making process toward
               meeting national goals."

         <LI>    "Up to" is important, since it will first be necessary to get a sensible              measurement system in place, before attempting to award performance             incentives.
         <LI>   Rewards should not be directed toward only "exceptional" performance, but             allow the Secretary to reward high or improved performance (i.e., "progress               toward achieving  national goals").
            </UL>

<LI>    High-performing States and localities should be rewarded with additional
          flexibility or reduced matching requirements.

<LI>    Similarly, disincentives should include reduced flexibility:
        <UL>
          <LI>     A requirement to shift funds into practices successfully used by high                 performing States and localities, or

          <LI>     Requirements for additional commitments of State or local resources, or
          <LI>     Reduction or termination of Federal funding.
          </UL>
<LI>    Partners should avoid punishing innovation and experimentation:
          <UL>
          <LI>   Keep in  mind:  no one is accountable for results now under the current system.
           </UL>
<LI>    Since there is shared accountability for results, Federal agencies should also
          respond to problems by providing technical assistance about promising practices:<BR>

          For example:  "The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to the States to     help them expand and improve ...."

   <LI>    States and localities should be held harmless for cases where outcomes are not
          achieved despite the use of best practices (given the current state of knowledge).
</UL>
 <B>    7.   Shift in the Locus of Decision-making</B>
<UL>
     <LI>    The partners should decide largely on the "What" and leave most of the "How" to
          States and localities.

      <LI>    Performance partnerships should seek to empower communities to make their
          own decisions about how to address their needs, and to be held accountable for
          results.

      <LI>    Front-line, local level providers should have greater flexibility and responsibility
          for service design, delivery, and results.

      <LI>    Partnerships should permit customers and beneficiaries to shape programs to
          better match their individual needs -- by giving them voice, choice, and the means
          to integrate services from multiple providers.

      <LI>   Recipient jurisdictions should have flexibility to set local benchmarks that are
          consistent with national program goals.
</UL>


<B>     8.   Administrative Simplification</B>
<UL>
 <LI>   Partners will seek to reduce barriers to success.
 <LI>    Partnerships should resemble "performance contracts" (i.e., contract for
          measurable results) rather than traditional cost-reimbursement, "level-of-effort"
          grants.

 <LI>    Performance partnerships should reduce Federal regulation of inputs, and avoid
          micro-management, and wasteful paperwork:
           <UL>
          <LI>    Rigid and costly program restrictions should be eliminated.
           </UL>
<LI>    Procedural, detailed application, financial management, auditing and expenditure
          reporting requirements should be eliminated or simplified to permit
          comprehensive service delivery:
          <UL>
           <LI>    The focus should be "Is the community achieving measurable results that 
              indicate  progress toward national goals?"  --  rather than "Were the dollars 
            spent on the identified problem?
            </UL>
<LI>    Federal agencies should, to the extent feasible, establish or negotiate performance
          targets, rather than specify the manner of compliance that States or localities must
          adopt.

<LI>    Reporting and monitoring should focus on performance (outcomes and outputs
          that indicated progress toward strategic goals) rather than inputs.

<LI>    Think in terms of reporting results to the public, rather than reports on process
          among levels of government.
</UL>
<B>     9.   Administrative Savings</B>
<UL>
<LI>    Administrative savings should be realized through consolidation and program and
          administrative simplification:
          <UL>
          <LI>    Consolidated planning requirements, for example, should enable more
              integrated services with less overhead.
            </UL>
</UL>
<B>     10.  Implementation</B>
<UL>

&quot;State and Local Exemption to Federal Advisory Committee Act&quot;.<BR>

<H4><B>The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995</B></H4>
<P>
<H4><B>P.L. 104-4, signed by the President March 22, 1995</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Title II, </B></H4>
<P>
<H4><B>Section 204.</B></H4>
<P>
<H4><B>STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT INPUT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>	(a) IN GENERAL.--Each agency shall, to the extent permitted in law, develop an effective process to permit elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf) to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant Federal intergovernmental mandates.<BR>

<P><B>	(b) MEETINGS BETWEEN STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL AND FEDERAL OFFICERS.--The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to actions in support of intergovernmental communications where--</B><BR>
<B>	(1) meetings are held exclusively between Federal officials and elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf) acting in their official capacities; and</B><BR>
<B>	(2) such meetings are solely for the purposes of exchanging views, information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs established pursuant to public law that explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or administration.</B><BR>

<P>	(c) IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES.--No later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall issue guidelines and instructions to Federal agencies for appropriate implementation of subsections (a) and (b) consistent with applicable laws and regulations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>&quot;JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF<B> CONFERENCE&quot;</B><BR>

<P>SEC. 204. STATE, LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT INPUT<BR>
		...<BR>
<I>	The conferees agree that an important part of efforts to improve the Federal regulatory process entails improved communications with State, local, and tribal governments.  Accordingly, this legislation will require Federal agencies to establish effective mechanisms for soliciting and integrating the input of such interests into the Federal decision-making process.  Where possible, these efforts should complement existing tools, such as negotiated rulemaking and/or the use of Federal advisory committees broadly representing all affected interests.</I><BR>

<P><I>	The conferees recognize that FACA has been the source of some confusion regarding the extent to which elected officials of State, local,  and tribal governments, or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf, may meet with Federal agency representatives to discuss regulatory and other issues involving areas of shared responsibility.  Section 204(b) clarifies Congressional intent with respect to these interactions by providing an exemption from FACA for the exchange of official views regarding the implementation of public laws requiring shared intergovernmental responsibilities or administration.</I><BR>

<P><I>	Section 204(c) requires the President to issue guidelines and instructions to Federal agencies, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, within six months of enactment.  The conferees would expect the President to consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA) before promulgating such guidelines.</I>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL01.1   Create flexibility and encourage innovation<BR>

<P> by designing a bottom-up solution to the problem of <BR>

<P> grant proliferation and its accompanying red tape.<BR>

<P> ******************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> HR 820, National Competitiveness Act of 1994, passed the Senate on <BR>

<P> March 16, 1994. Includes (as Title XI) the &quot;Local Empowerment and <BR>

<P> Flexibility Act of 1994&quot;  This legislation establishes a pilot <BR>

<P> program (maximum of 30 communities in maximum of 6 states) to empower <BR>

<P> and provide communities the flexibility to integrate programs and <BR>

<P> program funds across existing Federal assistance categories.  <BR>

<P> Included are programs for economic development, employment training, <BR>

<P> health, housing, nutrition, rural development, and other social <BR>

<P> services.  Localities must develop a local flexibility plan which <BR>

<P> includes, among other things, specific goals and measurable <BR>

<P> performance and a system for the comprehensive evaluation of the <BR>

<P> impact of the plan on the participants, the community and program <BR>

<P> costs.  It provides the Community Enterprise Board authority to waive <BR>

<P> any requirements applicable under Federal law or regulation necessary <BR>

<P> for the implementation of local flexibility plans.  Conferees have <BR>

<P> been named in both the House and the Senate.<BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P> P.L. 103-227, Goals 2000, establishes six flexibility demonstration <BR>

<P> projects under the &quot;Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration <BR>

<P> Act&quot;.  Under this demonstration, States can apply for designation as <BR>

<P> one of the six &quot;Ed-Flex Partnership States&quot; which would give them the <BR>

<P> authority to waive any statutory or regulatory requirement applicable <BR>

<P> to any program or Act as described in the law without seeking <BR>

<P> approval from the Department of Education.  States will be eligible <BR>

<P> for designation if they have prepared an improvement plan, have <BR>

<P> waived State statutory and regulatory requirements for the local <BR>

<P> authorities within the demonstration area, and have established <BR>

<P> performance measures for ensuring accountability to outcomes in the <BR>

<P> improvement plans.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Administration's community empowerment initiative is designed to <BR>

<P> solicit bottom-up proposals from communities on how to revitalize <BR>

<P> individual communities.  Applications for empowerment zone/enterprise <BR>

<P> community designation require community-wide comprehensive, strategic <BR>

<P> plans which look at economic and human development factors in a <BR>

<P> community.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Example of state-initiated bottom-up grant consolidation:  <BR>

<P> West Virginia and Indiana submitted Consolidated State Plans which <BR>

<P> included 199 Federal programs that serve children and families.  <BR>

<P> These State &quot;consolidations&quot;, as proposed, do not require legislative <BR>

<P> change or waivers.  They would be accomplished through administrative <BR>

<P> processes, such as cost allocation, but from the customer level would <BR>

<P> appear consolidated.  President Clinton endorsed these consolidated <BR>

<P> plans in January.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Various departmental initiatives are being developed and implemented <BR>

<P> in this area as well.  For example, the Department of Education's <BR>

<P> Improving America's Schools Act proposes to:<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>     o     permit Title I school wide programs to incorporate funding <BR>

<P> from other  programs, so that children attending high- poverty <BR>

<P> schools can benefit from a cohesive educational program rather than <BR>

<P> receiving separate, often disconnected, categorical services.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>     o     allow state and local educational agencies to submit <BR>

<P> consolidated plans, rather than a separate plan for each program, in <BR>

<P> order to present a single, comprehensive strategy for moving the <BR>

<P> state or community toward achievement of the National Education <BR>

<P> goals.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> On October 26, 1993, the President signed an executive order <BR>

<P> entitled, &quot;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&quot;.  In this <BR>

<P> executive order, the President called for increasing flexibility for <BR>

<P> State and Local waivers.  He stated that each agency shall review and <BR>

<P> streamline its waiver application process and &quot;to the extent <BR>

<P> practicable and permitted by law, consider any application by a <BR>

<P> State, local, or tribal government for a waiver of statutory or <BR>

<P> regulatory requirements in connection with any program administered <BR>

<P> by that agency with a general view toward increasing opportunities <BR>

<P> for utilizing flexible policy approaches at the State, local and <BR>

<P> tribal level in cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with <BR>

<P> the applicable Federal policy objectives and is otherwise <BR>

<P> appropriate&quot;.  To the fullest extent practicable, the President <BR>

<P> stated that decisions for waivers should be rendered within 120 days <BR>

<P> of the receipt of the waiver application.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL01.2   Support proposals for federal-state flexibility grants.<BR>

<P> ****************************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Several proposals, at various stages in the legislative process, have <BR>

<P> been developed by agencies.  For example: <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>   o  P.L. 103-227, Goals 2000: Educate America Act, establishes a <BR>

<P> national framework for education reform and contains measures for <BR>

<P> systemic educational reform using both top-down and bottoms-up <BR>

<P> strategies.  State and local educational agencies are encouraged to <BR>

<P> develop comprehensive improvement plans that will provide a coherent <BR>

<P> framework for the implementation of reauthorized Federal education <BR>

<P> and related programs in an integrated fashion.  States may receive an <BR>

<P> allotment of funds for systemic improvement efforts and must submit a <BR>

<P> State Improvement Plan after its first year of funding.  The <BR>

<P> Secretary has been given authority to waive Federal statutory and <BR>

<P> regulatory requirements to enhance flexibility in the implementation <BR>

<P> of systemic improvement plans.   <BR>

<P>    <BR>

<P>   o The Human Services Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103-252, signed by <BR>

<P> the President on May 18, 1994, created the Community-Based Family <BR>

<P> Resource Program by consolidating four HHS programs:  the Family <BR>

<P> Resource and Support Program; Emergency Child Protective Services <BR>

<P> Grants; the Child Abuse Community-Based Prevention Program;  and the <BR>

<P> Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).  The purpose of the <BR>

<P> new consolidated program is to assist each state to develop and <BR>

<P> implement, or expand and enhance, a comprehensive, statewide system <BR>

<P> of family resource services through collaboration with existing <BR>

<P> education, vocational rehabilitation, health, mental health, <BR>

<P> employment and training, child welfare, and other social services <BR>

<P> agencies within the state.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>    o Labor's Reemployment Act proposes to consolidate six benefit and <BR>

<P> training programs for dislocated workers who lose their jobs as a <BR>

<P> result of government policy decisions: Trade Adjustment Assistance, <BR>

<P> Clean Air Act, the North American Free Trade Agreement bridge <BR>

<P> program, and the defense conversion and defense diversification <BR>

<P> programs. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>   o  Education's Improving America's Schools Act, the reauthorization <BR>

<P> bill for elementary and secondary education programs, proposes to <BR>

<P> consolidate the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education programs <BR>

<P> and the Chapter 2 State Grants program into the Eisenhower <BR>

<P> Professional Development program; consolidate the Drug-Free Schools <BR>

<P> and Communities Act and the Safe Schools Act into a Safe and Drug-<BR>

<P> Free Schools program; and consolidate the current Immigrant Education <BR>

<P> program into the Bilingual Education authority which would create a <BR>

<P> targeted discretionary grant program for school districts heavily <BR>

<P> affected by immigration.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>   o  HUD proposes combining HOPE homeownership programs into one <BR>

<P> program under FHA; combining categorical McKinney Act homeless <BR>

<P> assistance programs; merging the housing certificate and voucher <BR>

<P> programs; and combining the HOPE VI and Urban Revitalization <BR>

<P> programs.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> NPR has requested agency input on candidates for consolidation for a <BR>

<P> possible mega-consolidation bill at some later date, and will work <BR>

<P> with state and local stakeholders to further develop ideas.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL01.3   Establish a cabinet-level enterprise board<BR>

<P> to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment.<BR>

<P> *****************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Community Enterprise Board was created by Presidential Memorandum <BR>

<P> September 8, 1993.  This board is chaired by the Vice President, with <BR>

<P> the President's Assistants for economic and domestic policy serving <BR>

<P> as vice chairs.  Heads from 15 Federal agencies serve as members.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ********************************************<BR>

<P> FSL02     REDUCE RED TAPE THROUGH REGULATORY <BR>

<P>           AND MANDATE RELIEF<BR>

<P> ********************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL02.1   Give cabinet secretaries and agency heads <BR>

<P> regulations and mandates.<BR>

<P> ***************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> See description of HR 820 and other actions under FSL01.1 above.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition to legislation, Federal agencies are doing what they can <BR>

<P> to provide greater flexibility to improve government services.  For <BR>

<P> example, at the Department of Defense, Secretary Perry sent a memo on <BR>

<P> waiver authority throughout DOD on March 28, 1994.  The memo stated: <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> &quot;The President and Vice President have charged us to radically change <BR>

<P> the way the government operates -- to shift from top-down bureaucracy <BR>

<P> to entrepreneurial government.  To further this goal, I hereby <BR>

<P> delegate to the Secretaries of the Military Departments and Directors <BR>

<P> of the Defense Agencies the authority to waive with the approval of <BR>

<P> the Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense any <BR>

<P> requirement contained in a DOD Directive of with the approval of the <BR>

<P> responsible OSD Staff Principal any requirement contained in a DOD <BR>

<P> Instruction of Publications, for activities being streamlined or <BR>

<P> reengineered in support of the National Performance Review.  I expect <BR>

<P> appropriate waiver proposals to be approved whenever possible.  The <BR>

<P> Service Secretaries and Defense Agency Directors may not supplement <BR>

<P> the DOD requirements so waived and are encouraged to waive other <BR>

<P> requirements within their authority as appropriate....A Staff <BR>

<P> Principal's denial of a request will be subject to review by the <BR>

<P> Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense.....&quot;.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL02.2   Issue a regulatory executive order addressing<BR>

<P> the problems of unfunded federal mandates and regulatory relief.<BR>

<P> ****************************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> 30, 1993.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership, <BR>

<P> signed October 26, 1993. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Additionally, OMB has begun quarterly meetings with intergovernmental <BR>

<P> partners on how to work together on regulations affecting State, <BR>

<P> local and tribal governments.  The first two meetings, held on <BR>

<P> December 1, 1993 and March 23, 1994, were chaired by Sally Katzen, <BR>

<P> Director of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  <BR>

<P> Issues discussed included Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), <BR>

<P> waiver processes, and guidelines on unfunded mandates.<BR>

<P> intergovernmental service delivery.<BR>

<P> ******************************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The President has appointed former Governor Bill Winters as ACIR <BR>

<P> chairman and 19 new commissioners.  This action by the President has <BR>

<P> brought the ACIR to its full capacity as a 26 member Commission.  The <BR>

<P> President attended the first meeting with Bill Winters as chair on <BR>

<P> December 1, 1993.  In addition, ACIR has selected a new Executive <BR>

<P> Director and has developed a work plan which includes as action items <BR>

<P> the NPR recommendations directed to ACIR.   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL06.2   Develop appropriate benchmarks and performance measures to <BR>

<P> improve the understanding of public service delivery effectiveness. <BR>

<P> The President should direct the Cabinet- level Enterprise Board <BR>

<P> and/or request ACIR to provide leadership in developing a systematic <BR>

<P> process to define and measure national benchmarks.<BR>

<P> *********************************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Community Enterprise Board has addressed the issue of benchmarks <BR>

<P> and established benchmarking as a priority in the Empowerment Zones <BR>

<P> and Enterprise Communities initiative.  The application, released <BR>

<P> earlier this year, states, &quot;A vision for change is not a laundry list <BR>

<P> of concerns, shortcomings, and deficits.  Instead, it is a strategic <BR>

<P> map for revitalization........ A strategic plan also sets real goals <BR>

<P> and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establishes a <BR>

<P> framework for assessing how new experience and knowledge can be <BR>

<P> incorporated on an ongoing basis into a successful plan for <BR>

<P> revitalization.&quot;<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ACIR is planning to organize five task forces to address five <BR>

<P> intergovernmental issues as part of a nationwide, consensus-building <BR>

<P> initiative to strengthen the intergovernmental system.  One of the <BR>

<P> task forces will focus on &quot;Benchmarking Intergovernmental Service <BR>

<P> Provision&quot;.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Goals 2000: Educate America Act (P.L. 103-227, Title III, State <BR>

<P> and Local Education Systemic Improvement) calls for the establishment <BR>

<P> of benchmarks in State improvement plans to specify measurable goals <BR>

<P> for improved student performance and for progress in implementation <BR>

<P> of the State improvement plan as well as timelines for charting <BR>

<P> progress in carrying out the plans.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> NPR and the Alliance for Redesigning Government are encouraging State <BR>

<P> benchmarking efforts such as those of Oregon, Utah, and Minnesota.  <BR>

<P> OMB has designated one Government Performance and Results Act <BR>

<P> intergovernmental pilot in the area of child support enforcement.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> FSL06.3   Convene meetings which draw together leaders from federal, <BR>

<P> state and local government to review, refine, and advance <BR>

<P> intergovernmental recommendations of the NPR.<BR>

<P> ********************************************************************<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The President and the Vice President met with both the Governors and <BR>

<P> Mayors during those groups' mid-winter 1994 conferences.  The <BR>

<P> President also attended the first ACIR meeting under the newly- <BR>

<P> appointed chair.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> OMB has been actively consulting with state and local stakeholders <BR>

<P> regarding the regulatory review process.  See description under <BR>

<P> FSL02.2.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Federal <BR>

<P> agencies have continuous efforts underway to further strengthen <BR>

<P> intergovernmental partnerships.  For example, EPA has developed an <BR>

<P> intergovernmental steering committee to guide efforts towards an <BR>

<P> Agency/State environmental partnership.  Through this committee, the <BR>

<P> EPA has established principles for a more flexible grant process and <BR>

<P> are in the process of establishing the necessary legislative <BR>

<P> strategy.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Outreach to state and local officials has been a central component of <BR>

<P> the Administrations' welfare reform policy development process.  The <BR>

<P> White House Working Group on Welfare Reform, Family Support and <BR>

<P> Independence, established by the President in May, 1993, has sought <BR>

<P> and received considerable input from state and local leaders in <BR>

<P> welfare reform.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> ACIR has proposed a major nationwide initiative of research, <BR>

<P> consultation, and consensus-building among federal, state and local <BR>

<P> officials and private citizens, culminating in a &quot;federal-state-local <BR>

<P> leadership roundtable&quot; in the Fall of 1995 to seek common ground <BR>

<P> towards fundamental intergovernmental reform.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> NPR is encouraging other intergovernmental activities such as the San <BR>

<P> Antonio Federal Executive Board reinvention lab initiative to remove <BR>

<P> red tape and improve internal operations so that intergovernmental <BR>

<P> partners can work together to create flexibility and solve problems <BR>

<P> in the community.  In addition, the Department of Energy's (DOE) <BR>

<P> Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy reinvention lab on <BR>

<P> &quot;Reinventing Federal, State, and local partnerships&quot; is working <BR>

<P> toward better partnerships by involving stakeholders earlier and more <BR>

<P> completely in the strategic, multi-year annual operating and budget <BR>

<P> planning, by providing more flexibility in the implementation of <BR>

<P> state and local provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and by <BR>

<P> building more public/private collaborations to create and pilot <BR>

<P> innovations. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> NPR is also partnering with the Alliance for Redesigning Government, <BR>

<P> the Institute for Educational Leadership, the National Rural <BR>

<P> Development Partnership, Interchange '94, the Federal Quality <BR>

<P> Institute, the Indiana and West Virginia consolidate state plans for <BR>

<P> children and family services, Partnership Minnesota, Oregon <BR>

<P> Benchmarks, the Atlanta Project, and others to convene additional <BR>

<P> intergovernmental and interagency forums focused on improving public <BR>

<P> services to families and communities throughout the country. <BR>

<P>FSLO1   IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC GRANT PROGRAMS <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <BR>

<P>FSL01.1   Create flexibility and encourage innovation by designing <BR>

<P>a bottom-up solution to the problem of grant proliferation and its <BR>

<P>accompanying red tape. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>HR 820, National Competitiveness Act of 1994, passed the Senate on <BR>

<P>March 16, 1994. Includes (as Title XI) the &quot;Local Empowerment and <BR>

<P>Flexibility Act of 1994&quot;  This legislation establishes a pilot <BR>

<P>program (maximum of 30 communities in maximum of 6 states) to <BR>

<P>empower and provide communities the flexibility to integrate <BR>

<P>programs and program funds across existing Federal assistance <BR>

<P>categories.  Included are programs for economic development, <BR>

<P>employment training, health, housing, nutrition, rural <BR>

<P>development, and other social services.  Localities must develop a <BR>

<P>local flexibility plan which includes, among other things, <BR>

<P>specific goals and measurable performance and a system for the <BR>

<P>comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the plan on the <BR>

<P>participants, the community and program costs.  As passed in the <BR>

<P>Senate, the amendment provides the Community Enterprise Board <BR>

<P>authority to waive any requirements applicable under Federal law <BR>

<P>or regulation necessary for the implementation of local <BR>

<P>flexibility plans.  The bill is currently in conference. <BR>

<P>  <BR>

<P>P.L. 103-227, Goals 2000, establishes six flexibility <BR>

<P>demonstration projects under the &quot;Education Flexibility <BR>

<P>Partnership Demonstration Act&quot;.  Under this demonstration, States <BR>

<P>can apply for designation as one of the six &quot;Ed-Flex Partnership <BR>

<P>States&quot; which would give them the authority to waive any statutory <BR>

<P>or regulatory requirement applicable to any program or Act as <BR>

<P>described in the law without seeking approval from the Department <BR>

<P>of Education.  States will be eligible for designation if they <BR>

<P>have prepared an improvement plan, have waived State statutory and <BR>

<P>regulatory requirements for the local authorities within the <BR>

<P>demonstration area, and have established performance measures for <BR>

<P>ensuring accountability to outcomes in the improvement plans. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The Administration's community empowerment initiative is designed <BR>

<P>to solicit bottom-up proposals from communities on how to <BR>

<P>revitalize individual communities.  Applications for empowerment <BR>

<P>zone/enterprise community designation require community-wide <BR>

<P>comprehensive, strategic plans which look at economic and human <BR>

<P>development factors in a community. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Example of state-initiated bottom-up grant consolidation:  West <BR>

<P>Virginia and Indiana submitted Consolidated State Plans which <BR>

<P>included 199 Federal programs that serve children and families.  <BR>

<P>These State &quot;consolidations&quot;, as proposed, do not require <BR>

<P>legislative change or waivers.  They would be accomplished through <BR>

<P>administrative processes, such as cost allocation, but from the <BR>

<P>customer level would appear consolidated.  President Clinton <BR>

<P>endorsed these consolidated plans in January. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Various departmental initiatives are being developed and <BR>

<P>implemented in this area as well.  For example, the Department of <BR>

<P>Education's Improving America's Schools Act proposes to: <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   permit Title I school wide programs to incorporate funding <BR>

<P>from other  programs, so that children attending high-poverty <BR>

<P>schools can benefit from a cohesive educational program rather <BR>

<P>than receiving separate, often disconnected, categorical services. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   allow state and local educational agencies to submit <BR>

<P>consolidated plans, rather than a separate plan for each program, <BR>

<P>in order to present a single, comprehensive strategy for moving <BR>

<P>the state or community toward achievement of the National <BR>

<P>Education goals. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>On October 26, 1993, the President signed an executive order <BR>

<P>entitled, &quot;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&quot;.  In this <BR>

<P>executive order, the President called for increasing flexibility <BR>

<P>for State and Local waivers.  He stated that each agency shall <BR>

<P>review and streamline its waiver application process and &quot;to the <BR>

<P>extent practicable and permitted by law, consider any application <BR>

<P>by a State, local, or tribal government for a waiver of statutory <BR>

<P>or regulatory requirements in connection with any program <BR>

<P>administered by that agency with a general view toward increasing <BR>

<P>opportunities for utilizing flexible policy approaches at the <BR>

<P>State, local and tribal level in cases in which the proposed <BR>

<P>waiver is consistent with the applicable Federal policy objectives <BR>

<P>and is otherwise appropriate&quot;.  To the fullest extent practicable, <BR>

<P>the President stated that decisions for waivers should be rendered <BR>

<P>within 120 days of the receipt of the waiver application. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>FSL01.2   Support proposals for federal-state flexibility grants. <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <BR>

<P>Several proposals, at various stages in the legislative process, <BR>

<P>have been developed by agencies.  For example:  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   P.L. 103-227, Goals 2000: Educate America Act, establishes a <BR>

<P>national framework for education reform and contains measures for <BR>

<P>systemic educational reform using both top-down and bottoms-up <BR>

<P>strategies.  State and local educational agencies are encouraged <BR>

<P>to develop comprehensive improvement plans that will provide a <BR>

<P>coherent framework for the implementation of reauthorized Federal <BR>

<P>education and related programs in an integrated fashion.  States <BR>

<P>may receive an allotment of funds for systemic improvement efforts <BR>

<P>and must submit a State Improvement Plan after its first year of <BR>

<P>funding.  The Secretary has been given authority to waive Federal <BR>

<P>statutory and regulatory requirements to enhance flexibility in <BR>

<P>the implementation of systemic improvement plans.    <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>o   The Human Services Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103-252, signed by <BR>

<P>the President on May 18, 1994, created the Community-Based Family <BR>

<P>Resource Program by consolidating four HHS programs:  the Family <BR>

<P>Resource and Support Program; Emergency Child Protective Services <BR>

<P>Grants; the Child Abuse Community-Based Prevention Program;  and <BR>

<P>the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).  The purpose <BR>

<P>of the new consolidated program is to assist each state to develop <BR>

<P>and implement, or expand and enhance, a comprehensive, statewide <BR>

<P>system of family resource services through collaboration with <BR>

<P>existing education, vocational rehabilitation, health, mental <BR>

<P>health, employment and training, child welfare, and other social <BR>

<P>services agencies within the state. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   Labor's Reemployment Act proposes to consolidate six benefit <BR>

<P>and training programs for dislocated workers who lose their jobs <BR>

<P>as a result of government policy decisions: Trade Adjustment <BR>

<P>Assistance, Clean Air Act, the North American Free Trade Agreement <BR>

<P>bridge program, and the defense conversion and defense <BR>

<P>diversification programs.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   Education's Improving America's Schools Act, the <BR>

<P>reauthorization bill for elementary and secondary education <BR>

<P>programs, proposes to consolidate the Eisenhower Mathematics and <BR>

<P>Science Education programs and the Chapter 2 State Grants program <BR>

<P>into the Eisenhower Professional Development program; consolidate <BR>

<P>the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and the Safe Schools Act <BR>

<P>into a Safe and Drug-Free Schools program; and consolidate the <BR>

<P>current Immigrant Education program into the Bilingual Education <BR>

<P>authority which would create a targeted discretionary grant <BR>

<P>program for school districts heavily affected by immigration. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>o   HUD proposes combining HOPE homeownership programs into one <BR>

<P>program under FHA; combining categorical McKinney Act homeless <BR>

<P>assistance programs; merging the housing certificate and voucher <BR>

<P>programs; and combining the HOPE VI and Urban Revitalization <BR>

<P>programs. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>NPR has requested agency input on candidates for consolidation for <BR>

<P>a possible mega-consolidation bill at some later date, and will <BR>

<P>work with state and local stakeholders to further develop ideas. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FSL01.3   Establish a cabinet-level enterprise board to oversee <BR>

<P>new initiatives in community empowerment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Community Enterprise Board was created by Presidential <BR>

<P>Memorandum September 8, 1993.  This board is chaired by the Vice <BR>

<P>President, with the President's Assistants for economic and <BR>

<P>domestic policy serving as vice chairs.  Heads from 15 Federal <BR>

<P>agencies serve as members. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> <BR>

<P>FSL02   REDUCE RED TAPE THROUGH REGULATORY AND MANDATE RELIEF <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <BR>

<P>FSL02.1   Give cabinet secretaries and agency heads the <BR>

<P>flexibility to authorize selective relief from regulations and <BR>

<P>mandates. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>See description of HR 820 and other actions under FSL01.1 above. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>In addition to legislation, Federal agencies are doing what they <BR>

<P>can to provide greater flexibility to improve government services.  <BR>

<P>For example, at the Department of Defense, Secretary Perry sent a <BR>

<P>memo on waiver authority throughout DOD on March 28, 1994.  The <BR>

<P>memo stated:  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>&quot;The President and Vice President have charged us to radically <BR>

<P>change the way the government operates -- to shift from top-down <BR>

<P>bureaucracy to entrepreneurial government.  To further this goal, <BR>

<P>I hereby delegate to the Secretaries of the Military Departments <BR>

<P>and Directors of the Defense Agencies the authority to waive with <BR>

<P>the approval of the Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of <BR>

<P>Defense any requirement contained in a DOD Directive of with the <BR>

<P>approval of the responsible OSD Staff Principal any requirement <BR>

<P>contained in a DOD Instruction of Publications, for activities <BR>

<P>being streamlined or reengineered in support of the National <BR>

<P>Performance Review.  I expect appropriate waiver proposals to be <BR>

<P>approved whenever possible.  The Service Secretaries and Defense <BR>

<P>Agency Directors may not supplement the DOD requirements so waived <BR>

<P>and are encouraged to waive other requirements within their <BR>

<P>authority as appropriate....A Staff Principal's denial of a <BR>

<P>request will be subject to review by the Secretary of Defense or <BR>

<P>Deputy Secretary of Defense.....&quot;. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL02.2   Issue a regulatory executive order addressing the <BR>

<P>problems of unfunded federal mandates and regulatory relief. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning Review, signed <BR>

<P>September 30, 1993. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental <BR>

<P>Partnership, signed October 26, 1993.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Additionally, OMB has begun quarterly meetings with <BR>

<P>intergovernmental partners on how to work together on regulations <BR>

<P>affecting State, local and tribal governments.  The first two <BR>

<P>meetings, held on December 1, 1993 and March 23, 1994, were <BR>

<P>chaired by Sally Katzen, Director of OMB's Office of Information <BR>

<P>and Regulatory Affairs.  Issues discussed included Federal <BR>

<P>Advisory Committee Act (FACA), waiver processes, and guidelines on <BR>

<P>unfunded mandates. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> <BR>

<P>FSL03   SIMPLIFY REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FSL03.1   Modify OMB circular A-87, &quot;Cost Principles for State and <BR>

<P>Local Governments&quot;, to provide a fee-for-service option in lieu of <BR>

<P>cost reimbursement (covering administrative costs of grants). <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>OMB is planning consultation with states and localities to develop <BR>

<P>details of fee-for-service option.  Woody Jackson at OMB is taking <BR>

<P>the lead. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL04   ELIMINATE NEEDLESS PAPERWORK BY SIMPLIFYING COMPLIANCE <BR>

<P>CERTIFICATION PROCESS <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL04.1   Simplify grant compliance certifications by modifying <BR>

<P>OMB's requirements. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>NPR and OMB exploring the best way to implement this <BR>

<P>recommendation, that must be fleshed out in consultation with <BR>

<P>stakeholders. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> <BR>

<P>FSL05   SIMPLIFY ADMINISTRATION BY MODIFYING THE COMMON GRANT <BR>

<P>RULES ON SMALL PURCHASES <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL05.1   Modify OMB circular A-102, &quot;Grants and Cooperative <BR>

<P>Agreements to State and Local Governments&quot;, to require that the <BR>

<P>common grants management rules increase the dollar threshold for <BR>

<P>small purchases by local governments from $25,000 to $100,000. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>OMB has developed a proposed amendment to the common rule.  The <BR>

<P>change has now been cleared by 8 of the 25 agencies prior to <BR>

<P>publication in the Federal Register.   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>

<P>FSL06   STRENGTHEN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PARTNERSHIP <BR>

<P>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL06.1   Reinvent the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental <BR>

<P>Relations (ACIR) and charge it with responsibility for continuous <BR>

<P>improvement in federal, state, and local partnership and <BR>

<P>intergovernmental service delivery. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The President has appointed former Governor Bill Winters as ACIR <BR>

<P>chairman and 19 new commissioners.  This action by the President <BR>

<P>has brought the ACIR to its full capacity as a 26 member <BR>

<P>Commission.  The President attended the first meeting with Bill <BR>

<P>Winters as chair on December 1, 1993.  In addition, ACIR has <BR>

<P>selected a new Executive Director and has developed a work plan <BR>

<P>which includes as action items the NPR recommendations directed to <BR>

<P>ACIR.    <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL06.2   Develop appropriate benchmarks and performance measures <BR>

<P>to improve the understanding of public service delivery <BR>

<P>effectiveness. The President should direct the Cabinet-level <BR>

<P>Enterprise Board and/or request ACIR to provide leadership in <BR>

<P>developing a systematic process to define and measure national <BR>

<P>benchmarks. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The Community Enterprise Board has addressed the issue of <BR>

<P>benchmarks and established benchmarking as a priority in the <BR>

<P>Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities initiative.  The <BR>

<P>application, released earlier this year, states, &quot;A vision for <BR>

<P>change is not a laundry list of concerns, shortcomings, and <BR>

<P>deficits.  Instead, it is a strategic map for <BR>

<P>revitalization........ A strategic plan also sets real goals and <BR>

<P>performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establishes a <BR>

<P>framework for assessing how new experience and knowledge can be <BR>

<P>incorporated on an ongoing basis into a successful plan for <BR>

<P>revitalization.&quot; <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>ACIR is planning to organize five task forces to address five <BR>

<P>intergovernmental issues as part of a nationwide, consensus-<BR>

<P>building initiative to strengthen the intergovernmental system.  <BR>

<P>One of the task forces will focus on &quot;Benchmarking <BR>

<P>Intergovernmental Service Provision&quot;. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The Goals 2000: Educate America Act (P.L. 103-227, Title III, <BR>

<P>State and Local Education Systemic Improvement) calls for the <BR>

<P>establishment of benchmarks in State improvement plans to specify <BR>

<P>measurable goals for improved student performance and for progress <BR>

<P>in implementation of the State improvement plan as well as <BR>

<P>timelines for charting progress in carrying out the plans. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>NPR and the Alliance for Redesigning Government are encouraging <BR>

<P>State benchmarking efforts such as those of Oregon, Utah, and <BR>

<P>Minnesota.  OMB has designated one Government Performance and <BR>

<P>Results Act intergovernmental pilot in the area of child support <BR>

<P>enforcement. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>FSL06.3   Convene meetings which draw together leaders from <BR>

<P>federal, state and local government to review, refine, and advance <BR>

<P>intergovernmental recommendations of the NPR. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The President and the Vice President met with both the Governors <BR>

<P>and Mayors during those groups' mid-winter 1994 conferences.  The <BR>

<P>President also attended the first ACIR meeting under the newly-<BR>

<P>appointed chair. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>OMB has been actively consulting with state and local stakeholders <BR>

<P>regarding the regulatory review process.  See description under <BR>

<P>FSL02.2. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the <BR>

<P>Federal agencies have continuous efforts underway to further <BR>

<P>strengthen intergovernmental partnerships.  For example, EPA has <BR>

<P>developed an intergovernmental steering committee to guide efforts <BR>

<P>towards an Agency/State environmental partnership.  Through this <BR>

<P>committee, the EPA has established principles for a more flexible <BR>

<P>grant process and are in the process of establishing the necessary <BR>

<P>legislative strategy. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>Outreach to state and local officials has been a central component <BR>

<P>of the Administrations' welfare reform policy development process.  <BR>

<P>The White House Working Group on Welfare Reform, Family Support <BR>

<P>and Independence, established by the President in May, 1993, has <BR>

<P>sought and received considerable input from state and local <BR>

<P>leaders in welfare reform.   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>ACIR has proposed a major nationwide initiative of research, <BR>

<P>consultation, and consensus-building among federal, state and <BR>

<P>local officials and private citizens, culminating in a &quot;federal-<BR>

<P>state-local leadership roundtable&quot; in the Fall of 1995 to seek <BR>

<P>common ground towards fundamental intergovernmental reform. <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>NPR is encouraging other intergovernmental activities such as the <BR>

<P>San Antonio Federal Executive Board reinvention lab initiative to <BR>

<P>remove red tape and improve internal operations so that <BR>

<P>intergovernmental partners can work together to create flexibility <BR>

<P>and solve problems in the community.  In addition, the Department <BR>

<P>of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy <BR>

<P>reinvention lab on &quot;Reinventing Federal, State, and local <BR>

<P>partnerships&quot; is working toward better partnerships by involving <BR>

<P>stakeholders earlier and more completely in the strategic, multi-<BR>

<P>year annual operating and budget planning, by providing more <BR>

<P>flexibility in the implementation of state and local provisions of <BR>

<P>the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and by building more public/private <BR>

<P>collaborations to create and pilot innovations.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>NPR is also partnering with the Alliance for Redesigning <BR>

<P>Government, the Institute for Educational Leadership, the National <BR>

<P>Rural Development Partnership, Interchange '94, the Federal <BR>

<P>Quality Institute, the Indiana and West Virginia consolidate state <BR>

<P>plans for children and family services, Partnership Minnesota, <BR>

<P>Oregon Benchmarks, the Atlanta Project, and others to convene <BR>

<P>additional intergovernmental and interagency forums focused on <BR>

<P>improving public services to families and communities throughout <BR>

<P>the country. <BR>

<H2>Progress to Date</H2>

To improve dramatically the delivery of federal domestic grants, the Administration has encouraged agencies to use
their existing waiver authority and seek new waiver authority to allow bottom-up innovation in the intergovernmental
service delivery system. From January 1993 through June 1996, President Clinton approved more than 67 welfare
demonstration projects in more than 40 states. He has also approved 13 comprehensive Medicaid reform demonstrations
permitting states to increase greatly their use of managed care, to subsidize health insurance for employed but
uninsured workers, and to expand Medicaid eligibility by increasing income limits. The President has also granted 19
states Medicaid waivers as part of larger welfare reform demonstrations. <P>

Congress has granted agencies additional waiver authorities. The Secretary of Education was authorized to waive
statutory requirements in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Public Law 103-227), the School to Work Opportunities
Act (Public Law 103-239), and the Improving America's Schools Act (Public Law 103-382) to clear the way for better
teaching and learning. He has approved more than 100 waivers under these authorities. The Department of Education
also may devolve its waiver authority to 12 states under the Ed-Flex program which provides flexibility to state
education agencies. In exchange for agreeing to greater accountability for results (e.g., academic performance of
their students), Ed-Flex states are given the authority to waive federal statutes for themselves and their school
districts, rather than submit waiver requests to the Secretary of Education. Eight Ed-Flex states have been
designated so far. Similarly, the Secretary of Labor has new authority to waive certain regulations of the Job
Training Partnership Act to help states and communities achieve workforce goals. And pending before Congress is a
bill, the Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act (S. 88, H.R. 2086), that would give broader waiver authority to most
federal agency heads to provide flexibility to states and communities in achieving results.<P>

To restrict unfunded mandates by federal agencies, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12875 in 1993.
Congress later passed the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) to limit its ability to impose new
mandates on state and local governments without providing funds. It also requires greater intergovernmental
consultations in the administrative rulemaking process, and allowance for the least costly and most effective means
of complying with federal regulations. <P>

In April 1995, OMB revised Circular A-87 to encourage federal agencies to test fee-for-service procedures for cost
reimbursement to states and localities. A fee-for-service alternative would be simpler than the existing cost
allocation rules and would encourage cost containment. In addition, OMB revised the common rules for small purchases
by local governments by increasing the dollar threshold from &#036;25,000 to &#036;100,000.<P>

The Administration has undertaken a series of initiatives to strengthen the intergovernmental partnership. First,
it created the Community Empowerment Board, chaired by the Vice President, to oversee a process whereby member
agencies may grant waivers. Eleven empowerment zones and 94 empowerment communities were designated in December 1994.
Each of these entities is provided with additional flexibility, funding, and tax incentives to implement their
community-developed, comprehensive, strategic plans. <P>

Second, the Administration is reforming the federal grant process into a system of performance partnerships to be
more responsive to locally perceived needs and bottom-up planning strategies. In his FYs 1996 and 1997 budgets,
President Clinton proposed performance partnerships that would consolidate over 200 existing programs in the areas of
public health, rural development, education and training, housing and urban development, transportation, and the
environment. This initiative exemplifies the replacement of a program-oriented mentality with a comprehensive
approach to problem solving; it signals a shift away from the present emphasis on how to manage federal grant programs
toward an emphasis on getting results. To date, Congress has authorized two of these six partnerships.<P>

The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) creates three rural development
performance partnerships in which a large number of rural utility, economic development, and housing programs will be
administered together in a flexible manner and focused on results. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)
performance partnerships legislation (Public Law 104-134) passed in early 1996; by May, Colorado and Utah had signed
performance partnership grants with the agency. They can now decide how many of their environmental grants (air,
water, hazardous waste, toxic substances, etc.) they want to combine into one "multimedia" (air, water, solid waste)
partnership grant to achieve better environmental results. <P>

Other federal agencies are forging ahead without waiting for the passage of legislation still pending before
Congress. The Department of Health and Human Services, for example, convened meetings with over 1,000 stakeholders
around the country to develop a list of desired results in each of the performance partnership grant areas (substance
abuse, mental health, immunization, chronic diseases, etc.).<P>

Separately, NPR has facilitated a series of administratively designated partnerships with states and localities.
The Oregon Option a 1994 partnership with the state of Oregon focuses on bringing together community, local, state,
and federal agencies to agree on desired results, how to accomplish them, how to measure them, and how to break down
barriers to achieving them. NPR also facilitates the Connecticut Neighborhood Revitalization Partnership, which is
based on that state's innovative law requiring the state and its municipalities to break down barriers in response to
neighborhoods' comprehensive plans and measurable goals to revitalize their economies and neighborhoods. In February
1996, Vice President Gore and other federal officials joined the governor and other state officials in signing an
agreement to eliminate federal, state, and local barriers to develop and revitalize Connecticut's poorest
communities. <P>

Finally, four areas -- metro Atlanta, metro Denver, the District of Columbia, and the state of Nebraska -- have joined
with the federal government to reduce crime and violence in a project called Pulling America's Communities Together
(PACT). Through Project PACT, the federal government is vigorously fostering and supporting the development of
broad-based, fully coordinated local and statewide initiatives that work strategically to secure community safety.
Additionally, EPA, through its brownfields initiative, is providing new flexibility to states and communities to
return contaminated urban lands to productive use.<P>

<P>

<P>                        THE OREGON OPTION<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> On Monday, July 25, 1994, Governor Barbara Roberts of Oregon,<BR>

<P> Multnomah County Commission Chairman Beverly Stein, and Portland<BR>

<P> Mayor Vera Katz, briefed senior level officials from the White<BR>

<P> House and Executive branch agencies.  The briefing was a proposal<BR>

<P> to partner with the Federal government in a demonstration project<BR>

<P> to redesign intergovernmental service delivery based on<BR>

<P> principles advanced in the National Performance Review.  Oregon<BR>

<P> is going into its fifth year of a legislatively approved, long<BR>

<P> range effort to set standards for measuring statewide progress<BR>

<P> and governmental performance.  The program is called &quot;Oregon<BR>

<P> Benchmarks.&quot;<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> During the briefing, the state and local officials cited problems<BR>

<P> they have encountered with Federal agencies and programs and also<BR>

<P> cited some success stories which have occurred.  Many of the<BR>

<P> difficulties cited by these officials related to programs and<BR>

<P> operations of various Federal agencies, while some difficulties<BR>

<P> related to the work of Offices of Inspector General in auditing<BR>

<P> programs operated with Federal funds.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Because some of what was presented relates to Offices of<BR>

<P> Inspector General in several Federal agencies, this material was<BR>

<P> put together as a way for these Inspectors General to see what<BR>

<P> Oregon has presented and perhaps work within and across agencies,<BR>

<P> consistent with the Inspector General Vision Statement, to<BR>

<P> address some of the problems cited, in a constructive way.  <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Additionally, since the Oregon officials formally presented their<BR>

<P> proposal for partnership, when it is considered at the agency<BR>

<P> levels, this material will put Inspectors General in a position<BR>

<P> of being informed on the issues in advance.  The excerpt which is<BR>

<P> presented below is a small part of the complete proposal.  The<BR>

<P> full proposal can be obtained form the address below.  It cites<BR>

<P> 18 federal programs and 12 Federal agencies (not by name) as<BR>

<P> impacting work going on under the &quot;Oregon Benchmarks&quot; project. <BR>

<P> From the meeting, the following Federal departments and agencies<BR>

<P> seemed to be among the group of 12:  HHS, HUD, USDA, Labor,<BR>

<P> Education, EPA, Veterans Affairs, Interior, Treasury, Justice,<BR>

<P> and Commerce.  <BR>

<P>                      1. PROPOSAL SUMMARY<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                           July 25, 1994<BR>

<P> The Proposition<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Oregon and its local governments propose a special partnership<BR>

<P> and long-range demonstration project with the federal government<BR>

<P> to redesign intergovernmental service delivery based on<BR>

<P> principles advanced in the National Performance Review.  This<BR>

<P> intergovernmental, interagency initiative would focus on outcomes<BR>

<P> and treat outcomes as the principal measure of success. In the<BR>

<P> model we propose the federal government and our governments will<BR>

<P> mutually identify results to be achieved and we will be<BR>

<P> contracted to achieve them.  To help us achieve these results,<BR>

<P> the federal government will merge funding categories and streams,<BR>

<P> create funding incentives which reward desirable results, and<BR>

<P> reduce micromanagement and wasteful paperwork.  This<BR>

<P> collaboration will empower our communities to identify local<BR>

<P> needs to be met by federal and state programs, to make their own<BR>

<P> decisions about how to address those needs, and to be accountable<BR>

<P> for results.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      ***  This initiative would focus on outcomes and treat<BR>

<P>           outcomes as the principal measure of success. ***<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We recommend that this demonstration project, &quot;The Oregon Option&quot;<BR>

<P> focus on important elements of Oregon's top strategic priority,<BR>

<P> our human investment benchmarks. These benchmarks underlie a<BR>

<P> collective effort by state and local governments, civic groups,<BR>

<P> nonprofits, and businesses to appreciably improve the lives of<BR>

<P> Oregonians as self-reliant individuals, members of healthy<BR>

<P> families, and skilled, successful workers. They fit our     <BR>

<P> strategy to enhance Oregon's economic prospects while getting<BR>

<P> more people off public assistance and reducing the human and<BR>

<P> financial costs of social dysfunction.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Problem To Be Overcome<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> This proposal accepts the premise of the National<BR>

<P> Performance Review: that the intergovernmental system for<BR>

<P> delivering assistance and services through federal grants and<BR>

<P> mandates to state and local governments has broken down in a<BR>

<P> tangle of good intentions gone awry. There are too many    <BR>

<P> funding categories, suffocating regulations and paperwork,<BR>

<P> a misdirected emphasis on remediating rather than preventing<BR>

<P> problems, and no clear focus on measurable outcomes. The system<BR>

<P> stifles initiative and squanders resources without achieving<BR>

<P> sufficient results. We have been attempting to correct similar<BR>

<P> problems in state government.  We are delegating greater     <BR>

<P> responsibility for program design, delivery, and results to<BR>

<P> the local level, <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                    THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 1<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> and we are encouraging more service integration and<BR>

<P> a preventive approach to problems.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Why Seize This Opportunity With Oregon?<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Oregon is an ideal partner for this initiative.  The test of an<BR>

<P> outcomes-based approach to intergovernmental services is likely<BR>

<P> to be more successful where state and local government are<BR>

<P> already using an outcomes model for establishing a long-range<BR>

<P> vision, setting public priorities, allocating resources,<BR>

<P> designing services, and measuring results.  We are well along in <BR>

<P> pioneering state and local effort -- Oregon Benchmarks -- to do<BR>

<P> all of these things.  Benchmarks cover issues as wide ranging as<BR>

<P> ecosystem protection, urban mobility, and industrial<BR>

<P> diversification.  Our human investment benchmarks focus on such<BR>

<P> outcomes as reduced teen pregnancy, diminished crime and<BR>

<P> recidivism, lower unemployment, higher per capita income,   <BR>

<P> greater early childhood immunization, and stronger K-12 student  <BR>

<P> achievement, just to name a few.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      ***  Oregon is ideal for this initiative.  Our systems are<BR>

<P>           in place.  We are ready to move.  We know how to be a<BR>

<P>           good partner.  ***<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We have already achieved notable success in the benchmarks<BR>

<P> process, and we will continue to pursue the progress made these<BR>

<P> past few years.  However, these efforts would receive an immense<BR>

<P> boost if federal participation was also focused and structured to<BR>

<P> achieve results.  Oregon offers an opportunity for the federal<BR>

<P> government to join the state and its communities in designing and<BR>

<P> demonstrating a more efficient, results-driven model of service<BR>

<P> delivery.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We are ready to move.  Through our 20-year strategic<BR>

<P> plan and through Oregon Benchmarks we know what we want to<BR>

<P> accomplish. We have established systems to pursue and measure<BR>

<P> those accomplishments at state and local levels, and we have<BR>

<P> enlisted the involvement of local jurisdictions, nonprofit<BR>

<P> organizations, businesses, and civic groups. In just the first<BR>

<P> four years of our benchmarks process, we have already<BR>

<P> taken nationally heralded steps to achieve benchmarks outcomes in<BR>

<P> child and family well being, in K-12 education, and worker<BR>

<P> training. Moreover, we know how to be a partner in an undertaking<BR>

<P> of this nature. Oregon has a record of participating in creative<BR>

<P> federal-state efforts to improve services. Examples include a<BR>

<P> 1981 Medicaid waiver, which has improved services to seniors<BR>

<P> while saving nursing home costs, and the 1993 forest plan, which<BR>

<P> streamlines and consolidates federally funded services to workers<BR>

<P> and their communities coping with changes in the forest<BR>

<P> products economy.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Benefits<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The most important benefit, and the ultimate test of The<BR>

<P> Oregon Option, will be results: higher rates of prenatal care and<BR>

<P> infant immunizations, lower teen pregnancy, higher K-12 skill<BR>

<P> levels, re-employment of dislocated workers, higher wages, safer<BR>

<P> neighborhoods. Other benefits include better use of public<BR>

<P> resources -- money and people -- at all levels, less client   <BR>

<P> confusion and despair, and greater confidence in public services.<BR>

<P> The Oregon Option also offers a laboratory for federal, state,<BR>

<P> and local participants to learn from their efforts and act on<BR>

<P> what they learn to improve service delivery.  The Oregon Option<BR>

<P> will advance the Administration's domestic policy agenda and the<BR>

<P> campaign to reinvent government.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> What It Will Take<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Oregon Option demonstration will require a long-term<BR>

<P> commitment and a fundamentally different way of thinking about<BR>

<P> the mission and structure of service systems at all levels of<BR>

<P> government.  The system envisioned here is focused on outcomes,<BR>

<P> customer-centered, decentralized, and accountable.  In this<BR>

<P> partnership, participants must be willing to a) contract for     <BR>

<P> measurable results, b) combine funding streams, c) renegotiate <BR>

<P> funding amounts and rates, d) eliminate rigid and costly    <BR>

<P> program restrictions, e) provide multi-year funding, and f)<BR>

<P> empower those closest to front-line service to choose the<BR>

<P> delivery mechanisms, initiatives, and investment criteria they   <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> deem most suitable.  The demonstration will require the waiver of<BR>

<P> a number of federal rules, and it will require financial and<BR>

<P> political support.  It is essential that the project have the<BR>

<P> initial involvement and continuing support of cabinet or<BR>

<P> subcabinet officials.<BR>

<P>              4. WHY A NEW INTERGOVERNMENTAL APPROACH<BR>

<P>                             IS NEEDED<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Dysfunctional Intergovernmental System<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In its 1993 report, the National Performance Review observes that<BR>

<P> a well-functioning intergovernmental system is central to<BR>

<P> Americans' quality of life and the national government's ability<BR>

<P> to pursue a domestic policy agenda.  It also notes that thousands<BR>

<P> of dedicated employees work hard within this system to solve<BR>

<P> human and societal problems.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Unfortunately, the report adds, there is a widespread feeling<BR>

<P> that public institutions and programs are not working.  At the<BR>

<P> same time, serious social and economic problems are deepening. <BR>

<P> These include low-birth-weight babies, single teenagers having<BR>

<P> babies, falling high school graduation rates, juvenile crime,<BR>

<P> declining household income, and the high number of Americans<BR>

<P> without adequate health care coverage.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      ***  The system intended to be a solution has become a major<BR>

<P>           part of the problem. ***<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> At least a part of the reason for these trends, the report<BR>

<P> asserts, is an increasingly dysfunctional intergovernmental<BR>

<P> process.  Grant and income transfer programs, notes the report,<BR>

<P> amount to over $226 billion in fiscal 1994.  The number of<BR>

<P> individual grant programs, now exceeding 600, continues to grow.<BR>

<P> Yet so do &quot;problems of duplication and overlap.&quot; The report goes<BR>

<P> on to level this harsh assessment.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      Unfortunately, the myriad of federal mandates and<BR>

<P>      regulations that accompany grant programs are cumbersome and<BR>

<P>      very costly to  administer, lack a coordinated<BR>

<P>      implementation strategy between levels of government, and<BR>

<P>      are not achieving the intended outcomes.  Each separate<BR>

<P>      program has its own array of rules and regulations that <BR>

<P>      must be observed, regardless of their impact on the<BR>

<P>      effectiveness and quality of customer service. States and<BR>

<P>      localities have limited ability to customize service<BR>

<P>      delivery by integrating programs because of competing, often<BR>

<P>      conflicting federal rules and requirements that accompany<BR>
 
<P>      each program.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The NPR report cites telling examples of a grant and mandate<BR>

<P> system that is fragmented, burdened with overhead, focused on<BR>

<P> process rather than results, and paralyzed with rules,<BR>

<P> regulations, and paperwork.  The system intended to be a solution<BR>

<P> has come to be a major part of the problem.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                 THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 17<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Oregon Perspective<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Not only are such problems familiar to our state and local<BR>

<P> governments as they view the federal end of the system, these<BR>

<P> problems are familiar to our localities as they view State of<BR>

<P> Oregon rules, regulations, and paperwork.  This is why Oregon<BR>

<P> state government, aware of its own bureaucratic shortcomings, has<BR>

<P> been making an effort through the benchmarks process to identify<BR>

<P> and integrate a wide range of functions and responsibilities<BR>

<P> (both within state agencies and between state and local agencies)<BR>

<P> that can be better handled at the local level The advantage of<BR>

<P> benchmarks, with their emphasis on measurable results, is that<BR>

<P> they make it possible to do this by measuring front-line<BR>

<P> performance in terms of outcomes.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Intergovernmental Barriers<BR>

<P> To Efficient, Integrated, Client-Centered Service<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In preparing this proposal, the Governor's Office surveyed state<BR>

<P> and local agencies to learn how they perceive their mission, the<BR>

<P> results they are trying to achieve, how the current<BR>

<P> intergovernmental system helps or stifles their efforts, and what<BR>

<P> features of a redesigned system would be most helpful to them. <BR>

<P> The themes that surfaced are presented in the remainder of this<BR>

<P> section.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> At this point, however, a word of caution is in order. While the<BR>

<P> examples that follow are intended to illustrate one dimension of<BR>

<P> intergovernmental dysfunction, they do not tell the whole story<BR>

<P> of Oregon's relationship with the federal system. As explained in<BR>

<P> the next section of this proposal, there are many instances in<BR>

<P> which the federal government has been supportive in cutting red<BR>

<P> tape and improving federally funded services to Oregonians.<BR>

<P> We want to build on those successes. Moreover, we know that state<BR>

<P> government is far from guiltless when it comes to generating<BR>

<P> stifling rules, regulations, and red.tape. The attempt through<BR>

<P> Oregon Benchmarks to simplify and integrate services is our own<BR>

<P> implicit acknowledgement that we, too, need to change the way we<BR>

<P> deliver services to Oregonians. That said, here are some examples<BR>

<P> of problems we hope to resolve with The Oregon Option<BR>

<P> demonstration project.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>    Too Many Federal and State Categories Add Overhead<BR>

<P>    and Make Service Integration Difficult<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The growing number of categories of federal programs confuse<BR>

<P> customers and waste resources. Every agency has a story to tell.<BR>

<P> For example, the <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                 THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 18<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Douglas County Health Department was recently admonished in a<BR>

<P> finicky federal &quot;technical assistance review&quot; for allowing an<BR>

<P> office work station purchased with WIC (Women Infant and Children<BR>

<P> nutrition) funds to be partially used for non-WIC activities<BR>

<P> (which were related to family health).  The county was asked to<BR>

<P> return a portion of the $5,227 investment for furniture, a matter<BR>

<P> still under negotiation.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> To manage among all of these categories, agencies must either<BR>

<P> keep elaborate (and expensive) accounting records, or (as is<BR>

<P> often the case), wastefully isolate administration and delivery<BR>

<P> of one program from another to avoid being penalized by auditors.<BR>

<P> Many community colleges, for example, run separate training<BR>

<P> programs for each federal program rather than merge classes<BR>

<P> because of different requirements and accounting complexities.<BR>

<P> Separate computer systems are set up for federal programs,<BR>

<P> at greatly added expense, rather than joining with existing<BR>

<P> systems.  The prospect of federal sanction is intimidating.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In addition, each program generally requires separate planning<BR>

<P> and reporting requirements, all of which adds to costs. For<BR>

<P> example, Oregon is expected to provide five plans for five major<BR>

<P> federal programs in work force preparation. If these plans were<BR>

<P> consolidated into one, Oregon could provide more integrated<BR>

<P> services with less overhead.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      ***  Separate planning and reporting requirements add to<BR>

<P>           costs and confuse customers. ***<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> More important, categorical programs confuse customers. In every<BR>

<P> area of social service delivery, from families and children to<BR>

<P> mental health to work force development, customers are confused<BR>

<P> by too many categories of services. For example, the state<BR>

<P> Legislature, in a report on Children and Families, reviewed the<BR>

<P> dizzying array of services from a client perspective.  They found<BR>

<P> that services were scattered and difficult to access.  The report<BR>

<P> envisioned community centers integrating services to make them<BR>

<P> more effective for clients.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We are attempting to address these concerns at all levels of<BR>

<P> government, and it isn't easy. In Multnomah County, for example,<BR>

<P> family planning, WIC nutrition support, maternal-child health and<BR>

<P> other primary care services are delivered through an integrated<BR>

<P> primary care delivery model.  Multnomah County is recognized<BR>

<P> nationally for this efficient system which allows clients to<BR>

<P> receive many different services in one visit.  While services<BR>

<P> have been integrated, there are still heavy administrative costs<BR>

<P> associated with the segmentation of funds and overlapping federal<BR>

<P> and state <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                 THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 19<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> reporting costs. The county estimates that it could save over<BR>

<P> $800,000 were the systems to be simplified. These savings would<BR>

<P> be enough to accommodate more than 12,000 patient visits each<BR>

<P> year.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Multnomah County is not alone in its efforts. At the end of 1993,<BR>

<P> there were 33 Oregon communities working in cooperation with the<BR>

<P> Oregon Department of Human Resources to integrate services. One<BR>

<P> such project is in White City, a small timber town in southern<BR>

<P> Oregon.  White City invited staff from the public assistance<BR>

<P> agency, child welfare, and the public health and employment<BR>

<P> departments to a coordination meeting.  Each person was asked to<BR>

<P> bring a list of the 30 families in the area deemed most at risk.<BR>

<P> When participants compared their lists, they were stunned: There<BR>

<P> was a crossover of 25 out of the 30. These service providers were<BR>

<P> working with the same families, often at cross purposes, and none<BR>

<P> of them were aware of one another's efforts.  They were so<BR>

<P> focused on the various state and federal requirements for<BR>

<P> individual programs, they were unable to view their customers in<BR>

<P> a holistic manner.  Now in White City, like many other Oregon<BR>

<P> communities, there is a single location where customers can<BR>

<P> access all services.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>   Excessive Rules, Regulations and Oversight<BR>

<P>    Add Cost and Stifle Service Capability<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> As the NPR points out so well, the intergovernmental system is<BR>

<P> driven by stifling rules and intrusive audits that add costs to<BR>

<P> the administration of programs and discourage innovation. These<BR>

<P> constraints are very expensive and have little value to<BR>

<P> customers.  Indeed, much of the bureaucracy that Americans<BR>

<P> complain about can be linked to the way we manage our<BR>

<P> intergovernmental system.  By focusing so much of our<BR>

<P> attention on the details of administration and the tracking of<BR>

<P> costs, our systems have become cumbersome and we have lost sight<BR>

<P> of the results that we are trying to achieve.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The burden and costs associated with federal rules and paperwork<BR>

<P> are huge.  Roughly one-fourth of Oregon's 40,000 state employees<BR>

<P> are primarily involved in implementing federal programs, and many<BR>

<P> more are partially involved with federal program requirements.<BR>

<P> Large agencies that are involved in delivering big federal<BR>

<P> programs such as public assistance and foster care estimate that<BR>

<P> 20 percent of their costs stem from unnecessary regulation.  For<BR>

<P> example, our public assistance division files 550 reports <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                 THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 20<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> each year and navigates through volumes of federal eligibility<BR>

<P> manuals.  Among smaller programs such as JTPA and Housing, more<BR>

<P> than 50 percent of staff time is spent dealing with federal rules<BR>

<P> and requirements.  These are estimates just for state government.<BR>

<P> We have not yet been able to estimate the amount of unnecessary<BR>

<P> paperwork local governments must endure because of the current<BR>

<P> design of our systems. Nor do we know the number of federal<BR>

<P> employees absorbed in writing regulations and reading our<BR>

<P> reports. If we could streamline the intergovernmental system,<BR>

<P> thousands of public employees could turn their attention from<BR>

<P> paper-pushing to direct productive services to citizens.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> This regulatory overkill is demoralizing and at times absurd For<BR>

<P> example,  on an Indian reservation where no private child care<BR>

<P> providers existed, a proposal to remodel a garage into a playroom<BR>

<P> was rejected because of cumbersome regulations.  The community<BR>

<P> had to settle for fewer child care slots.  The Department of<BR>

<P> Consumer and Business Service has faced some microscopic<BR>

<P> monitoring by federal agencies.  In 1989, Oregon submitted<BR>

<P> construction industry standards.  This year a response arrived.<BR>

<P> Comments extended to typos and the observation that while<BR>

<P> Oregon's change of terminology from &quot;flagman&quot; to &quot;flagger&quot; was<BR>

<P> understandable, a complete comparison document would be required<BR>

<P> providing a rationale for this change.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> One of the newer problems encountered by state agencies is the<BR>

<P> federal &quot;first dollar&quot; requirement. The Vocational Rehabilitation<BR>

<P> Division, for example, faces a federal requirement to look to<BR>

<P> other agencies and resources to pay for client services before<BR>

<P> using VRD funds.  The problem develops when another agency with<BR>

<P> the same client, say the Job Training Partnership Administration,<BR>

<P> has the same requirement.  In a situation where an employer is<BR>

<P> interested in an on-the-job-training contract, both agencies<BR>

<P> are paralyzed because neither can act until the other puts in the<BR>

<P> first dollar.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> All these rules and requirements distract workers from their real<BR>

<P> priority, customer service, as they struggle to remain in<BR>

<P> compliance. The system squanders our greatest asset, the valuable<BR>

<P> time of front line workers, in a tangle of unproductive,<BR>

<P> unnecessary activities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                 THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 21<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>   A Bias Toward Remediating Problems<BR>

<P>   Rather Than Preventing Them<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Besides too many categories with too many rules and regulations,<BR>

<P> there is one final problem with the intergovernmental system.<BR>

<P> Resources are directed at the wrong place. Indeed, the structure<BR>

<P> of federal program allocations often reward failure and penalize<BR>

<P> success.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We in Oregon believe strongly in the Clinton Administration's<BR>

<P> agenda to build strong families that can take care of children,<BR>

<P> to improve education, to provide preventive health services, and<BR>

<P> to create the kind of professional technical education and job<BR>

<P> training services that move Oregonians into high wage jobs.  When<BR>

<P> we look at how federal dollars flow, however, we see a<BR>

<P> preponderance of expenditure on the kinds of assistance and<BR>

<P> remedial support services that could be reduced dramatically if<BR>

<P> we invested earlier in the life cycle.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Much of this misallocation of resources stems from matching<BR>

<P> requirements created in federal programs.  For example, Oregon's<BR>

<P> efforts and expenditures in the JOBS program have helped reduce<BR>

<P> the state's ADC caseload. Because JOBS funding is allocated in<BR>

<P> direct proportion to the state's share of the national ADC<BR>

<P> caseload, performance in reducing the ADC caseload is penalized:<BR>

<P> better results bring fewer federal JOBS program dollars available<BR>

<P> to the state, while larger shares go to states I programs that <BR>

<P> do not perform.  Similarly, we receive substantial matching<BR>

<P> funds for foster care, yet limited funds for in-home care, even<BR>

<P> though many experts believe home maker services are cheaper and<BR>

<P> forestall the need for more expensive foster care.  These<BR>

<P> examples are not atypical.  In too many cases our investments in<BR>

<P> preventive programs that work reduce the total funds we receive<BR>

<P> from the federal government.<BR>

<P>                  WITH THE FEDERAL SYSTEM         <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Despite problems in the intergovernmental service<BR>

<P> delivery system, Oregon governments have forged a number of<BR>

<P> promising partnerships with federal agencies.  Collectively,<BR>

<P> these successes provide a precedent and a foundation for a<BR>

<P> broader redesigned partnership between our state and local    <BR>

<P> agencies and the federal government.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Here are prominent examples of successes to build on.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Senior Services<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> In 1981 Oregon applied for a waiver from the Health Care Finance <BR>

<P> Administration to allow Medicaid funds formerly dedicated for<BR>

<P> nursing homes to be used for home and community-based care for<BR>

<P> the elderly and disabled.  We were the first state in the nation<BR>

<P> to use such an approach, and the results have been excellent,<BR>

<P> allowing a majority of long-term care clients to be shifted out<BR>

<P> of nursing facilities.  This has afforded a greater             <BR>

<P> independence and better quality of life for clients while saving<BR>

<P> the federal and state governments $319 million between 1981 and<BR>

<P> 1993.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The number of Medicaid nursing facility clients has<BR>

<P> actually declined slightly over the past 11 years, despite rapid<BR>

<P> growth in the elderly segment of the population. Our population<BR>

<P> over 75 years old grew 50 percent in the 1980s. Yet during that<BR>

<P> period, nursing facility occupancy dropped from 93 percent to 88<BR>

<P> percent. And the number of nursing facility beds per 1,000     <BR>

<P> Oregonians over 65 dropped From 48 to 38.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Oregon Health Plan Medicaid Waiver<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We are working to expand health care coverage to all Oregonians.<BR>

<P> The federal government worked closely with the state in<BR>

<P> one key part of our strategy: the Medicaid reform component of<BR>

<P> the Oregon Health Plan, a Title XIX demonstration project.  Under<BR>

<P> the plan, most Oregonians with incomes under the federal poverty<BR>

<P> level are covered by Medicaid.  Clients receive care through a<BR>

<P> coordinated system of managed care plans, with benefits   <BR>

<P> defined through a prioritization process that emphasizes<BR>

<P> cost-effective preventive care.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The program began on February 1, 1994.  Today there are 260,000<BR>

<P> people enrolled in 20 managed care plans under the health<BR>

<P> plan.  Of the total 260,000 enrolled, 72,000 are new Medicaid<BR>

<P> eligibles who would not have been eligible for health care<BR>

<P> coverage without the health plan.  Because of <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                   THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 23<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> our partnership with the federal government in designing<BR>

<P> this program, we are increasing the number of people covered,<BR>

<P> enrolling more of them in managed care plans, controlling <BR>

<P> Medicaid costs and improving health care to Oregonians.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Forest Plan<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> The Northwest Economic Adjustment Initiative established a new<BR>

<P> partnership between Oregon and the federal government to<BR>

<P> assist dislocated workers, businesses, and communities that must<BR>

<P> adjust to economic conditions and land management decisions that<BR>

<P> adversely affect the forest products economy.  The initiative<BR>

<P> provides for cooperative planning and decision making among<BR>

<P> local, state, and federal agencies as well as improvement in the<BR>

<P> distribution of federal funds.  Moreover, it is long        <BR>

<P> term, involving funding commitments of up to five years.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Although this initiative is still in its infancy, some promising<BR>

<P> results have begun to take shape.  The initiative has fashioned a<BR>

<P> coordinated service delivery system for a package of assistance<BR>

<P> involving 18 federal programs, 12 federal agencies, and numerous<BR>

<P> state and local interests.  Of nearly 50 recommendations for<BR>

<P> cutting red tape and streamlining delivery systems, over half<BR>

<P> have been adopted and only seven have been denied.  The<BR>

<P> initiative has also been a catalyst in finding common ground<BR>

<P> among forest industry workers, communities, and state and federal<BR>

<P> governments to create a new kind of forest-based economy.  The<BR>

<P> &quot;Ecosystem Workforce Pilot Program&quot; is redefining jobs in the<BR>

<P> woods through ecosystem restoration projects that provide<BR>

<P> dislocated workers family wages and benefits, long-term        <BR>

<P> employment, and skills training.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Developmental Disabilities<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Before 1981 certain Medicaid dollars had to be used to house<BR>

<P> individuals with developmental disabilities in large, state-run<BR>

<P> institutions. But then the federal Health Care Financing<BR>

<P> Administration worked with Oregon to allow those dollars to pay<BR>

<P> for home and community-based care instead.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We were the first in the nation to receive such a waiver<BR>

<P> and the results have been excellent.  More than 1,500 former<BR>

<P> residents of large institutions now live in community-based<BR>

<P> homes.  And more than 100 people a year are able to stay in the<BR>

<P> community with new or enhanced services, rather than        <BR>

<P> institutions.  This change has been essential to the state's<BR>

<P> effort to reduce <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                     THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 24<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> the size of its largest institution for the<BR>

<P> developmentally disabled, bringing it back into compliance with<BR>

<P> Medicaid regulations.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> These separate efforts demonstrate that Oregon is fertile<BR>

<P> ground for bold, innovative experiments that can yield big<BR>

<P> dividends.  We have learned a great deal from these efforts and<BR>

<P> have built a promising track record in collaboration with our<BR>

<P> federal partners.  Now it is time to take the next step        <BR>

<P> -- to build on these separate successes by implementing<BR>

<P> The Oregon Option.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>               THE OREGON OPTION, PAGE 25<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>               6. THE OREGON OPTION<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Oregon proposes The Oregon Option, the multiyear demonstration of<BR>

<P> a redesigned model of intergovernmental service delivery. It<BR>

<P> would be structured and operated to achieve benchmarks in human<BR>

<P> investment that are mutually desirable to the federal government<BR>

<P> and to our communities.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> These are the principles of the recommended service delivery<BR>

<P> system:<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      *    Only results equal success.  The system should be<BR>

<P>           structured, managed, and evaluated on the basis of<BR>

<P>           results (i.e., progress in achieving benchmarks).<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      *    Customers come first. The system should be oriented to<BR>

<P>           customer needs and satisfaction, especially through<BR>

<P>           integration of services.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      *    Nip problems in the bud. The system should be biased<BR>

<P>           toward prevention rather than remediation of problems.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>      *    Cut red tape, empower front-line workers. The system<BR>

<P>           should be simplified and integrated as much as<BR>

<P>           possible, delegating responsibilities for service<BR>

<P>           design, delivery, and results to front-line,<BR>

<P>           local-level providers, whether they are local agencies<BR>

<P>           or local offices of state agencies.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Need for High-Level, Long-Term Commitment<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> To have a reasonable prospect of success, this delivery model<BR>

<P> must have high-level support at both federal and state levels,<BR>

<P> and a long-term federal commitment to funding.  Because it will<BR>

<P> take time to put new systems in place and begin to see results,<BR>

<P> eight years should be considered a minimum time frame.  Funding<BR>

<P> for this effort should be based on a formula that creates strong<BR>

<P> financial incentives for successfully improving the lives of<BR>

<P> Oregonians while reducing the need for public assistance and<BR>

<P> remedial program services.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> This delivery model will require consolidation of funding<BR>

<P> categories and streams, suspension of stifling regulations and<BR>

<P> wasteful paperwork requirements, management accountability by<BR>

<P> results rather than inputs, and a cooperative rather than<BR>

<P> adversarial relationship among government partners.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>                  OREGON OPTION, PAGE 27<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> How the Parties Should Proceed<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> If there is strong federal interest in this proposal, the parties<BR>

<P> should proceed by further refining the recommendations contained<BR>

<P> here, with an aim toward two near-term accomplishments. First, we<BR>

<P> should develop a statement of principle that identifies what   <BR>

<P> We are moving on Oregon outcomes we want to achieve and the<BR>

<P> ground rules for redesigning the service delivery system. <BR>

<P> Second, we should select a few benchmarks for immediate attention<BR>

<P> as the basis of system redesign.  For example, the federal<BR>

<P> government may wish to join with Oregon to reduce teen pregnancy<BR>

<P> rates and increase immunizations.  Each benchmark should generate<BR>

<P> a substantial list of actions to take, some of which can be done<BR>

<P> quickly, others over a longer time, perhaps in conjunction with a<BR>

<P> legislative strategy.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> Next Steps<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P> We recognize that a great deal of collaborative work lies ahead<BR>

<P> to take this concept forward. Team structure, benchmark outcomes,<BR>

<P> timelines, budgets, and organizational logistics need to be<BR>

<P> established. We are moving on Oregon Benchmarks already. We are<BR>

<P> ready to move on The Oregon Option.<BR>

<P>REINVENTING HUMAN RESOURCE<BR>

<P>MANAGEMENT (HRM)<BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 29<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 29:1<BR>

<P>
<P>Many of the NPR recommendations aimed at fundamental reforms of<BR>

<P>federal human resource management will require statutory changes,<BR>

<P>particularly in areas such as the hiring system, position<BR>

<P>classification, the labor-management relations program, and<BR>

<P>performance management.  Responsibility for determining the specific<BR>

<P>changes needed to accomplish these recommendations' objectives was<BR>

<P>assigned to the National Partnership Council, established by<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12871 on October 1, 1993.  The Council includes<BR>

<P>representatives of federal agencies, employee unions, and neutral<BR>

<P>organizations.  Formation of the Council itself fully implemented the<BR>

<P>NPR recommendation to form labor-management partnerships for success. <BR>

<P>The Council issued its report on January 31, 1994, but as yet no<BR>

<P>legislative proposals have been prepared. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation was enacted that partially implemented NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendation that the number of federal employees be reduced.  The<BR>

<P>Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 required a reduction of<BR>

<P>272,900 full-time equivalent positions during fiscal years 1994<BR>

<P>through 1999 and authorized lump-sum payments of up to $25,000 to<BR>

<P>employees who resign or retire (subject to OPM approval of agency<BR>

<P>early retirement authorization requests).  The legislation also<BR>

<P>adopted the NPR's recommendation calling for broadening agencies'<BR>

<P>authority to pay for employee training, but regulations to implement<BR>
this part of the statute have not been completed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Progress is being made in many areas where recommended changes can be<BR>

<P>accomplished administratively.  For example, the Office of Personnel<BR>

<P>Management (OPM) has actions under way to abolish the Federal<BR>

<P>Personnel Manual and the federal job application form, and a<BR>

<P>presidential memorandum was issued in July 1994 directing agencies to<BR>

<P>establish programs to encourage and support the expansion of<BR>

<P>family-friendly work arrangements for their employees.  OPM is also<BR>

<P>continuing its efforts to institute governmentwide employment<BR>

<P>information and job application systems accessible by computer and<BR>

<P>telephone.  Working groups have been formed to determine how best to<BR>

<P>proceed in a number of other areas.  However, for various reasons,<BR>

<P>consideration of some issues, such as allowing agencies to hire<BR>

<P>candidates directly when recruiting shortages exist and establishing<BR>

<P>agency productivity gainsharing initiatives with employees, have been<BR>

<P>deferred.  No action has occurred to implement the NPR recommendation<BR>

<P>to improve accountability for equal opportunity goals and<BR>

<P>accomplishments. <BR>

<P>      AND RESPONSIVE HIRING SYSTEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Authorize agencies to establish their own recruitment and examining<BR>

<P>programs.  Abolish centralized registers and standard application<BR>

<P>forms.  Allow federal departments and agencies to determine that<BR>

<P>recruitment shortages exist and directly hire candidates without<BR>

<P>ranking.  Reduce the types of competitive service appointments to<BR>

<P>three.  Abolish the time-in-grade requirement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>1.  Authorize agencies to establish their own recruitment and<BR>

<P>examining programs.  Abolish central registers and standard<BR>

<P>application forms. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Allow federal departments and agencies to determine that<BR>

<P>recruitment shortages exist and directly hire candidates without<BR>

<P>ranking. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Reduce the number of competitive service appointment types to<BR>

<P>three. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Permit nonpermanent employees to compete for permanent positions<BR>

<P>under agency procedures for internal placement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Abolish the time-in-grade requirement.  Create a general<BR>

<P>qualifications framework that permits agencies to augment or modify<BR>

<P>qualification standards for both internal and external placement<BR>

<P>actions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  Eliminate all statutory rules on detailing employees to temporary<BR>

<P>assignments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  Create a governmentwide employment information system to inform<BR>

<P>the public of job opportunities.  Coordinate the development and<BR>

<P>operation of common automated systems to facilitate agency staffing<BR>
policies and operations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that reforms are needed to bring the<BR>

<P>federal hiring process more into line with the needs of agencies and<BR>

<P>job applicants, and we see merit in allowing agencies greater<BR>

<P>latitude in determining which job candidates they wish to hire. <BR>

<P>However, the specific NPR proposals represent significant departures<BR>

<P>from the traditional hiring process, and we have completed no work on<BR>

<P>which to base a determination of whether they are the best way to<BR>

<P>improve the hiring process.  More importantly, the report gave no<BR>

<P>indication of how agencies would be held accountable for ensuring<BR>

<P>that merit system principles and other statutory requirements, such<BR>

<P>as veterans' preference in hiring, are followed under a complete<BR>

<P>decentralization of the hiring process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Executive Order 12871, dated October<BR>
1, 1993, created the National Partnership Council (NPC) and charged<BR>

<P>it with proposing statutory changes consistent with this NPR<BR>

<P>recommendation.  In its January 31, 1994, report, the NPC endorsed<BR>

<P>the NPR recommendation and outlined a framework for how a<BR>

<P>decentralized hiring system should work.  However, no statutory<BR>

<P>language to change the federal hiring system has been proposed. <BR>

<P>According to NPR staff, action has been deferred on the issue of<BR>

<P>allowing agencies to directly hire candidates when recruiting<BR>

<P>shortages exist because of uncertainty about the criteria to be used<BR>

<P>in determining such shortages. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM has initiated two regulatory changes related to this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  On June 15, 1994, it proposed in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register to eliminate the regulatory time-in-grade restriction on<BR>

<P>promotion eligibility.  On June 22, 1994, it proposed to abolish the<BR>

<P>SF-171 standard job application form effective December 31, 1994. <BR>

<P>OPM is continuing efforts begun before the NPR report was issued to<BR>

<P>institute governmentwide employment information and job application<BR>

<P>systems accessible by computer and telephone.  In May 1994, OPM<BR>

<P>discontinued its central registers for entry level professional and<BR>

<P>administrative positions.  Agencies, with OPM assistance, now rate<BR>

<P>and rank candidates for their own vacancies in these positions. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Remove all grade-level classification criteria from the law while<BR>

<P>retaining the 15-grade structure. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Provide agencies with flexibility to establish broadbanding<BR>

<P>systems built upon the General Schedule framework. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Modify the standard 15-grade classification system that applies<BR>

<P>to those employees not covered by a broadbanding system. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Similar to our position on the previous<BR>

<P>recommendation, we generally favor granting agencies increased<BR>

<P>prerogatives in managing their human resources, but are concerned<BR>

<P>about how they would be held accountable for their actions.  The<BR>

<P>current job classification system evolved to implement the principle<BR>

<P>that there be equal pay for substantially equal work for all<BR>

<P>employees in each local pay area.  The report gave no indication of<BR>

<P>how the integrity of the job classification and pay systems would be<BR>

<P>maintained if each agency were allowed to establish its own systems<BR>

<P>without central guidance and controls.  Our examinations of the<BR>

<P>broadbanding approach to position classification have shown it was<BR>

<P>generally successful in the few instances in which it was used, but<BR>

<P>the tests were too limited for a conclusion that it would be<BR>

<P>appropriate in other locations.  Salary costs also tended to be<BR>

<P>higher under a broadbanding system.  Legislation to allow<BR>

<P>broadbanding in all agencies has been proposed in the past, but was<BR>

<P>not enacted because of congressional concerns that it had not been<BR>

<P>sufficiently tested. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In its January 31, 1994, report, the NPC endorsed classification<BR>

<P>reform and said labor-management partnerships should guide changes in<BR>

<P>classification and pay structures.  It also suggested delaying<BR>

<P>legislative recommendations for changes to the General Schedule pay<BR>

<P>system until experience is gained with the pay flexibilities allowed<BR>

<P>under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. <BR>

<P>this act did not authorize agencies to design their own programs<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Reduce by half the time required to terminate federal managers<BR>

<P>and employees for cause.  Make other improvements in the systems for<BR>

<P>dealing with poor performers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Develop a culture of performance that supports supervisors'<BR>

<P>efforts to deal with poor performers. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  A 1990 study we conducted indicated a need for<BR>

<P>agency management to focus on creating an environment within which<BR>

<P>supervisors are encouraged and motivated to deal with poor performers<BR>

<P>and are properly trained and supported when they attempt to deal with<BR>

<P>them.  Thus, we agree with the general thrust of the recommendation. <BR>

<P>However, we have done no work on which to base an opinion on the<BR>

<P>reasonableness of the goal to reduce by half the time required to<BR>

<P>terminate employees for cause. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In its January 31, 1994, report, the<BR>

<P>NPC recommended that the required 30-day notice period for proposed<BR>

<P>adverse actions be reduced to 15 days.  This 30-day notice period<BR>

<P>represents only a small part of the overall time it usually takes to<BR>

<P>terminate employees for cause.  No other recommendation was made on<BR>

<P>how to cut the overall time needed to terminate federal employees for<BR>

<P>cause.  An NPR representative said the legislation to be developed<BR>

<P>may call for agencies to look at other processes and review periods<BR>

<P>to see if they, too, could be cut. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM has convened focus groups of federal managers and supervisors to<BR>

<P>look at the relationship between performance and minority and<BR>

<P>nonminority discharge rates, and is developing training courses for<BR>

<P>managers and supervisors on dealing with poor performers scheduled to<BR>

<P>begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree completely that greater emphasis on<BR>

<P>federal employee training is needed.  Training expenditures are often<BR>

<P>one of the first areas to be cut when agency budgets are reduced, and<BR>

<P>our work indicates that many employees are not receiving all of the<BR>

<P>training they believe they need.  In a 1991 survey of federal<BR>

<P>employees, we asked about their training experiences and needs. <BR>

<P>Overall, the employees expressed fairly positive views about<BR>

<P>training, but sizeable numbers felt their training experiences left<BR>

<P>something to be desired. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Results of the survey illustrate the extent to which employees may<BR>

<P>have unmet training needs.  About one-quarter of the respondents said<BR>

<P>they had no agency-paid training of any kind during the previous 2<BR>

<P>years.  When asked to what extent their agencies encouraged them to<BR>

<P>participate in training, about 36 percent checked some or little to<BR>

<P>no extent.  About 20 percent said they needed a great deal to a very<BR>

<P>great deal of additional job-related training.  Almost a quarter said<BR>

<P>they were treated fairly only some of the time or never when it came<BR>

<P>to training relating to their current jobs. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On March 30, 1994, Congress passed Public Law<BR>

<P>103-226, the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which<BR>

<P>broadened agencies' authority to pay for employee training.  An<BR>

<P>agency may now pay for any training that assists it in achieving its<BR>

<P>mission and performance goals if it determines that the training is<BR>

<P>in the interest of the government.  The act also removed the previous<BR>

<P>restriction on degree training, and eliminated limitations on<BR>

<P>training from nongovernment sources.  Implementing regulations have<BR>

<P>not yet been completed.  However, in June 1994, OPM notified agencies<BR>

<P>of the changes to the training law, and advised them to implement<BR>

<P>those changes immediately. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Because the legislation expanded the circumstances in which employees<BR>

<P>could receive agency-paid training, training costs could increase. <BR>

<P>On August 4, 1994, OMB advised agency chief financial officers that<BR>

<P>the law may allow agencies to transfer up to 2 percent of their<BR>

<P>appropriations among accounts, and that up to 3 percent of their<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1994 unobligated salary and expense funds could be used<BR>

<P>for employee training programs in fiscal year 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  The dramatic demographic changes occurring in the federal<BR>

<P>workforce signify the need to modernize federal employment policies<BR>

<P>to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities. <BR>

<P>Leading nonfederal employers have found that well-conceived<BR>

<P>work/family programs can improve employee recruitment, retention, and<BR>

<P>productivity.  Our work shows that the government has not kept pace<BR>

<P>with these employers in the work/family area. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In October 1993, Congress passed the Federal<BR>

<P>Employees Leave Sharing Amendments Act to provide continuing<BR>

<P>authorization for leave transfer and leave bank programs.  Although<BR>

<P>such action was recommended by the NPR, action to reauthorize the<BR>

<P>programs was under way before the NPR report was issued.  Congress<BR>

<P>also authorized agencies to provide telecommunications support for<BR>

<P>flexiplace participants during fiscal year 1994.  Legislation being<BR>

<P>drafted by OPM and GSA would permanently authorize such support. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In an October 21, 1993, memorandum, OPM provided agencies with<BR>

<P>information to help them set up alternative workplace arrangements. <BR>

<P>A presidential memorandum was issued on July 11, 1994, directing<BR>

<P>agencies to establish programs to encourage and support the expansion<BR>

<P>of flexible family-friendly work arrangements, including job sharing,<BR>

<P>career part-time employment, alternative work schedules,<BR>

<P>telecommuting, and satellite work locations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In May 1994, OPM proposed regulations to allow employees to use up to<BR>

<P>5 days of sick leave a year to care for ill family members and for<BR>

<P>bereavement upon a family member's death.  The proposed regulations<BR>

<P>also would remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the<BR>

<P>recredit of sick leave for former employees returning to federal<BR>

<P>service.  The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act of 1994,<BR>

<P>enacted on October 22, 1994, allows up to 13 days of sick leave each<BR>

<P>year to care for ill family members and for bereavement.  Thus, OPM's<BR>

<P>proposed regulation will have to be changed accordingly. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to OPM, it is drafting a legislative proposal to broaden<BR>

<P>agencies' authority to design flexible child care and dependent adult<BR>

<P>care programs.  According to NPR staff, action has been deferred on<BR>

<P>the proposal to expand the demonstration project authority to allow<BR>

<P>projects on employee benefits. <BR>

<P>have done no work to form an opinion on the extent to which<BR>

<P>no strong evidence that consolidating existing appeal and grievance<BR>

<P>systems would result in significant savings in time or money.  We<BR>

<P>found that the individual systems were established to serve specific<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although this recommendation is not very specific,<BR>

<P>it appears to be intended to achieve a more governmentwide approach<BR>

<P>to SES matters.  We believe this idea may have merit.  The SES has<BR>

<P>not been the highly mobile cadre of managers envisioned by the Civil<BR>

<P>Service Reform Act.  Our work has also shown that relatively few SES<BR>

<P>appointees completed candidate development programs designed to<BR>

<P>enhance their managerial skills. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  While many decisions remain to be<BR>

<P>made on how the SES will be managed and structured, actions are being<BR>

<P>taken toward implementing this recommendation.  Among the actions OPM<BR>

<P>has taken are (1) establishing an Executive Resources Management<BR>

<P>Group as an interagency forum to share information and study<BR>

<P>governmentwide SES issues, (2) preparing new executive core<BR>

<P>qualifications, (3) delegating to agencies the authority to determine<BR>

<P>the training experiences appropriate for their SES candidate<BR>

<P>development programs using criteria established by OPM, (4)<BR>

<P>distributing background material on successful succession planning to<BR>

<P>agency personnel executives, (5) establishing a working group to<BR>

<P>develop succession planning models for use by agencies, and (6)<BR>

<P>preparing a draft brochure on executive mobility. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.12.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  In general, the FPM and agency directives<BR>

<P>provide guidance to federal managers on how to interpret and apply<BR>

<P>the statutes pertaining to federal employment.  To the extent that<BR>

<P>they can be simplified and automated, they could possibly better<BR>

<P>accomplish their purposes.  While we believe the recommendation's<BR>

<P>objective is sound, we have no opinion on the amount of effort and<BR>

<P>cost it would take to automate and reengineer the work processes. <BR>

<P>Nor do we have an opinion on the prospects of developing and having<BR>

<P>replacement processes, systems, and manuals in place by December<BR>

<P>1994.  We note, however, that major automation initiatives tend to be<BR>

<P>costly. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.12.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Working with agency representatives,<BR>

<P>unions, the Interagency Advisory Group, and the National Partnership<BR>

<P>Council, OPM abolished the FPM in January 1994.  Of the total manual,<BR>

<P>30 chapters were abolished outright, 6 chapters were provisionally<BR>

<P>retained until December 1994, and 52 chapters were either retained in<BR>

<P>part or may be retained in some other format.  OPM also published a<BR>

<P>notification in the Federal Register that it will be incorporating<BR>

<P>certain guidance previously in the FPM into regulation.  Thus, while<BR>

<P>the FPM has been eliminated in form, it has not been completely<BR>

<P>eliminated in substance.  According to an NPR representative, 23<BR>

<P>agencies had initiatives under way to significantly reduce the amount<BR>

<P>of their internal regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Under the leadership of OPM and the Department of Defense, a Human<BR>

<P>Resources Automation Consortium was created to construct an automated<BR>

<P>governmentwide personnel network.  The consortium opened a &quot;model<BR>

<P>personnel office&quot; incorporating currently available automated systems<BR>

<P>in Crystal City, Virginia.  In addition, OPM is developing new<BR>

<P>electronic job application and applicant evaluation systems,<BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards, and live satellite broadcasts as means of<BR>

<P>providing guidance and assistance to agencies.  And, according to the<BR>

<P>NPR representative, 24 agencies have initiated personnel system<BR>

<P>automation projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM is working with an interagency advisory group to define<BR>

<P>accountability in a customer context.  According to OPM, the work<BR>

<P>group will focus on customer service standards, benchmarks, and<BR>

<P>measurement methods, and will distribute a governmentwide human<BR>

<P>resources customer satisfaction survey. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.13.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President should issue an executive order that identifies<BR>

<P>labor-management partnership as a goal of the executive branch and<BR>

<P>establishes the National Partnership Council. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Based on our evaluation of the state of the federal<BR>

<P>labor-management relations program, we concluded that the program is<BR>

<P>not accomplishing its objectives.  We recommended that a panel of<BR>

<P>nationally recognized experts in labor-management relations and<BR>

<P>participants in the federal program be convened to develop a proposal<BR>

<P>for comprehensive program reform.  In our opinion, the National<BR>

<P>Partnership Council is an appropriate body to serve that purpose.  It<BR>

<P>should be recognized that, depending on the matters made subject to<BR>

<P>collective bargaining in a revised program, considerable training for<BR>

<P>federal managers on bargaining strategies and methods could be<BR>

<P>required since few matters are now subject to bargaining. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.13.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  Executive Order 12871, signed by the President on<BR>

<P>October 1, 1993, established the National Partnership Council.  The<BR>

<P>Council is composed of representatives of the three largest federal<BR>

<P>employee unions, the Public Employee Department of the AFL-CIO, and<BR>

<P>seven federal agencies.  Among the Council's responsibilities are<BR>

<P>advising the President on labor-management relations, supporting the<BR>

<P>creation of labor-management partnerships and promoting partnership<BR>

<P>efforts, and proposing legislative changes related to labor<BR>

<P>relations.  The executive order also required federal agencies to<BR>

<P>create labor-management partnerships.  The Council issued its report<BR>

<P>to the President on January 31, 1994.  According to the report, the<BR>

<P>Council plans to pursue an active program of information gathering,<BR>

<P>guidance, and training related to partnership activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A number of agencies have formed national and local councils and<BR>

<P>signed partnership agreements with their employee unions.  Some of<BR>

<P>the partnership agreements were the result of Quality Management and<BR>

<P>related initiatives that preceded Executive Order 12871. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.14.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  This recommendation is based on the<BR>

<P>premise that the government has too many employees and should be<BR>

<P>reduced by offering employees opportunities and incentives to leave. <BR>

<P>The NPR report does not clearly indicate how many employees, if any,<BR>

<P>are excess or how the determination was made that agencies have more<BR>

<P>employees than they need to accomplish their missions.  We have long<BR>

<P>maintained that the numbers and types of employees needed should be<BR>

<P>determined through sound workforce planning procedures.  We see no<BR>

<P>apparent relationship between the downsizing issue and the<BR>

<P>accumulation of annual leave by senior executives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 29:2.14.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of<BR>

<P>1994 required a reduction of 272,900 full-time equivalent positions<BR>

<P>during fiscal years 1994 through 1999, and authorized payments of up<BR>

<P>to $25,000 to employees who take early or regular retirement or<BR>

<P>resign during periods specified by the employing agencies. <BR>

<P>Accordingly, the part of the recommendation calling for payments to<BR>

<P>separating employees has been adopted.  The act also provided that<BR>

<P>agencies may train any employee for placement in another agency if<BR>

<P>the head of the losing agency determined that the training would be<BR>

<P>in the interest of the government.  OPM also established a work group<BR>

<P>to examine job search issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While OPM retained the responsibility for approving agency early<BR>

<P>retirement authorization requests, it implemented procedures to<BR>

<P>approve them quickly and increased agency prerogatives on how early<BR>

<P>retirements could be administered.  Legislation to implement the part<BR>

<P>of the recommendation calling for agencies to fund job search<BR>

<P>activities and retraining of employees scheduled to be displaced has<BR>

<P>not been approved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM implemented the Interagency Placement Program (IPP) on December<BR>

<P>1, 1993, to find jobs in other agencies for employees displaced by<BR>

<P>downsizing.  When filling vacancies from competitive registers or<BR>

<P>through the use of direct hire authorities, agencies must consult the<BR>

<P>IPP before hiring applicants with no prior federal service. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Government Management Reform Act, enacted on October 13, 1994,<BR>

<P>limits SES members' annual leave accumulation to 720 hours.  Thus, it<BR>

<P>did not accomplish the NPR recommendation that the accumulation limit<BR>

<P>be 240 hours.  We were advised that neither OPM nor NPR would push<BR>

<P>for further limitations. <BR>

<P>actions have been taken.  The five partially implemented<BR>

<P>recommendations include improving multifamily asset management and<BR>

<P>disposition (HUD02), establishing a new housing production program<BR>

<P>(HUD05), streamlining HUD field operations (HUD06), creating<BR>

<P>incentives for refinancing certain subsidized home mortgages (HUD07),<BR>

<P>and reducing operating subsidies for vacancies (HUD10).  Activity,<BR>

<P>including the introduction of legislation, has been initiated to<BR>

<P>implement the other five recommendations.  Legislation pending before<BR>

<P>Congress would, for example, devolve the control of public housing to<BR>

<P>local public housing authorities (HUD01), authorize demonstration<BR>

<P>programs to promote mixed-income housing (HUD04), and consolidate the<BR>

<P>Section 8 certificate and voucher programs (HUD09).  In addition, HUD<BR>

<P>has taken steps to improve single-family asset management and<BR>

<P>disposition (HUD03) and to modify its process for computing annual<BR>

<P>adjustments to rents for Section 8 projects (HUD08). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>HUD has taken many of its actions in conjunction with its reinvention<BR>

<P>efforts.  Reinvention is HUD's approach for changing the way it does<BR>

<P>business, both at headquarters and in the field, in order to become<BR>

<P>more results-driven and customer-oriented.  As recommended by the<BR>

<P>NPR, HUD has begun to (1) undertake a major reorganization, (2)<BR>

<P>eliminate layers and bureaucracies, and (3) increase the authority<BR>

<P>and responsibility of its offices that work closely with states and<BR>

<P>communities.  However, reinvention goes beyond the scope of the NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendations and includes goals such as reducing homelessness and<BR>

<P>reinvigorating economically distressed communities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      HUD01:  REINVENT PUBLIC<BR>

<P>      HOUSING<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>HUD should create pilot programs to devolve greater authority over<BR>

<P>housing funds to sound local agencies.  It should create<BR>

<P>demonstrations of mixed-income public housing with portable<BR>

<P>subsidies.  HUD should also streamline public housing rules and take<BR>

<P>other steps to improve public housing management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  HUD should establish demonstration projects that dramatically<BR>

<P>devolve control of public housing to local public housing authorities<BR>

<P>(PHA) with histories of sound management, and provide the required<BR>

<P>ongoing operating subsidies subject only to the local PHA's meeting a<BR>

<P>series of performance targets. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  HUD should work closely with local PHAs, their national<BR>

<P>organizations, public housing tenant representatives, and state and<BR>

<P>local government officials to eliminate unnecessary HUD requirements<BR>
and procedures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  HUD should be authorized to target new construction and<BR>

<P>modernization funds to both HUD and locally developed demonstration<BR>

<P>models that seek to provide choices to public housing tenants,<BR>

<P>including the option to use their housing subsidies to move to units<BR>

<P>outside of public housing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  HUD should make a hard-hitting, targeted effort to resolve the<BR>

<P>severe difficulties of those few public housing agencies identified<BR>

<P>as problem PHAs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  HUD should be permitted to authorize sale of public housing units<BR>

<P>with flexible requirements for replacement housing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the creation of pilot programs to allow<BR>

<P>sound housing agencies greater authority over their operations. <BR>

<P>Similarly, mixed-income demonstrations would be a first step toward<BR>

<P>returning the public housing program to its original concept of<BR>

<P>serving mixed-income populations.  Finally, streamlining public<BR>

<P>housing rules should benefit well-managed housing agencies.  However,<BR>

<P>the details on how this initiative would be implemented are critical. <BR>

<P>For example, some of the best-run PHAs are also the largest; because<BR>

<P>they receive a high level of funding, HUD should not altogether cease<BR>

<P>to oversee their operations.  Additionally, many PHAs still have high<BR>

<P>vacancy rates.  Therefore, we have some concerns about how<BR>

<P>implementation would occur. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In its September 1993 report, NPR<BR>

<P>advocated a series of actions to help &quot;reinvent&quot; public housing.  The<BR>

<P>House and Senate versions of the HUD reauthorization bills (H.R. <BR>

<P>3838, Housing and Community Development Act of 1994, and S.  2281,<BR>

<P>Housing Choice and Community Investment Act of 1994) contained<BR>

<P>provisions that, if enacted, would have authorized the Secretary of<BR>

<P>HUD to conduct demonstration projects that would have tested the<BR>

<P>extent to which public housing may be exempt from certain statutory<BR>

<P>requirements (action item 1); eliminated unnecessary HUD requirements<BR>
and procedures (action item 2); targeted new construction and<BR>

<P>modernization funds for public housing to give tenants greater market<BR>

<P>power, including the freedom to move outside of public housing with<BR>

<P>their subsidies (action item 3); provided for revitalizing severely<BR>

<P>distressed public housing that, in some cases, is managed by the most<BR>

<P>troubled housing authorities (action item 4); and authorized the sale<BR>

<P>of public housing with flexible requirements for replacement housing<BR>

<P>(action item 5).  However, neither of these bills has been enacted. <BR>

<P>      ASSET MANAGEMENT AND<BR>

<P>      DISPOSITION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>HUD should use public-private partnerships to manage and sell<BR>

<P>HUD-held loans and real estate for nonsubsidized housing projects. <BR>

<P>Congress should reduce restrictions on HUD's sale of multifamily<BR>

<P>properties, including the use of portable subsidies for tenants when<BR>

<P>the Secretary determines that to be best for tenant needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  HUD should identify those market-rate rental apartment buildings<BR>

<P>and HUD-held loans secured by such apartment buildings as primarily<BR>

<P>financial assets and should maximize the present value financial<BR>

<P>return in disposition. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  For the identified financial assets, HUD should use the best<BR>

<P>practice models of public-private partnerships for management and<BR>

<P>disposition of problem loans and real estate, as opposed to working<BR>

<P>those assets with in-house staff. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Statutory restrictions on HUD disposition of multifamily<BR>

<P>properties held as a result of FHA insurance programs should be<BR>

<P>relaxed; HUD should be authorized to assist affected tenants with<BR>

<P>portable subsidies (as opposed to assistance tied to the project or<BR>
unit) when appropriate. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We continue to support increased flexibility in<BR>

<P>HUD's multifamily asset management and disposition programs,<BR>

<P>including the use of public-private partnerships to manage and sell<BR>

<P>HUD-held loans and real estate for nonsubsidized housing projects. <BR>

<P>We also support the reduction of restrictions on HUD's sale of<BR>

<P>multifamily housing projects and the use of portable subsidies when<BR>

<P>the use of such subsidies is consistent with the government's<BR>

<P>interests and tenants' needs.  In our view, legislative changes that<BR>

<P>give HUD greater flexibility in disposing of properties, enacted as<BR>

<P>part of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of<BR>

<P>1994, are in line with this recommendation.  These changes, when<BR>

<P>implemented, should help HUD improve its multifamily asset management<BR>

<P>and property disposition activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition<BR>

<P>Reform Act of 1994 (P.L.  103-233) authorizes HUD to carry out a<BR>

<P>demonstration program to test the feasibility of restructuring and<BR>

<P>disposing of troubled HUD-held multifamily mortgages through the<BR>

<P>establishment of partnerships with public, private, and nonprofit<BR>

<P>entities.  HUD is currently developing such a demonstration program<BR>

<P>and expects to implement it in October 1994 (action items 1 and 2). <BR>

<P>The act also contains provisions that give HUD greater flexibility in<BR>

<P>disposing of HUD-owned multifamily properties and allow HUD, in<BR>

<P>certain circumstances, to use portable tenant-based subsidies in<BR>

<P>place of project-based subsidies (action item 3).  HUD is developing<BR>

<P>regulations to implement the act's provisions.  HUD has also<BR>

<P>developed a plan for selling the bulk of HUD-held mortgages by the<BR>

<P>end of fiscal year 1996. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>1.  HUD should be authorized to use the Mutual Insurance Fund for any<BR>

<P>cost-effective expenditure needed to maximize the value of the fund,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  HUD should undertake programs designed to mitigate losses. <BR>

<P>
<P>3.  HUD should contract out loan servicing for the single-family<BR>

<P>loans for which it accepts assignment. <BR>

<P>the results of this examination, which it expects to receive in early<BR>

<P>1995, before it can implement action items 1, 2, 3, and 5.  In July<BR>

<P>1994, HUD sold 357 loans to private industry (action item 4). <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>HUD should be authorized to experiment in negotiated restructuring of<BR>

<P>privately owned assisted-housing projects to improve management,<BR>

<P>promote mixed-income housing, and save taxpayer funds. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  On a demonstration basis, HUD should be authorized to conduct<BR>

<P>negotiated restructuring of assisted-housing projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Demonstrations should include allowing project rents to float to<BR>

<P>market rates with tenants receiving their assistance in a portable<BR>

<P>format (like portable Section 8 certificates) to make up the<BR>

<P>difference between tenant contribution and the market rent. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  If, over time, the market value and/or net operating income of<BR>

<P>the project improves because of better management or because of a<BR>

<P>better environment through improved income mix, the owner and manager<BR>

<P>should receive some of the benefit. <BR>

<P>
<P>4.  Each demonstration should be structured so that HUD payments for<BR>

<P>the project, the obligations of the owner, and assistance to tenants<BR>

<P>would continue for at least as long as under contracts outstanding at<BR>

<P>the start of the demonstration. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  HUD should work with IRS to explore ways to deal with competing<BR>

<P>public objectives of the tax code and housing programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  These demonstrations should be real experiments in modified<BR>

<P>approaches to assisted housing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  HUD should seek legislation to shift multifamily projects from<BR>

<P>above-market to market rents while protecting the existing tenants. <BR>

<P>However, we would generally support actions that allow HUD to lower<BR>

<P>rents by restructuring the debt on assisted-housing projects, when<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the portion of this recommendation<BR>

<P>dealing with multifamily housing.  Providing risk-sharing<BR>

<P>arrangements for multifamily housing through FHA (via federal credit<BR>

<P>enhancements) can increase the availability of capital by promoting<BR>

<P>an expanded secondary market for multifamily mortgages, particularly<BR>

<P>mortgages for affordable multifamily housing.  However, we are<BR>

<P>concerned about the portion of the recommendation calling for<BR>

<P>improved access to FHA for first-time homebuyers.  If the intent of<BR>

<P>this part of the recommendation is to let buyers who do not currently<BR>

<P>qualify into the program, the financial condition of the insurance<BR>

<P>fund supporting the program could be undermined. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The portion of this recommendation affecting<BR>

<P>multifamily properties was authorized by the Housing and Community<BR>

<P>Development Act of 1992 (P.L.  102-550).  FHA has entered into<BR>

<P>risk-sharing arrangements for multifamily properties with 19 housing<BR>

<P>finance agencies.  HUD has also signed partnership arrangements to<BR>

<P>share risks with the Federal National Mortgage Association and the<BR>

<P>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.  These actions should help<BR>

<P>stimulate multifamily housing development, in part through a<BR>

<P>broadened secondary market for loans on multifamily properties<BR>

<P>(action items 1 and 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation has been introduced to establish a new FHA program to<BR>

<P>make FHA home mortgage insurance with special terms available to low-<BR>

<P>and moderate-income buyers of single-family homes in both high-cost<BR>

<P>and revitalization areas (action items 3 and 4).  To make<BR>

<P>cost-effective investments in professional financial management, HUD<BR>

<P>has taken steps to obtain professional financial assistance (action<BR>

<P>item 5). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  HUD should participate in the multiple agency field office<BR>

<P>restructuring effort. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Program field staff should report more directly to responsible<BR>

<P>program assistant secretaries. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  HUD should continue to delegate specific grant award<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We continue to support the principle behind this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  Previous GAO studies have reported on problems with<BR>

<P>HUD's organizational structure and resource deployment.  In April<BR>

<P>1994, the Secretary initiated a major reorganization as part of his<BR>

<P>effort to &quot;reinvent&quot; HUD.  This reorganization includes eliminating<BR>

<P>the regional offices and most regional functions to help meet the<BR>

<P>goal of a more result-driven and customer-oriented HUD.  The<BR>

<P>reorganization also gives program assistant secretaries direct line<BR>

<P>authority for program delivery in the new structure.  However, it is<BR>

<P>premature to evaluate the success of the reorganization or even to<BR>

<P>determine whether HUD can be reinvented.  HUD faces many challenges,<BR>

<P>the most basic of which is the need to change an organizational<BR>

<P>culture that has become reactive and defensive. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In April 1994, the Department implemented a<BR>

<P>new reorganization plan, which restructured the field offices along<BR>

<P>single-family and multifamily lines of business, and made the field<BR>

<P>office staff directly accountable to the program office assistant<BR>

<P>secretaries.  The reorganization also eliminated many traditional<BR>

<P>regional review and management oversight functions, and it shifted<BR>

<P>most field authority to state and area offices (action items 1 and<BR>

<P>2).  HUD has also consolidated its operations into 17 program areas<BR>

<P>and is working to meet the NPR employment reduction goals through<BR>

<P>attrition rather than layoffs (action item 5). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In reorganizing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), HUD will<BR>

<P>consolidate centers for processing insurance applications.  In<BR>

<P>addition, the Assistant Secretary for Housing is conducting a study<BR>

<P>of the future of FHA.  He has held four of eight public forums to<BR>

<P>explore how best to reorganize FHA to remove bureaucratic barriers<BR>

<P>and transform it into a more entrepreneurial, mission-driven<BR>

<P>institution (action item 3).  HUD is continuing to delegate specific<BR>
grant award decisionmaking to the states and localities (action item<BR>

<P>4). <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.7.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  HUD should be given flexibility to induce profitable refinancing<BR>

<P>of section 235 program loans by paying whatever contract costs and<BR>

<P>incentive payments to section 235 borrowers may be cost-effective. <BR>

<P>companies. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support efforts to reduce any unnecessary<BR>

<P>interest rate subsidies being paid under this program.  It is not<BR>

<P>clear at this time whether the incentive contracts referred to in<BR>

<P>this recommendation are the best way to accomplish this. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Arising out of the NPR's recommendations, the<BR>

<P>Government Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400) was introduced<BR>

<P>in the House on October 28, 1993.  Section 6002 of this bill would<BR>

<P>give HUD authority to provide incentives to mortgagors to refinance<BR>

<P>mortgages insured under section 235 of the National Housing Act and<BR>

<P>would make funds available for closing costs and other costs incurred<BR>

<P>in connection with such refinancings.  This bill was passed by the<BR>

<P>House on November 23, 1993.  Since then, section 6002 was introduced<BR>

<P>in the Senate as section 1019 of the Government Downsizing,<BR>

<P>Performance, and Accountability Act of 1994 (S.  1843), which was<BR>

<P>added as an amendment to the Community Development Banking and<BR>

<P>Financial Institutions Act of 1993 (S.  1275).  It became Public Law<BR>

<P>103-325 on September 23, 1994 (action item 1).  HUD is also seeking<BR>

<P>owners, not on the more broadly based housing costs index and<BR>

<P>comparability methods. <BR>

<P>
<P>3.  HUD should be given legislative authority to require owners to<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support eliminating unjustified increases in<BR>

<P>annual payments to Section 8 projects.  However, we have no<BR>

<P>that somewhat modify its process for computing annual adjustments to<BR>

<P>rents for Section 8 projects.  This modification, while intended to<BR>

<P>better reflect rental costs, does not follow the changes prescribed<BR>
by the NPR because the regulations are formula-based.  No legislation<BR>

<P>has been enacted that would address the NPR action items on<BR>

<P>discontinuing the use of comparability studies (action item 1),<BR>

<P>basing rental rate increases on actual increases in costs to owners<BR>

<P>(action item 2), and requiring owners to document and justify all<BR>

<P>      SUBSIDIES FOR VACANCIES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 11:2.10<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation would encourage public housing agencies to make<BR>

<P>better use of their assets by reducing subsidies paid for<BR>

<P>unjustifiably vacant units. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.10.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  HUD should establish an Agency goal of achieving an average<BR>

<P>97-percent occupancy rate in units owned and managed by public and<BR>

<P>Indian housing authorities, by the end of fiscal year 1999. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  HUD should reduce annual operating subsidies to PHAs and Indian<BR>

<P>Housing Authorities (IHA) with consistently high vacancy rates<BR>

<P>possibly by reducing the per-unit subsidy for vacant units to 50<BR>

<P>percent of the subsidy level for occupied units. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  HUD should enter into contractual agreements with those PHAs<BR>

<P>receiving reduced subsidies, which should include proposed PHA action<BR>

<P>plans to reduce vacancy rates and measurable performance goals and<BR>

<P>milestones. <BR>

<P>
<P>4.  HUD should restructure its performance funding system formula to<BR>

<P>provide for increasing levels of operating subsidies tied to the<BR>

<P>achievement of occupancy level targets. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the thrust of this recommendation.  In<BR>

<P>fact, HUD currently allocates operating subsidies to public housing<BR>

<P>authorities on a formula basis and has a policy of reducing subsidies<BR>

<P>for public housing authorities with &quot;excess&quot; vacancies.  However, we<BR>

<P>have no information on the extent to which this policy is encouraging<BR>

<P>public housing authorities to make better use of their assets. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 11:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The NPR recommended a series of action items<BR>

<P>to encourage public housing authorities to reduce their vacancies<BR>

<P>through financial incentives and performance measures.  The Housing<BR>

<P>and Community Development Act of 1992, which predates these<BR>

<P>recommendations, gave HUD authority and funding for the Vacancy<BR>

<P>Reduction Program.  Under the regulations that define this program,<BR>

<P>some of the recommended action items have been or are being<BR>

<P>accomplished.  For instance, HUD has established an agency goal of<BR>

<P>achieving an average 97-percent occupancy rate in units owned and<BR>

<P>managed by housing authorities by the end of fiscal year 1999 (action<BR>

<P>item 1).  In addition, each housing authority participating in the<BR>

<P>Vacancy Reduction Program must develop a vacancy reduction plan. <BR>

<P>However, HUD's Vacancy Reduction Program does not provide for, and<BR>

<P>HUD has not addressed, other steps recommended by the NPR that would<BR>

<P>penalize housing authorities with consistently high vacancy rates by<BR>

<P>reducing their annual operating subsidies by lowering the per-unit<BR>

<P>subsidy for vacant units to as little as 50 percent of the subsidy<BR>

<P>for occupied units (action item 2) or reward housing authorities that<BR>

<P>achieve target-level occupancy rates by increasing their operating<BR>

<P>subsidy levels (action item 4).  A basis for taking these steps might<BR>

<P>be developed after the completion of an ongoing study requested by<BR>

<P>Congress and funded by HUD.  HUD is implementing action item 3 with<BR>

<P>PHAs that have consistently high vacancy rates rather than with PHAs<BR>

<P>that receive reduced subsidies because the action to reduce subsidies<BR>

<P>has not yet been taken. <BR>

<P>============================================================ Section 1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 1:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AID has taken action on all recommendations and partially implemented<BR>

<P>three of them.  AID had begun to redefine its mission and priorities<BR>

<P>in the post-Cold War era prior to the National Performance Review. <BR>

<P>AID's efforts to implement several recommendations and many action<BR>

<P>items are tied to an overarching activity--the &quot;Results-Oriented<BR>

<P>Operations Reengineering&quot; plan.  Through this plan, expected to be<BR>

<P>tested by selected missions and offices from fall 1994 through spring<BR>

<P>1995 and implemented beginning October 1995, AID expects to overhaul<BR>

<P>how the agency plans, implements, and evaluates its development<BR>

<P>programs.  Within overall parameters determined by AID headquarters,<BR>

<P>including 4- to 5-year budget projections and expected agencywide<BR>

<P>program directions, AID missions will develop comprehensive country<BR>

<P>strategic performance plans to define strategic program objectives,<BR>

<P>strategies for achieving these objectives, and how progress will be<BR>

<P>measured and reported.  Funding to the field will be by strategic<BR>

<P>program objectives, not by individual projects and activities.  AID<BR>

<P>expects that the new system will (1) focus on customer needs,<BR>

<P>participation, and development results; (2) enable its staff to take<BR>

<P>on greater responsibility and accountability; and (3) use information<BR>

<P>system technologies to better achieve and report on program results. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although AID has been actively pursuing its goals for &quot;reinvention,&quot;<BR>

<P>more time is needed to determine whether these efforts will be<BR>

<P>effective.  AID is still working to improve its system of performance<BR>

<P>indicators that accurately measure the impact of its programs on<BR>

<P>developing countries and the financial and information system<BR>

<P>improvements needed to better monitor and report on the use of<BR>

<P>resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      AID01:  REDEFINE AND FOCUS<BR>

<P>      AID'S MISSION AND PRIORITIES<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 1:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>With the end of the Cold War, AID must rethink how it will operate. <BR>

<P>NPR recommends steps to plan for this new mission and proposes new<BR>

<P>authorizing legislation to define its post-Cold War mission and<BR>

<P>priorities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The AID Administrator should conduct a zero-based, bottom-up<BR>

<P>review of all AID programs and operations, identifying programs and<BR>

<P>operations that (a) do not directly support a clearly defined mission<BR>

<P>of sustainable development, and (b) can be undertaken by other<BR>

<P>assistance providers with a comparative advantage over AID. <BR>

<P>Nonessential and redundant programs should be eliminated. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The administration should seek comprehensive new authorizing<BR>

<P>legislation to replace the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as<BR>

<P>amended. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The AID Administrator should develop a strategic vision of what<BR>

<P>the agency should look like as it enters the 21st century. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The AID Administrator should conduct a comprehensive review of<BR>

<P>all agency directives and other internal and public issuances to<BR>

<P>ensure that they clearly express the agency's mission, priorities,<BR>

<P>and objectives in clear, consistent, and accurate terms. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  GAO strongly agrees that the U.S.  government needs to<BR>

<P>develop a coherent foreign aid policy that redefines our national<BR>

<P>interests and balances objectives with available resources, and we<BR>

<P>have recommended that foreign aid reform begin with the articulation<BR>

<P>of a clear strategic direction for AID.  We have noted that over the<BR>

<P>30 years since its enactment, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 has<BR>

<P>been frequently amended, but neither the foreign assistance goals and<BR>

<P>objectives nor the approaches used for providing this assistance have<BR>

<P>been fully reexamined. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  AID has taken several steps to implement this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  In November 1993, the Clinton Administration<BR>

<P>submitted a discussion draft for authorizing legislation to replace<BR>

<P>the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, which had been widely<BR>

<P>criticized for its myriad of foreign aid objectives, directives, and<BR>

<P>funding earmarks.  This draft surfaced as two bills, H.R.  3765 and<BR>

<P>S.  1856, known as the &quot;Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act of<BR>

<P>1994.&quot; Both bills were introduced in February 1994 and would<BR>

<P>authorize foreign assistance and related expenditures according to<BR>

<P>several overall policy objectives:  promoting sustainable<BR>

<P>development, democracy, and peace; providing humanitarian assistance;<BR>

<P>promoting growth through trade and investment; and advancing<BR>

<P>diplomacy.  Although markup sessions were held, the proposed<BR>

<P>legislation was not enacted by the 103rd Congress, and the 1961 act<BR>

<P>remains as AID's authorizing legislation.  According to one AID<BR>

<P>official, AID will likely resubmit its portion of the bill for action<BR>

<P>by the 104th Congress, but the likelihood that new authorizing<BR>

<P>legislation for foreign assistance will be enacted is unknown at this<BR>

<P>time. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In March 1994, AID reported on its strategies for achieving its<BR>

<P>overall foreign policy goal of sustainable development in four<BR>

<P>program areas--economic growth, health and population, the<BR>

<P>environment, and democracy.  The four program areas are very broad,<BR>

<P>and it remains to be seen whether AID will be able to translate these<BR>

<P>directions into a manageable set of objectives.  A noteworthy example<BR>

<P>of AID's attempt to streamline its mission is its omission of trade<BR>

<P>and investment activities--an area that had received increasing<BR>

<P>program focus at AID during the 1980s.  Trade and investment<BR>

<P>activities are included in the foreign aid program set forth in the<BR>

<P>proposed authorizing legislation but would be funded and administered<BR>

<P>separately from sustainable development programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AID has completed surveys of both its &quot;external customers&quot;<BR>

<P>(essentially the targeted recipients of AID goods and services) and<BR>

<P>its staff to (1) better understand which sectors and delivery<BR>

<P>approaches effectively address host country needs and complement<BR>

<P>other donor efforts and (2) identify ways to streamline its<BR>

<P>processes.  AID's process for preparing the fiscal year 1996 budget<BR>

<P>will be zero-based and take into consideration the results of these<BR>

<P>stakeholder studies.  AID also issued an agency directive in May 1994<BR>

<P>on strategic planning and performance measurement, particularly on<BR>

<P>setting and monitoring program strategies in establishing country<BR>

<P>program strategic plans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its &quot;reengineering&quot; plan, AID is reviewing all of its<BR>

<P>operational systems to determine the improvements needed to deliver<BR>

<P>foreign assistance in ways that assure strict accountability for<BR>

<P>resources yet provide more flexibility and more rapid response to<BR>

<P>changing conditions.  The initial plan for improving operations was<BR>

<P>submitted to the Administrator in October 1994.  Following the<BR>

<P>Administrator's approval of redesigned operations, AID's Bureau for<BR>

<P>Policy and Program Coordination will revise the guidance and<BR>

<P>directives needed to implement new procedures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Funding for AID development assistance programs should be<BR>

<P>appropriated on a 2-year or multiyear basis determined by reference<BR>

<P>to specific assistance needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  AID development assistance funds should be appropriated as part<BR>

<P>of a single account. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Earmarks on AID development assistance appropriations should be<BR>

<P>eliminated or reduced to allow the agency greater flexibility in<BR>

<P>responding to changing assistance needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Statutory reporting and notification requirements should be<BR>

<P>reduced. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The AID Administrator should assure the completion of a<BR>

<P>zero-based review of all internal agency reporting requirements and<BR>

<P>procedural directives; elimination of outdated, unduly burdensome,<BR>

<P>noncost-effective requirements; and establishment of controls over<BR>

<P>the initiation of new requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  AID should develop a results-driven performance measurement<BR>

<P>system capable of documenting expenditures of development assistance<BR>

<P>funds against feasible and measurable performance goals. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have reported on AID's extensive reporting<BR>

<P>requirements and have recommended the elimination of one such<BR>

<P>requirement.  We have also reported on the often divergent views held<BR>

<P>by the legislative and executive branches on the degree of<BR>

<P>flexibility and autonomy AID should have in pursuing specific goals<BR>

<P>and objectives.  While we have not addressed the issue of eliminating<BR>

<P>legislative earmarks, we have suggested that AID could increase<BR>

<P>confidence in its management by establishing a strategic management<BR>

<P>system including accountability and monitoring provisions.  We have<BR>

<P>also reported that Congress and AID have worked together effectively<BR>

<P>when in agreement on a goal, such as the Development Fund for Africa<BR>

<P>created in 1987 to provide a stable source of funding for Africa. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The fiscal year 1994 appropriations<BR>

<P>legislation allowed for 2-year funding commitments (until September<BR>

<P>30, 1995) and some no-year funding, replacing previous requirements<BR>

<P>that most funds be obligated within the fiscal year that funds were<BR>

<P>appropriated.  This act also substantially reduced the number of<BR>

<P>earmarks, and the proposed foreign aid authorizing legislation would<BR>

<P>provide significant flexibility to the executive branch to program<BR>

<P>foreign aid funds according to foreign policy goals.  Reflecting the<BR>

<P>intent of the proposed legislation, AID has defined its mission as<BR>

<P>(1) providing humanitarian relief and (2) promoting sustainable<BR>

<P>development through four broad program areas:  economic growth,<BR>

<P>democratic initiatives, the environment, and health and population. <BR>

<P>The fiscal year 1994 appropriations act and proposed authorizing<BR>

<P>legislation also substantially reduce the number of reporting and<BR>

<P>notification requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its reengineering efforts, AID has taken steps to review<BR>

<P>and eliminate outdated, cumbersome internal requirements and develop<BR>

<P>a results-driven performance management system.  AID's Quality<BR>

<P>Council formed a subcommittee on internal regulations, and bureaus<BR>

<P>are reviewing their own rules and regulations to determine which are<BR>

<P>necessary for sound program management and which are not.  AID's goal<BR>

<P>is to reduce internal requirements by 50 percent, and the agency has<BR>

<P>identified 73 rules which it may be able to eliminate.  However,<BR>

<P>agency management requirements will ultimately be driven by the<BR>

<P>reforms still being developed to respond to other needed changes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Another component of AID's reengineering is the development of<BR>

<P>feasible and measurable performance indicators.  As part of their<BR>

<P>overall comprehensive country strategic performance plan, missions<BR>

<P>will report on program outcomes and results using a &quot;Work Plan&quot; that<BR>

<P>should include a database for recording both planned and achieved<BR>

<P>results.  Also, AID has been developing the Program Performance<BR>

<P>Information System for Strategic Management (PRISM) since 1990.  This<BR>

<P>system is intended to provide a meaningful set of agencywide<BR>

<P>indicators of program performance to be used in monitoring and<BR>

<P>evaluating program results and to provide managers the information<BR>

<P>needed in making program decisions.  Most missions have developed<BR>

<P>strategic objectives and linked these to performance indicators to<BR>

<P>monitor progress, and central bureaus such as the Bureau for Global<BR>

<P>Programs will soon begin developing objectives and indicators. <BR>

<P>However, the system needs further development to ensure that these<BR>

<P>indicators are systematically used for managerial and program<BR>

<P>decisionmaking.  Also, as the reengineering operations plan notes,<BR>

<P>the current system does not have the capability to compare results<BR>

<P>across countries or to aggregate individual country statistics to<BR>

<P>assess global trends. <BR>

<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  AID should operationally integrate all its human resource<BR>

<P>management systems, including Foreign Service National (FSN) and<BR>

<P>Personal Services Contractor (PSC) staffs, as well as Foreign Service<BR>

<P>(FS) and General Schedule (GS) employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  AID should reinvigorate the International Development Intern<BR>

<P>(IDI) Program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  AID should ensure that the lengths of overseas assignments are<BR>

<P>logically related to the nature of the work performed by AID<BR>

<P>personnel. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  AID should ensure that junior officers develop management and<BR>

<P>administrative skills as part of their career development. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  AID should invest in more training in project implementation,<BR>

<P>contract administration, financial management, and foreign language<BR>

<P>proficiency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  AID should encourage rotational assignments in and out of the<BR>

<P>Office of the Inspector General (OIG). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  AID should restructure the performance review and employee<BR>

<P>incentive programs to link individual performance to organizational<BR>

<P>performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  The AID Administrator should enforce the terms of the up-or-out<BR>

<P>regulations and begin reducing the excess senior management at the<BR>

<P>agency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>9.  AID should integrate qualified spouses of overseas couples into<BR>

<P>the assignment process and cultivate them as part of the overseas<BR>

<P>work force. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>10.  AID should initiate an interagency review of FS benefit policies<BR>

<P>among the various agencies using FS employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  GAO strongly agrees that AID lacks adequate work force<BR>

<P>planning and management systems and has reported that AID has not<BR>

<P>restructured its work force to meet the agency's evolution from a<BR>

<P>hands-on implementor to supervising the work of others to carry out<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  AID has taken a number of steps to<BR>

<P>overhaul its personnel system and improve its human resource<BR>

<P>development.  In March 1994, AID submitted a concept paper to<BR>

<P>Congress proposing an integrated personnel system--the USAID<BR>

<P>Development Corps.  This proposal would unify Foreign Service and<BR>

<P>General Schedule personnel into a single service, and integrate all<BR>

<P>other employees into the agency's overall human resources system. <BR>

<P>AID currently has six teams engaged in (1) drafting specific<BR>

<P>legislative proposals outlining basic authorities; (2) developing the<BR>

<P>pay plan and benefits package; (3) developing improved work force<BR>

<P>planning, position management, assignments, and career management<BR>

<P>systems; (4) developing and implementing employee evaluation and<BR>

<P>recognition/awards systems; (5) examining spousal employment as an<BR>

<P>integral part of the system; and (6) defining system parameters and<BR>

<P>conversion provisions, separation rules, and grievance system<BR>

<P>provisions.  AID has begun working on implementing those aspects of<BR>

<P>the unified personnel system that can be implemented without<BR>

<P>legislation, such as an improved work force planning system and staff<BR>

<P>development programs.  Final drafts of legislative proposals are<BR>

<P>tentatively scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1994 and<BR>

<P>submitted to Congress by February 1, 1995.  AID has begun enforcing<BR>

<P>regulations on limited career extensions and is focusing on granting<BR>

<P>extensions based on agency needs only.  The size of the Senior<BR>

<P>Foreign Service is beginning to contract. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AID is developing a new employee evaluation system designed to<BR>

<P>include peer evaluation, greater feedback, separation of the<BR>

<P>promotion process from evaluation, and more focus on accountability<BR>

<P>for meeting organizational goals.  AID began testing the pilot in<BR>

<P>July 1994 and implementation is expected by spring 1995.  Initially<BR>

<P>it will be applied to the Foreign Service only, but AID expects to<BR>

<P>apply it to Civil Service staff when granted such authority by<BR>

<P>Congress. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A staff development strategy is being formulated that will define<BR>

<P>career paths and requisite training through a career management<BR>

<P>system that is to help each employee chart a predictable and<BR>

<P>equitable career strategy from entry-level through retirement.  AID's<BR>

<P>work force diversity plan was approved by the Administrator and<BR>

<P>distributed in April 1994.  It is intended to guide efforts to<BR>

<P>achieve a representative work force profile and establish an active<BR>

<P>program to ensure equal employment opportunity for each employee. <BR>

<P>Recruitment is now being guided by work force planning and diversity<BR>

<P>analyses, and the International Development Intern program is being<BR>

<P>restructured to reduce the average grade and age of new-hires and to<BR>

<P>increase the full-time equivalent years invested in the interns. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AID, with the assistance of a training consultant, is restructuring<BR>

<P>its training program to reflect organizational changes and stress<BR>

<P>certification for key positions, such as program managers,<BR>

<P>contracting officers, controllers, and executive officers. <BR>

<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  AID should vigorously explore opportunities to remove staffing<BR>

<P>restrictions and allocate operating expense salary resources to<BR>

<P>individual managers, rather than budgeting and managing funds<BR>

<P>centrally. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have reported on the increasing number of AID<BR>

<P>programs and projects being implemented through outside parties, such<BR>

<P>as personal services contractors, who often perform the same or<BR>

<P>similar duties as direct-hire employees.  While we have not addressed<BR>

<P>the issue of lifting personnel restrictions, we have recommended that<BR>

<P>AID develop a comprehensive work force planning system to recruit,<BR>

<P>train, and assign both direct- and nondirect-hire staff. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  This recommendation is somewhat<BR>

<P>difficult to implement given that AID's operating funds are<BR>

<P>appropriated separately from its program funds.  Also, the Office of<BR>

<P>Management and Budget (OMB) wields considerable influence over agency<BR>

<P>staffing allocations and personnel restrictions.  AID is exploring<BR>

<P>staffing flexibility through reengineering efforts and unified work<BR>

<P>force proposals such as the &quot;Development Corps,&quot; which, if<BR>

<P>implemented, would provide greater flexibility and encourage mobility<BR>

<P>among bureaus and overseas assignments.  AID has also reduced by 20<BR>

<P>percent the number of personal services contractors since November<BR>

<P>1993 by not renewing contracts for many U.S.  and third-country<BR>

<P>nationals overseas. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We agree that improvements are needed in<BR>

<P>AID's information and financial management systems, but we have not<BR>

<P>specifically studied the merits of an innovation capital fund. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OMB and AID agreed not to ask for a<BR>

<P>separate revolving fund for capital investments.  According to one<BR>

<P>AID official, OMB and congressional appropriations committees<BR>

<P>traditionally have not supported off-budget spending.  AID proposed<BR>

<P>in its fiscal year 1995 budget submission that $18 million be set<BR>

<P>aside in the operating expense account for improvements to its<BR>

<P>information and financial management systems but not as a revolving<BR>

<P>fund.  The Information Systems Plan was funded in fiscal year 1994<BR>

<P>and has been included in the budgets for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. <BR>

<P>This entire project was subjected to a cost-benefit analysis<BR>

<P>conducted by the General Services Administration who, according to<BR>

<P>one AID official, called it &quot;one of the best they had seen.&quot; As part<BR>

<P>of its reengineering efforts, AID has established a team to conduct a<BR>

<P>study to determine the data needed by staff and how such data are<BR>

<P>used and accessed.  This effort will include user reference groups to<BR>

<P>provide feedback on information needs and systems under development. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>With OMB assistance, AID is exploring an alternative to the Army<BR>

<P>Corps of Engineers Financial Management System that will eliminate<BR>

<P>development time through procuring a complete off-the-shelf automated<BR>

<P>financial management system.  This is a near-term effort to improve<BR>

<P>financial management capabilities.  AID initiated development of the<BR>

<P>AID Washington Accounting and Control System (AWACS) in 1990 and the<BR>

<P>agency currently plans to proceed with this system.  GAO plans to<BR>

<P>review the status of AID's financial management system improvement<BR>

<P>efforts during fiscal year 1995. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  AID's &quot;Results-Oriented Operations<BR>

<P>Reengineering&quot; draft plan proposes a new way of carrying out AID's<BR>

<P>work by (1) focusing on end user needs, participation, and<BR>

<P>development results; (2) enabling AID employees to take on greater<BR>

<P>responsibility and accountability; and (3) using information system<BR>

<P>technologies to facilitate AID's evaluation and achievement of<BR>

<P>overall objectives.  The plan includes efforts to link reward and<BR>

<P>incentive systems to performance results, establish systems for<BR>

<P>continuous project review, and strengthen and integrate evaluations<BR>

<P>with agency program planning processes.  Incorporating these concepts<BR>

<P>at the mission level will require mission responsibility for<BR>

<P>preparing a comprehensive strategic performance plan that will have<BR>

<P>three parts:  a strategic definition of the country program, a report<BR>

<P>on program outcomes and results, and an operational resources plan. <BR>

<P>Funds allocation to the field will be based on AID/Washington<BR>

<P>approval of an overall strategy to achieve identified objectives and<BR>

<P>program outcomes.  While individual projects might be identified,<BR>

<P>they are not the object for approval and funds obligation will be by<BR>

<P>strategic objective, not by activity. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The draft plan was circulated for agencywide review and comment and<BR>

<P>was finalized in October 1994.  Although it may change in some<BR>

<P>implementation aspects as it is reviewed, AID expects the fundamental<BR>

<P>concepts to remain unchanged.  In October 1994, AID selected eight<BR>

<P>overseas missions and two offices to pilot different aspects of the<BR>

<P>reengineered approach and to begin training if funds are available. <BR>

<P>The pilot missions and offices are scheduled to complete their<BR>

<P>testing of the plan's approaches by spring 1995.  At that time, the<BR>

<P>reengineering team will analyze the results and refine and submit the<BR>

<P>plan for final approval.  AID expects to begin implementing the<BR>

<P>reengineering plan by October 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly agree that AID resources are spread<BR>

<P>among too many countries to be effective, with programs at some<BR>

<P>missions so diffuse that they have had little impact, and we have<BR>

<P>noted that some recipient countries may soon be candidates for<BR>

<P>&quot;graduation.&quot; However, we have not addressed the issue of regional<BR>

<P>missions nor identified specific missions for closure. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 1:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  AID plans to close 21 overseas missions and<BR>

<P>offices and expects the closeouts to be completed by the end of<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1996.  These generally included countries determined to<BR>

<P>have (1) &quot;graduated&quot; from the need for AID assistance or a close AID<BR>

<P>presence or (2) not promoted the basic political and economic reforms<BR>

<P>considered essential for aid to be effective.  Five missions were<BR>

<P>closed in fiscal year 1994, 10 are scheduled for closure in fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1995, and 6 are to be closed in fiscal year 1996.  Almost all<BR>

<P>plans for closing out missions have been approved by AID/Washington. <BR>

<P>The exception is the Regional Development Office for the Caribbean in<BR>

<P>Barbados due to the changing events in Haiti and Cuba and the<BR>

<P>consequent need for a U.S.  aid presence in the Caribbean.  According<BR>

<P>to an AID official, it is still very likely that this office will<BR>

<P>close in fiscal year 1996 but that certain programs considered<BR>

<P>important to U.S.  interests will be administered from Washington or<BR>

<P>elsewhere in the region.  While the announcement of closing 21<BR>

<P>missions is a positive step toward streamlining AID's overseas<BR>

<P>presence, AID's presence in Central and Eastern Europe and the former<BR>

<P>Soviet Union has increased in the past several years.  For example,<BR>

<P>as of early 1994, AID had 39 permanent employees at four regional<BR>

<P>missions in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Armenia. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In March 1994, AID requested that missions review their programs for<BR>

<P>additional graduations and replies were due in July 1994.  The Bureau<BR>

<P>for Policy and Program Coordination is analyzing the replies and will<BR>

<P>prepare a final report on how AID could proceed to phase out certain<BR>

<P>programs.  Essentially, plans for &quot;graduation&quot; are to be built into<BR>

<P>the new country level strategic planning process, and missions are to<BR>

<P>project end-dates for assistance based on measurable indicators and<BR>

<P>the assumption that AID programs as well as external factors proceed<BR>

<P>as planned. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>AID's general guidance for field presence is to operate in three<BR>

<P>types of countries:  (1) those in which AID can provide an integrated<BR>

<P>package of sustainable development assistance with clearly defined<BR>

<P>program objectives and performance targets; (2) transitional<BR>

<P>countries that have recently experienced national crisis, a<BR>

<P>significant political transition, or a natural disaster; and (3)<BR>

<P>countries in which AID's presence is limited and may operate from a<BR>

<P>central or regional base, but where aid to nongovernmental sectors<BR>

<P>may facilitate the emergence of a civic society, help alleviate<BR>

<P>repression, meet basic humanitarian needs, enhance food security, or<BR>

<P>address a problem with regional or global implications. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its &quot;rightsizing&quot; efforts, AID is reducing the size of its<BR>

<P>Regional Economic Development and Support Offices in East and West<BR>

<P>Africa.  AID is considering additional regional consolidations and<BR>

<P>closures, and expects a &quot;second round&quot; to be announced next year. <BR>

<P>AID is also developing a &quot;core&quot; mission model to assist in deciding<BR>

<P>how future overseas posts should look.  AID and the State Department<BR>

<P>are also studying the merits of consolidating the administrative<BR>

<P>functions of the various U.S.  agencies represented at posts and<BR>

<P>expect to report to Congress by November 1994 on consolidating those<BR>

<P>services that are feasible.  Final plans are to be implemented by<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1996.  AID, the State Department, and the U.S. <BR>

<P>Information Agency are working with the General Services<BR>

<P>Administration to identify a single travel agent to serve these<BR>

<P>foreign affairs agencies.  These agencies are also reviewing the<BR>

<P>possibility of using one contractor for storage of household goods. <BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 3:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Commerce has made considerable progress in its<BR>

<P>implementation of the NPR recommendations, although none of the<BR>

<P>recommendations was fully implemented.  NPR's view that Commerce is a<BR>

<P>&quot;holding company&quot; composed of 13 vastly different operating units,<BR>

<P>each pursuing disparate missions, is consistent with our observations<BR>

<P>of Commerce activities in prior work such as our transition series<BR>

<P>report on Commerce Issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We support the thrust of the NPR Commerce recommendations, including<BR>

<P>better coordination across government in shared program<BR>

<P>responsibility, improved customer service through technology<BR>

<P>advancement, and enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in operations. <BR>

<P>We continue to support these reinvention principles. <BR>

<P>      PROMOTION<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 3:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation is designed to improve federal services to U.S. <BR>

<P>businesses competing in the world export markets. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have advocated improved federal trade promotion efforts. <BR>

<P>In a January 1992 report, we recommended that the Secretary of<BR>

<P>Commerce, as Chair of the the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee<BR>

<P>(TPCC), the interagency committee that oversees federal export<BR>

<P>promotion efforts, work with other TPCC member agencies and the<BR>

<P>Director of the Office of Management and Budget to (1) develop a<BR>

<P>governmentwide strategic plan for carrying out federal export<BR>

<P>promotion programs and (2) ensure that the budget requests for these<BR>

<P>programs are consistent with their relative strategic importance. <BR>

<P>This recommendation was incorporated into law in October 1992. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Title II of the Export Enhancement Act of<BR>

<P>1992 requires TPCC to issue annually a report containing a<BR>

<P>governmentwide strategic plan for federal export promotion efforts<BR>

<P>and describing its implementation.  The act requires that the plan,<BR>

<P>among other things, establish priorities for federal export<BR>

<P>promotion, include a strategy for bringing federal export promotion<BR>

<P>activities into line with the new priorities and for improving their<BR>

<P>coordination, and propose a unified budget for federal trade<BR>

<P>promotion programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>TPCC issued its first report to Congress, Towards a National Export<BR>

<P>Strategy, on September 29, 1993.  It recommended numerous<BR>

<P>improvements to federal export promotion programs, and pledged to<BR>

<P>establish the governmentwide priorities and develop a unified export<BR>

<P>promotion budget within the context of the fiscal year 1995 budget<BR>

<P>request. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since the September 1993 plan was issued, TPCC has implemented a<BR>

<P>number of actions to improve coordination of export promotion<BR>

<P>programs.  For example, TPCC is creating a nationwide network of<BR>

<P>Export Assistance Centers that consolidate the delivery of export<BR>

<P>promotion services in the field.  However, little progress has been<BR>

<P>made in refocusing export promotion efforts.  Governmentwide export<BR>

<P>promotion priorities have not been established and a unified export<BR>

<P>promotion budget request was not incorporated in the fiscal year 1995<BR>

<P>budget request. <BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 3:2.3<BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We believe that changes in the federal export control system<BR>

<P>can be beneficial if balanced against national security concerns. <BR>

<P>Our reports over the last few years have dealt with improving various<BR>

<P>aspects of export control programs in the context of the need to<BR>

<P>balance the goals of U.S.  competitiveness with protecting national<BR>

<P>security. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Commerce is working with other<BR>

<P>agencies to reform and streamline the export control system. <BR>

<P>Regulations are being rewritten, jurisdictional disputes are being<BR>

<P>addressed, export control lists continue to be reviewed, and efforts<BR>

<P>have been made to improve other agencies' access to licensing data. <BR>

<P>However, a number of these actions are not yet complete, and<BR>

<P>legislation to reauthorize the Export Administration Act has not yet<BR>

<P>been passed. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have not specifically assessed the need to<BR>

<P>strengthen the Tourism Policy Council.  However, in concert with<BR>

<P>Commerce's responsibility for promoting tourism, we have advocated<BR>

<P>several changes to tourism programs.  These include coordinating<BR>

<P>among government agencies to speed international airport clearance<BR>

<P>processing and to improve visitor facilitation.  Given the size and<BR>

<P>diversity of the tourism industry, efficient and effective<BR>

<P>coordination of government and private sector activities is a<BR>

<P>prerequisite to successful tourism promotion. <BR>

<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  NPR's recommendation is consistent with the recommendations<BR>

<P>in our August 3, 1994, report on research fleet modernization.  In<BR>

<P>that report, we recommended that in order to ensure that all viable<BR>

<P>and cost-effective options for accomplishing NOAA's program missions<BR>

<P>are considered in making decisions on future fleet modernization, the<BR>

<P>Administrator, NOAA, should (1) ensure that sufficient funding is<BR>

<P>made available to carry out needed efforts to assess the operational<BR>

<P>feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using private sector<BR>

<P>contracting and charter services for vessels to support such mission<BR>

<P>requirements as hydrographic chartering and mapping, (2) continue to<BR>

<P>develop a methodology to assess the results of these efforts, and (3)<BR>

<P>reevaluate the level of vessel chartering in the fleet modernization<BR>

<P>plan in light of the results of these assessments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 3:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In February 1994, NOAA issued a solicitation<BR>

<P>for a contract to acquire sounding data in western Long Island Sound,<BR>

<P>Vineyard Sound, and Nantucket Sound.  The solicitation represents an<BR>

<P>attempt by NOAA to experiment with a program of public-private<BR>

<P>competition to help fulfill NOAA's minimum number of days at sea,<BR>

<P>which may include NOAA bidding against private contractors in areas<BR>

<P>in which the agency can be competitive.  NOAA expects to award the<BR>

<P>contract in the near future.  This hydrographic survey effort is<BR>

<P>expected to take approximately a year. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To obtain an independent review of its Fleet Replacement and<BR>

<P>Modernization Plan, NOAA contracted with the National Research<BR>

<P>Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences, the National<BR>

<P>Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.  NRC initiated<BR>

<P>its review on December 8, 1993, and issued a final report with<BR>

<P>recommendations in April 1994.  In May 1994, a NOAA committee was<BR>

<P>President signed Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-2, &quot;Convergence<BR>

<P>of U.S.-Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems.&quot;<BR>

<P>The directive requires that the Department of Commerce and Department<BR>

<P>of Defense (DOD) integrate their polar-orbiting environmental<BR>

<P>satellite systems into a single, converged, national system; that<BR>

<P>appropriate aspects of the National Aeronautic and Space<BR>

<P>into the national program; and that administrative responsibility for<BR>

<P>this national program be placed under a tri-agency integrated program<BR>

<P>office (IPO).  Also in May 1994, DOD, DOC, and NASA issued the<BR>

<P>&quot;Implementation Plan for a Converged Polar-Orbiting Environmental<BR>

<P>Satellite System.&quot; A tri-agency team has been established to execute<BR>

<P>Program Office was formally established on October 3, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although section 2001 of H.R.  3400, the &quot;Government Reform and<BR>

<P>Savings Act of 1993,&quot; would have directed DOD, DOC, and NASA to<BR>

<P>propose a single operational polar environmental satellite system,<BR>

<P>this legislation has not been enacted.  Nevertheless, the<BR>

<P>Presidential Decision Directive and tri-agency implementation plan<BR>

<P>achieved the intent of this legislation.  A tri-agency group led by<BR>

<P>NOAA's Office of Policy and Strategic Planning, and including<BR>

<P>legislative specialists from DOD and NASA, has been created to assess<BR>

<P>whether legislation formally establishing the National Polar-Orbiting<BR>

<P>============================================================ Section 6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Actions--in some cases, bold and broadly sweeping actions--have been<BR>

<P>proposed and are being taken to implement all eight NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations affecting DOE.  However, none of these<BR>

<P>recommendations has yet been fully implemented, and success in<BR>

<P>achieving the related savings and other anticipated benefits will<BR>

<P>require time and a continuing commitment of energy and other<BR>

<P>resources from DOE's leadership.  In addition, success in<BR>

<P>implementing some of the recommendations will depend on actions<BR>

<P>outside DOE's control. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The actions that DOE has taken to implement the NPR's recommendations<BR>

<P>for improving the Department's contract management (DOE01 and DOE03)<BR>

<P>are particularly significant.  As we and others have noted, DOE has<BR>

<P>failed in the past to properly manage the contractors that execute<BR>

<P>contracts for the Department valued at over $15 billion per year. <BR>

<P>Since June 1993, when the Secretary of Energy established a Contract<BR>

<P>Reform Team, DOE has been evaluating its contracting practices,<BR>

<P>proposing improvements in these practices, and starting to implement<BR>

<P>the proposed improvements, which directly support NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendations.  In managing its environmental restoration and waste<BR>

<P>management contracts, DOE has taken steps to reduce costs, strengthen<BR>

<P>oversight, and ensure quality and safety.  Likewise, in managing<BR>

<P>contracts at its laboratories and weapons production facilities, it<BR>

<P>has developed and is incorporating criteria and measures of<BR>

<P>performance and has taken steps to control costs.  Overall, these<BR>

<P>contracting reforms are among the most sweeping in DOE's history;<BR>

<P>however, staffing limitations and weaknesses in DOE's information<BR>

<P>system could delay or curtail their implementation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOE has partially implemented the recommendation that it incorporate<BR>

<P>land-use planning in cleaning up its nuclear facilities.  It has<BR>

<P>drafted guidance and begun developing land-use plans at several<BR>

<P>sites, but it cannot adjust the level of cleanup at its sites to<BR>

<P>correspond with planned future uses until Congress has enacted<BR>

<P>proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,<BR>

<P>Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or the Environmental<BR>

<P>Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the adjustments (DOE02). <BR>

<P>Similarly, DOE has taken action and legislation has been introduced<BR>

<P>to implement several other NPR recommendations--to increase federal<BR>

<P>income by refinancing the Bonneville Power Administration's debt<BR>

<P>(DOE04), to strengthen the Federal Energy Management Program (DOE05),<BR>

<P>to redirect the DOE laboratories to post-Cold War priorities (DOE06),<BR>

<P>to allow the private sector to cogenerate power at the DOE<BR>

<P>laboratories (DOE07), and to sell the Alaska Power Administration<BR>

<P>(DOE08)--but action on the pending legislation is required to fully<BR>

<P>implement these recommendations.  Previous legislative proposals to<BR>

<P>redefine the laboratories' missions and to sell the Alaska Power<BR>

<P>Administration have encountered opposition and have not been enacted. <BR>

<P>
<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      DOE01:  IMPROVE<BR>

<P>      ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACT<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR proposes improvements in DOE's environmental cleanup contracts to<BR>

<P>achieve efficiency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOE should introduce competition and innovation in contracting<BR>

<P>for environmental cleanup services. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  DOE should enhance the management of its waste management and<BR>

<P>environmental restoration contracts by providing qualified on-site<BR>

<P>DOE personnel to assume greater environmental project management and<BR>

<P>project design responsibilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  DOE should adopt measures to reduce costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  DOE should build tangible, outcome-oriented performance measures<BR>

<P>into its environmental restoration contracts to ensure objective,<BR>

<P>measurable assessments of contractor performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  For the award of such environmental restoration contracts and the<BR>

<P>disbursement of fees, DOE should put more emphasis upon the<BR>

<P>contractors' record for ensuring worker safety and health. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  To control costs, DOE's waste management and the environmental<BR>

<P>restoration programs should build a reliable methodology for<BR>

<P>estimating costs that is applied uniformly at all Environmental<BR>

<P>Restoration and Waste Management (EM) sites. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  DOE should build capable cost estimating and cost engineering<BR>

<P>teams at each DOE site, who will be able to proficiently determine<BR>

<P>the contractors' scope of work and review cost estimates. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  For those environmental services that are paid for on a<BR>

<P>cost-plus-award or a cost-plus-fixed fee award basis, DOE should<BR>

<P>perform systematic and timely audits on costs incurred by every<BR>

<P>contractor to verify that costs charged are legitimate and<BR>

<P>reimbursable. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>9.  DOE should reevaluate the merits of requiring environmental<BR>

<P>restoration contractors to hire as many of the former management and<BR>

<P>operating contractors' staff, at current salary and benefit levels,<BR>

<P>as they can effectively employ. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>10.  DOE should examine options to increase the ratio of federal<BR>

<P>workers to contract employees to improve management and oversight and<BR>

<P>control costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support improvements in contract management.  We have<BR>

<P>repeatedly criticized DOE for failing to properly manage the vast<BR>

<P>network of contractors that carry out its missions; contracts for<BR>

<P>this work amount to over $15 billion a year.  Contract management<BR>

<P>problems are particularly evident in the EM program, which was<BR>

<P>created in 1989 and has grown to encompass almost one-third of the<BR>

<P>Department's budget.  Although DOE has implemented several strategies<BR>

<P>to increase its control over these cleanup contractors and adopted<BR>

<P>new contracting strategies, numerous problems remain. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOE has begun implementing the<BR>

<P>changes recommended by the DOE Contract Reform Team in its February<BR>

<P>1994 report entitled Making Contracting Work Better and Cost Less. <BR>

<P>For example, after extensive competition, DOE awarded a new contract<BR>

<P>for managing and operating the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,<BR>

<P>which incorporates performance-based features and consolidates the<BR>

<P>current five contracts into one pact (action items 1 and 4).  In July<BR>

<P>1994, DOE also issued a solicitation package for the Rocky Flats<BR>

<P>management and operating contract that included various innovative<BR>

<P>features.  Meanwhile, DOE is continuing to develop performance<BR>

<P>criteria and measures for ensuring that contractors consider workers'<BR>

<P>safety and health (action item 5) and is working to incorporate<BR>

<P>contract reform provisions into existing contracts (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For its environmental restoration contracts, DOE is reviewing the<BR>

<P>roles and responsibilities of headquarters and field staff and has<BR>

<P>prepared a draft plan that looks at the feasibility of replacing<BR>

<P>contract employees with federal employees (action items 2 and 10). <BR>

<P>DOE is also working to increase competition for these contracts and<BR>

<P>has budgeted additional fiscal year 1995 funds for auditing cost-plus<BR>

<P>type contracts (action item 8).  At the contractor level, DOE is<BR>

<P>taking steps to ensure that environmental contractors hire the most<BR>

<P>qualified employees (action item 9).  To control costs, DOE has<BR>

<P>issued a policy requiring consideration of innovative contract<BR>

<P>arrangements, including measures to reduce costs (action item 3),<BR>

<P>developed a standardized cost-quality handbook and performance<BR>

<P>objectives, and allocated additional slots for cost-estimating and<BR>

<P>engineering teams at the field offices (action items 6 and 7). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although implementation is proceeding on all of the action items,<BR>

<P>full implementation, for the most part, is not expected until late<BR>

<P>1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>2.  DOE, federal and state regulators, and other stakeholders should<BR>

<P>work together to address land-use planning at DOE sites while CERCLA<BR>

<P>is being reauthorized. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree with the general direction of the NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendation to conduct land-use planning for DOE's facilities and<BR>

<P>to relate the level of cleanup to expected future uses of the land. <BR>

<P>According to NPR, such an approach can help clarify cleanup<BR>

<P>objectives and improve exposure and risk assessments, resulting in<BR>

<P>better-informed selections of cleanup remedies.  We have also<BR>

<P>emphasized that the Department should acknowledge that some areas of<BR>

<P>the weapons complex may be irreversibly contaminated and may thus<BR>

<P>require long-term institutional control.  In our August 1994 report,<BR>

<P>we noted that if Congress agrees with DOE's and EPA's plans to<BR>

<P>utilize land-use planning, Congress could consider amending the<BR>

<P>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act<BR>

<P>of 1980 (CERCLA) to provide more specific direction about<BR>

<P>incorporating future land uses when determining cleanup levels and<BR>

<P>selecting remedial actions.  We also recommended that the<BR>

<P>Administrator, EPA, provide more detailed guidance for the 5-year<BR>

<P>reviews required by CERCLA for sites not returned to unrestricted<BR>

<P>use, and communicate this guidance to DOE.  We recommended that the<BR>

<P>guidance (1) specify that such reviews address whether land-use<BR>

<P>patterns are changing or likely to change in the near future and (2)<BR>

<P>discuss responsibilities for maintaining land-use restrictions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Legislation (H.R.  3800 and S.  1834) to<BR>

<P>amend CERCLA was introduced but never enacted by the 103rd Congress. <BR>

<P>Supported by the administration, this legislation would have<BR>

<P>specifically authorizied the consideration of land use in cleanups<BR>

<P>and the use of community working groups to recommend future land uses<BR>

<P>(action items 1 and 2).  EPA is seeking congressional direction and<BR>

<P>clarification on how it could consider land use in selecting remedies<BR>

<P>and setting cleanup levels.  Meanwhile, DOE has decided to develop<BR>

<P>land-use plans as part of its cleanup efforts.  The Assistant<BR>

<P>Secretary for Environmental Management has set a goal of establishing<BR>

<P>future use recommendations for DOE's sites by the end of 1995.  In<BR>

<P>January 1994, DOE issued final draft guidance for identifying future<BR>

<P>land uses.  One DOE site has completed a future land-use report, and<BR>

<P>several other sites are beginning to work with citizens and other<BR>

<P>stakeholders to develop land-use plans (action item 2).  However, DOE<BR>

<P>cannot adjust its level of cleanup without EPA's approval or<BR>

<P>legislative clarification (action item 3). <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  In our view, contractors should be held liable for improper<BR>

<P>performance and accountable for improper behavior.  However, as noted<BR>

<P>in our December 1992 report entitled Department of Energy Contract<BR>

<P>Management, the needed changes will take both time and commitment. <BR>

<P>As a positive step, the Secretary of Energy, in June 1993,<BR>

<P>established a special Contract Reform Team to, among other things,<BR>

<P>develop a framework of performance measurements and incentives for<BR>

<P>use in DOE's management and operating contracts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In February 1994, DOE's Contract<BR>

<P>Reform Team issued a report identifying corrective actions that<BR>

<P>directly support the action items recommended by the NPR.  DOE has<BR>

<P>formed task teams, including representatives from across the<BR>

<P>Department, to implement each corrective action.  Many of these<BR>

<P>actions focus on developing objective performance criteria and<BR>

<P>measures and switching to performance-based contracts for operating<BR>

<P>the various DOE facilities (action item 1).  Although DOE is still<BR>

<P>developing these performance measures, it incorporated some of them<BR>

<P>in the contract that it awarded for managing the Idaho National<BR>

<P>Engineering Laboratory--the first contract awarded since the reform<BR>

<P>effort began.  DOE is also endeavoring to use more competition in<BR>

<P>selecting contractors (action item 2), substitute fixed-price<BR>

<P>contracts for the cost-reimbursable contracts that it used almost<BR>

<P>exclusively in the past (action item 4), and improve its financial<BR>

<P>management system (action item 5).  The impact of these various<BR>

<P>actions on the authority of DOE's field managers is not yet clear<BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Secretary should encourage PMAs in the Southeast, Southwest,<BR>

<P>western areas, and Bonneville to be more aggressive in promoting<BR>

<P>energy conservation programs with their subscriber utilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Secretary should establish a new rate policy for PMAs in the<BR>

<P>Southeast, Southwest, western areas, and Bonneville. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Congress should remove the Energy and Water Development<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Disagree.  Although we agree that the PMAs should be allowed to<BR>

<P>recover a larger portion of their operating costs, we disagree that<BR>

<P>the actions, as proposed, will increase federal income.  The proposed<BR>

<P>debt restructuring, in our opinion, would merely exchange an old<BR>

<P>Treasury debt for a new Treasury debt and therefore would not<BR>

<P>increase federal receipts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Three bills introduced in Congress,<BR>

<P>the Government Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400), the<BR>

<P>Department of Energy Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (S.  1638), and<BR>

<P>the Bonneville Power Administration Refinancing Act (S.  2332), focus<BR>

<P>on the concept of restructuring debt.  Debt restructuring has been<BR>

<P>selected by the administration as an alternative to encouraging<BR>

<P>energy conservation programs (action item 1) or to establishing new<BR>

<P>rate policies (action item 2).  H.R.  3400, which the House approved<BR>

<P>in November 1993 and referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental<BR>

<P>Affairs, would require the administrators of the PMAs to study<BR>

<P>refinancing options.  S.  1638 would require the administrators of<BR>

<P>the PMAs, among other things, to repay their federal debt, and S. <BR>

<P>2332 would require the Bonneville Power Administration to refinance<BR>

<P>its appropriated debt.  Reforming the rate policy was not addressed<BR>

<P>in any of these bills (action item 2).  None of these bills was<BR>

<P>passed by the 103rd Congress.  Although congressional action would be<BR>

<P>necessary to remove the prohibition against conducting studies of<BR>

<P>market rates for PMAs, a proposal to remove this prohibition was not<BR>

<P>included in the pending legislation (action item 3). <BR>

<P>energy management by DOE and other federal agencies and increased<BR>

<P>funding for federal energy conservation efforts.  Funding options<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:2.6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation provides guidance for use of DOE energy labs,<BR>

<P>focusing on defining new missions, consolidating or eliminating<BR>

<P>unneeded facilities, and making their services of greater benefit in<BR>

<P>the post-Cold War era. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOE should continue to support the reduction of funding for<BR>

<P>nuclear weapons production, research, testing programs, and<BR>

<P>infrastructure that are not needed to meet current defense<BR>

<P>requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Secretary should develop a vision and mission for the total<BR>

<P>DOE laboratory complex.  The Secretary should then review the mission<BR>

<P>and facilities of DOE laboratories, weapons production facilities,<BR>

<P>and testing sites and recommend the phased consolidation or closure<BR>

<P>of obsolete or redundant facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Secretary should convene a group to design and implement<BR>

<P>mechanisms for identifying intellectual assets, test facilities, and<BR>

<P>research capabilities at national labs that can be useful to other<BR>

<P>government agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Once DOE has established a fair &quot;pricing&quot; process, it should<BR>

<P>encourage laboratory managers to bid on federal contracts and to<BR>

<P>apply for government grants that could utilize their unique technical<BR>

<P>capabilities without competing directly with the existing<BR>

<P>capabilities of private industry. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Laboratory managers should also be encouraged to work more<BR>

<P>closely with the private sector on high-priority R&amp;D needs and to bid<BR>

<P>for contract or cooperative work on such projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  DOE, the contractors who manage the laboratories, and laboratory<BR>

<P>managers should work to make access to the laboratories' resources<BR>

<P>more accessible to the private sector, removing unnecessary layers of<BR>

<P>approval for cooperative R&amp;D agreements and contract work-for-others,<BR>

<P>and taking other steps to simplify and speed up the process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that the mission of the national laboratories needs<BR>

<P>to be redefined.  These laboratories--and particularly the three<BR>

<P>defense laboratories--represent a significant national resource that<BR>

<P>may be redirected toward important national priorities outside of<BR>

<P>their traditional defense mission.  Our ongoing work suggests that<BR>

<P>strong government leadership is needed to redefine the laboratories'<BR>

<P>missions and provide the kind of managerial tools necessary to ensure<BR>

<P>a successful transition to new mission areas, such as competitiveness<BR>

<P>and environmental technologies.  These are the areas in which experts<BR>

<P>believe the greatest contributions can be made.  In the past, several<BR>

<P>government task forces have been charged with examining the mission<BR>

<P>of the national laboratories and developing appropriate<BR>

<P>recommendations for change, but little has occurred.  The<BR>

<P>laboratories are very powerful, have strong constituencies and<BR>

<P>independent power bases, and are already redefining their own<BR>

<P>missions in the absence of stronger DOE leadership. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also agree that opportunities exist for consolidating certain<BR>

<P>weapons facilities and for sharpening the laboratories' defense<BR>

<P>mission in light of changing military priorities.  For example, the<BR>

<P>laboratories still have an important role to play in improving the<BR>

<P>safety of weapons. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In February 1994, the Secretary of<BR>

<P>Energy created the Advisory Board Task Force on Alternative Futures<BR>

<P>for the Department of Energy National Laboratories to examine the<BR>

<P>changing roles and missions of the national laboratories and to make<BR>

<P>specific recommendations for redirecting their considerable resources<BR>

<P>and talents to important national priorities.  Part of the task<BR>

<P>force's charge is to analyze alternative scenarios for the<BR>

<P>laboratories, including restructuring and/or closing parts of the<BR>

<P>laboratory system (action items 1, 2, and 3).  The task force is<BR>

<P>scheduled to report the results of its work in February 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, the defense laboratories, facing declines in their nuclear<BR>

<P>weapons budgets, have aggressively sought partnerships with other<BR>

<P>federal agencies (action item 4) and with private industry (action<BR>

<P>      PRIVATE POWER COGENERATION<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:2.7<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This would allow the private sector to cogenerate power at DOE labs<BR>

<P>as a means of saving money.  DOD has similar authority at this time. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.7.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation should be enacted to amend section 804(2)(B) of title<BR>

<P>VIII, the Shared Energy Savings amendment of the National Energy<BR>

<P>Conservation Policy Act, to remove the restriction that limits the<BR>

<P>sale or use of cogenerated electricity to federally owned facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not specifically made a<BR>

<P>recommendation on this issue, we generally support the idea of using<BR>

<P>fuel-efficient cogeneration technology where feasible.  The benefits<BR>

<P>of using this technology were recognized by Congress as early as 1978<BR>

<P>with passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act, which<BR>

<P>required electric utilities to purchase energy from cogenerators and<BR>

<P>other power producers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Three bills were introduced in the<BR>

<P>103rd Congress:  the Government Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (H.R. <BR>

<P>3400), the Department of Energy Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (S. <BR>

<P>1638), and the Government Downsizing, Performance, and Accountability<BR>

<P>Act of 1994 (S.  1843).  All of these bills proposed amending the<BR>

<P>National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) to remove the<BR>

<P>restriction that limits the sale or use of cogenerated electricity to<BR>

<P>federally owned facilities.  The Senate Committee on Energy and<BR>

<P>Natural Resources held a hearing on S.  1638 in November 1993.  In<BR>

<P>addition, the Federal Cogeneration Act of 1993 (H.R.  3371) would<BR>

<P>have permitted off-site electricity sales, although it did not<BR>

<P>propose amending NECPA.  None of these bills was passed by the 103rd<BR>

<P>Congress. <BR>

<P>      DOE08:  SUPPORT THE SALE OF<BR>

<P>      ADMINISTRATION<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 6:2.8<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The federal government should divest its interests in the Alaska<BR>

<P>Power Administration. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.8.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation should be enacted that is the same as, or similar to,<BR>

<P>H.R.  5516 from the 102nd Congress authorizing the sale of the two<BR>

<P>Alaska Power Administration projects in accordance with the<BR>

<P>previously negotiated purchase agreements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the concept of such a sale, provided the<BR>

<P>terms and conditions of the sale carefully balance the interests of<BR>

<P>the Alaska Power Administration's (APA) existing ratepayers and of<BR>

<P>taxpayers.  However, we have continuing concerns, as we noted in our<BR>

<P>February 1990 report entitled Federal Electric Power:  Views on the<BR>

<P>Sale of Alaska Power Administration Hydropower Assets, about the<BR>

<P>terms and conditions of the sale as proposed.  Specifically, while<BR>

<P>the selling price will likely facilitate the sale and minimize the<BR>

<P>impact of the sale on APA ratepayers, it will not likely reflect the<BR>

<P>fair market value of the assets and will not recover all federal<BR>

<P>costs associated with the project. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 6:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOE has been working since 1986 to<BR>

<P>facilitate the sale of the APA.  Four bills were introduced in the<BR>

<P>103rd Congress supporting the sale:  the Government Reform and<BR>

<P>Savings Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400); the Department of Energy Reform and<BR>

<P>Savings Act of 1993 (S.  1638); the Government Downsizing,<BR>

<P>Performance, and Accountability Act of 1994 (S.  1843); and the<BR>

<P>Alaska Power Administration Sale Authorization Act (S.  2383).  The<BR>

<P>House approved H.R.  3400 on November 22, 1993, and referred it to<BR>

<P>the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.  The Senate Committee<BR>

<P>on Energy and Natural Resources approved S.  2383 on August 12, 1994. <BR>

<P>None of these bills was passed by the 103rd Congress. <BR>
