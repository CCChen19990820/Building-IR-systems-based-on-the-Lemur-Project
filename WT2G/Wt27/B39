Don,<p>Okay.  Let me guess.  We're talking Texas here?  :)<p>You'll be glad to know that Texas is one of the Top 10<br>states in the US in which to homeschool.  Homeschools are<br>legally considered private schools and the state has no<br>jurisdiction over private schools.  In Texas there isn't <br>even a registration or reporting procedure.<p>So, what to do?  Your daughter does *not* have to go back<br>to that school tomorrow.  You may contact the school <br>(in writing) that she will no longer be enrolled in their<br>school.  That's it.<p>Next, get all your ducks in a row, so to speak.  You may use<br>a "canned curriculum" like Seton.  I'm assuming here that<br>you are Catholic -- otherwise you wouldn't be asking about<br>this Catholic program.  This will run you about $450 for the<br>year.  There are five other "canned" Catholic programs, some of<br>which are less expensive.  There are also secular and non-Catholic <br>Christian programs available, too.  The prices run the gambit of <br>low to high.  A truism in the homeschool marketplace -- "Just because<br>it's expensive doesn't mean it's the best."<p>Since you live in Texas where the only requirements for home learning<br>are good citizenship, math, reading, spelling and grammar, you may<br>integrate these subjects plus electives of your daughter's choosing any<br>way you see fit.

: Barbara,

: Sure!  Compulsory ed. age in WY is from age 7 (before Sept. 15)
: until the age of 16 or graduation from the 8th grade.

: Parents must annually submit their curriculum to the local board of
: trustees proving that a &quot;basic academic educational program&quot; is being 
: taught.  This includes the required subjects reading, writing, math, 
: civics, history, literature, and science.

: Not submitting a curriculum means you are automatically guilty of failure
: to comply with the laws.

: Parents may teach their own children only.

: There are no parent teacher qualifications and no standardized testing is 
: required.

: As an alternative, you may use a religious &quot;umbrella&quot; program and you
: would then be exempt from all of the above requirements because the state
: does not have the authority to manage or regulate parochial or church schools.

: That's it.  Hope it helps.

I'm a little confused.  Is compulsory education still from 7-17?  What about the mandatory Kindergarten I keep hearing about?  Also, one church-related school says that we don't have to test because we are actually satellites of the school.  They say we are then not home school but church-related schools with a very small student body.  Which is correct?  I thought you had to test every year with a church-related umbrella school.  What's the legal difference?<br>Mimi

: : PS  Thanks so much for your help.  We want o be as 'up and up' as possible under that law, and that description of a satellite school thing didn't sound right.  I'm so glad there was someone I could ask!

: PPS  This &quot;school&quot; is run by their Grandma.  Does this make a difference?

Mimi,<p>It could make a difference that your children's grandmother<br>is running the preschool only in that it would make it easier<br>to check on whether your mother/mother-in-law has ever submitted<br>their names and address to the state, registering them as pupils<br>in her program.

Hi.  I"m wondering if any other MN parents frequent this?  I was working closely with my son's teachers, until I had a problem.  Now, I'm getting flack because "We never knew about your homeschooling"  !!!  Any advice for dealing with flack?  With correcting agression problems from Public school?  Resources for Learning Disabled children?  I'm glad I found a resource!  Thank YOU!

<br>:   Resources for Learning Disabled children?  <p>Dear Shannon,<p>Kathy will undoubtedly be along soon with answers to some of your other questions, but recently I came upon a resource called LD online (http://www.ldonline.org) and thought I'd pass it along.  <p>I'm not sure if it is directed more towards LD kids in school or if it offers support to LD kids whether homeschooled *or* publicly schooled. But check it out and if it proves useful, you can let others here know about it.<p>As the Website Administrator of Kaleidoscapes, I had considered starting a discussion board for parents of special needs kids, but am in the process of moving the site in January -- so it will probably be February, at the earliest, before  new boards get started at Kaleidoscapes.

: Kathy will undoubtedly be along soon with answers to some of your other questions, but recently I came upon a resource called LD online (http://www.ldonline.org) and thought I'd pass it along.  

: I'm not sure if it is directed more towards LD kids in school or if it offers support to LD kids whether homeschooled *or* publicly schooled. But check it out and if it proves useful, you can let others here know about it.

: As the Website Administrator of Kaleidoscapes, I had considered starting a discussion board for parents of special needs kids, but am in the process of moving the site in January -- so it will probably be February, at the earliest, before  new boards get started at Kaleidoscapes.  Plus, I'll have to find hosts before any other boards can be scheduled.

: Glad you found us and it's great to have you here!! :)

This would entail keeping samples of your<br>child's work throughout the year.  It is usually best to keep <br>materials from the beginning of the year and the end of the year to<br>demonstrate clear "progress" that has been made.  The teacher will<br>then have to write a report that your child is making academic progress<br>in accordance **with the child's abilities.**<p>Yes, I always take private emails.

Well, the laws aren't great, but the homeschoolers <br>are very highly organized and very visible.<p>Compulsory ed ages are 7 - 17 years.  You may homeschool<br>only your own child.  You will have to file a notice of<br>intent by Aug. 1 each year or be subject to a $20 per week<br>fine.  This doesn't count if you move into the state after<br>that date.  The notice must include the name, age, and grade of<br>each child, the location of your homeschool, the curriculum<br>to be offered (there aren't any required subjects in K-8), and<br>the proposed hours of instruction (which must be four hours per<br>day), and the qualifications of the parents.  For high school level,<br>this notice must also include whether a child is pursuing a college<br>prep or general course of education and a description of the courses.<br>You will need to maintain attendance records which are open for<br>inspection. These will need to be submitted at the end of the school<br>year to the superintendent.

: Hello!<br>: Please tell me about Tennessee.  We might be moving there.  What can I expect?  Is it a homeschool-friendly state?  What are the laws?<br>: Thank you!<br>Hi!  I'm from Tennessee, and there are a lot of homeschoolers here, and lots of support groups.  Where are you moving to?  We are near Nashville.  You can use snail mail to write:  Home Education Association of TN,  3677 Richbriar Ct., Nashville, TN   37211.  The only problem that usually arises occurs if you are trying to homeschool a  highschooler and you don't have a bachelor's degree, or if you don't have a high school diploma.  Those are not insurmountable, however.  Mimi<p>

: : Hello!
: : Please tell me about Tennessee.  We might be moving there.  What can I expect?  Is it a homeschool-friendly state?  What are the laws?
: : Thank you!
: Hi!  I'm from Tennessee, and there are a lot of homeschoolers here, and lots of support groups.  Where are you moving to?  We are near Nashville.  You can use snail mail to write:  Home Education Association of TN,  3677 Richbriar Ct., Nashville, TN   37211.  The only problem that usually arises occurs if you are trying to homeschool a  highschooler and you don't have a bachelor's degree, or if you don't have a high school diploma.  Those are not insurmountable, however.  Mimi

Is there a resource for IHIP and quarterly reports that have been accepted in New York?  <p>I'm worn out creating these for my two kids.  I'd like to see what others have used.  I'd like ideas for what others are doing and some evaluation ideas used by others.  <p>Thanks.

We recently moved from Tucson and it's my understanding that Telao used to be called THEN.  So I think the two addresses you gave are the same people.<p>When you call the Superintendents office, they will send you a list of local support groups which is more current than most sources since new groups are started all the time.

Depending on the age of <br>your child, if your child is of high school age, you <br>need to be keeping comprehensive and details records<br>and photos, etc., of all of your child's achievements<br>in various fields:  sports, art, community activities,<br>academics, music, etc.  Colleges are very influenced<br>by a detailed portfolio put together by the parents<br>and the child.

Chad,<p>There are a few legal considerations here.  First,<br>you will need to find out what the legal age for a<br>minor being left home alone in DE is.  Here in NJ, it<br>is age 13.  If your state is similar, then you have<br>no legal problems staying home alone.<p>Next, you will need to know that compulsory education<br>laws in DE are until the age of 16.  What that means<br>is that on your 16th birthday, you will no longer owe<br>the state of DE any explanation on your whereabouts or<br>justify your choices of education.<p>Now, the homeschooling laws in DE are pretty clear cut.<br>You have two options:<p>1.  You can register with your local superintendent of <br>schools.  He/she will have complete authority over what<br>you do and learn and what hoops you will have to jump.<br>There are no written regulations or guidelines in DE<br>concerning what they may require of you.  It's all <br>"to the satisfaction of the superintendent," meaning<br>it's your obligation to make him happy.  It's possible<br>if he/she finds out your parents are working, that he/she<br>will not be "satisfied" and deny your right to homeschool.<br>That's theoretical.  Please hook up with a homeschool<br>support group in your area to find out what *your*<br>district's superintendent's modus operandi is.  He/she<br>will also most certainly require you to take standardized<br>tests. <p>Option 2:  Enroll with a homeschool cover organization<br>that is either in or out of DE.  These schools are<br>extremely varied, from very loose "do-your-own-thing" <br>schools to highly structured with testing, etc., schools.<br>This will be a decision for you and your parents to <br>make.  Check out as many as you can before deciding on one to<br>be sure to find the school that suits you best.<p>Now, as to whether it is prudent to homeschool at home<br>without your parents present, well, that remains to be<br>seen.  If your parents trust your judgment and you<br>work well by yourself and have sufficient internal<br>motivation to get your work done without constant<br>nagging, you should do quite nicely!  My teenage son<br>rarely works with me.  The things he needs help with I<br>can explain to him in 20 to 30 seconds.  (You could<br>call one of your parents at work to ask a question!)<br>As a matter of fact, since I work at night, my son usually<br>has all of his work done before I even get up in the morning.<br>So, yes, I know it can work.

Maybe this is really silly, but I moved from Ohio whre my girls could have started Kindergarden at age 4 (almost 5) because their birthdays (twins) are in September.  Here in Indiana you are required to be 5 by June 1st.  NOW>>>  I plan to home school and use a packaged cirriculum (haven't picked on yet).  QUESTION:  Can I start them at age 4 (almost 5) as they would have in Ohio....or will I run into problems when they graduate (maybe colleges won't recognize them as high school graduates at that age).  I want to try to finish High School by the time the are 16 so they can go to college and take it slow and enjoy it instead of packing in too many classes and my really learning from any of them.

They must inform you that you are not eligible to <br>participate in school-sponsored events, such as gym class or afterschool enrichment.<p>You then outline what curriculum you'll use with your children, whether it is the curriculum the school itself provides<br>or if you use your own. Then, the school board must approve.

She told me just to go through my church.<br>When I told her I wasn't Christian, she told me I really ought to be, it's had such meaning in her life. So much for separation of church and state.<p>But she might have a point, in one way. She said she knew of no homeschooling family which wasn't Christian,that being the principal motivation.<br>Well, I have never met a christian I didn't like, so if there's any Ocean County, NJ group that'll have us despite our religious convictions, I'd be happy to hear about it.<br>

Ev,<p>Well, just goes to show the garbage you'll get from <br>your superintendent's office.

I don't know by heart the requirements in Florida.  Kathleen will be able to help you with that a lot more that I could but I did want to <br>suggest that you should go to your local public library.  When I first decided to homeschool that was my first stop.  They have tons of materials (or at <br>least Orange County did--where I live) on everything from laws to "how to homeschool" books.  If it's not on the shelf, ask.  They can put it on reserve for you most of the time.  If you have any questions you can e-mail me directly as<br>I am in Florida too.<br>~Giovanna~

: I don't know by heart the requirements in Florida.  Kathleen will be able to help you with that a lot more that I could but I did want to 
: suggest that you should go to your local public library.  When I first decided to homeschool that was my first stop.  They have tons of materials (or at 
: least Orange County did--where I live) on everything from laws to &quot;how to homeschool&quot; books.  If it's not on the shelf, ask.  They can put it on reserve for you most of the time.  If you have any questions you can e-mail me directly as
: I am in Florida too.

Does anyone have information on how Goals 2000 passed<br>in Washington State will affect homeschoolers?  Have <br>there been new school to work initiatives that require <br>publics school kids to earn labor certificates in order <br>to be able to work in the future?  Would homeschoolers<br>also be required to earn this certificate under Goals <br>2000?<p>Thanks,  Penny<br>

Posted by Gordie on September 11, 1996 at 16:45:45:<p>
I am interested in developing a Native-American based perspective for the education of my children.  So far, I have not found much that will enable me to move in that direction other than the Native American Religious Freedom Act, and the Freedom of Religion Act.  These may work for your benefit, though I don't have enough info.  Anybody out there that can shed some light?

: Vivian,

: Compulsory ed in Maryland is for children age 5 until 16.  A written request for an
: exemption to delay the start of schooling until age 6 must be submitted to the local 
: superintendent and he *must* grant it within five days.

: MD's homeschool statute is MD Education Code Ann. 7-301(a) which requires parents to 
: send a signed statement of intent at least 15 days *before* starting to homeschool.  
: You must indicate if you are choosing the option of being supervised by the local
: PS superintendent or that your homeschool is being supervised by an approved correspondence 
: school or by a bona fide church school.

: If you select the PS supervision, you will need to maintain a portfolio of your child's
: work.  The local superintendent may review the portfolio up to three times per year 
: (but usually it is twice.)  If the superintendent is not satisfied with your child's 
: portfolio, you will have 30 days to provide evidence that the deficiency is remedied or
: have to stop homeschooling.

: If you select the approved correspondence or church school option, they must supervise
: your homeschool program with pre-enrollment conferences, textbooks and lesson plan review,
: annual visits, and periodic parental conferences.

: There are no teacher qualifications and there is no mandatory standardized testing.

: If you would like to email someone in MD, try writing to Manfred Smith of the Maryland Home
: Educators Association at homebase@erols.com and he will be quite helpful.  Please tell him
: I sent you!

: Let me know if you would like the addresses for some local support groups.

I haven't been able to find very much information about homeschooling in Tennessee. I have found out that we have to have at least 20 hours of documented teaching per week and that the instructors (parents and other relatives) don't have to have a college education if they go through a "religious school". Is there anything else I should know? I would appreciate all the help I can get as we are new at this.

Since you are in Cleveland, TN, the closest local<br>group that I can find is:<p>MidEast THEA<br>385 County Road 783<br>Etowah, TN  37331<br>423-263-7026<p>Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "consultants."<br>For example, I am a professional homeschool consultant.<br>You could use my services in arranging your homeschooling,<br>but unless I was a "church school," (which I'm not) I<br>wouldn't be enough of an umbrella school that is required<br>by law.  Is that what you meant?<br>

: Since you are in Cleveland, TN, the closest local

: MidEast THEA
: 385 County Road 783
: Etowah, TN  37331
: 423-263-7026

: Also, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;consultants.&quot;
: For example, I am a professional homeschool consultant.
: You could use my services in arranging your homeschooling,
: but unless I was a &quot;church school,&quot; (which I'm not) I
: wouldn't be enough of an umbrella school that is required
: by law.  Is that what you meant?

In a nutshell, if you do not have a college degree,<br>you will have to submit a quarterly report on your <br>child's achievements in the required subjects.  If you<br>are a college graduate, you will need to submit an annual<br>instructional calendar showing 170 days of instruction by<br>Oct. 1 of each school year.  Children are tested yearly.<p>To see these laws in detail, visit the MN homepage:<p><br>http://www.mache.org/begin/begin.htm<p>

Thanks for the information.  Massachusetts is actually the most likely place that we will go.  We are from New England, all our family is there, we own a house on Cape Cod, etc.  I'm a little nervous about it, because up until now, I have been able to do whatever I want in our homeschool.  I am pretty concientious, though.  I haven't always kept the best records, but I do keep a log/journal for each child, yearly portfolios, etc.  However, in Massachustts they want you to list ALL the resources that you have, including maps, globes, books, etc.  I hate the idea that they will have to "approve" me.  We are from a small town, though.  I have a feeling that they will probably not have dealt with homeschoolers before.  If I can make a good impression, establish a good relationship, etc., perhaps it will be okay.  It's scary to think that our family lives depend on the whims of the local school system, though.  My daughter went to kindergarten and first grade there.  I liked the teachers, but it often seemed that everyone else I dealt with worked hard to be intimidating, disapproving of parents, etc.  I volunteered in the schools there and that is one of the reasons I decided to homeschool!  <p>Thanks again for the information.  If there is anyone with experience with homeschooling in Massachusetts, I'd like to hear from you.  <p>Deanne

: Dear PA Homeschoolers,
: Here is the letter that I sent to the Steel Valley School officials stating why I was not giving my son an achievement test.

: Natalie J. schowoeble
: Coordinator of Guidance and Pupil Services
: Steel Valley School District and Pupil Services
: E. Oliver Road
: Munhall, PA  15120

: Dear Ms. Schwoeble:

: We received your letter of March 22, 1993 regarding the standardized testing required by the state.

: We use a non-graded curriculum.  A grade level has not been assigned to my son, Charles M. Page, by me or by my evaluators.  If I were required to assign a grade level to my son's work, which is not a current requirement of the Pennsylvania Homeschooling regulations, I would find it difficult since he performs at different levels in different subjects.

: Since Charles is not a third-grader he will not participate in standardized testing for the 1992-93 school year.

: With All Sincerity,
: Barbara Page

I thought the list was<br>interesting.  Thanks for letting me know why NC was<br>excluded.  <p>If we do go back to Massachusetts, I hope to establish a <br>good relationship with the schools.  The area that we lived<br>in had a pretty good school system, as far as that goes.  <br>I also would probably choose to use an umbrella school such<br>as Clonlara, at least for the first year.  <p>Thanks again...  I'd still like to hear from anyone currently<br>homeschooling in Massachusetts.<p>Deanne

: 2.  Parents without a college degree must use a correspondence

: 3.  Parents may provide a curriculum or program of study that
: includes in the judgment of the superintendent the standards
: of learning objectives adopted by the Board of Ed.
: for language arts and math and evidence that the parent
: is able to provide an adequate education.

: There are actually two other options, too:

: 1.  Religious exemption statute.  Parents would need to 
: convince their school board that their child, by reason of a 
: bona fide religious training or belief is conscientiously 
: opposed to attendance at school.  If granted, this would

There is no one answer to your question.  Every state<br>is soooo different in their requirements.  In some<br>states, you must use an umbrella program.  In other<br>states, they couldn't give a hoot what program you are<br>using or not, as long as you file all the paperwork<br>and do all the standardized testing/evaluations, etc.<p><br>

Becky,<p>Hi!  Sorry that you were spooked.  Even in PA, homeschoolers<br>are happily homeschooling!  The problem is that it is such a <br>large state and the regulations are enforced differently from<br>school district to school district.  The laws are exactly the<br>same everywhere; it's the superintendents who choose to interpret<br>them or enforce them or turn a blind eye.  I have a friend in PA<br>who hasn't reported to the state or school district in about six <br>years -- and the superintendent doesn't require her to!<p>But that is very unlikely to happen in most areas of PA.  Most of<br>what I have heard is exactly the opposite.  Having a good rapport<br>is essential.

: Becky,

: Hi!  Sorry that you were spooked.  Even in PA, homeschoolers
: are happily homeschooling!  The problem is that it is such a 
: large state and the regulations are enforced differently from
: school district to school district.  The laws are exactly the
: same everywhere; it's the superintendents who choose to interpret
: them or enforce them or turn a blind eye.  I have a friend in PA
: who hasn't reported to the state or school district in about six 
: years -- and the superintendent doesn't require her to!

: But that is very unlikely to happen in most areas of PA.  Most of
: what I have heard is exactly the opposite.  Having a good rapport
: is essential.  Superintendents or principals may also choose to let
: your children participate in various PS activities.  But there is 
: nothing mandatory that says they must.  

: In addition to your yearly evaluation (that's super that you have a
: friend who qualifies!), you will also have to submit the portfolio of
: your child's work to the superintendent, plus write the education objectives
: at the beginning of the year.  Plus there's the testing for the grades
: 3, 5, and 8 which your friend would probably qualify to give to your child.

: As far as the hours, 900 hours for elementary students and 990 hours for 
: secondary students is required OR (get that -- OR) 180 days of instruction.
: Yes, you will need to keep a log to prove your 180 days of instruction.  This
: will need to be submitted with your yearly portfolio to the superintendent.

: I highly recommend contacting the Pritt Ministry Services (whether you're Christian
: or not -- it doesn't matter) and ordering their Pennsylvania Portfolio Plus Administrative
: Album.  It is quite complete.  It has *everything* you will need: medical forms, affidavits,
: recordkeeping logs, etc.  It costs $27.95 and is worth every penny.
: Their number is 215-536-1650.

: When a law says you must register a child at age 8, that's when you start accounting
: for their education.  Don't worry until then and, no, you don't have to prove anything
: now.  That's one of the really nice things about PA.  Age 8 is the oldest compulsory ed.
: age in the US!  

: As far as your papertrail, some superintendents expect a huge one, some don't even want to see
: one, and some are just expecting some sign of improvement -- for example, have some of your 
: child's papers in math from the beginning of the school year and some from the middle of the

    We live in NY right on the border of PA (just down the road a mile to be exact).  PA is tough--it requires a lot of bookkeeping although somepeople seem to get around that.  I don't think NY is difficult at all.  You do have to send in a letter of intent (I'm going to homeschool these kids etc) and brief reports 4 times a year....and mine are very very brief...no grades very little detail.  I've never been given any trouble and my friends who live upstate have had no trouble either.  As a matter of fact I think NY learned to chill out years ago when they were taken to court several times for harrasment.  THe most challenging part is to keep track of the dates when you are supposed to submit the reports.  I don't use there IHIP form (most of my friends don't either) and I just have to input some comments into my own computer form.<br>  andrea

<br>: Andrea,<p>: It's always interesting to hear how people handle<br>: these regulations.  What do you do about the annual<br>: assessment/testing?

(I have h'schooling friends who think the laws are too EASY!  What planet are they from?)  See my post about getting out of testing in PA.  Since the h'schooling parent is the one who chooses the required evaluator, you still most of the power in what is recorded about your child(ren).

This portfolio must be turned in to the superintendent, but he gives it back.  In the city of Pittsburgh, they tell the h'schoolers to NOT even turn in their portfolios because they don't have the time to look at them.  Then there is the option of not complying with the homeschooling laws here in PA.....(yes I know some people that are doing this...)  I like the compulsory school age of 8-years-old.

She's beginning this year.<br>One question:  If you have already sent in your objectives<br>report and declared a grade level, is it too late to<br>use your technique?  This woman's children have been<br>in the PS for a number of years already and this is<br>going to be their first year.  Will the "I don't use<br>grade levels" work?

Hi, again!  I went back to show my husband the informa-<br>tion on the homeschool laws in Florida and they were <br>gone!  Would you mind stating them again?  And is the <br>atmosphere in the state a friendly one?  Thanks, so <br>much, Kathleen!

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

: I am in my second year of homeschooling our son.  He is currently <br>: using 2nd grade curr. and is 6 y/o.  We are having a rough time<br>: trying to map out US history on pieces of paper and keep everything<br>: straight.  I would really appreciate a source or help.  God Bless!<br>Our timeline is made of brown, or kraft, paper which is sold in a roll.  I cut a large piece of it and drew a heavy colored line down the center lengthwise.  I drew pencil lines at a diagonal upward along the line.  My daughter writes important events in history on these lines as we study them.  Below the line she has listed the historical fiction that she reads about each period.  We also found stickers for each state flag and put those near the date that the colony or territory became a state.  Our local teacher store had a poster of the presidents.  I cut out the pictures and my daughter pasted them near the dates that particular president was in office.  As you can imagine, the timeline runs around the wall in our "school room"  Since it is out in the open, it gets referred to from time to time! We finished American History last year and we are working on ancient civilizations, following the same method.

We are getting ready to start the American Girl at School curriculum.  I also bought the Teacher's Guides for each of the series.  Has anyone else used this?  If so, how did it work out?  My daughter loves the American Girl books, so we hope it will be fun for her.

: gunpowder works, did George Washington really have wooden teeth, recreate some 
: of Benjamin Franklin's experiments, etc.

: I have my book out called &quot;The Timetables of History&quot;.  Here are all the 
: scientific discoveries listed for the years 1774-1778:
: J.G. Gahn isolates manganese 1774
: John Wilkinson's boring mill to facilitate manufacture of cylinders for steam 
: engine 1774
: Pierre-Simon Girard invents water turbine 1775
: James Watt perfects steam engine 1775
: Joseph Priestly discovers hydrochloric and sulfuric acids 1775
: Cook's first voyage to the Pacific 1776
: David Bushell invents torpedo 1777 (I hope he was on our side!)
: Lavoisier discovers oxygen 1777
: James Cook discovers Hawaii 1778
: Smeaton experiments with diving bell 1778

: I hope I helped.

: Any good web pages for this subject.  I want something for my daughter that will grab her interest.  She is 12.  Thanks.  If you have any neat projects to do, fire away!<p><br>There is a great site called "Odyssey in Egypt".  It begins in March or April of next year.  You get daily updates of digs and excavations by the archeologists there.  The kids are given some things to research and report back daily on.  My 13 year old daughter loves Egypt and can hardly stand to wait until this project gets underway.  Right now we are using "Greenleaf's Guide to Ancient Egypt" and any novels that might have to do with Egypt.  I have a lot more info of great books, etc. if you need those.<p>http://www.scriptorium.org/odyssey/<p>Marty B. <br>

Check out the Calgary Herald's contribution to the world of on-line lesson plans.  They also have a section for parents to help them teach their own children (imagine that!) using the newspaper.  Oh...they also state somewhere that it is okay if you use their lesson plans even if you aren't a teacher. (Gee thanks.)  I liked the lesson plan for using the newspaper for teaching pre-reading skills.<br>-Barbara Page

A very important book "The Crusades" by Hilaire Belloc is a must read.

Hi!  There is a series called "Her Story," eight volumes, I think, each set in a different time period of history.  I think the entire series is written by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler.  Hands-On History sells the whole set, but I found them at the library.  They are probably 4th -5th or 6th grade, but my son, who was six, loved them as readalouds.  My daughter, age 10, is the one who found these and read them all before I chose a few to read aloud to them both.  In the library, right next to those books, was another, similar series, written mostly about boys.  I'm pretty sure it was a different series with different authors, but both my children loved these also.  These are shorter books.<p>I'll check my records for the titles of other favorite books.  I am terrible at remembering exact titles.  We read THE DOOR IN THE WALL by Marguerite de Angeli last year, which is set in the Middle Ages.  The children loved it. A book about young Jewish children in Germany before World War II is WHEN HITLER STOLE PINK RABBIT.  I liked this story a lot.  It got the point across without going into gory details or being too scary.  The book starts with the family leaving Germany and it's mostly about how hard it was for them as refugees.  Another, similar book, is called JOURNEY TO AMERICA.  We liked that one as well.  This was about a family escaping before the war and about their trials as refugees in (I think) Switzerland.  If I think of any more, I'll post them.<p>Deanne  <br>

Thanks for the ideas!  We also study history in this way, adding historical fiction also.  We also like to read nonfiction books from the library about specific things that we are interested in. This way we can delve more deeply into something they really want to know about.  For example, my son is interested in ships, in particular the USS Constitution.  He has a favorite book about it at the library that we will probably read again when we get to that period of history.  We don't really try to memorize dates either.

: Thanks for the ideas!  We also study history in this way, adding historical fiction also.  We also like to read nonfiction books from the library about specific things that we are interested in. This way we can delve more deeply into something they really want to know about.  For example, my son is interested in ships, in particular the USS Constitution.  He has a favorite book about it at the library that we will probably read again when we get to that period of history.  We don't really try to memorize dates either.  What I'm aiming for is a general understanding for that period of history (daily lives, how things were different, how they are the same), and understanding and familiarization with the sequence of events, and an understanding of the people and leaders of that time period.

Usbourne makes a build-your-own Viking settlement.  Greenleaf carries this and also a build-your-own Viking ship.  We're planning to use both of these in a few months when we do our Viking unit.  : My history unit studies for next year are Ancient Rome, Vikings and the Middle Ages.  I have plenty of wonderful resources for Rome and The Middle Ages, but could use some resources, ideas and hands-on projects for our unit on Vikings. I am homeschooling a 9 yo boy with a high interest level.: So far I have, Living History series Vikings, Pamela Odjik's The Vikings, Viking Adventure by Clyde Bulla, Landmark series The Vikings, and a biography of Leif Erikson. We are also planning to make a Viking Costume, learn some basic geography related to Viking homelands and explorations, read some : Nordic mythology. Any other suggestions? Internet sites?: Charity

: : Hi!  I am new to the internet and all of this.  I really like this message board.

: : This year, I will be studying U.S. history with my two children, ages 7 and 10 1/2.
: : Does anyone have any ideas of links--or even any searching ideas?  As I said, I am
: : new to all of this and am not sure how to go about it.  So far, most of my searches
: : have been too broad and I'm not sure how to narrow it down.  When I try to narrow the
: : search as I would at the library, it seems to get broader.  (For instance when searching
: : &quot;North Carolina&quot; I get lots of matches with just the word &quot;North.&quot;)

: : I'd also be interested in any ideas for resources, as well as hearing from anyone who
: : has done a unit on U.S. history and has ideas for activities or projects, etc. 

: : Thanks!

: Has anybody used this curriculum?  The results look impressive,but is it <br>: user friendly for a home education? Thanks, Joyce<p>We bought Mapping the World by Heart a couple years ago. I don't know if it has changed much, since then. But I can tell you that I was really disappointed with it for what I paid for it. And after thoroughly looking it over, I though to myself that I could have done this without spending the money they charged for it. Basically what it is is a video that describes why they include geography in school subjects, and a brief discription of how to teach geography (which is not very informative), and some sample maps and blank maps for you to use to draw from. You select the map you want to work on, and then while you're learning facts about the contries on that map, you practice drawing it on a blank map grid. You could do the same thing without the stuff they provide. There is not magic method to teaching the kids how to remember the geography, other than that they learn about it, and then draw it. I don't mean to sound so negative, but I have to count my costs carefully, and I felt it was a big waste.

There are many kinds of literature that fit what you are looking for. If you want an excellent in depth book about Lewis and Clark, try "Sacajawea" by Anna Lee Waldo.

: There are many kinds of literature that fit what you are looking for. If you want an excellent in depth book about Lewis and Clark, try &quot;Sacajawea&quot; by Anna Lee Waldo. A series that has American History as the backdrop is &quot;The Kent Family Chronicles&quot; by John Jakes. A similiar kind of series from black history would be &quot;Roots&quot; or other books by Haley. If you want Mexican history just before the Conquistodors, I enjoyed &quot;Aztec&quot; (sorry, no author). If you want some speculative fiction I've heard that &quot;Pastwatch&quot; just recently released by Orson Scott Card is quite good.

Timberdoodle offers an inexpensive booklet. Turning Back the Pages of Time: a guide to American History through Literature.  It is complied by Kathy Keller.  It is divided into eras and then subdivided by age groups.  I have found it to be a handy reference.<p>

We got a wonderfulo CD program from Grolier Kids ( a division of Grolier encyclopedia) called "How would you Survive?" which is an interactive program covering lifestyles in Viking society, and compares it with Aztec and Egyptian societies. A lot of 'learn while playing' value.<br>: My history unit studies for next year are Ancient Rome, Vikings and the Middle Ages.  I have plenty of wonderful resources for Rome and The Middle Ages, but could use some resources, ideas and hands-on projects for our unit on Vikings. I am homeschooling a 9 yo boy with a high interest level.<br>: So far I have, Living History series Vikings, Pamela Odjik's The Vikings, Viking Adventure by Clyde Bulla, Landmark series The Vikings, and a biography of Leif Erikson. We are also planning to make a Viking Costume, learn some basic geography related to Viking homelands and explorations, read some <br>: Nordic mythology. Any other suggestions?

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

Posted by <a href="mailto:AndreaC@juno.com">Andrea</a> on January 04, 1997 at 08:44:25:<p>
Has anyone seen or used the Capsela kits?  I picked one up at a thrift store for $1.99.  I couldn't figure out what it was about but my 9 year old son went wild with it.  Basically it is a series of electrical units inside capsles (sp) that snap together and the kids can make robots, boats, cars etc.  It is obviously very educational.  I ended up buying another kit for my son ($30) and appreciated what a bargin I had gotten before.  You might want to check these out the next time you go to a toy store.

: Hi Kathy!

: There are undoubtedly many wonderful electronic-related websites, but I have found an outstanding CD Rom that I will highly recommend from my own personal experience.

: The CD is called &quot;Cybercrafts: Fun with Electronics&quot; by Philips (the same people who make light bulbs &lt;smile&gt;).

: It has been rated as one of the &quot;Top 5 Education CD-ROMs of all time&quot; by Mac Home Journal and one of the &quot;Best 50 CD-ROM titles&quot; as rated by Newsweek.

: It is fun and includes 25 hands-on electronic projects (using the 100 electronic components and workbench included in the package).

: The recommended age is 8 and up, but my 5 year old loves it as much as my 8 year old.

: In my opinion it is an incredibly worthwhile investment of $24.95 (plus S&H).  That is the current price listed in the Edutainment Company's catalogue (see link below).

: I hope others here will post links to their favorite electricity-related websites, but I just had to post info about this program since it is one of the best sources of educational material that I know of for teaching electronics.

: Cindy

Hello Everyone!  We are back from a fun-filled, relaxing vacation on Anna Maria Island<br>Florida.  Seems we even got some 'schoolwork' done while we were there.  One of the<br>most interesting science field trips that we did was to hike out onto a tidal flat at low tide. <br>Wow! Did we ever see a lot of critters!  Since we're from Pennsylvania, we don't get to<br>see things having to do with the ocean.  I even had the nerve to record the boys' sandcastle<br>building activities under the heading of ART/SCULPTURE in my PA-required log of<br>educational activities! <br>

You all may already know this, but I am finding several hsers in our area (Central Fla.) do not.  We have a Discovery Science Center in Ocala - 11 state wide.  However, there are approximately 200 nation wide.  For $36.50 you can get an annual pass for your family (including grandparents even if they live in another state) and you can attend any Discovery Science Center in the nation for free.  Just thought ya'll might be interested.  We are getting it for Christmas!!!

: : : My 14 year old daughter and I are trying to find a good high school biology course.  We would like it to be either web-based or use interactive multimedia.  Does anyone know of resources for this kind of program?

: : Dear Annette,
: : I'm honored by the opinions of my esteemed colleagues who have vouched for my deep
: : knowledge concerning interactive and/or web based biology curriculum while I have been
: : away on vacation.  But here is the bad news - I have never reviewed and interactive and/or
: : web based high school biology curriculum.  I have a fairly good idea of what is contained
: : with the written curriculums of the major homeschooling publishers but that is as far as my
: : experience goes.....

: : The good news is that what you are looking for is actually out there on the Web....Try
: : clicking your little mousey on the link that I have provided below and see what you come
: : up with.  One of the reasons that I don't know what is out there is that you have to shell
: : out some serious dollars before you can sign up to 'take' an on line course.  I'm not going
: : to do that for purposes of review.  

: : I'll bet my bottom dollar that the information you seek is also contained in Mary Pride's
: : Book on Computers and Homeschooling (I don't know what the actual name of her book
: : is on computers;  did you know that each of her nine (at last count) children have their
: : own computers?)

: 
: OOOPS!  Major Boo-Foe there on the Clonlara link.  It will take you nowhere fast. 
: Besides, after finding the actual link I discovered that they only offer on-line classes in
: Algebra, History and English.  No Biology.  Pennsylvania Homeschoolers (not me) offers
: online science classes.  I'll be back someday with their links.  Remember, though, these
: things are not free.
: Red-In-The-Face,

Does anyone know of resources for this kind of program?<p>Hi Annette!<p>Barbara Page, one of the co-hosts here, is in Florida right now and won't be back till December; but she has a lot of biology knowledge and interests in high school science.  I'm sure she will post something when she gets back.  In the meantime, I have one lead for you (although it may not be quite what you want, or age-appropriate for your daughter).  It is a CD Rom program called Real Scientist, by ASD.  In a catalog review it says: "Ages 10 and up.  A fun and educational science kit providing hands-on activities, experiments, and two computer programs for scientific learning.  Children learn about biology, ecology, and scientific procedures by performing fascinating activities and experiments using professional lab materials, live bioluminescent marine organisms, and interactive software.  Great for schools!"<p>The program is brand new and I haven't heard about it from many other sources.  It is available from the Edutainment Co. (1-800-338-3844 or visit their website, http://www.eductainco.com) for $54.95 plus S&H.  Kind of expensive for a CD Rom, but I saw it offered in another catalog for $59.95.   We are considering purchasing it for our own daughter (who is almost 8) in the future because we need to include more hands-on science projects than we are at present.<p>Cindy

I am in the process of doing an OM competiton with my kids but had no luck with other hsers who have already done it or who wanted to start up a team program. I was lucky enough to get in on a public school team and subsequently I am now the coach. I have no problem being part of an institution for this but really really wanted to get our hs group to do this. I find it very hard to motivate and invent the wheel to get other hsers active in something like this. has anyone else done om and have they gotten enough other hsers organized and motivated? If so HOW??? thanks- Marie

: What is Odyssey of the Mind and how does one get started doing it?  I have heard 
: of it but my kids are younger so I have'nt paid much attention,
: but it sounds like something we'd like.  Do you have any
: information about starting from scratch, age ranges,
: etc?  Thanks!

: : I am in the process of doing an OM competiton with my kids but had no luck with other hsers who have already done it or who wanted to start up a team program. I was lucky enough to get in on a public school team and subsequently I am now the coach. I have no problem being part of an institution for this but really really wanted to get our hs group to do this. I find it very hard to motivate and invent the wheel to get other hsers active in something like this. has anyone else done om and have they gotten enough other hsers organized and motivated? If so HOW??? thanks- Marie

My son loves it and we consider it a part of his eduation as well as his social life.  We have tried to start a homeschool team with no luck, partly due to the fact that there are not many kids in our area that are his age.  I don't see any problem with him being with the team he is with except for a few behavior situations.  We deal with these as they arise with my son as well as with the team.  I feel that not only has it been good for him but it is also good for the team to be around my son who is polite, smart and deals well with peer pressure.<br>They are not used to being around a kid with such a mature attitude and I believe they find it refreshing.  So I say, let them all enjoy the experience.

<br>My son was still in PS last year and participated in OM as part of the gifted program.  He is hs this year and they are not doing OM.  I am really disappointed, even though it takes A LOT of work and the kids really do have to do it themselves because the rules are so strict.  We had one hser on our OM team last year.  My son and the other  hser did all of the work for the team.  It seems to me that it is a frustrating  project whether you are dealing with homeschoolers or public schoolers.<p>Stef

Our cat killed a baby bunny without mutilating it and<br>I put it in the freezer for science usage.  Any advice<br>on whether this will work.  Frogs are hard to come by<br>so I'm considering using the bunny instead. I know it<br>sounds sort of cruel, but the cat killed it anyway.<br>This would be for high school biology.  Thanks.

Has also done physics songs<br>and general science songs.  We sell all sorts of audio products which<br>help kids learn just about anything. I was just trying to find something<br>I had heard about.

: : Lehr has a song with the elements of the periodic table.
: : I don't know offhand where to get either of these, but

: : 
: : : Somewhere I heard that there was a chemistry song book.
: : : I would like to see one or know where I can get one.  Has
: : : someone ever heard of one of these?  &lt;fcooper@flash.net&gt;

Hi folks,<p>I'm embarrassed by what I've done.  I accidently overwrote the most recent Science Board file with an older copy (losing the past 18 posts or so in the process).<p>Time doesn't allow me to repost all of those messages individually, so here is a link to the whole bunch of them.  http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/science/posts.html<p>At the moment, I don't have a more recent back up of the Science Board file, but if I find one, I will correct my error better.<p>I am so sorry for the inconvenience.<p>Cindy

: Hi folks,

: I'm embarrassed by what I've done.  I accidently overwrote the most recent Science Board file with an older copy (losing the past 18 posts or so in the process).

: Time doesn't allow me to repost all of those messages individually, so here is a link to the whole bunch of them.  http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/science/posts.html

: At the moment, I don't have a more recent back up of the Science Board file, but if I find one, I will correct my error better.

: I am so sorry for the inconvenience.

: Cindy

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

Posted by Maggie on January 05, 1997 at 08:50:41:<p>
My question is basically what I wrote I the topic.  She is brilliant, speaking full conversations by 20 months, using "I" correctly in sentances, she said her alphabet fully by 20 months, and now at 24.5 months counts to 16.  All without much help at all.  She is fascinating, and I wonder what else I should be doing, for this little girl.  How can I find out if she is as gifted as I think she is?

: My question is basically what I wrote I the topic.  She is brilliant, speaking full conversations by 20 months, using &quot;I&quot; correctly in sentances, she said her alphabet fully by 20 months, and now at 24.5 months counts to 16.  All without much help at all.  She is fascinating, and I wonder what else I should be doing, for this little girl.  How can I find out if she is as gifted as I think she is?

: My question is basically what I wrote I the topic.

All without much help at all.  She is fascinating, and I wonder what else I should be doing, for this little girl.  How can I find out if she is as gifted as I think she is?<p>At 2 years, there is not a lot of reason to have your child tested in my opinion.  We had our daughter tested when she was 5.  She was several grade levels ahead and it helped us in making a decision about what to do school wise for her.  For a gifted private school, your child would likely have to be tested to gain admission.  If you are planning to homeschool anyway, the advantage is in your child being able to enter programs such as Educational Program for Gifted Youth (through Stanford University).  Our daughter is in their program, which is for math.  They are just starting an expository writing course for 4-6 graders, but are holding they beta testing open only to children who would be the ages of 4th to 6th grades.  I don't know if it will open for younger children once the beta testing is done.  Another reason we chose to test achievement and IQ on our daughter, was to see how much innate ability versus how much achievement just from being in our home environment there was.  Most children whose parents are home with them prior to school, seem to be more academically advanced than those who have been in day care, with nannies, etc.  So, their accomplishments are not always clear indicators of intellectual capability, but do leave some impression.<p>I also wouldn't worry about what you should be "doing", if she is happy and enjoying herself.  We read prolifically in our family, which is something our daughter always loved.  You can cover anything your daughter might be interested in with a good book.  My husband is a mathematician, so occasionally the two of us would try to come up with a really difficult math problem for each other to solve just for fun.  Our daughter always loved us doing this and wanted her own math problems to solve while we were doing ours.  There wasn't anything planned or forced.  We led our life, that is full of music, art, literature, etc., and just included her in it.

Help!  I could use some words of encouragement.  We will start back to school Monday after taking 2 weeks off.  (Like probably everone else has.)  This is our first year h'schooling and we haven't taken more than a day off here and there.  We even had a baby in November and kept at it.  (My husband is so great, he took off work and taught the 11 and 8 year old.  <p>I feel so far behind!  My biggest concern is that we had such a good routine going, and it took a quite a few weeks to get the cooperation from my children, I am afraid I'm going to have the same old battles.<p>I have so many ideas I want to accomplish in the next couple of months.  How do you all handle returning from break?  Do your kids jump right in? or do you have to be on them all the time?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Dana

I am new at this also (we started in Oct. with our 12 yr old daughter).  She surprised ME---I was worried about the same thing since I also start back to school on the 10th (I'm in college).  Last night she sat down with my school and work schedule and proceeded to work out her own schedule for homeschooling!  She is anxious to get back to work and you may find the same thing with your children.  If not, then maybe if you sat down with them and let them have some input into their schedule it will help them feel more like it's their decision as well.  Also, starting out lightly might help.  I know how awful it is to return to work or school after a break and have to just jump right back in---do something fun the first few days!  Good luck and congratulations on the baby!<p>

Does anyone know of a homeschooling contact in the area? I want to know if there are active groups, if any of the districts make it easy or almost impossible to comply. Are there strong active groups? Ect ect. This will be the first time I've ever really moved and I'm looking for help.<br>Thanks<br>eileen

Does someone have some advice on grading writing<br>assignments for a 9th grader.  There are no points to<br>be kept other than whether or not he accomplished the<br>assigned goal, but the end product is difficult to<br>evaluate.  Also, how do I know if he is writing at his<br>grade level?  I don't know whether to expect more of<br>him (is he just getting by and should I push him more) or<br>is he doing fine?  Any advice is welcome.  Thankyou.

Isn't there a bulletin board for homeschooling handicapped people?  Seems like I saw one, but can't remember.  Here's my situation and we're open to all suggestions.  My nephew was 25 when he was in a car accident last year.  He had been a child who had learning difficulties, especially in math, but was a good reader.  The accident left him a paraplegic, as well as brain injured.  His deficits are in math, short term memory and he also has vision problems, which we will hopefully address through vision therapy.  His wife left him, taking the two children, and he is living with his parents now.  Their divorced daughter also lives with them, and is homeschooling her daughter, who is distractible, a late reader (she is 8), and has emotional problems from dealing with everything going on in her life.  I helped homeschool her last year, and she is coming along well, but what I'm looking for is some kind of phonics program, or reading program, that they could work on together.  Any ideas?  Thanks.

I know it got really bad reviews from Mary Pride and her gripes with the program are very valid.  My sis-in-law is trying to find something that will be somewhat self-directing for them, as well, to promote some independence.  It's very hard for a 26 year old who is more like a 12-year old, not to take charge of his own thing.  It's really hard for non-readers to be self-directed in most learing though, as I can attest, having a 9 year old who was a later reader.  Nonetheless, thanks for the suggestion.

: Has anyone seen "Great Books for Independent Reading"?<br>: I found it listed in the Net Homeschool Store. It<br>: sounds like what I need for my high school child, but <br>: hate to spend the money w/out more info.<p>We used Great Books... with my High School daughter. It gives a good selection to pick and choose from. There is a synopsis of each book and two pages of quiz/tests, a challenge question and answer keys for the quiz/tests. The exercises range from true/false to fill in the blanks to 2-3 sentence answers. The questions are generally thought provoking and well done. I found the books's main usefulness to be in suggesting good literature titles that I was not familiar with myself and provided a good tool to direct her reading. We used volume one.

: If anyone knows of a site where I can find ancient history clip art, please let me know.  Thanks!Jennifer,I have some graphics I bought from Educational Resources that has all kinds of art (in color) for different school subjects. It's called "K-12 Graphics" and there are 2 volumes.  There are a few pictures about ancient history in the first volume.  I will say that both volumes have really received a work-out from us, though!  Hope this helps.Carole

Thanks!<p>Hi Jennifer,<br>I came upon this link recently:<br>http://desktoppublishing.com/stewart.html<p>It is artwork by John Stewart.  I don't know if it is what you're looking for, but based on the descriptions at the site it sounds like it might be helpful.  I haven't had a chance to look at the actual art files at this site, but if you do, let us know if they prove useful to you.<p>Cindy

<br>Winnie Ille Pu is put out by Dutton belisk Paperbacks.  It is a lot of fun.  Also, the Universtiy of Illinois (I think) published Telae Charlottae several years ago.  Contact someone in Eta Sigma Phi (an honorary classical studies fraternity) for more information, since I bought a copy at their convention.  Good luck and let me know if you find anything else.<br>

I will be hosting a homeschool chat forum at Parents Place on 1/9 and 1/16 at 10 p.m. EST.  This will continue after January if the turnout is good.  Anyone interested should go to www.parentsplace.com/index.html         If you have never chatted there you should arrive early to register.  It is free and IRC software is not needed.  Anyone accessing the internet will be able to chat as long as they register first.  This website is a parents site.  It is not specifically a Christian or homeschool site.  Therefore, there will be a wide variety of people chatting I would imagine.  This will be the first time for this forum.  I would like to see a good turnout so that it can continue and more people can get quick help on homeschool questions.

We are thinking of starting a private school for 5 children ages 5-8 (but which will grow with them) using retired teachers to teach their favorite units.  We are hoping to come under Missouri's homeschooling laws.  Anyone ever heard of this?  If not, any suggestions for something similar?  We want alternative education for our children but private schools are in short supply here and we have neither the time nor the dedication to homeschool ourselves.  Thanks for any and all help!!!!

Posted by <a href="mailto:aerogers@umich.edu">Anne</a> on December 14, 1996 at 15:40:32:<p>
Despite a grade skip last year, my gifted 7 yr old is very bored in school. She's started goofing off in class and is slow to turn in her work-in the past few weeks she's made improvements in behavior (I explained that I couldn't persuade her teacher to change her assignments until she demonstrated that she was capable of doing the assigned work). I'm now coming in once a week to work with a Junior Great Books Group for her class (otherwise she gets no relief from the third grade reader even though her teacher is aware that she recently completed reading the Dairy of Anne Frank at home). Of coarse, it doesn't help that the new principal is openly hostile to making any accomidation for gifted children. And has twice tried to undo the grade skip-three weeks after school started she tried to persuade me to put my daughter in 2nd grade with 3rd grade reading instruction. Since she was performing at the level of an average 3rd grader I refused. Last month, she asked me to consider retaining my daughter in 3rd grade next fall, so that we could correct the error made earlier in the fall. I politely told her that I wouldn't consider that option. <p>I've spent time in her classroom recently her teacher means well but he just doesn't realized that she's extremely bored. He can't understand (and stated that on her report card this week) why she is doing "fantastic projects at home," and only average to above average work in class. He's at least open-minded, caring, and willing to listen. However, that's not true of the 4th and 5th grade teachers. I'm also concerned about what the principal will say to prejudice next years teachers. Private schools in our area have huge waiting lists (some won't even accept additonal names) so private school does not appear to be an option for next year. So I'm thinking of home schooling.<p>Things I'm worried about-I'm a single parent and work full-time. Does anyone have experience home schooling as a single parent? My other question-does anyone have experience with Cloronda (sp)? I live in Ann Arbor where they are based, so it might be possible for her to attend their campus program. <br>Any advice will be appreciated.

: Despite a grade skip last year, my gifted 7 yr old is very bored in school. She's started goofing off in class and is slow to turn in her work-in the past few weeks she's made improvements in behavior (I explained that I couldn't persuade her teacher to change her assignments until she demonstrated that she was capable of doing the assigned work). I'm now coming in once a week to work with a Junior Great Books Group for her class (otherwise she gets no relief from the third grade reader even though her teacher is aware that she recently completed reading the Dairy of Anne Frank at home). Of coarse, it doesn't help that the new principal is openly hostile to making any accomidation for gifted children. And has twice tried to undo the grade skip-three weeks after school started she tried to persuade me to put my daughter in 2nd grade with 3rd grade reading instruction. Since she was performing at the level of an average 3rd grader I refused. Last month, she asked me to consider retaining my daughter in 3rd grade next fall, so that we could correct the error made earlier in the fall. I politely told her that I wouldn't consider that option. <p>I was a grade-skipped (5th to 7th) kid and hated the grade skipping and was still bored with school after the skip. Ever since then (back in the '60s) I've been thinking of ways to do better by my children. I was very glad to hear about homeschooling beginning in the early 1980s. It is my choice for my son, who is now four years old.<p>: Things I'm worried about-I'm a single parent and work full-time. Does anyone have experience home schooling as a single parent? My other question-does anyone have experience with Cloronda (sp)? I live in Ann Arbor where they are based, so it might be possible for her to attend their campus program. <p>I hear good things about Clonlara from people who live in Michigan. I have heard of some single moms who have homeschooled, by taking hours that give them more time with their children when the children are awake (this can also be done by adjusting the child's sleep schedule) or by taking the children to the workplace, as one mother who works in a library has done for years. I am still trying to gather more information on how to do this; many parents seem to rethink their life choices after becoming single, so there are quite a few parents who pose this question.<p>: Any advice will be appreciated.<p>Of course I recommend looking up the books listed on my Web site, at the link below.<p>Hope this helps!

	Hi, everyone, I've been discussing homeschooling online for years (since before my own son was born) and am now getting HEAVILY into Web-based discussions of homeschooling. I wanted to let everyone who happens to read this know about a site I maintain, the School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom! site <p>(http://pages.prodigy.com/School_is_dead/Learn_in_freedom.html) <p>I've tried to put a lot of information into the School Is Dead site without duplicating existing Web-based homeschooling resources. School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom! has been visited more than 8,200 times since January 1996, by people from all over the world. Here are some of the specific pages at the School Is Dead site:<p>	One of the most popular (and thus most plagiarized) pages on my site is the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ <p>(http://pages.prodigy.com/School_is_dead/colleges_4_hmsc.html) <p>I have made sure that the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ is the most accurate resource of its kind, as well as the most informative about the ins and the outs of the college admission process. The FAQ is listed in Yahoo's Education: College Entrance directory, and thus is frequently visited by college admissions officers--the most reliable source on which colleges have really admitted homeschoolers. I have taken care to REMOVE from that FAQ the names of colleges with open admission policies--which make up much of the content of several of the plagiarizing college lists. There is also an extensive bibliography of college guides in the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ.<p>	Another issue I get many questions about is the number of homeschoolers in various places around the world. I have an FAQ file on that subject too, known as Homeschooling is Growing Worldwide <p>(http://pages.prodigy.com/School_is_dead/homeschool_growth.html) <p>That page covers the issue of homeschooling growth around the world, from Norway to New Zealand, and from Japan to the United States.<p>	What I have tried to make the most characteristic part of my Web site is a comprehensive bibliography on homeschooling, perhaps already the largest in the world, and certain to be the largest in the world after forthcoming revisions. Through years of research in consultation with many librarians I have found books on homeschooling for teenagers, for African-Americans, for children with special needs, and for parents in particular states of the United States. I have found homeschooling titles not only in English but also in French and Japanese, and not only popular books about homeschooling but also videotapes and academic theses. If someone wants to start a research project on homeschooling, there is hardly a better place to start than in the bibliographies on the School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom! Web site. I keep a pointer to all the bibliographies on the site on a separate page <p>(http://pages.prodigy.com/School_is_dead/bibliographies.html) <p>That page's address will stay constant (for as long as Prodigy stays in business, anyway) while I make a series of additions to my bibliographies, adding more pages which will be linked to the page I just mentioned. I work so that book-loving homeschoolers (and most homeschoolers I know are book-lovers) will find this a ready resource to help them in requesting books from libraries and from bookstores.<p>	Overall, people have called the School is Dead site everything from a disgrace (that reader was a unionized schoolteacher [grin]), to "slightly radical," or even not hard-hitting enough [grin], but they agree it's informative. I hope you'll stop by for a visit.

Posted by <a href="mailto:nthomps@praxis.net">Stef</a> on December 13, 1996 at 18:45:36:<p>
First, let me say that I am thrilled to find this resource.  I will introduce myself.  I am a new hsing mom.  I have three children - David is 11, Eddie is 7 and Mary Katherine is almost 4 months.  We started hsing our oldest son just before Thanksgiving this year.<p>My question is:  Eddie is in 2nd grade at a math, science and technology PS.  We are planning on hsing him next year.  I received a call from his gifted teacher today saying that he has just had an "i don't care" attitude for 3-4 weeks.  This directly corresponds with the time we have been hsing his older brother.  I had a talk with him this evening and he says he wants to be hsed.  I told him that we  were going to next year, but he wants to now.  Eddie is a very sensitive little boy - my compliant child.

: First, let me say that I am thrilled to find this resource.  I will introduce myself.  I am a new hsing mom.  I have three children - David is 11, Eddie is 7 and Mary Katherine is almost 4 months.  We started hsing our oldest son just before Thanksgiving this year.

: My question is:  Eddie is in 2nd grade at a math, science and technology PS.  We are planning on hsing him next year.  I received a call from his gifted teacher today saying that he has just had an &quot;i don't care&quot; attitude for 3-4 weeks.  This directly corresponds with the time we have been hsing his older brother.  I had a talk with him this evening and he says he wants to be hsed.  I told him that we  were going to next year, but he wants to now.  Eddie is a very sensitive little boy - my compliant child.  I am sure their is a little jealousy with David being home and a new baby in the house.  Could it just be that he feels left out???

: I can tell you that I am a little stressed.  I am still nursing the baby and adjusting to hsing David.  My husband is a  youth minister and I am not sure we can even afford to buy cirriculum for Eddie right now.  What we bought for David was certainly an  unplanned expenditure right here at Christmas and I am preparing to purchase their materials for next fall.

: One other thing.  Eddie is in gifted and all of the gifted 2nd graders are in a 3rd grade class.  Even if I do decide to pull him out of PS - how  do I ever decide what to  teach??????

: Thanks in advance.  I am sure that you vererans will be much help!!

Good morning, Stef.  Don't you find it exciting that your son wants to be home with the rest of his family?  <br>His actions and moods are very common for someone who is doing the 'same old thing' while the rest of the family embarks on a new adventure.  <br>I would recommend that you begin homeschooling him soon.  I would imagine that your PS second quarter ends at the end of Jan. so it would be<br>best to wait until that comes.  Your son won't mind the wait because he'll be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and he will anticipate<br>the change.  This also gives his classmates and teacher(s) time to say good-by.<p>As for cost for books and materials:  for the remainder of this year, why not use the unit study approach?  The cost is reasonable...library use,<br>internet use, and materials readily found around the home and neighborhood.  Yes, you will still want to purchase a math book (unless your school<br>will allow Eddie to keep his math text for the remainder of the year).  <p>My rule of thumb for cost for one student in elementary school for one full year is between $100 and $150 for basic texts and materials.  You can <br>purchase fine used books thru many national stores, too, which keeps the cost down.  I'm sure you will

We are in our 2nd year of hsing our gifted daughter.  It has at times seemed to be an overwhelming demand on time and finances.  There is an alternative though, and it is one that we are leaning toward more this year.  If you look at an article by Dr. Arthur Robinson (http://www.home-school.com/Articles/ChildrenTeach.HTML) it may help you.  His wife died and he still homeschooled his children, who did very well.  His approach was to have his children in a good math program that they worked on for 2 hours a day, then have them write an essay that he would correct, then spend the rest of the time reading.  He believes that spending time trying to do meaningless science experiments, etc. are a waste of time when the children are young.  I would recommend you reading his article.  It makes a lot of sense to me.  His family (along with many other homeschooling families that I know) use Saxon math.  Our daughter is enrolled in EPGY-Educational Program for Gifted Youth through Stanford University for her math.  It has a lot less drill and a lot more opportunity for gifted children to experiment with their math knowledge and extrapolate from what they already know to try to solve problems.  My husband has a PhD in math, and he thinks it is a very good program and is a good foundation for how higher level math operates.  We did add a bit of drill until our daughter knew all her mult. tables.  It costs $400 per quarter, but I understand that they definately offer financial aide to try to make it available to a wide range of students.  If you want more info., please feel free to e-mail me.  It starts at K and goes through AP level courses.  They have a web site, but I don't have the URL handy.

A *little* stressed?  I would be a *lot* stressed. :)  <p>A new baby is very stressful and beginning homeschooling is very, very stressful.  Put those two together and you have overload.  <p>We also started homeschooling with a new baby.  So we just took time off from schooling until we all felt we were ready to do some schoolwork.  When you have years to educate your children, taking off a few weeks or even months will not make any difference in the long run and might really help in the short run.  So think about taking a break for a little while until the stress level decreases a little and you can concentrate more on schoolwork.<p>You don't say what kind of curriculum you're using, but any curriculum can be adjusted faster or slower or changed to a different one if needed for your child.

: A *little* stressed?  I would be a *lot* stressed. :)  

: A new baby is very stressful and beginning homeschooling is very, very stressful.  Put those two together and you have overload.  

: We also started homeschooling with a new baby.  So we just took time off from schooling until we all felt we were ready to do some schoolwork.  When you have years to educate your children, taking off a few weeks or even months will not make any difference in the long run and might really help in the short run.  So think about taking a break for a little while until the stress level decreases a little and you can concentrate more on schoolwork.

: You don't say what kind of curriculum you're using, but any curriculum can be adjusted faster or slower or changed to a different one if needed for your child.  That's the great thing about hsing.  If your child is only 7, but doing 7th grade work (slight exageration here), you can buy 7th grade books and nobody else is any wiser.  So I would say that if Eddie wants to be homeschooled too, I would let him.  It certainly won't hurt him.

: Read as much as you can about homeschooling (I did a lot of reading while nursing; what else can you do?) and try to decide on curriculum and schedules and things like that so you're not buying lots of books you end up not even using.

: You might want to check out resources that sell used books and even new books at reduced prices.  Check out the resources page.

: Keep repeating to yourself and out loud if necessary, &quot;It will get easier.  It will get better.&quot;

I agree.  I would take him out of school and I would relax as much as possible.  I've been homeschooling for going on 10 years.  At second grade level, I wish I could go back and do it different.  There's enough time for book learning!  Anyway, you could probably arrange with his school to bring home the books he's using now!  No cost!  But, from there I would springboard.  Let him do what he's interested in doing.

First, let me say that I am thrilled to find this resource.  I will introduce myself.  I am a new hsing mom.  I have three children - David is 11, Eddie is 7 and Mary Katherine is almost 4 months.  We started hsing our oldest son just before Thanksgiving this year.<p>My question is:  Eddie is in 2nd grade at a math, science and technology PS.  We are planning on hsing him next year.  I received a call from his gifted teacher today saying that he has just had an "i don't care" attitude for 3-4 weeks.  This directly corresponds with the time we have been hsing his older brother.  I had a talk with him this evening and he says he wants to be hsed.  I told him that we  were going to next year, but he wants to now.  Eddie is a very sensitive little boy - my compliant child.  I am sure their is a little jealousy with David being home and a new baby in the house.  Could it just be that he feels left out???<p>I can tell you that I am a little stressed.  I am still nursing the baby and adjusting to hsing David.  My husband is a  youth minister and I am not sure we can even afford to buy cirriculum for Eddie right now.  What we bought for David was certainly an  unplanned expenditure right here at Christmas and I am preparing to purchase their materials for next fall.<p>One other thing.  Eddie is in gifted and all of the gifted 2nd graders are in a 3rd grade class.  Even if I do decide to pull him out of PS - how  do I ever decide what to  teach??????<p>Thanks in advance.  I am sure that you vererans will be much help!!

In our family, my teenage<br>sons are in contact with friends daily, either through a job at the hospital, home-school activities,<br>church activities, or volunteer work.  I feel sorry for his experience with "social<br>isolation", but I don't see it happening in the home-schoolers with whom we are associated.  The <br>negative socialization of public school settings is a fear to all parents.  Friends who don't home-school<br>their children comment on how home-schooled children in our church are friendly to everyone, not just age-mates<br>or school mates.  This gentleman's experience seems, to me, to be by far the exception and not the rule.

I can think of two rebuttals to his argument against homeschooling: his problems seem to come from not having a chance to be with other kids for six days out of seven.  If true, that is pretty extreme and likely to cause most of his problems.  Most homeschoolers I know have far more chances for their kids to interact with other kids than that!  Also, for every maladjusted child who was homeschooled, there are hundreds of public school children who suffer even more greatly from effects of "socialization" issues (particularly drug use/premarital sex etc).

<br>I strongly suspect that this is a NEA putup job.  Everything that is said is about the common misperceptions of homeschooling.  It sounds like someones fantasy of what homeschooling is about and how "terrible" is must be from the perspective of someone in the NEA.  Back in the 1800's there was a scandalous book written about what it was "really" like being a nun and life in convents.  It fed all the anti-catholic misperceptions common in that day. (ie., nuns are the concubines of priests, etc.)  This letter is doing the same thing.  Go back and read it with this in mind.  You'll see what I mean.

: Please check out this site and tell me what you think.  It is very anti-homeschooling written by an adult who was homeschooled.  His major complaint is the lack of social interaction he received.<p>: www.easystreet.com/~hsms<p>This guy really has a problem.  It's too bad his parents weren't more aware of his feelings and that there obviously wasn't any communication between them about what they were doing.  Perhaps there are still some homeschoolers who are not allowing their children any contact with anyone except homeschoolers.  I find it hard to understand.  We have homeschooled for 7 years; our two oldest were in public school for 6 and 4 years respectively.  We learned about homeschool and I could see my oldest child becoming more relaxed and more like the child he had been before he started school.  School was not a break, a wonderful social time for him.  He was tested, put in special classes, pulled out for special programs, and lost his self esteem.  Talk about not fitting in; remember when you were in school and the way the Special Ed kids "fit in"?  Not!  Many of the homeschoolers I know have all sorts of ways of being with their peers; Scouts, church groups, family activities, clubs, and homeschool activities (basketball teams, field trips, Science Olympiads, community theatre, community ed, taking band, choir, and classes at the public school.  They also have the very real advantage of non-peer socialization that p.s. students don't have time for; volunteering in the community, working thru apprenticeships and mentorships with adults or older h.s. students, etc.   I'm preaching to the choir.  But this man who posted this board has a very real gripe.  He may have turned out warped anyway, but the big problem here, as I see it, is that he was not consulted, he was not trusted, and when he wanted to communicate with his parents he was "afraid to", by his own admissions.  Most likely that would have been the case even if he hadn't been h.s.'d.  So sad.  We can all learn from this.  I have offered my children the option of going back to school, of taking classes there, etc.  So far, my eldest has been in Voc-Tech for 2 years (no, he did not have problems adjusting; some of the other kids have problems understanding him; but recently they have asked him to "put in a good word for us" since he's been placed in the GMYes Training program, and they want to be in it too.  His reply, "I can't help you; you have to do it yourself.  I sit on the GMYes Advisory board with my Mom, and the criteria is that you have a good record on attendance, and tardiness, make good grades and pass the state certification tests.  You can do it for yourself.")  He has been active in volunteer work (300 hours completed to date), a member of Sea Explorers (maritime boy scout group) and worked as a tour guide at our local maritime museum.  He has had two businesses, lawn care and small engine repair.  Our next son has taken over the lawn care business, volunteers at the public library at book sales, doing maintenance work, and helping the librarian with preschool craft and story time.  We have the neighbor kids here, and they don't seem to mind that we h. s.  Most of them wish they could; some have asked me if I would h.s. them!!  Maybe they think it's a cop-out, but I don't think so.  When the kids are here, if my kids are working, they have the option of helping with chores, or coming back when they kids are done.  They usually stay; because "fun stuff is always happening here, Mrs. Ransom".  Then we do the fun stuff, like paint t-shirts, make cookies, gingerbread houses, etc.  The neighbor kids join in; so we get built-in peer socialization.  The kids make friends wherever they go; they don't have problems socializing.  I'd say this guys problems were more in the parenting than in the h.s.ing; he needs therapy to help him deal with the anger he has for his parents.<br>

I'd say this guys problems were more in the parenting than in the h.s.ing; he needs therapy to help him deal with the anger he has for his parents.

My kids had a harder time of it when we lived in the country.  When they were homeschooling AND when they were in p.s.!  My daughter went thru a terrible time in p.s. because she wasn't getting enuf time with her dad.  He was on the road a lot.  I took her out of school and let her go with her dad.  She straightened right up.  Her socialization was being glommed onto by one girl (that had problems!) and being sucked into her world.  Not healthy.  I went to a large school, and I have trouble socializing!  Give me a break!  There's more to it than home-schooling vs public schooling!<br>

I guess if you look at the world today, and you look at the world before public school was the norm, you could easily judge what all this "peer socialization" does for our country.  Did you notice he signed himeself as:  Foremost Home Schooling Authority in the World Today?  Scary!<p>He decided from second grade that he hated homeschooling and never relented.  I just kept wondering how his poor parents feel   : (<p><br>

I thought this was terribly sad.  This poor guy hasn't adjusted to life, and is using homeschooling as an excuse for his misery.  He would probably feel just as much a social misfit if he had gone to school.  <p>It is also possible that his religious parents were extreme in his upraising, and thus caused his misery.  I don't feel angered by his writing, or offended.  He's troubled, and seeing the world a certain way.  Instead, I would think that anyone who homeschools at the very extreme, whether it be intensely strict religion, discipline, or heavy duty academic requirements might want to examine their lives, to be certain that their children are indeed thriving and happy with the homeschooling.  Obviously this guy wasn't, and it's too bad he couldn't have received help when he was younger.<p>

Please check out this site and tell me what you think.  It is very anti-homeschooling written by an adult who was homeschooled.  His major complaint is the lack of social interaction he received.

You should check out Steck-Vaughn materials.  I have found them very useful for students diagnosed ADD.<br>Also check out Suzanne Steven's books.  She has worked with special needs kids for many years and understands the<br>benefits of homeschooling, too.  Her most recent book is excellent:  The LD Child and the ADHD Child: Ways Parents and<br>Professionals can Help.  It's published by John F. Blair, Publisher, 1406 Plaza Drive, Winston-Salem, NC  27103.<br>A third suggestion is to use the unit study approach with your student.  Kathryn Stout and Amanda Bennett have excellent<br>materials.<br>Hope these suggestions help.

Thanks :)<br>:  <br>I don't know if my child is ADD; I'm not a fan of labeling, and would never let anyone put a label on my son when he was in p.s.; that is, I had him tested independently and not by the school.  That way I could be in control of what information the school got about my son.  I definitely heard a lot about ADD and LD and was given info to read on ADD.  This is a child who could be totally focused on something that interested him, and couldn't concentrate at all if it was something that didn't interest him.  No, he wasn't hyper, either.  He could sit quietly thru a 1 or 2 hour church service, or whatever.  But he could also get 45 pages behind in his reading workbook when he was in 3rd grade!  We pulled him out of school in 5th grade, and after the first year of "School at home" which was a disaster, we fell into the child-led interest oriented type of unschooling we do now.  Have done for 7 years.  I get the state guidelines for grade level from our umbrella school (we use Clonlara; they are wonderful) and have an idea of what they might be covering in that grade.  So if it's American history, I either get an old text book or borrow from the library, and then get real books for him to read about the various topics that are covered in the text.  We don't use the text, except for reference, or if there are good maps.  We bought one history book strictly for the wonderful map overlays and used the contents page as a guide.  By real books, I mean historical fiction, biographies, informational books on the kids reading level, etc.  Dover books has activity books, and "Make a Fort" or Make a Plains Indian diorama stuff available.  See if a museum nearby offers exhibits that tie in.  Check out local historical monuments.  These are just ideas.  We do use math texts; but not on a "go thru the book page by page" way, either.  We do that if the child cares to, but we often have 3 or 4 books or workbooks around that they are using sporadically.  We sew, quilt, cook, experiment with recipes, comparison shop, figure out price per item, per lb. etc.  We do woodworking and craft project that require measuring and so on.  In other words, we live, then we figure out what to count it as, to report to our school.  If I didn't want my kids to have a diploma from a certified school, we wouldn't even have to be this structured (as in record keeping) but since I do want that, this is what we do.  Follow that kid's interests, it'll make a world of difference in his attention.  <br>

BAS,<p>We do not know for sure that our son is ADD, but I have had every teacher since he was in K ask me.  He is also in gifted.  We have just recently started hsing because - well, for lots of reasons, but one being, his teachers say he can't sit in his seat, he gets bored, gets in trouble.  I am sure you know what I mean.<p>We are using Sonlight Cirriculum.  It is a literature based.  The  reason we chose this is because he LOVES to read.  You know that with ADD kids if they are really interested, they can stay focused.  Well, this has met the challenge for our family.  He also loves history and all of the reading is historical fiction surrounding  the subject or country he is studying in history.  It's worked for us.<p>The other thing I have found with my son (5th grade) is that I don't plan to stay on any one subject too long.  We do what we  need to do and move on.   I believe that was part of his problem in PS.  He didn't do well waiting on others to finish.  I also let him take breaks.  I also do the "cardinal sin" and let him listen to music while he does certain subjects.  I have heard from several ADD parents that this is actually calming for them and I have found this to work well with David.  Mind you, I am very selective.  Right now  we are listening to Manheim Steamroller Christmas Music.<p>Good Luck<p>Stef

I found a homeschool tutoring center near my new home which offers tutoring, curriculum, record keeping,<br>and student activities for a fairly reasonable price. The curriculum they use is by School of Tomorrow. My<br>daughter wants a more structured approach and this would be more structured, but I'd like to find out more<br>about the curriculum. I was told it is Christian based and has a format similar to Alpha Omega. Has<br>anyone used or seen this curriculum? Does anyone know if the Christian basis uses a fundamental or<br>mainstream approach? Their homepage was not very informative, but this is the link:

     There is a new newsgroup for people who are homeschooling their children who have various disabilities. It is at alt.education.home-school.disabilities. You may have to reload your headers to get it.

: I had my daughter take this test, and then I took it.  We both took it at the 5th grade level and did I get a shock!  I felt I did pretty well, until I read my score!  If this test still happens to be available after the 10th, I'd like to challenge some of you to take it and let us know how YOU do!  <p>I had my daughter take the test last Sunday.  Since it had not been that long since she had taken other grade level assessment tests, I thought I would get a good correllation.  If 100% is what shows grade level achievement, then the 2 other tests my daughter took were wrong.  I would prefer to see a test that gives you a comparison with what other children at that grade level score, or a test that would test more broadly across the grades and give an approximate grade level competency.  I was concerned after she took the test about our methods of homeschooling.  Should we teach more to the tests?  I don't think so.  My daughter is reading Dickens, but missed questions like identifying a helping verb in a sentence.  I just wish I could see a SAT.  That is really the only test that will greatly impact her scholastic choices.  I too, would love to hear whether others thought this gave a good assessment of their children's performance at grade level.

I'm not so worried about grade level, but just the areas that we need to work on.  She's learned the stuff in this test, she just didn't remember it.  It helped me to see where to go back over some material.  I didn't do so hot on the test either, and I have a little more than a high school diploma!<p>I agree that I'd like to see a comparison to others, but THAT may not be good?

Posted by <a href="mailto:bunda002@gold.tc.umn.edu">Karl M. Bunday</a> on December 10, 1996 at 22:23:42:<p>
Hi, everyone, don't you just LOVE this Web-based message board? I sure do, because it is ON-TOPIC and has none of the misbehavior now prevalent on the USENET homeschooling discussion groups (through no fault of the groups),<p>misc.education.home-school.misc<p>and<p>misc.education.home-school.christian<p>I remember the "good old days" on the commercial online services, when everyone posted abundant messages and the commercial service's enforcment mechanisms were just enough to keep everyone getting along without stifling discussion. I am very encouraged to see how this and other Web-based threaded discussion groups are developing, and think the Web-based discussions have a great future. Meanwhile, the commercial online services are dying. I recognize many names of familiar friends from Prodigy and CompuServe (both services of which I am still a member) here, who have fled the higher cost of those services as compared to using an Independent Service Provider (ISP) for Internet access. And some people have never joined a commercial online service, and now about half of all online users access the online world through ISPs of one kind or another, <em>not</em> any of the big commercial online services.<p>I first heard about this message board through a message Cindy Johns posted to one of the USENET newsgroups. I have been dismayed to see both of the USENET newsgroups about homeschooling in the misc.* hierarchy degenerating because of ill-mannered crossposts by people who don't even participate in the homeschooling groups. The division between a "Christian" and a "miscellaneous" group happened before I was a participant in USENET, and is something I find regrettable. I think for a long time there are going to be people logging on to USENET with new Internet accounts, looking for homeschooling groups, and finding either of the two existing USENET groups--and not liking what they see. That reduces our chances to exchange ideas with one another.<p>I propose running a charter modification campaign to make one of the existing USENET newsgroups on homeschooling a <strong>moderated</strong> newsgroup, which would, at a minimum, allow filtering out all the off-topic crossposts with a robot program. That alone might be enough to greatly increase the quality of discussion in the newly moderated group, and increase participation and interaction among homeschoolers on USENET. I propose running the campaign first for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup, since that is the group among the two where I hang out the most and appears to be the group with the most flamewars and other problems that cry out for moderation.<p>Would you vote in support of a USENET moderation campaign for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup?

: Hi, everyone, don't you just LOVE this Web-based message board? I sure do, because it is ON-TOPIC and has none of the misbehavior now prevalent on the USENET homeschooling discussion groups (through no fault of the groups),

: misc.education.home-school.misc

: and

: misc.education.home-school.christian

: I remember the &quot;good old days&quot; on the commercial online services, when everyone posted abundant messages and the commercial service's enforcment mechanisms were just enough to keep everyone getting along without stifling discussion. I am very encouraged to see how this and other Web-based threaded discussion groups are developing, and think the Web-based discussions have a great future. Meanwhile, the commercial online services are dying. I recognize many names of familiar friends from Prodigy and CompuServe (both services of which I am still a member) here, who have fled the higher cost of those services as compared to using an Independent Service Provider (ISP) for Internet access. And some people have never joined a commercial online service, and now about half of all online users access the online world through ISPs of one kind or another, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; any of the big commercial online services.

: I first heard about this message board through a message Cindy Johns posted to one of the USENET newsgroups. I have been dismayed to see both of the USENET newsgroups about homeschooling in the misc.* hierarchy degenerating because of ill-mannered crossposts by people who don't even participate in the homeschooling groups. The division between a &quot;Christian&quot; and a &quot;miscellaneous&quot; group happened before I was a participant in USENET, and is something I find regrettable. I think for a long time there are going to be people logging on to USENET with new Internet accounts, looking for homeschooling groups, and finding either of the two existing USENET groups--and not liking what they see. That reduces our chances to exchange ideas with one another.

: I propose running a charter modification campaign to make one of the existing USENET newsgroups on homeschooling a &lt;strong&gt;moderated&lt;/strong&gt; newsgroup, which would, at a minimum, allow filtering out all the off-topic crossposts with a robot program. That alone might be enough to greatly increase the quality of discussion in the newly moderated group, and increase participation and interaction among homeschoolers on USENET. I propose running the campaign first for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup, since that is the group among the two where I hang out the most and appears to be the group with the most flamewars and other problems that cry out for moderation.

: Would you vote in support of a USENET moderation campaign for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup? Do you have any suggestions for a moderation policy for that group? Do you have any long-time participant in that newsgroup in mind whom you would support as a moderator? Please E-mail with any &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; suggestions you have, while posting public comments as replies to this message board. I will put the news: link to that newsgroup as my optional link on this message, so you can see how appallingly bad things are there now.

: Some people (I predict more and more people) will always find this sort of Web-based discussion group to be the best. Others, perhaps because of what software or Internet access they have, will prefer USENET, if USENET's quality improves. Many will try each in turn, and, after all, isn't choice for parents one thing that every homeschooler can support? Please let me know what you think, publicly or privately, and let's all keep discussing in a civil, informative manner wherever we meet in cyberspace.

: Karl,<br>: I have heard about the 'good old days' from a mutual friend of ours.  It was long before my time on the net, but sounds better than all the problems I have run accross on homeschool lists, chatrooms, etc.  I am very interested in what you are talking about, and will do what I can to help.

There seems to be sufficient interest in moderating the existing misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup now that I will take on the task, as I have volunteered to do. I have posted a message titled "1st draft of moderation policy for misc.education.home-school . . ." on the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup, where the message has received a reply from a participant I've heard good things about from other participants.<p>The basic USENET rules is that we will have to move our discussion of new policies to the news.groups newsgroup once a formal Request For Discussion (RFD) has been drafted. Again, I will take on the task of putting together the RFD. The discussion on the news.groups newsgroup will be open to <strong>anyone</strong>, including people with utterly no interest in the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup. (There are both antimoderation and promoderation "parties" on the news.groups board that discuss every proposal for moderation.)<p>After the RFD stage produces a consensus on what the formal proposal should be, it becomes embodied in a Call For Votes (CFV) that is posted to news.groups and to existing newsgroups that are likely to include persons interested in the proposal. People can vote validly <em>only</em> by reply to the posted CFVs by E-mail. All votes are public. A new proposal must win by a designated number of votes and by a supermajority to pass. (About half of all proposals pass, and about half don't. Most recent proposals for moderating existing newsgroups have done pretty well when it comes time to vote--people know USENET needs moderation.)<p>My E-mail address is immediately below. I'm pretty sure that most people who fill out these reply forms on this message board Web site write in their E-mail addresses, which makes their names active E-mail links when they post their replies. I do.<p>You are putting up the "tour" on Excite, aren't you? I'm about to go take a look at that. Thanks for your interest in helping homeschoolers find online resources.<p>Karl M.

There seems to be sufficient interest in moderating the existing misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup now that I will take on the task, as I have volunteered to do.

: The basic USENET rules is that we will have to move our discussion of new policies to the news.groups newsgroup once a formal Request For Discussion (RFD) has been drafted. Again, I will take on the task of putting together the RFD. The discussion on the news.groups newsgroup will be open to &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt;, including people with utterly no interest in the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup. (There are both antimoderation and promoderation &quot;parties&quot; on the news.groups board that discuss every proposal for moderation.)

: After the RFD stage produces a consensus on what the formal proposal should be, it becomes embodied in a Call For Votes (CFV) that is posted to news.groups and to existing newsgroups that are likely to include persons interested in the proposal. People can vote validly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by reply to the posted CFVs by E-mail. All votes are public. A new proposal must win by a designated number of votes and by a supermajority to pass. (About half of all proposals pass, and about half don't. Most recent proposals for moderating existing newsgroups have done pretty well when it comes time to vote--people know USENET needs moderation.)

: My E-mail address is immediately below. I'm pretty sure that most people who fill out these reply forms on this message board Web site write in their E-mail addresses, which makes their names active E-mail links when they post their replies. I do.

: You are putting up the &quot;tour&quot; on Excite, aren't you? I'm about to go take a look at that. Thanks for your interest in helping homeschoolers find online resources.

Karl:<p>: I propose running a charter modification campaign to make one of the existing USENET newsgroups on homeschooling a <strong>moderated</strong> newsgroup, which would, at a minimum, allow filtering out all the off-topic crossposts with a robot program. That alone might be enough to greatly increase the quality of discussion in the newly moderated group, and increase participation and interaction among homeschoolers on USENET. I propose running the campaign first for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup, since that is the group among the two where I hang out the most and appears to be the group with the most flamewars and other problems that cry out for moderation.<p>: Would you vote in support of a USENET moderation campaign for the misc.education.home-school.christian newsgroup? Do you have any suggestions for a moderation policy for that group? Do you have any long-time participant in that newsgroup in mind whom you would support as a moderator? Please E-mail with any <em>personal</em> suggestions you have, while posting public comments as replies to this message board. I will put the news: link to that newsgroup as my optional link on this message, so you can see how appallingly bad things are there now.<p>There is a moderated group in the "alt" area that is pretty good.  Slow at times, but good.  It's alt.education.home-school.christian.  No noise whatsoever!  I would have assumed you know about it already, as you're one of the "biggies" regarding 'net homeschooling.<p>I do certainly agree that the "misc" groups could use a good influx of common decency--I haven't read either of them in many months--can't stomach the trash.<p>KK

Cindy, <br>I am the parent of a very intelligent 7th Grade daughter,<br>who is suddenly flat out refusing to return to school in <br>our school district (for various reasons). To send her to<br>a neighboring district school would cost a large sum <br>of money.<p>I am wondering, if there are schools that offer online<br>education, that can be accomplished at home?

: Cindy, 
: I am the parent of a very intelligent 7th Grade daughter,
: who is suddenly flat out refusing to return to school in 
: our school district (for various reasons). To send her to
: a neighboring district school would cost a large sum 
: of money.

: I am wondering, if there are schools that offer online
: education, that can be accomplished at home? And
: are these approved in Ohio?

: Where can we find more information on this?

:                        Thanks, Joe

Help!! I am in my second year of homeschooling.  We are doing a independent study program that requires us to do the constitution for my 8th grader to pass.  She is having a real struggle with it.  Is there anyone out there that can help with a suggestion of software, or good web site.  That is easy  to understand.   Something that can catch her interest such as a game.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Posted by Daneen on December 09, 1996 at 21:45:21:<p>
I am using a fantastic Phonics/Reading program put out by The Literacy Press.  I have tried a couple other ways to teach my children to read.  This is far and above the best.  There are  no fancy songs, games, or jingles.  It is a straight forward approach to reading which has a non-reader reading at 2nd grade level or above in less than 9  months.  Just thought I'd pass this along in case anyone is looking for a good program.  As a new internet user I am not sure what the "rules" are as to giving out the address and phone of the  place  to order from.  If someone can assure me there is no problem and is interested I'll post the info.  Otherwise if you'll reply with your E-Mail address I'll be glad to send the information to you.

Sorry.<p>There are really no rules about giving out addresses and phone numbers;  however, you and  everyone else here should know that search engine robots (such as Alta Vista, Lycos, etc.) register all the information in any messages that are posted to public forums on the Web.  That is not a bad thing, but you do need to be aware of how public the messages become once they are posted.  It would be similar to posting the information in a public mall where ANYBODY can see the information.  If you are comfortable with that, then by all means, post the numbers or addresses.<p>Cindy Johns<br>

: :  As a new internet user I am not sure what the &quot;rules&quot; are as to giving out the address and phone of the  place  to order from.  If someone can assure me there is no problem and is interested I'll post the info.  Otherwise if you'll reply with your E-Mail address I'll be glad to send the information to you.

: Dear Daneen,

: I meant to respond to this sooner but I'm afraid it slipped my mind.  Sorry.

: There are really no rules about giving out addresses and phone numbers;  however, you and  everyone else here should know that search engine robots (such as Alta Vista, Lycos, etc.) register all the information in any messages that are posted to public forums on the Web.  That is not a bad thing, but you do need to be aware of how public the messages become once they are posted.  It would be similar to posting the information in a public mall where ANYBODY can see the information.  If you are comfortable with that, then by all means, post the numbers or addresses.

: Cindy Johns

: I am using a fantastic Phonics/Reading program put out by The Literacy Press.  I have tried a couple other ways to teach my children to read.  This is far and above the best.  There are  no fancy songs, games, or jingles.  It is a straight forward approach to reading which has a non-reader reading at 2nd grade level or above in less than 9  months.  Just thought I'd pass this along in case anyone is looking for a good program.  As a new internet user I am not sure what the "rules" are as to giving out the address and phone of the  place  to order from.  If someone can assure me there is no problem and is interested I'll post the info.  Otherwise if you'll reply with your E-Mail address I'll be glad to send the information to you.<p>

We just found a fun Christmas craft that the kids (ages 6 and 11) really enjoyed doing.  And my husband made one too.<p>They are "Stained Glass" Decorations made with patterns and put on paper plates.  We hung ours in the window and they look great.<p>Just wanted to pass it on.<p>Linda<br>

: We just found a fun Christmas craft that the kids (ages 6 and 11) really enjoyed doing.  And my husband made one too.

: They are &quot;Stained Glass&quot; Decorations made with patterns and put on paper plates.  We hung ours in the window and they look great.

: Just wanted to pass it on.

Has anyone used software put out by The Learning Company<br>to teach Spanish, and if so, how did you like it?  I<br>think it's just called, Learn to Speak Spanish, and comes<br>on CD's.  If you have used some other software for<br>Spanish, I would be interested in hearing about it too.<br>Thanks.

He will be graduating this year and will have way more than the 22 credits required by the state.  Since you have all those state requirements to fulfill, it would be easier for your child to take the lower level tests, etc.  At some point, he will be done with college, and it won't really matter what grade he's in :) <s>  Marsha

: Sandra,

: The experience I have had with NC homeschoolers in your

I received some sound advice many years ago from a long time home educator which we have always followed.  Regardless of how far ahead your child is in his studies it is generally best to only declare the grade level your child would be in if enrolled in a traditional school.  This means that you may be teaching at high school level but will only declare that you are teaching at (what was it?) seventh grade (?).  This means that your child will only need to test at the traditional age-grade level and will no doubt easily ace the tests!  Unless there are other compelling reasons to report the higher level learning your child is doing I would recommend this approach.

I heard about it on the radio and the game makers offer different educational levels for the game i.e., grade school and high school level.<p>Thank you,<br>Kent Taylor

My niece received the "Phonics Game" from her in-laws as a gift.  She does not homeschool but she has a 3 year old son.  She called me up and asked me if I would like to borrow it as she didn't think her son was old enough to use it yet and she was planning on sending him to a regular preschool anyway.  When I got it it was still in the box.  I have a 4 year old and a 3 year old as well as an 8 month old.  My 4 year old is reading one syllable, short vowel words.  I thought the "Phonics Game" would be a great supplement.  Well, what I found was a very difficult program that is inapropriate for preschoolers and early elementary.  It is geared more for late elementary at best and it really is more of a remedial program.  It is also geared toward illerate adults.  The card games have complicated rules that that a preschooler would never be able to grasp.  I gave it back to her and said "Thanks, but no thanks!"  This is our 3rd year homeschooling, (we started with two-year-old kindergarten)  We do not use a curricurriculum; I have always written my own.  I think that the "Phonics Game" is not a very good prgram and that you could find more inexpensive alternatives if you needed a packaged phonics program.  By the way, if you want to get information on how to write your own curriculum, why don't you visit our website?

I had one teacher in public high school that believed in Latin.  She taught us basic Latin  root words.  I have used that knowledge more than any other English-class information.  Who uses grammar?  We use Latin daily!  You don't have to know you're using a noun, but if you know the Latin root of the word you're reading, you have a pretty good idea what the word means!  Now, learning it to speak?  That'd be weird.  But, there are some Latin books that would be cool to be able to decipher!  : )  <p>Did that help?

Who uses grammar?  We use Latin daily!  You don't have to know you're using a noun, but if you know the Latin root of the word you're reading, you have a pretty good idea what the word means!  Now, learning it to speak?  That'd be weird.  But, there are some Latin books that would be cool to be able to decipher!  : )  

: : Did that help?


: Yes, that does make sense.  When I was learning sign language, I couldn't remember the sign unless I knew why it was done that way.  Same principle applies here.  Thanks.

Our family will be moving to Tennessee sometime in the near future.  I understand that it is easier to use an umbrella school there rather than try to homeschool on your own.  I don't know the first thing about these schools.  How do they work?  Do they give the assignments and keep the records?  Do they choose the curriculum or do you?  I would like to find one where we could use A Beka or Bob Jones.  Right now it looks like we'll either be moving to the Knoxville or Chattanooga area.  Does anyone know of any good schools in those areas?  Thanks for any help you can give me.<br>Theresa

I think they have something available thru this board regarding state requirements.  Clonlara Home Based Education program umbrellas people all over the world; even has an office in Japan.  Their phone number is (313) 769-4515, or visit their website at http://www.grfn.org/education/clonlara.  We have used them for 7 years and been very satisfied.  They support you whether you want to do a Christian curriculum, or another structured curriculum, or if you want to unschool.  They have family rates, they request that you send in monthly reports, but are flexible in working with you.  They keep transcripts for you, help you with any legal problems, etc.  Ask for their free informational pkg.  Good luck in moving.

I don't know the first thing about these schools.  How do they work?  Do they give the assignments and keep the records?  Do they choose the curriculum or do you?  I would like to find one where we could use A Beka or Bob Jones.  Right now it looks like we'll either be moving to the Knoxville or Chattanooga area.  Does anyone know of any good schools in those areas?  Thanks for any help you can give me.

: : I know of one &quot;umbrella school&quot; it is located in Madison, Tennessee it is called Family Christian Academy.  The address is 487 Myatt Drive  Madison, Tennessee  37/
: Family Christian Academy is an &quot;Umbrella School&quot; to anyone nation wide.  So you do not have to be a &quot;local&quot;.  They have the homeschool bookstores in all the areas you have mentioned.  Kelly

Theresa,<br>I left you a message on another board, but I left out that I know that Family Christian Academy is very flexible, and surely let you use Bob Jones or A Beka.  I only know one family who has used FCA, but they were happy with it.  Hope this helps!<p>

It stated that our group is an informal support group for families who teach their children at home.  It further gave our purpose: to encourage each other in the adventure of teaching our children at home.  We do this thru Mom's meetings (fathers are welcome but show up infrequenstly; they are usually watching kids at home!), as well as a newsletter, annual used book and materials sale, Pizza Hut "Book-It" program which culminates in a pizza party, an annual project fair and special classes announced throughout the year whenever anyone feels like teaching such a class.  Unlike many h.s. groups, we have no official "membership" and no statement of faith.  Religion has never been the focus of the group; our purpose is to encourage h.s.ers of any or no religious belief.  For this reason, we have never made religion an issue.  Don't get me wrong, many of our members are Christians and use Christian materials.  Nevertheless, this is not a secular group either. Field trips are arranged by individual mothers, announced at meetings or in the newsletter, and since we have such large numbers involved in our group, usually the mother takes care of leaving a number for sign-up, sets the cut-off for group size (usually dictated by the place where the field trip will be held), and sets a cut-off date for signing up.  roup classes may be taught from a Christian perspective.  We have always made it very clear that no one will be offended if they choose to send or choose not to send their child to a class because of the viewpoint of the class.  And we are open about announcing what kind of a class it is, so there is no room for question or offense.  Likewise, we expect that we will all, whether Christian or not, treat each other with respect and kindness.  We believe that in this way we can continue to have a worthwhile support group to encourage all of us in h.s.ing our children.  Hope this was helpful.<p>: Please don't get me wrong, we have a wonderful group, but sometimes I hear more complaining than praising.<p>: Please help!!!!!<p>

Unlike many h.s. groups, we have no official &quot;membership&quot; and no statement of faith.  Religion has never been the focus of the group; our purpose is to encourage h.s.ers of any or no religious belief.  For this reason, we have never made religion an issue.  Don't get me wrong, many of our members are Christians and use Christian materials.  Nevertheless, this is not a secular group either. Field trips are arranged by individual mothers, announced at meetings or in the newsletter, and since we have such large numbers involved in our group, usually the mother takes care of leaving a number for sign-up, sets the cut-off for group size (usually dictated by the place where the field trip will be held), and sets a cut-off date for signing up.  roup classes may be taught from a Christian perspective.  We have always made it very clear that no one will be offended if they choose to send or choose not to send their child to a class because of the viewpoint of the class.  And we are open about announcing what kind of a class it is, so there is no room for question or offense.  Likewise, we expect that we will all, whether Christian or not, treat each other with respect and kindness.  We believe that in this way we can continue to have a worthwhile support group to encourage all of us in h.s.ing our children.  Hope this was helpful.

: : Please don't get me wrong, we have a wonderful group, but sometimes I hear more complaining than praising.

: : Please help!!!!!

This would be useful.  The homeschool group that we belong to was originally set up (not by me) to be an "inclusive" group for those who weren't necessarily homeschooling for religious reasons.  It became very apparant that there were a few "new age" members in the group who wanted to do activities, sing songs etc. that were against what those of us with a Christian or Jewish belief found acceptable.  This has caused a fall-out among a number of people in the group.  The leader has called a meeting in a week to define what the makeup of the group should be.  She has gotten closer to realizing that it is very, very difficult if there is so much diversity in the group.  We have only participated in the group for 1 year, so don't know everything that has gone on, but I sure hear lots of grumbling and complaining about all kinds of things.

America: The First 350 years, This deffinetly goes against the grain as far as what we were taught in public shcool and even against what most christians have believed.  I suggest reading and listening to the tapes before letting your daughter read and listen to them.  Some very thought provoking bold statements are made.  I must go for now, but will post a second message later.  I will cover in more detail the other sources I have in conjunction with Far Above Rubies.

(Someone named Fritz Hinrichs, I believe.)<br>When I hear the term Classical Education I always think of the writings of Charlotte Mason and Susan Schaeffer McCauley.  I think they would give you a good base to understand the idea.  There is also a newsletter available based on their writings.  I don't get it, but have borrowed it from a friend.  If anyone is interested, I will try to get the info about it.

I am relying on my memory here because I can't find the details right now.  But I could have seen a mention of a case like this in a past issue of The Teaching Home.  They list in every issue various homeschooling related cases in the different states.  Or it could have come from posts in the Homeschooling section of America Online.  We have recently moved and I can't find a lot of my back issues of The Teaching Home and I can't suscribe to America Online anymore since there isn't a local access number available here.<p>I agree with Giovanna; your friend should contact the local support group and get their assistance.  If she isn't a member of a group, she should be as they can give a lot of support (show up at the hearings maybe).  And maybe they'll know of an attorney that is more supportive of homeschooling.  Also she could get other adults who know the children, like pastors, adult friends, grandparents, etc. who could verify the improvement homeschooling has had on the children.<p>Wish I could be more help,<p>Linda<p>P.S.  A little note about netiquette.  Putting a post all in caps is considered "shouting" and is kind of on the rude side.  I realize the urgency of your post, but perhaps you should tone it down a little. :-)

<br>I found the article you mentioned in the March/April 1995 issue ot Teaching Home.  The case was in Amherst County in Virginia (outside of Lynchburg).  The father wanted the children in public school or custody given to him, so HSLDA couldn't represent her.  She hired a lawyer who was able to work with information from HSLDA.  The court ruled for the mother.   (Tucker v. Brown, November 9, 1994, J&D District Court for the County of Amherst).  Hope this will help.<br>Theresa

: THANKS LINDA FOR YOUR SUGGESTION.   WE ALREADY CALLED THE HOMESCHOOL LEGAL DEFENSE , THEY SAID BECAUSE IT WAS A CUSTODY HEARING THEY COULD NOT HELP HER.  IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF HER MONEY.  IF YOU KNOW OF OTHER CASES COULD YOU TELL ME SOME MORE OR THE DETAILS. AGAIN THANKS.<p><br>Hi!  My heart really, really goes out to your friend.  What a nightmare!!!  I don't know that I can help much but I have a few suggestions.<p>First of all, I would call the Homeschool Legal Defense Assoc. and ask if they can refer your friend to a lawyer who is knowledgable with homeschooling.  I know HSLDA said they would not be able to help her but maybe they know of lawyers out there who sympathize with homeschooling.  Also, your friend should probably do a lot of research on studies that show the benefits of homeschooling.  They are out there but I don't know where to look for them.  Maybe someone on this board may know of some.  I say this because if the lawyer your friend has attained doesn't homeschool he may not himself understand why it is so beneficial.  Also the psychologist could be a potential problem.  If I understood your post correctly you stated that the psychologist said her child needed to go back to public school so her child could have more "adult interaction."  I don't understand that.  I know there is more to this situation than I personally know and I don't know the specifics but I'm just giving my opinion based on what you posted.  My suggestions to your friend is to basically arm herself with as much knowledge (statistics, why is beneficial, higher test scores, etc) as much as possible and to surround herself with people that support the homeschooling movement.  I don't know what state she is in but maybe she could contact a local homeschool support group that can lead her to a good lawyer, a psychologist, although I don't know why a psychologist of any kind would be the "ultimate authority" on why a child should be homeschooled or not.  Also this support group could help her find the research she will need to prove that homeschooling is a good alternative to public school.<br>Giovanna

Everyone I know has done Mavis Beacon, but I'm ordering the Multimedia Typing Tutor!  Actually, there's a small booklet type lesson book called Kid's Can Type Too.  It taught my daughter, and she does really well.

<p>I would desperately like to network with other homeschool moms that also have a business they run out of their home.  I could use some incouragement.  This is our 4th year homeschooling.  My husband and I have been wanting for some time to have a computer related business that we can run out of the home.  My husband is a firefighter, he works 24 hours on 24 hours off.  He also is a farrier (horseshoer) and up till this last August was leaving the fire station at 8 am and going directly out to shoe horses.  Needless to say we rarely saw much of him.  We decided it was now or never to start a home business the whole family could contribute to.  We got a home equity loan and got all the necessary things we needed to start our business.  I homeschool from 8-12, direct teaching to my 8yr old and 5yr old, our 14 year old works independently pretty well.  I work at the bus. from 1-5 four days a week and one day a week when my husband is off, I go out for the whole day and market our business.  My husband's pretty much got out of the horseshoing business and is working our new bus. on his days off.  He helps with the homeschooling and laundry, etc.  It is hard to get out of the business mode and in to the homeschooling mode sometimes.  I just have to focas all my attention on my teaching when I'm homeschooling  and re-focas back on the bus. when I'm done.  I would love to talk with other moms doing the same thing.  I sometimes feel quilty when I cannot devote more time to all the extra activities we used to do with homeschooling.  My goal is to get all the kids involved one way or the other eventually.  Look forward to hearing from you.  Kelly

Look forward to hearing from you.  Kelly<br>You have got a busy schedule.  I, too, don't have my own home business at present.  For 2 years I did; as a family we bought and renovated neglected houses.  We did one house each year.  We took a box of homeschooling stuff with us for when we needed a break, or there wasn't a job for one of the kids.  I also helped homeschool my great-niece one of those year.  It sounds like you are doing just what the rest of us do; you can only really do one thing at a time and do it well, so you kind of compartmentalize your life.  That's not all bad.  At present, I am working out of the home 18+ hours per week.  I work 2-8:00 Mon, Tues. Thurs.  I'm homeschooling 4, but only have 3 at home full-time.  My oldest goes to voc-tech in the mornings, and works on co-op in the afternoon. My 14 year old babysits the 9 and 6 year olds.  They are only "Home Alone" until their Dad gets home at 5:00; a total of 9 hours per week.  It works, but it is hard, and I worry about the things I can't do too.  One thing I've learned; if you want to do projects with the kids; only do one at a time.  Sometimes I get one child up earlier than the others to spend time with one ata time.  And if you want to do field trips or out of the home activities; schedule it ahead.  I try to keep Fridays for that sort of thing; shopping, field trips, lunch at Pizza Hut (we do Book-It thru our h.s. group) the first Friday of the month, etc.  We try to do dr. appts. on Wed. mornings, whenever possible.  That way I keep things sort of organized in my brain.  We have 2 kids in braces (teeth) and 2 undergoing eye therapy, so you see, we have to schedule that in, too.  Good luck.  Altho I don't have a lot of advice, I know it helps just to know there are other peoplpe surviving out there with crazy schedules!!<br>

: : I would desperately like to network with other homeschool moms that also have a business they run out of their home.  I could use some incouragement.  This is our 4th year homeschooling.  My husband and I have been wanting for some time to have a computer related business that we can run out of the home.  My husband is a firefighter, he works 24 hours on 24 hours off.  He also is a farrier (horseshoer) and up till this last August was leaving the fire station at 8 am and going directly out to shoe horses.  Needless to say we rarely saw much of him.  We decided it was now or never to start a home business the whole family could contribute to.  We got a home equity loan and got all the necessary things we needed to start our business.  I homeschool from 8-12, direct teaching to my 8yr old and 5yr old, our 14 year old works independently pretty well.  I work at the bus. from 1-5 four days a week and one day a week when my husband is off, I go out for the whole day and market our business.  My husband's pretty much got out of the horseshoing business and is working our new bus. on his days off.  He helps with the homeschooling and laundry, etc.  It is hard to get out of the business mode and in to the homeschooling mode sometimes.  I just have to focas all my attention on my teaching when I'm homeschooling  and re-focas back on the bus. when I'm done.  I would love to talk with other moms doing the same thing.  I sometimes feel quilty when I cannot devote more time to all the extra activities we used to do with homeschooling.  My goal is to get all the kids involved one way or the other eventually.  Look forward to hearing from you.  Kelly
: You have got a busy schedule.  I, too, don't have my own home business at present.  For 2 years I did; as a family we bought and renovated neglected houses.  We did one house each year.  We took a box of homeschooling stuff with us for when we needed a break, or there wasn't a job for one of the kids.  I also helped homeschool my great-niece one of those year.  It sounds like you are doing just what the rest of us do; you can only really do one thing at a time and do it well, so you kind of compartmentalize your life.  That's not all bad.  At present, I am working out of the home 18+ hours per week.  I work 2-8:00 Mon, Tues. Thurs.  I'm homeschooling 4, but only have 3 at home full-time.  My oldest goes to voc-tech in the mornings, and works on co-op in the afternoon. My 14 year old babysits the 9 and 6 year olds.  They are only &quot;Home Alone&quot; until their Dad gets home at 5:00; a total of 9 hours per week.  It works, but it is hard, and I worry about the things I can't do too.
