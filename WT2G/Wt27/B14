<b>Strengthen Leadership in Information Technology</b>
<p>
<H2>IT01:  Provide Clear, Strong Leadership to Integrate 
Information Technology Into the Business of Government</H2> 
<p>
 <b>Making the Vision a Reality</b>
<p>
      Reinventing government is an enormous, complex undertaking that 
 begins with leadership, not technology. Yet information technology (IT)-<p>
 -because it can help break down bureau and agency boundaries--can be a 
 powerful tool for reinvention. Its use requires both a clear vision of 
 how government can benefit from technology to change the way it does 
 business, and a commitment to making the vision a reality. Only good 
 leadership, which combines vision and commitment, can ensure sound 
 investments in IT to support the redesign of federal business practices. 
<p>
      The Clinton administration has made expanded use of IT a national 
 goal; its efforts in achieving this goal are two-pronged. 
<p>
 -Creating a National Vision-
       To accelerate the development of the National Information 
 Infrastructure, the National Economic Council and the Office of Science 
 and Technology Policy have created a committee--the Information 
 Infrastructure Task Force--to coordinate the administration's efforts 
 to formulate forward-looking telecommunications and information 
 policies. This task force, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and 
 consisting of deputy-level representatives of relevant federal 
 departments, will articulate and implement the President's vision of a 
 nationwide system in which all Americans can exchange and receive 
 information when and where they need it at a reasonable cost.      
<p>
 -Improving Federal IT Practices- 
      The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 gives the Office of Management 
 and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
 (OIRA) governmentwide responsibility for providing leadership in 
 information management. The act also charges a senior official within 
 each agency--reporting directly to the agency head--to provide agency-
 level leadership in this area. With proper vision and direction, these 
 officials could fulfill their potential as agents of change, using 
 information technology to help reinvent their agencies' approach to 
 their mission. 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
     The federal government's attempt to integrate information technology 
 into the systems supporting its operations have produced some successes-
 -and some costly failures. Despite spending an estimated $25 billion in 
 fiscal year 1993 on information technology, the federal government has 
 lacked the strong and effective leadership required to ensure that
 government makes the most of these resources.[1] We have operated 
 without any overall, enterprisewide strategic plan or vision of the role 
 of information systems in government, and with little or no regard for 
 connections among various federal agencies, or with state and local 
 governments. Many agency heads and federal executives continue to 
 overlook IT's strategic role in reengineering business practices. 
 Agency information resource managers typically lack the tools or the 
 opportunity to be effective partners with top executives in developing 
 strategies to use technology effectively. Too often, agency information 
 resource management (IRM) plans and agency strategic plans are not 
 integrated. Without clear direction and support from the top, 
 modernization programs tend to degenerate into loose collections of 
 independent systems solving unique problems and automating--rather than 
 improving upon--the existing ways of doing business. For example, three 
 bureaus in the Department of Agriculture were to share a computer system 
 to improve the management of food acquisition and price support 
 programs. However, 5 years after work on the system had begun, no 
 mechanism had been established to resolve disagreements that arose in 
 testing, installation, and maintenance.[2] 
<p>
      The oversight community--OMB, the General Services Administration 
 (GSA), congressional committees, the Inspectors General, and the General 
 Accounting Office (GAO)--often aggravates this situation by 
 overemphasizing specific details such as the acquisition costs of 
 individual IT projects rather than assessing the overall impact on 
 productivity. Instead, effective oversight should foster the analysis of 
 work processes and formulation of strategic plans that integrate 
 information technology with agency missions. Oversight agencies are in 
 an excellent position, given their independent status, to identify and 
 promote opportunities for cross-agency sharing of capabilities. 
<p>
      In particular, OIRA is charged under the Paperwork Reduction Act to 
 provide leadership and oversight for the information resources 
 management activities of federal agencies. Historically, OIRA has placed 
 more emphasis on regulatory and paperwork review responsibilities than 
 on leadership and information policy. The Administrator of OIRA is 
 committed to improving OIRA's performance in the information area.[3] 
 The seeds of change have been sown. Nurturing them will require 
 resources and expertise from the central agencies, and a new partnership 
 between OIRA, GSA, and the agencies. 
<p>
      In a few cases where oversight agencies have attempted 
 coordination, the results have been positive. For example, in 1988, OMB 
 analyzed the use of information technology by the Customs Service, the 
 Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the State Department 
 to check the names of persons entering the United States against a 
 master list. Finding duplication of effort and little sharing of 
 information, OMB worked with the agencies to create the Interagency 
 Border Inspection System (IBIS), jointly funded and operated by the 
 three agencies. IBIS allowed Customs and INS to redesign their work 
 processes. INS agents now conduct all name checks, freeing Customs 
 agents to inspect baggage--thereby improving enforcement and speeding 
 the processing of legitimate 
 transfers. 
<p>
      An even more powerful example of successful coordination has been 
 the work of the High Performance Computing, Communications, and 
 Information Technology Subcommittee which coordinates the multi-agency 
 High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative. By 
 coordinating and sharing resources and expertise among 12 federal 
 agencies, this interagency working group, under the leadership of the 
 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has created a $784 
 million program that is expanding the nation's computing 
 capabilities.[4] This, and other programs, should be models for the type 
 of coordination across government to realize IT's full potential in 
 reinventing government.
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Plan for effective use of information technology throughout 
 government.(2) 
      By January 1994, the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) 
 should expand its workto include a Government Information Technology 
 Services (GITS) Working Group. At a minimum, the working group will be 
 composed of representatives from OMB and agencies directly affected by 
 the recommendations made in this report, e.g., the Departments of the 
 Treasury, Justice, Defense, Energy, Agriculture, Commerce, Health and 
 Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and the General Services 
 Administration. The GITS Working Group will assist the IITF in 
 performing the following:
<p>
 ---Developing a strategic vision for using information resources 
 within thefederal government. This vision will define an overall program 
 and plan for IRM in the federal government and should include specific 
 models of operation, goals for improving government use of IT in mission 
 performance--both across and within agencies--and measures for improving 
 service to the public. 
<p>
 ---Developing strategies to improve leadership and authority 
 within federalagencies, and to include information resources management 
 in agencies' mission strategic planning. 
<p>
 ---Setting priorities for federal information resources 
 management and assessing the adequacy of resources to support and 
 facilitate important goals.  
<p>
 In addition, the GITS Working Group should perform the following: 
<p>
 ---Develop an implementation plan for the recommendations made 
 in this report. 
<p>
 ---Work with state and local governments and private sector 
 advisers to promotecooperation and information sharing. 
<p>
 ---Establish a continuous improvement plan and process to 
 design, develop, and implement technology-enabled, governmentwide 
 business initiatives--the electronic government as described in this 
 report. 
<p>
 ---Identify additional opportunities and oversee follow-up on 
 those opportunities for sharing information resources across agencies to 
 improve program performance. 
<p>
 ---Use existing interagency groups such as the Federal IRM 
 Policy Council (FIRMPoC) for assistance where applicable. 
<p>
 ---Serve as the focal point for implementing the recommended 
 actions of this accompanying report. 
<p>
 
<p>
 2.  Coordinate and oversee implementations of information technology 
 plans.(2)
<p>
 Beginning November 1993, OMB should:
<p>
 ---In coordination with the GITS Working Group and GSA, convene 
 (or useexisting) interagency teams, chaired by an appropriate program 
 agency, to share information, solve common problems, and represent the 
 government to the public on specific cross-cutting information 
 technology matters. 
<p>
 ---Revise OMB Circular A-130 to encourage the integration of 
 agency IRM plans with agency strategic plans and budgets via the 
 creation of strategic IT plans and performance measures. 
<p>
 ---Ensure adequate OMB staff expertise to exercise effective 
 leadership offederal information and IT activities. This function should 
 combine technical expertise in information computing and communications, 
 government operations, and service sector innovation. This function must 
 be integrated with--not isolated from--OMB's other management and 
 budget oversight functions. This integration will ensure that OMB speaks 
 with one voice on information and IT issues, and that agencies can rely 
 on consistent guidance.

<b>Implement Electronic Government</b>
<p>
 Introduction
<p>
      Citizens and government workers contend with an increasingly 
 complicated array of federal agencies, organizations, processes, and 
 forms. The existing service delivery system is largely based on 
 hierarchical design structures developed in the 1930s. The result is 
 slow, inefficient service that may not satisfy actual customer needs. 
 The information needed for sound decisionmaking and high-quality 
 customer service is not coordinated across government agencies, thus 
 increasing cost and time to provide services.  In short, today's 
 government structures, processes, and business practices, which were 
 designed for a different era, cannot keep up with the existing types and 
 volumes of customer demands.
<p>
       Information technology will be the key to providing more cost-
 effective and user-friendly government services.  Industry examples 
 illustrate how exploiting technology can provide superior customer 
 service, significantly decrease costs, increase quality, and improve 
 overall effectiveness and competitiveness.  Successful applications of 
 information technology also can be found in federal, state, and local 
 government.  Moreover, the Office of Management and Budget estimates 
 that by the year 2000, approximately 75 percent of public transactions 
 will be processed electronically.[1] 
<p>
      The requirement to address ever-more-constrained operating budgets 
 makes integration of information technology into all phases of the 
 federal workforce vital to meeting service demands of the American 
 public. 
<p>
      Information technology must not be applied haphazardly or 
 sporadically. It also must not be used simply to automate existing 
 practices. Instead, information technology must be seen as the essential 
 infrastructure for the government of the 21st century--a modernized 
 electronic government. 
<p>
      Electronic government will allow citizens broader and more timely 
 access to information and services through efficient, customer-
 responsive processes--thereby creating a fundamental revision in the 
 relationship between the federal government and everyone served by it. 
 Electronic government will enable the creation of "virtual agencies" 
 that will give citizens access to integrated program information and 
 services organized around service "themes" (e.g., unemployment 
 assistance), rather than bureaucratic--and often idiosyncratic--
 structures. In a virtual agency, several interconnected federal 
 organizations will be able to provide information and services in a 
 seamless manner. 
<p>
      In electronic government, high-speed telecommunications links 
 (information highways) will carry the data necessary to support 
 governmental operations. These information highways will connect 
 federal, state, and local governments, and help form a National 
 Information Infrastructure (NII) made up of public and private 
 transmission circuits and information services. Existing components of 
 the NII include the nation's telecommunications carriers; Internet, 
 which serves both government and private sector as a pathway for 
 electronic mail and data; public libraries; and the electronic 
 settlement services that support the automated teller machines and 
 credit cards that facilitate the flow of funds nationwide. 
<p>
      A conceptual subset of the NII is the government's information 
 infrastructure, the portion of the NII used exclusively by the 
 government. It is composed of all the electronic services and paths that 
 support government operations, such as the computer systems that 
 facilitate the payment of monthly Social Security benefits, the FTS2000 
 telecommunications systemthe federal government uses for voice and data 
 communications, internal networks run by individual government agencies, 
 and the wealth of data and information that the government makes 
 available. 
<p>
      The following seven initiatives, which NPR proposes implementing on 
 a fully operational or pilot basis, would facilitate and expand 
 government's use of the NII. These initiatives are highlighted because 
 work is already in progress on their development and they offer 
 significant payback opportunities: 
<p>
 ---integrated electronic benefit transfer,
<p>
 ---integrated electronic access to government information and 
 services, 
<p>
 ---National Law Enforcement/Public Safety Network,
<p>
 ---intergovernmental tax filing, reporting, and payments 
 processing, 
<p>
 ---International Trade Data System,
<p>
 ---National Environmental Data Index, and
<p>
 ---governmentwide electronic mail.

<H2>IT02:  Implement Nationwide, Integrated Electronic Benefit 
Transfer</H2>
<p>
 <b>Convenient, Secure Funds Receipt at the Press of a Button</b>
<p>
      Each year, tens of millions of citizens receive government 
 services, either directly from the federal government or indirectly 
 through state and local governments or third parties. The number of 
 recipients of government benefits is large--and is projected to grow. 
<p>
 ---In the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Stamp 
 Program,enrollment averaged 25.4 million persons per month in 1992 and 
 had increased to 27.4 million persons by March 1993.[1] 
<p>
 ---Approximately 31.4 million low-income people receive monthly 
 authorization for medical assistance through Medicaid.[2] 
<p>
 ---Monthly disability insurance benefits are drawn by more than 4.3 
 millionformer workers and their dependents. 
<p>
 ---The Social Security Administration is expected to distribute more 
 than $450billion annually to 44.3 million beneficiaries by 2000.[3] 
<p>
      Provision of these benefits relies primarily on paper-based 
 systems--such as checks, vouchers, or coupons--that are not always 
 customer-friendly, are inefficient and expensive to operate, and are 
 subject to fraud and abuse. 
<p>
      The USDA Food Stamp Program provides an excellent example. It is 
 perhaps the most paper-intensive of all federal benefits programs. Over 
 3 billion food stamps are printed yearly and distributed monthly in the 
 form of coupon booklets to over 10 million households. Each month, 
 210,000 authorized food retailers receive the coupons in exchange for 
 eligible food items. The retailers carry stacks of food stamps to 
10,000 
 participating financial institutions, which credit the store accounts 
 for their value. The banks send the redeemed food stamps to a Federal 
 Reserve Bank which again counts the coupons, credits the banks' 
account, 
 bills the U.S. Treasury for the value of the coupons, and destroys 
them. 
 Food stamps cost federal and state governments approximately $400 
 million per year in administrative expenses to print, ship, store, 
 distribute, reconcile, and destroy.[4] The paper aspect of food stamps 
 also creates management control 
 vulnerabilities and ample opportunities for fraud and abuse. 
<p>
      The Food Stamp Program, together with similar inefficient, 
 outmoded, paper-based systems, can be replaced by proven, cost-
effective 
 technology. Electronic benefit transfer (EBT) is already successfully, 
 and cost-effectively, used by the federal government. EBT adopts 
 commercial electronic payment practices to the delivery of government 
 assistance services, enabling benefits to be transferred 
electronically. 
 Presently, direct federal payment programs such as Social Security, 
 Supplemental Security Income, federal pensions, and veterans benefits 
 are a mixture of electronic direct deposit and paper check issuance. 
<p>
      The savings entailed by converting to EBT are significant. For 
 example, the roughly 450 million paper check payments made per year 
cost 
 taxpayers up to six times more to deliver than those electronically 
 deposited. Making the transition to electronic transactions, which cost 
 6 cents per transaction compared to 36 cents per physical paper 
 transaction, would significantly reduce benefits delivery cost.[5] 
<p>
      Recent pilot projects to replace paper-based benefits systems with 
 EBT also confirm that electronic benefit delivery can reduce costs. The 
 Secretary of USDA reported that usingEBT for government issuance of 
food 
 stamps saved 24 percent in operating costs in pilot projects in New 
 Mexico and 3 percent in Minnesota. Retailers also benefit: the study 
 showed that cost to retailers dropped by an average of $3.98 per $1,000 
 in food stamp product sales in New Mexico, and by $9.09 in Minnesota. 
 EBT issuance of food stamps also benefits banks that participated in 
the 
 pilot; their cost fell by $3.17 and $5.48 per $1,000 of benefits 
 redeemed in New Mexico and Minnesota, respectively.[6] The estimated 
 loss due to fraud related to food stamp benefits dropped by 75 percent 
 in New Mexico and 81 percent in Minnesota.[7] 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 A major expansion of electronic delivery of federal benefits has not 
 been possible in the past for several reasons, including 
<p>
 ---lack of banking service accessibility;
<p>
 ---lack of availability of a low-cost alternative to receiving and 
 cashing a government check; 
<p>
 ---legislative restrictions limiting flexibility to select a 
 particular method of payment; and 
<p>
 ---people's natural resistance to change, e.g., trusting 
 electronic direct deposit. 
<p>
      These reasons are no longer impediments to nationwide electronic 
 benefit delivery. EBT can provide basic bank-like services in 
 neighborhoods where no physical banks exist. Paper check processing has 
 become more expensive than electronic direct deposit. Congress and 
 the public are more receptive to alternative delivery methods. This 
 receptivity is evidenced by recent congressional action permitting EBT 
 as an operational alternative to issuing food coupons and by the 
 overwhelming recipient preference of EBT over food coupons in all
 EBT demonstration sites. 
<p>
      Compatibility with commercial electronic transaction networks is a 
 critical requirement for retail merchants and financial institutions. 
 EBT could be processed concurrently with commercial electronic 
 transactions by adopting the specific standards and rules promoted by 
 the American Bankers Association and used by the major commercial 
direct 
 debit point-of-sale and automated teller machine (ATM) networks. This 
 compatibility would allow government transactions to be processed along 
 with existing commercial financial transactions, exploiting previously 
 defined nationally and internationally accepted standards. Industry's 
 support is vital to successful implementation of EBT, especially for 
 federal-state administered programs such as Food Stamps; Special 
 Supplemental Food Program forWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC); Aid to 
 Families With Dependent Children (AFDC); and child support. 
<p>
      The most effective implementation of EBT would be nationwide 
 delivery of multiple, integrated benefits using the existing commercial 
 infrastructure--e.g., electronic funds transfer network, commercial 
 banking, credit/debit card authorization and settlement/interchange 
 networks, and the Federal Reserve's Automated Clearing House system. 
 Benefits that could be delivered over this network include food stamps, 
 veterans benefits, student aid, medical assistance, housing programs 
 including assistance payments to families and individuals, unemployment 
 insurance, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, AFDC 
 assistance, child support, and WIC assistance. 
<p>
      The nationwide EBT system would use direct deposit of benefits and 
 plastic access cards to replace food stamp coupons, AFDC checks, WIC 
 vouchers, Medicaid authorization cards,state general assistance checks, 
 housing assistance checks, etc. This approach would dramatically 
improve 
 recipient services, combat fraud and abuse, and save millions in yearly 
 operating costs for federal and state governments. 
<p>
      Federal payments would be deposited directly into recipients' bank 
 accounts. For recipients without bank accounts, or those who prefer not 
 to involve their banks, a federally sponsored electronic account 
 accessible by an EBT card could be established. For recipients without 
a 
 bank account who are at or below the poverty level, a free electronic 
 service (e.g., a fixed number of free ATM or point-of-sale transactions 
 per month) could be provided. Funding for this service could come from 
 savings achieved by the federal government through conversion to direct 
 deposit. 
<p>
      For public assistance programs jointly administered by federal and 
 state governments, EBT could dramatically simplify the delivery of 
 separate program benefits to eligible recipients. Ultimately, a single 
 government services plastic benefits card could be issued instead of 
 separate cards for each program. By using one comprehensive EBT 
 infrastructure, federal and state agencies can share both start-up and 
 ongoing operating costs associated with the delivery of government 
 benefits to the public. As a result, all stakeholders should experience 
 lower operating costs and provide measurably improved customer service. 
<p>
      Although much benefit is gained by leveraging the existing 
 infrastructure, there are several liability and policy issues to be 
 considered. 
<p>
 ---The Federal Reserve Board in February 1993 proposed making 
 Regulation Eof the Electronic Funds Transfer Act applicable to EBT. 
 Regulation E governs electronic transaction liability in the private 
 sector; it would make federal and state governments liable for the 
 replacement of recipient benefits reported lost or stolen, without 
 regard to recipient responsibilities. The cost of this regulation could 
 effectively deter or even halt EBT expansion. 
<p>
 ---To avoid the development of incompatible systems and to realize 
 substantial operating cost reductions through volume (economies-of-
 scale) pricing, EBT efforts will need to be coordinated nationally 
while 
 these systems are still in their infancy. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>

<p>
 1. Design an integrated EBT implementation plan. (2)
<p>
      An existing interagency team, the Electronic Benefit Transfer Task 
 Force, chaired by OMB, is defining the roles, responsibilities, and 
 changes required to implement EBT nationwide. This task force should 
 periodically report on its progress to the GITS Working Group and the 
 Vice President and should complete the implementation plan by June 
1994. 
<p>
      The most effective implementation of EBT is nationwide delivery of 
 multiple, integrated benefits, which leverages the existing commercial 
 infrastructure. Ongoing benefits delivery improvement efforts should be 
 accelerated. These efforts include implementing electronic delivery of 
 food stamps by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service and direct benefit 
 delivery by the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management 
 Service, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Personnel 
 Management, and the Railroad Retirement Board. 
<p>
      The initiative should press for (1) integrating a package of 
 benefit programs for electronic payment, including Food Stamps, Social 
 Security benefits, and AFDC; and (2) sequencing their implementation to 
 ensure that each new benefit program added builds on prior successes. 
 The initiative should use government and local EBT experiences to pilot 
 and implement integrated benefits delivery nationwide. 
<p>
      The implementation plan should include recommendations on various 
 resource issues, such as cross-agency administrative cost pooling, 
 funding strategies, organization, and staff support; and should 
 establish a calendar with key milestones for progress measurement and 
 review. 
<p>
 
 2. Legislation should be proposed to facilitate nationwide 
 implementation of EBT. (3)
<p>
      OMB should direct the Electronic Benefit Transfer Task Force to 
 perform the following policy and legislatively oriented tasks. The team 
 should draft a report of its activities by July 1994. 
<p>
 ---Review existing legislation and regulations for each program that 
 may affect nationwide implementation of EBT and draft appropriate 
 changes. For example, one key issue concerns the applicability of 
 Regulation E to EBT. Examine the comments submitted in response to the 
 Regulation E proposal making it applicable to EBT, and determine a 
 governmentwide position on recipient liability in EBT processing. 
<p>
 ---Adopt a uniform EBT services pricing structure and attendant 
 funding agreements. Identify standard categories and construct an EBT 
 processing pricing structure to include capture and financial 
settlement 
 of transactions by and among processing centers and networks, including 
 industry and federal and state operations. Within the pricing 
structure, 
 address cross-program cost effectiveness. This should maximize the 
 benefits of economies of scale, leverage the commercial direct debit 
 infrastructure, and ensure that cost-effective criteria are used to 
 facilitate and expedite the migration to EBT. 
<p>
 ---Define a settlement process that is the financial reconciliation of 
 all debit and credit transactions on a daily basis. High-volume/same-
day 
 settlement processing is required to support EBT. This processing 
 closely aligns with and can leverage the financial services industry's 
 current settlement exchange system. The Treasury's Financial Management
 Service and the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank are in the process of 
 assessing implementation approaches. 
<p>
 ---Develop integrated EBT program and operating rules. For example, 
 recipient responsibilities presently vary among different benefit 
 programs. Obtain agreement across programs on how to combine program 
 requirements into a uniform set of EBT rules and responsibilities. 
 Review and modify ongoing efforts to adapt industry's electronic 
 transfer operating procedures and rules. Coordinate with private sector 
 entities to define the government EBT system: this includes technical 
 considerations such as standards and type of equipment deployed, 
 security and privacy protection, and operating rules (e.g., roles and 
 responsibilities of all parties, liabilities, indemnifications, and 
 settlement timing). 
<p>
 ---Define benefits delivery options. The presumed method of payment 
 for all new enrollees in direct federal programs would be direct 
deposit 
 or EBT service. While total conversion from paper checks to electronic 
 payments is the goal, it probably is best to start with a highly 
 publicized voluntary direct deposit program and phase in EBT service 
 over a 3-year period. However, a voluntary dual paper-based and EBT 
 system is not the preferred method for the federal-state administered 
 programs, especially for the Food Stamp Program. An objective shared by 
 the Food and Nutrition Service, food retailers, and financial 
 institutions is to eliminate paper coupons, not create a dual-delivery 
 system. A dual system would be too costly to manage, hinder the 
 interstate flow of transactions, cripple efforts to obtain economies-
of-
 scale pricing, and defeat efforts to combat fraud and abuse in the 
 trafficking of coupons. Consumer and recipient advocacy groups will 
need 
 reassurance that strong recipient preference exists for EBT and that 
 adequate privacy safeguards are in place.

<H2>IT03: Develop Integrated Electronic Access to 
Government Information and  Services</H2>
  <p>
 <b>Quick Response, Complete Information, and a Happy 
 Ending to Telephone Tag </b>
 <p>
      Imagine this:  A recent retiree goes to a government services 
 kiosk, located at his local post office. He wants information about his 
 retirement benefits. After requesting his Social Security Number and 
 other personal ID information, the kiosk prints a summary of his
 Social Security contributions, as well as the benefits to which he is 
 entitled as a veteran. His annuity distribution options are included on 
 the printout, as are all of the rules governing earning income while 
 collecting retirement benefits. The kiosk then asks him if he wants 
 related information on retirement, information on senior citizens 
 groups--and brochures on collecting stamps as a hobby. 
<p>
      The government's primary mission is to provide quality services to 
 the public in a timely manner. However, access to government services 
is 
 cumbersome, uncoordinated, and not customer-friendly. If more than one 
 agency is involved, a customer must go through two or more rounds of 
 inquiries, with frequent routings from one government employee to 
 another. Several recent government initiatives involving various 
 information access methods are improving service to citizens by making 
 information more readily available. Several of these initiatives are 
 described below. 
<p>
 Telephone Access.
      Industry pioneered the use of the telephone to provide services to 
 customers. Toll-free numbers and guided questions by either a human or 
 computer speed callers to needed services. Call receipt is logged and 
 automatically distributed, and responsiveness to customers can be 
 measured. 
<p>
      The government has begun to incorporate telephone-based techniques 
 to improve access to its services. For example, 70 percent of taxpayer 
 contacts with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are now conducted by 
 telephone. The IRS has made major improvements in theaccuracy of its 
 telephone service information and is able to resolve many taxpayer 
 problems in a single phone call--including accepting verbal statements 
 over the phone. The Social Security Administration (SSA) now receives 
 over 55 million calls a year requesting information and services over 
 its national 800  number. On a cross-agency basis, the Federal 
 Information Center (FIC), operated by the General Services 
 Administration (GSA), provides 800-number telephone service in major 
 metropolitan areas. The public may call FIC with any question or 
problem 
 related to the federal government. Information specialists then 
research 
 the question and either provide an answer or the telephone number of 
the 
 specific federal office that should be contacted. 
<p>
 
 Kiosk Access. 
      Federal and state governments are developing approaches to 
 providing information and services through interactive, customer-
 activated terminals called kiosks, which are modeled after automated 
 teller machines (ATMs). 
<p>
      The use of kiosks can create savings and generate revenues, as 
well 
 as provide information and services. For example, the Info/California 
 kiosk, a customer-activated terminal implemented by the State of 
 California, has generated major benefits, including lower costs
 for customers of state information. For example, the kiosk offers a job 
 match service in which customers preregister to determine relevant 
 statewide employment openings. Previously, the job match service cost 
 $150 per applicant. With preregistration at the kiosk, the cost is now 
 $40 per applicant. Additionally, a California Department of Motor 
 Vehicle address change costs $5 in person, $2 if received in the mail, 
 and $1 if the transaction is received via the kiosk.[1) The State of 
 Iowa estimates that its kiosk technology saves the state $6 per birth 
 certificate issued ($7 manually versus $1 by kiosk technology).[2) 
<p>
      SSA is developing a new customer service initiative using kiosk 
 technology to provide a wide range of services. This pilot program, to 
 begin in late 1993, will provide information (retirement and disability 
 benefits information, Supplemental Security Income eligibility 
 requirements, etc.) and direct services (processing of entitlements, 
 status of pending claims, etc.).[3) The pilot program should result in: 
<p>
 ---reduction in claims processing time,
<p>
 ---reduction in paper flow and file retention,
<p>
 ---enhanced customer service through a one-stop shopping concept, 
 and 
<p>
 ---increased productivity.[4]
<p>
      In conjunction with this initiative, SSA, the U.S. Postal Service 
 (USPS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are developing a 
 combined government services kiosk.[5]  This kiosk will be a single 
 access point to services provided by the three agencies. Since these 
 three agencies represent a significant share of the federal government 
 "s contact with the public, this partnership will have a dramatic 
effect 
 on decreasing costs by reducing duplicate efforts and improving service 
 by providing public access from more locations.
<p>
Additional Access Methods

     Many of the  recent initiatives to provide electronic access have 
 included the use of  personal computers. For example, the Library of
 Congress has placed a  searchable version of its catalog on 
Internet.[6]
 For computational scientists, the Department of Energy, the National
 Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science 
Foundation
 (NSF) research  centers have established Internet-accessible libraries 
of
 government- sponsored software. 
<p>
      NSF and the National Institutes of Health routinely place their 
 program announcements and various other documents in an easily 
 searchable and retrievable form on Internet. NSF's Science and 
 Technology Information Service is accessed many thousands of times each 
 week for information about NSF activities, funding opportunities, 
 abstracts about research grants, and various reports on science and 
 technology. Access is easy, and is provided at no charge. 
<p>
      The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) operates a 
 publicly accessible dial-up electronic bulletin board system (BBS). 
This 
 BBS, called FedWorld, provides access to over 100 federal government 
 databases and bulletin board systems. Planning is under way to place 
 this collection on Internet. A study has been completed recently to 
 examine the feasibility of expanding FedWorld into a locator service 
 that is a "comprehensive inventory and authoritative register of 
 information products and services disseminated by the federal 
 government," that can "assist agencies and the public in locating 
 federal government information."[7] 
<p>
      The Clinton administration has established Internet mailboxes for 
 the President and the Vice President (e.g., president@whitehouse.gov) 
 for direct electronic mail access by the public. The House of 
 Representatives has a pilot project under way to provide public e-mail 
 to seven congresspersons, and the Senate is expected to announce a 
 similar program shortly. If successful, all members of Congress will 
 eventually be accessible through Internet. 
<p>
      Most new information technology initiatives have their roots in 
the 
 private sector, since it is the private sector--not government--that is 
 usually first to adapt new information technologies to improve customer 
 service. One example of government and industry working cooperatively 
to 
 provide services is France's Minitel system. In the early 1980s, the 
 French Government opened its telephone network to provide a wide range 
 of services.[8] Minitel service is routinely used in homes and 
 businesses. It includes on-line retrieval services, credit reporting 
 services, airline reservations, telephone directories, and government 
 information. U.S. telecommunication and information services companies 
 have begun to offer similar services. The federal government, as a 
 potential customer and a provider of information that could be made 
 available electronically, could stimulate development of these 
services. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Citizen access to federal government information and services is 
 uncoordinated and not customer-friendly. Individuals must frequently 
 contend with several different organizations and processes in order to 
 complete a single transaction. In turn, the federal government expends 
 an inordinate amount of resources to complete actions. To receive 
 service, a customer must know whom to contact and how to contact that 
 organization: Government has not made public access easy. Information 
 technologies may be employed to reduce the complexities that citizens 
 face and consolidate actions required for providing services.
<p>
      Several organizations have recommended (to different government 
 entities) ideas for employing information technology governmentwide to 
 improve services. 
<p>
 ---The Service to the Citizen Intergovernmental Task Force 
 requests one-stop, easy citizen access to information.[9] 
<p>
 ---The National Academy of Public Administration asks for 
 electronic access to government services.[10] 
<p>
 ---The Program on Strategic Computing and Telecommunications in 
 the Public Sector suggests replacing face-to-face services with 
 teleservice and self-service.[11] 
<p>
      These organizations are but three of many that are organized and 
 committed to improving government. They advocate the increased use of 
 information technology as a key to improving customer service. However, 
 as similar as their recommendations may be, their suggested 
 implementations are quite dissimilar, pointing to a problem needing 
 action. Further, there is no lead agency or organization that can 
 coordinate the implementation of customer service initiatives. An 
 authoritative charter is needed to trigger progress. 
<p>
      A true nationwide one-stop 800-number government service does not 
 exist. Access to FIC is limited and not well-publicized. FIC primarily 
 serves customers in certain key metropolitan areas representing 
 approximately 50 percent of the U.S. population. For individuals who 
 live outside these metropolitan areas, FIC's telephone number is not 
 listed in many of their local telephone company directories and may not 
 be available through directory assistance. 
<p>
      In the future, government information collection and distribution 
 could be accomplished directly by the public using electronic kiosks, 
 personal computers, interactive telephone voice response equipment, or 
 other electronic off-the-shelf devices. Interactive computers or 
 electronic kiosks could deliver a wide variety of government services, 
 such as the following. 
<p>
 ---Governmentwide service directories--access directories of 
 government services, addresses (postal and electronic), and telephone 
 numbers. 
<p>
 ---Change of address service--automatically transmit, through a 
 single transaction, a new address to all service agencies selected by a 
 customer. 
<p>
 ---Forms and publications--locate and request copies of 
 government forms and publications; these could be delivered and filled 
 out electronically, printed at the kiosk, or delivered by the post 
 office. 
<p>
 ---Tax filing--electronically input necessary financial data to 
 allow the IRS to perform tax computations for federal, state, and local 
 governments. 
<p>
 ---Governmentwide information locator service--perform searches 
 on selected topics, list locations for the information, and provide 
 electronic links to the information.
<p>
 ---Multimedia and multilingual service delivery--provide information to 
 meet special needs of clients using video, audio, or multiple 
languages. 
<p>
 ---Public messaging entry station--allow entry of messages to 
 government agencies and officials. 
<p>
      Government should form partnerships with the private sector to 
 develop and implement ideas on how to use information technology to 
 provide new and better services. Using the French Minitel model, both 
 government and business services would be accessible. These 
partnerships 
 will allow the federal government to provide additional services at 
less 
 cost and will take advantage of lessons learned by industry. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Coordinate, recommend, and implement information technology 
 initiatives to improve customer service. (2) 
<p>
      The Government Information Technology Services (GITS) Working 
Group 
 should charter an interagency team by May 1994 to coordinate, 
recommend, 
 and implement information technology initiatives to improve customer 
 service. The progress of this team should periodically be reported to 
 the Vice President. OMB should work with this Customer Service 
 Improvement Team (CSIT) to develop funding strategies. An existing 
 interagency team, the Service to the Citizen Intergovernmental Task 
 Force, may be appropriate for this role. CSIT should work closely with 
 GITS to ensure complementary strategies exist toward common goals. 
 Membership of this team, as a minimum, should include representation
 from the following: the GITS Working Group, the Service to the Citizen 
 Intergovernmental Task Force, the FIC, the SSA-USPS-VA kiosk 
 implementation organization, FedWorld, and the National Academy of 
 Public Administration. 
<p>
      As one of its first tasks, this team should develop and test an 
 integrated governmentwide "one-stop service shop." This would consist 
 of simple "Yellow Pages"-style databases of federal programs and 
 automated links to the information and service providers. This one-stop 
 shop should include access not only to information (e.g., how to apply 
 for a program) but also the capability to process information (e.g., 
 ability to accept an application electronically from the user). 
Customer 
 access to this one-stop shop should be available through a variety of 
 means. Access methods should include the telephone, information
 kiosk, and personal computer. Building blocks for the one-stop shop 
 include the Federal Information Center, government services kiosks, and 
 FedWorld (see actions 2, 3, and 4). Links between these services should 
 be established where feasible, so that these efforts complement one 
 another and are not duplicative, e.g., government services kiosks 
should 
 be able to link to FedWorld's locator service. A draft strategic plan 
 for development and implementation of the one-stop service shop should 
 be completed by November 1994. 
<p>
      Significant customer service-related applications developed by 
 individual agencies or organizations should be directed to this team. 
 The team will then determine whether those initiatives may be 
 appropriate for governmentwide application. Recommendations from 
private 
 and public sector organizations should also be considered by this team. 
<p>
 
 2. Implement an integrated governmentwide national one-stop 800-number 
 calling service. (1) 
<p>
      The Administrator of GSA should develop, by July 1994, an 
 implementation plan for expanding to a national 800-number service to 
 begin by December 1994. Under this plan, a customer should be able to 
 call a single number and have the call routed by FIC to an individual 
in 
 the appropriate agency who can respond. (Presently, callers are given 
 agency phone numbers to dial themselves.) FIC's national 800 number 
 should be listed in all local telephone company directories and be 
 available from directory assistance nationwide. 
<p>
      This national 800-number service should be supplemented by a 
 telephone network of individual agency 800 numbers. Customers who do 
not 
 know what agency (or number) to call may call this federal government 
 information specialist. Otherwise, they can contact the agency 
directly. 
 Agencies that do not now offer 800-number calling services should 
 develop implementation plans by July 1994, to provide this service by 
 December 1994. 
<p>
 
 3. Implement an integrated one-stop government services kiosk. (2) 
<p>
      The Customer Service Improvement Team should coordinate the 
 development and implementation of a one-stop government services kiosk. 
 The SSA-USPS-VA initiative should be used as a model, and as a likely 
 candidate for further development and expansion by additional agencies. 
 It should develop a preliminary implementation plan by November 1994. 
 This plan should identify appropriate agencies and customer services to 
 be included, and timetables for nationwide expansion. The locations of 
 kiosk-based access points to federal government services must be 
 numerous and nationwide in order to facilitate customer access to 
 information and services. Existing agency kiosk systems will need to be 
 examined for the feasibility of upgrading them to include the services 
 of the one-stop government services kiosk. 
<p>
      The kiosk concept is proving itself viable in delivering fast and 
 efficient government services to the public. However, before it is used 
 to collect and deliver sensitive information such as financial data, 
 critical issues including user authorization, privacy, and network 
 security must be addressed.[12] 
<p>
      Access to services through the electronic kiosk could be 
controlled 
 in the same manner as access to ATMs. A kiosk access card could be used 
 to access personal information in government files, including Social 
 Security account balances and security background information reports. 
 More general access could be provided without restriction for 
 information on federal programs and to government yellow and white 
pages 
 directories. 
<p>
      The functionality of a kiosk access card could also be expanded 
 through smart card technology. Smart cards could be used for additional 
 purposes such as storing and distributing data. This card could then be 
 used for electronic transfer of funds or to allow the user to receive 
 federal, state, and local benefits. 
<p>
 
 4. Implement an integrated governmentwide one-stop electronic bulletin 
 board system. (2) 
<p>
      The Customer Service Improvement Team should develop an integrated 
 one-stop electronic BBS by upgrading NTIS' FedWorld. A preliminary 
 implementation plan should be developed by November 1994. This system 
 should enable customer access, from a personal computer, to government 
 information, services, and databases via easy-to-use interfaces. The 
 upgraded FedWorld should not only be a locator service to federal 
 information, but be capable of "closing the deal" and providing the 
 information. Customers must be able to retrieve information from the 
 databases, order copies of reports, and connect, via links, to other 
 government information and services providers. 
<p>
 
 5. Work with private industry to advance the implementation of 
 technologies that provide citizen access to government information and 
 services. (2) 
<p>
      The Customer Service Improvement Team should begin to implement a 
 program, by December 1994, that actively encourages private sector 
 investment in technologies that will enhance public access to the 
 government. Partnerships with industry should be developed that 
 encourage and provide incentives for industry to assist government in 
 improving customer service. A strategic plan for this program should be 
 developed by November 1995.

<H2>IT04:Establish a National Law Enforcement/ Public Safety Network </H2>
<p>
 <b>Integrated Communications Simplify Emergency Response</b>
<p>
      Imagine this:  A fire following an earthquake is devastating a 
 large urban area in northern California. Several local, state, and 
 federal agencies--including fire and police units, state highway units, 
 and national guard and defense units--are rushing to the scene. Even 
 though they come from different jurisdictions, the units coordinate 
 easily because they share a common communications system. The fire is 
 contained quickly, emergency services are dispatched where needed, lives 
 are saved, and property loss is reduced as a result. 
<p>
      Whether they are responding to a natural or technological disaster 
 or performing search-and-rescue or interdiction activities, federal, 
 state, and local law enforcement and public safety workers must be able 
 to communicate with each other effectively, efficiently, and securely. 
 Most of this communication occurs over tactical land mobile radio 
 systems. 
<p>
      However, interoperability across these different radio systems is 
 difficult to achieve. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies 
 operate in different parts of the radio spectrum. Complicating this 
 problem is the lack of security on most systems, leaving them open to 
 interception and monitoring. When security is applied to the radio 
 systems--as isdone with many federal radio systems--interoperability 
 depends on having the correct encryption key to communicate. 
<p>
      Moreover, every federal, state, and local law enforcement agency 
 operates separate tactical networks in every metropolitan area in the 
 country. Often, there are several independent network control centers 
 operating within the same federal building with no interoperation. This 
 expensive duplication of effort prevents the use of spectrally efficient 
 equipment and results in less-than-optimum coverage for many agencies. 
 In addition, technical and administrative support is duplicated 
 throughout the federal government. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Recently, the National Telecommunications and Information 
 Administration, a part of the Department of Commerce, mandated that 
 federal radio users begin the transition to more spectrally efficient 
 (digital narrowband) radio systems beginning in 1995. The Federal 
 Communications Commission is currently addressing this same issue 
 applicable to state and local law enforcement and public safety. The 
 Associated Public Safety Communications Officers, Inc., is sponsoring a 
 federal, state, local, and industry effort to develop technical 
 standards for the next generation narrowband digital radio systems. 
<p>
      Over the next 10 to 15 years, all federal government radio systems 
 will be replaced with digital technology. If this is done on an agency-
 by-agency basis--as was done in the past--the cost will be enormous and 
 the same problems with interoperability will occur, resulting in costly 
 redundancies of equipment and staffing. Current budget conditions make
 it critical that the federal law enforcement, public safety, and 
 disaster response agencies coordinate the transition to digital 
 narrowband systems. Only through a coordinated approach will cost 
 savings be realized and the serious interoperability problems of the 
 past be overcome. 
<p>
      An excellent mechanism for addressing these complex issues--and 
 saving considerable dollars--is a shared infrastructure: a National Law 
 Enforcement/Public Safety Wireless Network. Development of this network 
 can be based on the efforts of two ongoing interagency initiatives. 
<p>
 ---The Federal Law Enforcement Wireless Users Group, a joint Treasury-
 Justice Department initiative, was formed to plan and coordinate future 
 shared-use wireless telecommunications systems and resources. 
<p>
 ---The Communications Interoperability Working Group, which 
 consists of representatives from the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, 
 and federal law enforcement agencies, under the auspices of the Office 
 of National Drug Control Policy, has been defining minimum baseline 
 requirements for current, secure, interoperable federal radio systems. 
<p>
 
      These new technological advances will permit the deployment of 
 intelligent radio systems that are feature enhanced, spectrally 
 efficient, and secure. Interoperability will be accomplished, and the 
 radio system can be connected to other fixed networks to improve
 the flow of information--e.g., fingerprints, mug shots, or criminal 
 records to the uniformed officer or special agent on the street. A 
 consolidated approach will result in numerous advantages in cost and 
 quality of service. 
<p>
  <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Formalize the Federal Law Enforcement Wireless Users Group. (1) 
<p>
      The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General will co-sign 
 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize the Federal Law 
 Enforcement Wireless Users Group byApril 1994. The MOU should define the 
 charter and membership of the group, which should include--at a minimum-
 -representation from all Justice and Treasury law enforcement agencies 
 and bureaus, with participation from other federal, state, and local law 
 enforcement and public safety stakeholders. 
<p>
 
 2. Establish a National Law Enforcement/ Public Safety Wireless Network 
 for use by federal, state, and local governments. (2) 
<p>
      The Government Information Technology Services Working Group should 
 issue a memorandum by July 1994 directing the Federal Law Enforcement 
 Wireless Users Group to coordinate establishment of an intergovernmental 
 wireless network. 
<p>
      The users group should work with the Office of Management and 
 Budget, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 
 the Communications Interoperability Working Group, the Federal Emergency 
 Management Agency, and state and local entities to: 
<p>
 ---further define costs and benefits, and develop budget 
 strategies; and 
<p>
 ---develop an implementation plan for the National Law 
 Enforcement/Public Safety Network to cover the next 10 years. 
<p>
 
      Responsibilities must be clearly defined, since the issue of which 
 agency or activity funds and controls the network will be a point of 
 contention. Establishment and use of the network must be handled at the 
 highest level to avoid turf conflicts and to focus on goals, roles, 
 methods, and relationships.

<p>
<H2>IT05:  Provide Intergovernmental Tax Filing, Reporting, and Payments 
 Processing</H2>
<p>
 <b>How to Get to Bed Early on April 14</b>
<p>
 Imagine this:  On April 15, a citizen receives a notice in the mail 
 from her state tax office. It contains a bill for her annual state and 
 federal taxes, and was calculated from records submitted electronically 
 by her employer and her bank. She verifies the bill, dials an 800 
 number, and pays her taxes by credit card. Her state and federal taxes 
 have now been completed in a matter of moments--with no annoying forms 
 to fill out. 
<p>
      U.S. taxpayers use and prepare financial data separately in 
 reporting tax information to federal, state, and local governments. 
 Although in some cases, the base level information required by the 
 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is used by the states, the filing form or 
 information input follow separate and distinct paths. 
<p>
      Efficient business practices require that a framework for a  
 "single information flow" be developed based on the premise that once 
 data is entered, it serves the needs of the entire enterprise. This 
 enterprise could be defined as all federal, state, and local government 
 agencies that require the same data from a reporting source. For 
 example, corporations or small businesses would report employee wages 
 and withholdings to a single government access point. Upon receipt by 
 the agency, the data could be used to update appropriate records held by 
 the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Labor, Department 
 of Veterans Affairs, state agencies, etc. This approach is but one of a 
 series of steps toward a virtual agency and one-stop access for 
 intergovernment transactions. 
<p>
      There are enormous costs associated with tax data processing. The 
 IRS annual operating budget for fiscal year 1992 was $6.7 billion to 
 collect $1.12 trillion in revenues. To collect these revenues, the IRS 
 processed 1 billion tax information documents and 204 million tax 
 returns.1 The federal, state, and local aggregated collection costs are 
 unknown due to the many types of taxes levied and the circuitous filing 
 paths for the various sales, real estate, property, income, and payroll 
 taxes. Innovative approaches to tax collection could lower overhead 
 costs significantly and simultaneously improve customer service by 
 reducing the burdensome, redundant filing techniques used today. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Federal, state, and local government policies need to foster close, 
 cooperative intergovernmental and interagency relationships that 
 eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and promote enhanced citizen 
 access to information and services. Joint electronic filing of wage and 
 tax data is perhaps one of the best examples of an application that 
 embodies these policies. 
<p>
      The IRS, Social Security Administration (with support from the 
 Office of Management and Budget), and Department of Labor are conducting 
 a Wage Reporting Simplification Project (WRSP). Cross-agency approaches 
 like WRSP should help ensure that "reporting once" pilot programs will 
 be in place in less than 2 years. Reporting once should include 
 providing financial data required to other agencies such as the 
 Department of Health and Human Services for entitlement purposes and the 
 Department of Labor for unemployment considerations. The phase 1 
 feasibility study for WRSP identifies potential life cycle savings of 
 $1.7 billion to participating government agencies and $13.5 billion in 
 reduced burden to private sector employers.2 
<p>
      An intergovernmental, single information flow concept for tax 
 filings, reporting, and payments processing will provide a seamless 
 government for the benefit of the taxpayer. Technology is present that 
 will enable this to happen. 
<p>
      The IRS is embarking on a comprehensive Tax Systems Modernization 
 program. Although the IRS automation effort will significantly lower the 
 cost of filing, auditing, and processing annual income tax data, 
 reengineering must be a vital part of the overall modernization 
 strategy.  
<p>
      This reengineering should include a broader intergovernmental 
 perspective and address new ways to conduct business with taxpayers, 
 business, financial institutions, and state and local governments. For 
 example, tax information for a large number of taxpayers is already 
 available to the IRS prior to taxpayers" annual filing. Financial 
 institutions, employers, and others report comprehensive financial 
 information about individuals to the IRS electronically or on paper. 
 Reported information includes wages, earnings on investments, and 
 certain financial transactions. The IRS thus has in hand all the 
 information it needs to compute taxes for 60 million filers. Yet it 
 still sends out enough forms to fill over five boxcars and requires 
 taxpayers to compute what the agency already knows. This practice 
 continues because, in most cases, these data are not converted to 
 electronic format for easy use until after taxpayers have filed their 
 tax returns. IRS could calculate returns and send a statement. So could 
 a state government, based on the same file. If IRS did this and if 
 electronic filing were used for all other individual income tax filings, 
 the IRS and state agencies would no longer need to mail the equivalent 
 of over 75 boxcars of forms. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>

 1. Integrate government financial filings, reporting, and payments 
 processing. (2) 
<p>
      The Secretary of the Treasury should  implement integrated 
 financial filings, reporting, and payments processing by January 1997. 
<p>
      This integration should address such areas as individual tax filing 
 and account settlement; business reporting, including wage and 
 withholding information; data from financial institutions; and other 
 employer and employee financial data required by federal, state, and 
 local government agencies. 
<p>
      The integrated filing, reporting, and payment processing program 
 should be piloted by the IRS to prove the concepts and quantify the 
 benefits--not only to citizens in terms of enhanced governmental 
 services, but to the governmental process at large. A network such as 
 the Treasury 's Consolidated Data Network and its successor, the 
 Treasury Communications System, could provide an evolutionary migration 
 path to full implementation minimizing the incremental costs. 
<p>
      To fully implement joint electronic filing of federal, state, and 
 local tax returns, all states and localities that levy income taxes 
 should agree on an uniform wage code that would enable the use of 
 electronic data interchange. Separate federal and state tax filings 
 defeat the purpose of trying to eliminate duplication and make 
 government more efficient. State and local information would similarly 
 flow to a federal access point for data interchange of financial and 
 employment information when required by any federal agency. 
<p>
      In order to make electronic filing more efficient, a digital 
 signature standard that can stand on its technical merits in a judicial 
 court challenge must be adopted.3 Presently, when citizens file returns 
 electronically, they are typically required to sign and mail a paper 
 certificate to the IRS to be matched with the electronic return. 
<p>
      To protect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals and 
 corporations, a method of electronic verification, coupled with a 
 privacy system that has the public's trust, must be employed. Without 
 these safeguards, public fears concerning disclosure of information and 
 governmental concern for data integrity would remain a problem.4 
<p>
      One possible scenario might be that a citizen uses an electronic 
 government services kiosk or home personal computer to file tax return 
 information with the IRS, including appropriate data the state and local 
 governments may require. The data would be transmitted to an IRS service 
 center to be processed, verified for accuracy, and then forwarded to the 
 state, thus meeting the filing requirements of both entities in one 
 step. This approach could be expanded to include the joint auditing of 
 financial data and the joint collection of taxes--the genesis of a 
 virtual tax financial data agency for business and individuals. 
<p>
      Both small and large business alike could benefit from the 
 reduction in the number of reports that have to be submitted to numerous 
 federal agencies and state and local governments. Simplified filing of 
 business financial and employment data could benefit small business 
 operators as desktop computers with communications capabilities are now 
 in widespread use. Until the infrastructure is in place, state and local 
 governments (or the Postal Service) could provide access service for 
 small business reporting and taxpayer financial information filing. 
<p>
 
 2. Determine ways to eliminate the need for filing routine income tax 
 returns. (2) 
<p>
      The Secretary of the Treasury should  eliminate or reduce the need 
 for filing routine income tax returns by January 1998. 
<p>
      The entire IRS filing process must be reengineered to be less 
 paper-intensive. Most of the required financial information is already 
 reported by business and financial institutions to the IRS. The IRS, not 
 the taxpayer, should prepare or process the tax information. Taxpayers 
 should only be required to file exceptions to the norm, e.g., unreported 
 income or transactions, unusual deductions, etc. An annual closing 
 statement could then be prepared and provided electronically to the 
 taxpayer for review, validation, and acceptance or reconciliation. The 
 primary emphasis would be on reconciliation before the fact rather than 
 enforcement and penalties after the fact. 
<p>
      Taxpayers could access the IRS data files by kiosk or by home 
 personal computer to confirm that tax computations are accurate. They 
 could then settle their accounts electronically by either paying taxes 
 due by a credit card or automated teller machine card or by directing 
 the refund to a designated account using electronic funds transfer.[5] 
 At any time during the year, the taxpayer would have the ability to 
 determine if withholdings track with projected year-end tax obligations.

<p>  
<H2>IT06: Establish an International Trade Data System</H2>
 <b>We've Got Fresh Tropical Fruit</b>
<p>
Imagine this:  A local businessman operates a specialized market in selling 
fresh tropical fruits and vegetables that have an extremely 
 short shelf life. His business was made possible thanks to the new 
 international trade data system that eliminates duplicate import forms 
 and allows speedy preclearance of international exports and imports. 
<p>
      The United States is competing in a global economy. The volume of 
 goods traversing international borders continues to grow. Over 40 
 federal agencies collect, process, analyze, and disseminate vast amounts 
 of international trade data to accomplish various trade-related 
 governmental functions, which include the collection of duties and the 
 enforcement of trade and contraband statutes. To accomplish its mission, 
 the U.S. Customs Service developed and operates the Automated Commercial 
 System (ACS). Today, this computer system collects complete trade data 
 on 95 percent of all U.S. import transactions, facilitates the movement 
 of goods by means of electronic releases, and interacts with more than 
 1,500 trade participants.[1] 
<p>
      Using ACS, Customs has established information-sharing capabilities 
 with several agencies including the Fish and Wildlife Service, Food and 
 Drug Administration, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of 
 Transportation. Work is in process to develop data exchange capabilities 
 with the Food Safety Inspection Service; Environmental Protection 
 Agency; and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Additionally, data 
 exchange capability exists with some foreign governments, such as Canada 
 and Singapore, for trade statistics and visa verification. Canada, 
 Mexico, and the United States are developing ways to develop uniform 
 trade documentation and procedures among the three countries. 
<p>
      Trade data information requirements are growing. For example, in 
 1986, one ocean carrier began receiving bill of lading and manifest data 
 electronically. In 1993, 76 carriers electronically supply ocean bills 
 of lading for 80 percent of all ocean import tonnage. In 1984, brokers 
 and importers represented 8 percent of all Customs data entries. In 
 1993, 1,324 brokers and importers provide 93 percent of the data entered 
 into ACS. They use the system to obtain release of cargo, pay duties, 
 update importer data, and carry out many more functions. ACS maintains 
 855 million trade records. On a daily basis, there are over 350 million 
 requests for information, and 600,000 transactions are processed.[2] 
<p>
      The Office of the United States Trade Representative, Department of 
 Commerce, International Trade Commission, and other agencies have access 
 to a number of other trade databases to support the development of trade 
 policy and the conduct of international trade negotiations. These have 
 been maintained on computer facilities operated by the National 
 Institutes of Health (NIH). However, NIH has advised these agencies that 
 new computer facilities need to be located to support these databases. 
 This presents an opportunity to revise and integrate these databases for 
 governmentwide access. 
<p>
      The U.S. Customs Service and other trade agencies have implemented 
 electronic systems to interface with the private sector for business 
 transactions. However, two different information-sharing standards are 
 now in use--the American National Standards Institute Accredited 
 Standards Committee X.12 and the United Nations Electronic Data 
 Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (UN/EDIFACT). 
 The UN/EDIFACT standard is a compromise between the U.S. standard and 
 the European Transportation standard.[3] In late 1992, the American 
 National Standards Institute voted to migrate to the EDIFACT standard by 
 1997.[4]  Close coordination of this migration effort among federal 
 agencies is needed to facilitate electronic commerce and the development 
 of interoperable computer systems. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      A basic problem in today's trade environment is that various 
 government agencies tend to develop costly systems and procedures on the 
 basis of their individual needs for trade information. In many cases, 
 individual agencies require duplicative reporting, resulting in enormous 
 and unnecessary costs to those U.S. interests involved in international 
 trade. In addition, the approach to system standards within the 
 government is fragmented. 
<p>
      Federal trade agencies and the private sector must have access to 
 trade data rapidly and accurately not only to enforce compliance with 
 existing laws and to account for revenues, but also to support U.S. 
 efforts effectively in a global marketplace. The executive branch uses 
 trade data in determining duty ratios, and Congress uses trade data to 
 make trade policy determinations. Although ACS maintains 95 percent of 
 current import data, there is not a similar reliable source of export 
 information. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, for example, 
 may have to go to 11 sources other than the U.S. Customs for necessary 
 trade information. There is no single source of reliable, accessible 
 trade data. 
<p>
    Without a single source, the same information is often 
 entered on many different forms during many different processes. For 
 example, one customs broker estimates that there are 14 different 
 processes now required for an import transaction. The number of required 
 processes depends on the type of goods coming into the United States.[5] 
 For some goods, multiple agencies must be notified and provide approval. 
 Paperwork related to export shipments is also very costly to the private 
 sector. It is estimated that for a single export shipment as many as 40 
 different paper documents may be required. The total cost of these 
 documents is estimated at between $150 and $200 per transaction, or 
 higher.[6] A customs broker is responsible for the import transaction 
 declaration on goods, which may be likened to a tax return being filed 
 for all imports. 
<p>
      In addition to Customs documentation, other government agency 
 regulations require the submission of forms for foreign trade 
 transactions. The Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental 
 Protection Agency, and the Department of Transportation, for example,
 require large volumes of forms. At one time it was estimated that in 
 excess of 4 million trade-related documents are submitted annually to 
 government agencies other than Customs.[7] 
<p>
      Since the import and/or export data must be entered on each form, 
 often manually, delays are frequent. The result can be missed delivery, 
 spoiled goods, and lost windows of opportunity (especially when trading 
 with other countries). These actions result in lost revenue both to U.S. 
 businesses and the government. 
<p>
      Federal agencies must provide or make available selected trade 
 information to partners of the United States. These partners include the 
 trade community (brokers, importers, exporters), the transportation 
 community (carriers, freight forwarders, couriers, the Bureau of 
 Transportation Statistics), and foreign governments. Other major users 
 of comprehensive trade data are the Trade Policy Committee and various 
 congressional oversight committees. 
<p>
      Existing agency databases and computer systems are limited in their 
 ability to integrate and disseminate trade data since none were designed 
 to support such a broad community of interest. For example, limitations 
 to ACS include difficulty in retrieving information, costly hardware 
 expansion, and 10-year-old software programs that are difficult and 
 expensive to maintain. Customs has established a Future Automated 
 Commercial Environment Team (FACET) to address these shortcomings and 
 chart a course for a future system. 
<p>
      An International Trade Data System, an expansion of the current 
 U.S. Customs Service ACS, is needed to provide the following 
 enhancements: 
<p>
 ---more accurate and complete trade statistics and data, 
<p>
 ---standardization of both import and export data collection, 
<p>
 ---reduction of government and trade community processing time and 
 costs, 
<p>
 ---knowledge to promote informed compliance with trade statutes, 
<p>
 ---elimination of duplication and unnecessary reporting, 
<p>
 ---enhanced fraud detection capabilities,
<p>
 ---improved financial controls, and
<p>
 ---immediate access to trade data.
<p>
 
      The existence of a reliable and easily accessible source of both 
 import and export trade information would streamline the trading 
 process, eliminate duplication and unnecessary reporting, and enhance 
 American competitiveness in the international marketplace. All the trade 
 data users will benefit from such a system; examples of its applications 
 include the following. 
<p>
 ---ACS is accessible via Treasury's Consolidated Data Network, 
 which offers the potential of a single communications network to link 
 the various law enforcement agencies responsible for guarding against 
 money laundering, the export of controlled high technology, and the 
 importation of narcotics, hazardous waste, and other contraband. 
<p>
 ---With an electronic means of using export data in one country as 
 import data to another and the corresponding rapid access of 
 information, a Customs official could evaluate a shipment before its 
 arrival at the border. Additionally, the system could provide 
 information to analyze and reject risky cargo and accept non-risky 
 cargo.[8] 
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 
 Develop and implement a U.S. Government International Trade Data System. 
 (2) 
<p>
      By April 1994, the Secretary of the Treasury should  begin 
 developing an International Trade Data System. The Treasury should seek 
 technical support for the project from the United States Trade 
 Representative; the International Trade Commission; the Departments 
 of State, Labor, Agriculture, and Commerce; and other stakeholders. An 
 implementation plan should be completed by January 1995, and submitted 
 to the Government Information Technology Services Working Group for 
 approval. 
<p>
      This project would be accomplished by establishing an integrated 
 database for the collection and dissemination of all international trade 
 data through the expansion and redesign of the U.S. Customs Service 
 Automated Commercial System. To implement the recommendation,
 Customs should expand FACET and make the team responsible for developing 
 a system design for a commercial environment that will reflect the 
 future needs of the U.S. government and the trade community. 
<p>
      The federal government must provide leadership to develop and 
 pursue a coordinated national electronic data interchange (EDI) policy 
 for interacting with domestic and international organizations. To date, 
 there has been no U.S. effort to assess the political and business 
 requirements for developing a comprehensive approach for the use of EDI.
 Migration to EDIFACT as a standard is now endorsed, although questions 
 still exist regarding its management and use--particularly its 
 relationship to other standards and responsiveness to regional and 
 national concerns. As a part of its trade data system infrastructure, 
 the federal government should provide proactive leadership in supporting 
 worldwide EDI policy and standards. Specifically, it should designate a 
 single government entity as the EDI policy and coordinating body.

<H2>IT07:  Create a National Environmental Data Index</H2>
<p>
 <b>Finding Out Which Way the Wind Blows (and the Rain Falls, and the Earth Quakes)</H2> 
<p>
      Imagine this:  A prospective homebuyer is looking for a location 
 for her home. She goes to an information kiosk at her library, where she 
 gets a printout of statistical probabilities of floods, earthquakes, and 
 major storms in various geographic areas. She is particularly pleased to 
 note the information provided about relative heat, humidity, and pollen 
 counts, since she suffers from various allergies.
<p>
       Environmental data and related information are created by several 
 federal agencies. For example, the Department of the Interior has 
 databases developed from biological surveys; the Environmental 
 Protection Agency collects information through the Environmental 
 Monitoring and Assessment Program; the National Aeronautics and Space 
 Administration collects satellite data; and the National Oceanic and 
 Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects vast quantities of 
 oceanographic, atmospheric, and geophysical data. The data collected 
 from these various systems are usually acquired for a particular 
 purpose, but frequently have multiple uses, such as the use of weather 
 data to investigate global climate change. 
<p>
      Innovative use of these available environmental data through 
 integrated data analysis and interpretation can be facilitated by 
 knowing what information is available and the source. There are many 
 potential government and nongovernment users of these databases in
 addition to the agency collecting the data. Among these users are the 
 general public, the business community, the international scientific 
 community, and researchers and government policymakers concerned about 
 the global environment. 
<p>
      The nation's investment in environmental data collection is very 
 high. For example, NOAA spends approximately $350 million a year to 
 support its satellite observing systems.[1] Similar high-dollar amounts 
 are invested in the satellite observing systems of other agencies, as 
 well as those on the ground and at sea. 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      In spite of the amount of dollars invested in the observing 
 systems, it is difficult for a user to find out what data exist, where 
 they are located, and how to gain access. For example, ocean temperature 
 data are critical to the study of climate, but there is no central focal 
 point where researchers can determine where the primary data are located 
 and where related data reside for correlation. At least 4 agencies and 
 10 data centers are involved in holding and archiving environmental 
 data.[2] One report concluded: "Scientists face major obstacles in 
 finding out what data are available."[3] Additionally, most data have 
 been collected without the benefit of data standards and existing data 
 may be of poor or unknown quality.[4] NOAA is the major holder of 
 federal environmental data. Its weather satellites, for example, have 
 collected over 150 terabytes (150,000,000,000,000) of data.[5] 
<p>
      Since most agencies are currently developing separate indexes of 
 their data holdings, integrating the information into a common index of 
 systems should avoid duplication and not be difficult. This common index 
 would provide a comprehensive mechanism to integrate the individual 
 agency data holdings into a cohesive system in the future. By using 
 electronic data interchange, users requiring the data would benefit from 
 easy location and access to the data. The index would allow citizens, 
 industry, and academia to locate and access needed information. 
<p>
      The creation of a unified environmental data index--an 
 environmental data "yellow pages"--will result in substantial progress 
 toward making environmental data acquired by the government available to 
 the many users that require or desire the data. 
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 Organize the implementation of a National Environmental Data Index. (2) 
<p>
      By July 1994, the Government Information Technology Services 
 Working Group should direct NOAA to organize the implementation of a 
 National Environmental Data Index. An implementation plan, including the 
 establishment of data standards, should be completed by November 1994. 
 This plan should recognize environmental data as a public resource to be 
 shared and not treated restrictively as the property of the scientific 
 community. The plan should address the frequency and method of updating 
 the data index. 
<p>
      NOAA should coordinate closely with the Environmental Protection 
 Agency, NASA, and the Departments of Energy, Defense, Interior, and 
 Agriculture to ensure unity of purpose. To implement the index, these 
 agencies should provide descriptions of their databases to NOAA. These 
 descriptions should include items such as type of data held, 
 geographical area, data elements available, and access arrangements 
 including methods for automating access. 
<p>
      The first phase in implementing this index is to coordinate the 
 development and use of environmental data gathered by government 
 agencies. The second phase will be to coordinate the indexing of non-
 federal and international environmental data.

 <H2>IT08:  Plan, Demonstrate, and Provide Governmentwide Electronic Mail</H2> 

<p>
 <b>Faster Than a Speeding Bullet(in)</b>
<p>
      Imagine this:  A citizen walks into a government office for job 
 counseling and information on training programs. Unfortunately, the 
 local counselor is not familiar with her particular job category. He 
 sends an e-mail message to an expert at the regional office. A few 
 minutes later, the counselor is sharing a detailed reply from this 
 expert with the jobseeker. In fact, he gives her an e-mail address she 
 can use to continue to communicate with the expert from her home 
 computer. 
<p>
      In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (Arpanet) 
 was created so that researchers at universities and other facilities 
 might share data and computational resources.[1] Soon these scientists 
 developed ways to use the network to transmit messages, known today as 
 electronic mail or "e-mail." Universities and regional networks then 
 connected their own systems to Arpanet, creating Internet. Today, this 
 cooperative network of networks links millions of computers throughout 
 the world. Moreover, e-mail on Internet and other networks has become an 
 important tool for industry and a growing market driver for commercial 
 networks and software suppliers. 
<p>
      E-mail has many applications. It provides rapid communications 
 among individuals or groups. Workers in an organization, within a 
 building or throughout the world, can use e-mail over local area 
 networks, telephone lines, or specialized data networks such as Internet 
 for easy, rapid interaction. The delays and frustrations of "telephone 
 tag" disappear, and many people can simultaneously interact. In effect, 
 workers can assemble and interact as teams without concern for location. 
<p>
      E-mail permits easy access across agencies and bureaucratic 
 boundaries. As such, it breaks down barriers to information sharing. 
 This can be as important within an agency as across agency boundaries. 
 Barriers to vertical communications are lowered by removing hierarchical 
 controls to communications.  
<p>
      E-mail can also minimize the need for personnel transfers or 
 expensive temporary assignments. For example, 53 engineers at Digital 
 Equipment Corporation (DEC)--spread across Massachusetts, Arizona, 
 Colorado, Singapore, and Germany--collaborated on a design project but 
 had never met and had talked on the phone rarely. DEC estimates that 
 this group finished its project one year sooner, and needed 40 percent 
 fewer people, than a team assembled in one building.[2] E-mail is also 
 cost-effective. According to Hewlett-Packard's calculations, a two-page 
 electronic mail message between any two HP employees worldwide cost on 
 average $0.22; a letter $0.51, and a fax $1.66.[3] And e-mail is faster 
 than all other methods, especially when more than one addressee is 
 included. 
<p>
      The infrastructure needed for supporting e-mail is widely in place 
 in universities and research establishments; most agencies that do 
 business with universities--notably those supporting research and 
 education--are major users. Agencies with e-mail capability use it for 
 rapid interaction with the public. Some have incorporated e-mail into 
 processes for grant and contract proposal reviews, saving the time and 
 expense of conventional mail for receipt of comments from expert 
 reviewers of proposals.
<p>
       Using e-mail, agencies working jointly on national research 
 initiatives, such as the High Performance Computing and Communications 
 Program and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, "meet" and 
 exchange information needed to manage complex cooperative programs. As 
 the infrastructure, personal computers, user-friendly software, and 
 telephone-based access have grown, some agencies have opened facilities 
 for general interaction with the public. 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Presently, over a dozen agencies, and (experimentally) the White 
 House and parts of both Houses of Congress are "on-line." Ultimately, 
 most federal employees should be reachable by e-mail. However, much work 
 needs to be done before this can happen. Issues of standards and 
 compatibility must be resolved. Additionally, many agencies desire 
 applications that are still not fully developed, such as file transfers 
 and multimedia mail. Many agencies have electronic mail, but few make it 
 available throughout an agency or use it to maximum advantage. The 
 federal government as a whole has an often incompatible mix of systems. 
 As the utility of linking internal systems together to conduct agency 
 business became apparent (and linking agency internal systems with more 
 global systems), several ad hoc interagency groups were formed to 
 examine various problems related to implementation. However, none of 
 these groups has the authoritative charters to accomplish the myriad 
 tasks that must be completed to optimize e-mail use. 
<p>
      In addition, several potential barriers of "traditional practice" 
 must be dealt with. The most difficult is a lack of understanding about 
 the various potential uses of e-mail. In addition, messages created in 
 the e-mail environment are treated by senders and receivers in much
 the same way as telephone conversations--privileged personal 
 communications. But messages, unlike telephone calls, are inherently 
 archival, which introduces records management, security, and privacy 
 concerns. The Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that agencies document 
 work that is used to transact official business--regardless of the 
 medium. Because official agency business will be conducted over 
 electronic mail systems, agencies must take steps to ensure that the 
 recordkeeping requirements of the FRA are met. 

      Guidance for agencies in meeting this requirement is not adequate 
 and should be strengthened and extended to reflect changes in records 
 management, privacy, and computer security. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Improve electronic mail and messaging among federal agencies. (2) 
<p>
      An existing interagency task force established by the Office of 
 Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
 (OIRA) should be charged to report by April 1994. The Department of 
 Health and Human Services presently chairs this interagency working 
 group, the E-mail Task Force, supported by the General Services 
 Administration.  As authorized by the Paperwork Reduction Act, OIRA is 
 overseeing the task force's work and coordinating it with other 
 initiatives. The task force is drawing expertise from existing 
 interagency information technology groups such as the Federal 
 Information Resources Management Policy Council, the FTS2000 Interagency 
 Management Council, and the High Performance Computing, Communications, 
 and Information Technology Subcommittee of the Federal Coordinating 
 Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. Four goals for this 
 group include: 
<p>
 ---Identify support for, provide advice to, and evaluate the 
 results of e-mail pilot programs currently underway. These pilot 
 programs should establish electronic mail capabilities among 
 departmental science and technology advisors and the White House Office 
 of Science and Technology Policy; departmental legislative affairs 
 offices and the Legislative Liaison Office and parties in the 
 alternative dispute resolution process of the Administrative Conference 
 of the United States. 
<p>
 ---Develop and issue a Request for Information to the private 
 sector. The Request for Information will outline the challenges faced by 
 the federal government in its progress toward electronic mail 
 interconnection and solicit possible technical solutions. The task force 
 will evaluate industry responses and use this information to fulfill its 
 other goals.
<p>
 ---Analyze the current use of Internet by federal agencies and its 
 potential contribution to both near and long-term e-mail requirements. 
 Coordinate proposals for improving mail interoperation with the High 
 Performance Computing and Communications Initiative via the High 
 Performance Computing, Communications, and Information Technology 
 Subcommittee of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, 
 Engineering, and Technology. 
<p>
 ---Develop a near-term program plan, including financial and 
 technical resource requirements, to assist agencies in improving their 
 capabilities for electronic mail. 
<p>
 
 2. Issue a governmentwide e-mail records management policy. (1) 
<p>
      In consultation with OMB, agencies, and the National Archives and 
 Records Administration (NARA) should issue a governmentwide e-mail 
 records management policy by April 1994. Some issues that NARA should 
 consider in revising its policy should include records management, 
 privacy, security, and permissible use.

<b>Establish Support Mechanisms for Electronic Government</b>
<p>
 <b>Introduction</b>
<p>
      Electronic government requires an information infrastructure. This 
 infrastructure consists of the technologies needed to allow information 
 to flow smoothly, as well as the operational policies, procedures, and 
 standards that support electronic government applications. 
<p>
      An effective government information infrastructure will lead to 
 complementary and cooperative interagency programs and an integration of 
 databases among these programs. Therefore, privacy and security issues 
 have the greatest priority. The public requires assurance that controls 
 exist to guarantee the integrity, security, and privacy of the 
 information the government maintains. 
<p>
      The government needs to improve the way it buys information 
 technology (IT). Additional Accompanying Reports of the National 
 Performance Review, titled Reinventing Federal Procurement and 
 Reinventing Support Services, contain specific recommendations on 
 improving IT acquisition.
<p>
     The initiatives in this section of the report require the support 
 and backing of federal, state, and local government as well as industry. 
 Incentives are needed to reward federal managers and private sector 
 contractors for innovations that result in successful 
 reengineering programs.
<p>
       Although the recommended actions in this report offer potential 
 savings in the billions of dollars, there will be some initial start-up 
 costs for innovative interagency projects. Certain measures can be taken 
 to finance pilot programs. These include creating a governmentwide 
 venture capital fund, initially seeded by taking a small percentage from 
 existing agency IT budgets to avoid the need for new spending 
 appropriations; multi-year funding of IT programs; and retaining savings 
 from IT projects for reinvestment in new IT initiatives. 
<p>
      A key element in realizing the vision of an electronic 
 government is government's approach to improving human resources for IT 
 management and use. Keeping pace with the service demands of citizens 
 and the advances in technology requires a full-scale shift from minimal 
 training to continual strategic learning.

<h2>IT09:  Improve Government's Information Infrastructure</H2>

<p>
 <b>Riding on the Information Highways</b>
<p>
      The vision of an electronic government requires computer hardware, 
 software, and telecommunications equipment to make data flow smoothly 
 across the nation's information highways. It also requires policies, 
 procedures, and standards to support the development and operations of 
 services that use the physical technology components. Practices and
 standards, for example, ensure that newly acquired hardware and 
software 
 are compatible with existing equipment and interoperable with other 
 systems to which they must be linked. Privacy and security practices, 
 methods, and standards ensure adequate user protection and systems 
 integrity.<p> 
<p>
      An effective information infrastructure requires high levels of 
 interoperation and integration among diverse users. For example, a 
large 
 enterprise might require high-capacity, high-performance, and expensive 
 technology, such as a fiber optic line leased from the phone company at 
 a cost of several thousand dollars per month. An individual, on the 
 other hand, could link to the same information infrastructure--at lower 
 capacity, lower performance, and lower cost--via a residential 
telephone 
 and a modem for a minimum access charge.  Technical requirements are 
 based on the amount of information 
 transmitted.
 .<p>
      The computer and communications industry is in a period of 
 rapid technological innovation producing a continuous revolution in 
 information processing capabilities and products. Notable among these 
 are (1) vast improvements in the ratio of price to performance in 
 integrated circuit design and manufacturing; (2) improvements in user-
 friendliness and the automation of complex procedures; (3) enhanced 
 interoperability among multi-vendor systems; and (4) universal access 
to 
 computer networks by both wireless and land-line connections. At the 
 same time, the telecommunications industry is creating new integrated 
 voice and data communications networks. These networks will provide the 
 critical underlying structure for rapidly accessing and receiving 
 information from assorted sources, rapidly coordinating actions, and 
 sharing resources across diverse, geographically distributed 
 organizations. 
 .<p>
      Elements of a nationwide information infrastructure are already 
 being incorporated into baseline federal, state, and local government 
 operations, based on capabilities provided by the private sector. The 
 federal government has contracts in place to take advantage of existing 
 telecommunications infrastructure for voice, video, and some data 
 communications services. The standard vehicles for agencies to acquire 
 these services are the FTS2000 contracts awarded to AT&T and Sprint by 
 the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1988. FTS2000 provides the 
 basic intercity telecommunications infrastructure for the federal 
 government. The various services available under the present contract 
 make it possible for a given agency to craft its own network services 
 based on its own requirements.
<p>
       In addition, Internet is a basic data communications 
 infrastructure for (computer-based) communications for some federal 
 agencies and much of the rest of the nation and the world. Today, this 
 cooperative "network of networks" links millions of computers 
 throughout the world providing the framework for an information 
highway. 
 Over 17,000 networks are linked in 102 countries, and many of these 
 networks contain thousands of computers.1 
<p>
      Internet makes possible collaboration and resource sharing among 
 millions of government workers, academics, educators, and researchers, 
 and a growing list of commercial organizations and services. Nearly 
half 
 of the presently attached networks are nonacademic in nature. It is a 
 rapidly evolving testbed for new information-based services. Private 
 citizens and business can gain access to Internet for a monthly fee. 
The 
 Internet is a common ground for linking governmental, academic, and 
 commercial networks for electronic mail. Most of the major commercial 
 on-line information and electronic mail services (Prodigy, CompuServe, 
 MCI, and AT&T) provide gateways to Internet. Major segments of the U.S. 
 component of Internet are funded by the Department of Defense (DOD), 
 National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National 
 Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other agencies that 
are 
 involved with research and development programs. 
<p>
      Federal agencies such as DOD, DOE, Department of Commerce (DOC), 
 and NASA are in the process of shifting their scientific and technical 
 information (STI) programs from paper-based operations to electronic 
 digital libraries. These electronic digital libraries will contain vast 
 quantities of agency-generated STI which can be accessed over the 
 National Information Infrastructure (NII). Test-bed electronic 
libraries 
 of STI are currently being developed using wide area information 
 servers, graphical user interfaces, and Internet connections. Common 
 policies and standards regarding federal STI will be essential in 
 simplifying the use of these databases and in providing one-stop 
 shopping for NII users.
<p>
       Recent federal initiatives improving access to government 
 information in electronic form--e.g., Office of Management and Budget 
 (OMB) Circular A-130 and the GovernmentPrinting Office Electronic 
 Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993--will accelerate the need 
for 
 electronic connections to the outside world for most agencies and 
 Congress. A wide variety of access methods will need to be supported, 
 including connection to publicly available communications networks, 
such 
 as Internet, Prodigy, and CompuServe, as well as dial-up access to 
 government-sponsored bulletin boards. Agencies must ensure that their 
 formats for information storage and linkages for interconnection are 
 compatible with these access methods. 
<p>
      Telecommuting is a potentially important application of the 
 infrastructure. Concepts include working from home or from facilities 
 located at the outer edge of large metropolitan areas, dividing time 
 between a regular office and a remote workplace, and combinations that 
 involve using remote or roving workplaces.[2] Recent action by Congress 
 directs GSA to facilitate the development of three pilot federal 
 telecommuting centers in Maryland and Virginia.[3] Telecommunications 
to 
 the base office will require high-speed data links for workflow and 
 videoconferencing to promote office interactions, training, and 
business 
 meetings. These inter-workplace telecommunications facilities will 
merge 
 with government's evolving information infrastructure and the more 
 widespread NII, thus blurring the workplace/home distinction. 
<p>
      State and local governments are moving forward on their own plans 
 to use advanced telecommunication systems. An example of one approach 
is 
 the Iowa Communications Network. It is envisioned as an advanced 
 information network providing voice, data, and video information 
 services to state and local agencies, libraries, local schools, 
 community colleges, and universities within Iowa. The state has been 
 coordinating its efforts with GSA, the Department of the Treasury, the 
 Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Postal Service to 
 investigate how such a comprehensive network could be used to integrate 
 the delivery of federal and state government services.[4] California, 
 North Carolina, and Texas all have major initiatives underway with 
local 
 telecommunications carriers. 
<p>
      The government's strategy for using information technology will be 
 refined and improved in the future as the national strategy, vision, 
 policies, and technology for the NII emerges. The government needs to 
 take action to ensure the compatibility of intergovernmental systems 
 with this evolving infrastructure. 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      The underlying technologies for the information infrastructure are 
 evolving rapidly, and no one can accurately predict the technology of 
 choice for the year 2000. The government must develop a coherent 
 information infrastructure to evolve with technology and support 
 electronic government. A cross-government coordinated plan for 
 infrastructure deployment is needed to reduce duplication, system 
 redundancy, and costs.[5] Significant opportunities exist for sharing 
 existing data and computing resources, reengineering delivery of 
 government services, improving the quality of service, and decreasing 
 costs. No single data center or single communications network can serve 
 all government information needs. The flexibility afforded by high-
 capability networking and new computing technologies can, however, 
offer 
 significant opportunities for cost savings by facility sharing and 
 "rightsizing" of local systems. .<p>

      The government must position itself to take advantage of the 
 evolving infrastructure by taking steps today to  coordinate its
 existing "components" of infrastructure--e.g., data  processing centers
 and  basic function applications. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Develop government's information infrastructure to effectively use 
 government information resources and support electronic government 
 applications. (2) 
<p>
      The Government Information Technology Services (GITS) Working 
Group 
 should coordinate the development of the government's information 
 infrustructure in order to help implement the strategic vision and 
 policy directions of the Information Infrastructure Task Force.[6] This 
 infrastructure should be developed as a joint partnership between 
 government, national laboratories, and universities on the one hand, 
and 
 the nation's information technology industry on the other; and in 
 coordination with the nation's broader research and development 
 initiatives (e.g., the NII initiative and the federal High Performance 
 Computing and Communications Program). 
<p>
      The Interagency Management Council--chaired by the Associate 
 Administrator of the GSA for FTS2000 with membership including senior 
 information resources managers of various government agencies--is 
 currently planning for the future replacement of the FTS2000 contracts. 
 This planning effort should include the transport requirements for the 
 government's information infrastructure and  ensure the replacement to 
 FTS2000 supports the development of the NII. 
<p>
      A key role that government can play is to require greater 
 interoperability among government systems. This can be facilitated by 
 focusing the FTS2000 replacement and individual agency procurement 
 requirements on systems that can interoperate, by working with industry 
 to explore partnering opportunities, by promoting standards, and by 
 identifying and removing regulatory barriers that may hinder 
development 
 of the NII.
<p>
 
 2. Consolidate and modernize government data processing centers. (2) 
<p>
      The GITS Working Group should  develop a governmentwide data 
 processing modernization plan by December 1994. The plan should 
 complement the working group's strategic information technology vision 
 for government resources and provide a road map for reducing the number 
 of data processing centers within two years of the plan's approval. OMB 
 should review the plan to ensure that these targets are met, and should 
 require special justification of new requirements for stand-alone data 
 processing installations. 
<p>
     OMB, in cooperation with the GITS Working Group, should update and 
 review the plan annually from a cross-government perspective in 
 conjunction with agency budget submissions. Additional opportunities 
for 
 consolidation and downsizing should be proposed by the working group 
and 
 incorporated into annual government data processing modernization 
plans. 
 For example, DOD developed a consolidation and modernization 
 plan--now being executed--that will consolidate over 100 data 
processing 
 installations into 16 efficient centers. 
<p>
 
 3. Reengineer basic systems for improved delivery of government 
 services. (2) 
<p>
      The GITS Working Group, by July 1995, in cooperation with OMB, 
 should develop a governmentwide plan addressing basic functions and 
 services to be reengineered, both within and across agencies.[7] The 
 plan should also include plans for interoperability among basic 
 administrative functions such as payroll, personnel recordkeeping, 
 management information systems, and financial and general ledger 
 accounting. 
<p>
      An example of reengineering would be to have current agencies 
 continue to set policies for specific benefits programs, with one 
agency 
 handling administration and coordination of integrated benefits 
 delivery. Another example of reengineering that will reduce cycle time, 
 steps, and pieces of paper handled is incorporating use of automation-
 based geographic information systems (GIS) data--such as streets, 
 property boundaries, parks, and police reporting districts--into 
revised 
 workflows and processes. The City of Minneapolis saved approximately 
$40 
 million in street design costs through integration of GIS into its 
 design process.[8] The City of Phoenix is extending its GIS-based 
access 
 to property records data from one department, where savings of over 
 $100,000 in recurring costs are expected, to all departments and 
 customers.[9] These revised process flows will yield increased service, 
 additional savings, and opportunities for cost recovery. 
<p>
      Reengineering will also allow many government administrative 
 support services to be streamlined. These services presently include 
 systems for payroll, personnel recordkeeping, grants, loans, 
 procurement, project management, management information, budgeting, and 
 financial accounting. Smaller administrative systems, such as 
 correspondence control, audit tracking, and legislative information 
 systems, should also be addressed. OMB should prioritize the phased 
 consolidation and standardization of selected integrated systems for 
 governmentwide use. 
<p>
      OMB, in cooperation with the GITS Working Group, should update and 
 review the plan annually from a cross-government perspective in 
 conjunction with agency budget submissions. 
<p>
 
 4. Consolidate and integrate federal government private networks. (2) 
<p>
      The GITS Working Group should compile an inventory of private 
 telecommunications networks currently in use within the federal 
 government by December 1994. The working group should evaluate this 
 inventory to identify opportunities for consolidating, sharing, and 
 interconnecting network resources among government agencies.

 <H2>IT10:  Develop Systems and Mechanisms to Ensure Privacy and Security</H2>
<p>
 <b>Business Relies on Secure Communications</b>
<p>
      Imagine this: A businesswoman walks into a post office, presents a 
 picture ID, and is given a "public key." Using this key card, she 
 electronically signs a federal contract and transmits it over the 
 National Information Infrastructure to a contracting agency. The 
 transaction is valid, secure, and paperless. 
<p>
      Automated teller machines (ATMs) are one of the most successful 
 examples of using information technology to improve service. Viewed with 
 skepticism at their introduction, they are now the principal means used 
 to conduct routine banking transactions.Fundamental to their success is 
 public confidence in the trustworthiness of the electronic banking 
 system. Indeed, people's chief anxiety about using ATMs is the fear of 
 being robbed while making a withdrawal. 
<p>
      A new type of crime is the "high-tech mugging," in which ATM 
 access information is stolen and used to make unauthorized withdrawals. 
 In a recent Brooklyn, N.Y., case, crooks used a hidden video camera to 
 look over the shoulders of people withdrawing money at ATMs. The camera 
 recorded their personal identification numbers (PINs); later the thieves 
 matched these with discarded receipts to withdraw money illegally. 
<p>
      In another ATM caper, crooks placed a bogus ATM machine in a 
 Connecticut mall. The bogus machine not only recorded hundreds of PINs, 
 but also read the private account information stored on each ATM card. 
 The bogus ATM machine returned cards to the unsuspecting owner and 
 displayed a message indicating that the transaction could not be 
 completed. These criminals later used the information to withdraw money. 
 In both of these crimes, the crooks succeeded in stealing over $100,000. 
<p>
      These cases illustrate real money loss by exploiting system 
 security vulnerabilities. However, they also illustrate the real 
 potential for a loss of public confidence in electronic government.[1] 
<p>
      Unless the information systems and electronic services delivery 
 systems protect the information being processed and the privacy of the 
 individuals using them, electronic government will not work. Government 
 is beginning to use the recent advances in information technology to 
 lower costs; increase efficiency and productivity; and collect, use, and 
 analyze far more information, much of it personal. 
<p>
      As government use of electronic services and information systems 
 grows more extensive and widespread, government and citizens will demand 
 continued confidentiality and integrity in the information processed. 
 Also, as government, businesses, and other organizations rely more on 
 electronic records and information, they will also demand more access to 
 diverse, interconnected databases. Information technology can provide 
 tremendous benefits in improved service and, used properly, enhanced 
 privacy and security. But without proper attention, it can also permit 
 inappropriate, unauthorized, or illegal access to information. 
<p>
      Furthermore, new electronic government applications--particularly 
 those focused on service-to-the-citizen programs--present nontraditional 
 challenges and vulnerabilities regarding accuracy, authentication, 
 privacy, and security. These challenges and vulnerabilities are both 
 technical and policy-related.[2] 
<p>
      Although overcoming the technical challenges is straightforward, a 
 tradeoff must be made between cost and risk. Information technology-
 based solutions and prototypes (cryptography, digital signatures, 
 security protocols) for protecting distributed internetworked systems 
 will soon be available. The implementation of these solutions should be 
 weighed against all identifiable risks. 
<p>
      Overcoming the political and policy challenges, however, is not 
 straightforward. Prominent among these today is the appropriate role of 
 the federal government in privacy and security. Examples of particularly 
 challenging policy issues include balancing national security interests 
 with private sector business interests, and maintaining a balance 
 between individual privacy and governmental efficiency. 
<p>
      The American people want trustworthy, readily available 
 information, and computer systems that are user-friendly, secure, and 
 protective of individual privacy. These systems must: 
<p>
 ---safeguard information, facilities, information systems, and 
 networks against illegal or unauthorized access, modification, or 
 disclosure; 
<p>
 ---balance access to agency information and records with 
 appropriate privacy controls; 
<p>
 ---respect private ownership of information and be subject to 
 policies and disclosure procedures for government use of individual 
 information; and 
<p>
 ---incorporate privacy and security safeguards early in the 
 design of the system. 
<p>
      Finally, as the nation develops information highways and expands 
 the national information infrastructure, systems should be designed and 
 used within a framework that 
<p>
 ---protects national security interests,
<p>
 ---permits legitimate law enforcement activities,
<p>
 ---enhances global competitiveness and productivity for U.S. business 
 and industry, and 
<p>
 ---ensures the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens. 
<p>
 
<p>
<b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Public acceptance and reliance on electronic information and data 
 requires 
<p>
 ---striking the proper balance between an individual's personal 
 privacy and the government's need for information, 
<p>
 ---providing a high degree of security against unauthorized 
 access or use, and 
<p>
 ---maintaining the accuracy of the information stored or processed. 
<p>
 
<b>Need for Privacy</b>.
<p>
       Americans are becoming increasingly concerned about 
 threats to their personal privacy resulting from wider use of 
 information technology to collect, maintain, and manipulate personal 
 information. A poll conducted in 1970 showed that only 33 percent of 
 respondents were concerned about personal privacy.[3] By 1990 polls, 
 that proportion had risen to 79 percent.[4]. 
<p>
      Although advancing technology can create new opportunities for 
 misuse, the real problem lies in the lack of adequate management 
 controls over those with access to personal records. For example, in a 
 recent well-publicized case, the U.S. Attorneys announced the arrest of 
 over two dozen individuals who engaged in schemes to buy and sell 
 information from Social Security Administration (SSA) computer files.[5] 
 Most of those arrested were current or former employees of the SSA or 
 the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector 
 General. This case brought to the public's attention the fact that SSA 
 employees in over 1,300 offices all across the country have unrestricted 
 access to over 130 million records on working Americans. In another 
 case, HHS's Inspector General found social security number fraud: An 
 SSA employee had used social security numbers taken from the SSA records 
 to obtain and establish credit.[6] 
<p>
      Giving increased attention to personal privacy policies and 
 procedures would allow the federal government to better represent 
 American business interests abroad, particularly in Europe, where 
 privacy protection approaches differ from U.S. approaches.[7] 
 Information, and the records associated with this information, is a 
 global commodity, which readily flows across international borders. 
 Trade conflicts and issues may arise for U.S. businesses when dealing 
 with the privacy laws of other countries, such as the recent privacy 
 laws advocated within the European Community for transborder flow of 
 information. 
<p>
 
<b>Need for Security.</b>
<p>
      As society becomes more dependent on computers and 
 computer communications systems for the conduct of business, government, 
 and personal matters, it relies more on the availability, 
 confidentiality, and integrity of the information these systems rocess. 
 Information security has become especially important for applications 
 such as electronic transactions where accuracy, authentication, or 
 secrecy are essential. 
<p>
      OMB estimates that by 2000 approximately 75 percent of public 
 transactions will be processed electronically.[8] The private sector 
 already uses electronic transactions widely. One trillion dollars in 
 worldwide banking and financial transactions occur each day.[9] Yet the 
 best security systems in use today lose money, credit and financial 
 reports, and private and proprietary data due to electronically 
 perpetrated theft and unauthorized browsing. For example, in the United 
 States, computer crime losses alone total $15 billion per year.[10] 
 These losses are minor when compared to potential losses from harmful 
 and illegal acts such as service disruption, terrorism, and industrial 
 espionage. The cost could be billions for a single debilitating 
 disruption of service or criminal act. 
<p>
      More than dollar losses are at stake. In distributed, 
 electronically based information systems, if access controls and 
 security concerns are not addressed as government proceeds with 
 reinvention, vulnerabilities to U.S. national security may be 
 inadvertently created by making information readily available to foreign 
 governments, competitors, or criminals.[11] Finally, large-scale service 
 disruptions could adversely affect recipients of federal benefits and 
 information-based services of all kinds. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>

      A division between sensitive unclassified and classified 
 information is statutorily mandated by the 1987 Computer Security Act. 
 The following actions use existing privacy and security boards, 
 councils, and groups. Exceptions are two near-term task forces to 
 develop high priority, essential standards or generally acceptable 
 principles needed for rapid progress in creating an electronic 
 government. 
<p>
 
 1. Establish a Privacy Organization. (3)
<p>
      The President should direct the Information Infrastructure Task 
 Force to advise on the establishment of a Privacy Organization within 
 the executive branch to serve as a focal point for both public and 
 private sector privacy issues. Such an organization would advise the 
 President on privacy issues and concerns affecting Federal agencies; 
 assist Federal agencies in identifying and resolving privacy issues 
 related to the implementation of their programs; coordinate U.S. privacy 
 policy with international organizations and foreign governments; and 
 assist and advise State, local, tribal governments and private sector 
 organizations with privacy issues and concerns. 
<p>
      The IITF should provide the President with specific recommendations 
 about the placement, membership, authority, powers, duties, (including 
 budget and legislative relationships), and staff size of such an 
 organization. If establishment of such an organization can be 
 accomplished by executive order, the IITF should create a draft 
 executive order for presidential approval. If specific legislation is 
 needed, the IITF should provide a draft of such proposed legislation. In 
 developing either/or both methods of establishing such an organization, 
 the IITF should seek comment from experts in both the public and private 
 sectors. 
<p>
 
 2. Establish uniform privacy protection practices and generally 
 acceptable implementation methods for these practices. (2) 
<p>
      The IITF by July 1994 should direct the creation of an interagency 
 task force to create uniform privacy protection practices for 
 information systems and generally acceptable implementation methods for 
 these practices. The task force should include membership from the 
 Departments of Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and 
 Human Services, Education, and State, OMB, and the Office of Science and 
 Technology Policy and should solicit participation and input from groups 
 such as business, consumer, computer science, telecommunications, civil 
 liberties, and state and local governments. 
<p>
      OMB should have a coordination and advisory role, and the chair 
 should be selected from the participating federal agencies. The task 
 force should be directed to prepare a report within 12 months following 
 its creation that details uniform privacy protection practices and 
 provides generally acceptable implementation methods for these 
 practices. Methods for implementing the uniform privacy protection 
 practices may differ by sector, e.g., health care, personnel, or law 
 enforcement. These practices and methods should be viewed as the 
 recommended privacy standards federal agencies will follow and the 
 private sector will consider. 
<p>
      The direction to the task force should require that the generally 
 acceptable implementation methods aggressively use information 
 technology--including the use of distributed interconnected systems--and 
 should effectively use technology to balance government's 
 responsibility to provide individuals a reasonable degree of control of 
 information about themselves and appropriate confidentiality with 
 government's desire for efficient and high-quality recordkeeping; 
 detection and prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse; and effective law 
 enforcement investigations. 
<p>
      OMB should issue new guidance (e.g., a circular), within six months 
 of receiving the task force's final report. This guidance will adopt, 
 for use governmentwide, uniform privacy protection standards and 
 generally acceptable implementation methods as set forth in that report. 
<p>
 
 3. Develop standard encryption capabilities and digital signatures for 
 sensitive unclassified data. (2) 
<p>
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 
 coordination with OMB and with technical assistance from the National 
 Security Agency (NSA), should issue a final digital signature standard 
 by December 1994. NIST, in coordination with OMB and with technical 
 assistance from NSA, should also create opportunities for industry to 
 develop the encryption capabilities required for protection of networked 
 distributed systems. NIST should then make that information available to 
 federal managers. A high priority should also be given to finalizing and 
 promulgating digital encryption standards and security protocol 
 standards. 
<p>
 
 4. Develop generally accepted principles and practices for information 
 security. (2) 
<p>
      NIST, in coordination with OMB and with technical assistance from 
 NSA, should plan and coordinate the development of generally accepted 
 principles and practices for information security which are to be 
 applied in the use, protection, and design of government information and 
 data systems, particularly front-line systems for electronically 
 delivering service to citizens. Draft guidance should be issued by 
 September 1994. More than one set of generally accepted principles and 
 practices may be required for the affected communities.
<p>
 
 5. Develop a national crisis response clearinghouse. (2)
<p>
      By September 1994, NIST, in coordination with OMB and with 
 technical assistance from NSA, should promulgate better security 
 information to the existing group of agency crisis response teams. This 
 clearinghouse should address security problems including collection, 
 analysis, and technical vulnerability assessment. It would also 
 disseminate information about incidents governmentwide. The mission of 
 this clearinghouse would be to serve as a broker of computer security 
 crisis information and of computer security resources. This can be 
 accomplished by expanding the role of the NIST program and by 
 formalizing Memoranda of Agreement that facilitate networking and 
 coordination among various existing independent crisis response bodies. 
<p>
 
 6. Emphasize the need for information security in sensitive unclassified 
 systems. (2) 
<p>
      OMB and NIST, with technical assistance from NSA, should 
 (1) improve planning capabilities for security by requiring an 
 information security plan to be part of each agency's strategic IT 
 plan; (2) identify computer security as a material weakness in the 
 Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act report if it does not meet 
 established thresholds; (3) require employees and contractors to 
 complete awareness and training; (4) improve planning for contingencies; 
 and (5) establish and employ formal contingency response capabilities. 
 These requirements should be included in future revisions to OMB 
 Circular No. A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, to be 
 issued no later than December 1994. 
<p>
 
 7. Reevaluate security practices related to national security data. (2) 
<p>
      By December 1994, the PRD Task Force--chaired by the Information 
 Security Oversight Office, in cooperation with the Joint Security 
 Commission, and the National Advisory Group for Security 
 Countermeasures--should aggressively pursue a reevaluation of 
 information security and information systems security practices. These 
 groups should also examine classification and safeguard practices for 
 the purposes of improving security within rapidly changing technological 
 and threat environments. This reevaluation should be accomplished within 
 the context of the Presidential Review Directives on national security 
 information and advanced telecommunications and encryption, as well as 
 the Presidential Decision Directive on public encryption management. 
<p>
 
 8. Foster the industry-government partnership for improving services and 
 security in public telecommunications.[12] (2) 
<p>
      Since government relies heavily on public telecommunications 
 systems (e.g., about 90 percent of DOD's telecommunications are 
 provided by public carriers), improved security, integrity, and 
 assurance of services is crucial. Electronic government will rely even 
 more heavily on public carrier telecommunications for services. 
 Fostering this relationship includes the following: 
<p>
 ---The voluntary and cooperative development of a unified concept 
 of operational security for new technological developments such as 
 universal personal telecommunications. The universal personal 
 telecommunications concept provides personal telecommunications services 
 regardless of location, terminal or network access point. For example, 
 individuals are assigned a unique personal network number so that 
 services may reach them anytime and anywhere in the network. Within this 
 context, the standards community needs to address the issues of national 
 security, emergency preparedness, priority, access, fraud, and 
 information privacy. The National Communica-tions System should work 
 through the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, 
 with technical assistance from NSA and NIST, to foster government and 
 industry liaison for developing security for Universal Personal 
 Telecommunications capabilities and ensure National Security/ Emergency 
 Preparedness. 
<p>
 ---The development and issuance of appropriate technical information 
 bulletins for shared industry use that address security assessments of 
 wireless access to commercial systems. The National Communications 
 System and the Federal Communications Commission, working with public 
 telecommunications services providers, should ensure information 
 bulletins address all telecommunications threats. 
<p>
 ---Working with industry to cooperatively improve security, 
 integrity, and availability of the public switched network (PSN) 
 provided by the telecommunications industry. The National Communications 
 System and industry, through the National Security Telecommunications 
 Advisory Committee and its supporting groups, should foster conducting 
 vulnerability assessments, sharing lessons learned, identifying 
 improvements in legislation to protect PSNs, reporting on vulnerability 
 incidents, and research on telecommunications security areas. 
<p>
 
 9. Implement the National Industrial Security Program. (2) 
<p>
      The Information Security Oversight Office, currently in GSA, should 
 aggressively continue to work with industrial organizations under 
 contract with the government to ensure the protection of classified 
 information while reducing costs and redundant requirements and 
 improving efficiency as described in Executive Order 12829, January 8, 
 1993, National Industrial Security Program (NISP).[13] This office, 
 along with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and Director 
 of Central Intelligence, should continue to work cooperatively with 
 industry to implement the NISP. The following should be considered as a 
 minimum: publication of a NISP operating manual; development of cost 
 collection and tracking mechanisms; development of governmentwide 
 standardized background investigation forms and processes, as 
 appropriate; standardized policy on reciprocity of investigations and 
 inspections; portability of security clearances across agencies; 
 development of uniform, standardized training and education requirements 
 for industry and associated curricula and competency evaluation for 
 government industrial security representatives; and the implementation 
 and enforcement of NISP standards. 
<p>
 
 10. Develop a comprehensive Internet security plan. (2)
<p>
      The existing interagency team, the Federal Networking Council, 
 chaired by the National Science Foundation (NSF), should, in 
 consultation with NIST and OMB, develop and promulgate a Federal 
 Internet Umbrella Security Plan, by November 1994, for interconnecting 
 the federal IT community with appropriate state, local, commercial, 
 public and private, and foreign government activities. Such a global 
 architecture should allow for security differences between networks. Use 
 of layered protocol standards and techniques can be employed with a 
 range or set of security service standards with appropriate gateway 
 protection devices so that small restricted communities and large open 
 communities can safely interoperate. The security architecture should 
 identify, as a minimum, the grades of services offered, how each is 
 implemented and assured, how interconnections between networks should be 
 made, and what can be done for those users not adequately served by any 
 of the agreed-upon standard grades of service. 
<p>
 
 11. Coordinate security research and development. (2)
<p>
      The GITS Working Group should direct NIST, in coordination with OMB 
 and with technical assistance from NSA, and the Office of Science and 
 Technology Policy's Federal Coordinating Council on Science, 
 Engineering, and Technology, to coordinate the development of a 
 governmentwide plan for security research and development (R&D). The 
 plan should be completed by December 1995. It should provide a baseline 
 assessment of the current R&D investment in privacy and security. The 
 plan should address development and prototyping of the next generation 
 of information systems within the context of appropriate, adequate 
 security and individual privacy features. The plan should also describe 
 a process for continuous technology improvement or advancement, which 
 includes evolving basic research into technology development and 
 prototyping initiatives followed by the introduction of mature features 
 into operational systems. Finally, the plan should recommend prototyping 
 experiments to accelerate use of new technologies in trusted
 systems and systems having individual privacy protection features.

<H2>IT11:  Improve Methods of Information Technology Acquisition</H2>
<p>
 <b>Purchasing Power to the People</b>
<p>
      Imagine this:  A government manager has a top priority special 
 project with a very short lead time. On top of that, the project depends 
 on use of a just-released proprietary software package. The manager 
 dials into an "electronic information technology marketplace" and 
 purchases the software on-line. The package is delivered within an hour, 
 and the project is under way. 
<p>
      Most Americans are used to the annual model change in the 
 automobile industry inspired in the 1930s by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., of 
 General Motors.[1] The extraordinarily rapid pace of technological 
 change in information technology (IT) hardware and software creates the 
 equivalent of three to five model changes each year.[2] The 
 microprocessor--the engine of IT change--is the driving force behind the 
 exponential rate of change.[3] Despite this rate of change, federal 
 government IT acquisition processes remain based on hierarchical 
 approval processes and dollar thresholds established in the 1960s when 
 computer systems were costly, often complex, frequently custom-designed 
 resources, available only from a limited number of vendors. Application 
 software was also expensive then, and typically available only from a 
 few vendors or developed by centralized in-house personnel. The IT 
 acquisition rules and regulations of this era were written to encourage 
 competition, control large dollar expenditures, and avoid waste when 
 buying uniquely designed systems. 
<p>
      Unlike the private sector, most government IT acquisition processes 
 also involve excessive layers of management oversight and regulatory 
 rigidity. These add to procurement costs by requiring vendor and 
 government teams to remain in place for lengthy periods and by ignoring 
 the short technology life-cycle of many of the items being procured. It 
 is not uncommon for the hardware and software ultimately delivered to a 
 government agency to be immediately upgraded--or need to be upgraded--to 
 stay current with commercial standards. 
<p>
      An excessive part of the government IT acquisition process is 
 devoted to obtaining approvals in advance of actual IT procurement. 
 Existing agency standard authorization levels from the General Services 
 Administration are far too low--currently $2.5 million per individual 
 acquisition. Even government credit card purchase authorization levels 
 are so low--$500 in some agencies--as to preclude their use in 
 purchasing even simple personal computers and associated items. A 
 reasonable increase of card purchase authorization levels for IT items 
 would instantly reduce the time required by procurement processes and 
 allow government managers to implement new programs quickly and 
 responsively. Private sector IT acquisition personnel, who generally 
 have the flexibility and skills to deal efficiently and effectively with 
 the rapidly changing IT market, save money for their employers. Real 
 taxpayer savings can result from not wasting valuable government staff 
 time on process issues.
<p>
       Another of the most time-consuming and costly aspects of the 
 current government IT acquisition process is the use of paper documents 
 in preparing and exchanging solicitation, proposal, and negotiation 
 information and subsequent contracts, reports, invoices, and payments. 
 Many vendors feel that the IT acquisition process is more focused on the 
 production of documents than the acquisition of IT goods and services. 
 The importance most government acquisition staffs place on bureaucratic 
 process issues delays the solicitation process and raises vendor costs. 
 The emphasis on process also deflects vendor efforts away from providing 
 the best IT products at the lowest price. An important part of the IT 
 acquisition function is to facilitate industry access to agency IT 
 buying plans and requirements as well as facilitate agency access to 
 industry IT product and service offerings and technology plans in an 
 arena where short technological life-cycles have demonstrated the need 
 to fundamentally change acquisition processes. For more effective 
 government IT acquisitions, there needs to be an improved ability to 
 better differentiate state-of-the-art from state-of-the-practice 
 technology.[4] 
<p>
      A number of private sector firms--particularly in the automobile 
 manufacturing sector--have begun to integrate information systems with 
 those of their suppliers.[5] This approach virtually eliminates all 
 paper involved in the acquisition process and facilitates close and 
 continuing information exchange between buyer and supplier throughout the
 product acquisition life-cycle. 
<p>
      With IT hardware and software technological life-cycles now 
 frequently measured in periods as short as a few months, existing IT 
 procurement processes (such as the GSA Multiple Award Schedule system 
 with its infrequent updates) simply cannot keep up with new product 
 introductions or price reductions for products achieving unusual 
 marketplace success. In addition, IT product offering and price 
 comparisons between different vendors' products are difficult to make 
 rapidly and easily when large numbers of individual paper documents are 
 used, thus reducing competition. The slow change process of the GSA 
 schedule precludes government agencies being able to take advantage of 
 the often lower street prices for many IT products. Great effort is 
 frequently expended to justify going "off schedule" to obtain desired 
 products at lowest cost. When program funds exist, the government should 
 buy off-the-shelf and commodity-type IT products in the same manner
 as do commercial firms and private citizens: This will dramatically 
 shorten the IT acquisition process and result in considerable savings. 
<p>
      Finally, unlike the private sector, there are virtually no 
 mechanisms that allow government IT procurement officials and their 
 staffs to see how IT acquisition process documentation and time delays 
 represent real, quantifiable costs. The government does not use 
 accounting practices that would allow these costs to be reflected as 
 part of the total recorded cost of the IT goods or services being 
 acquired. Knowing how acquisition process costs inflate overall IT costs 
 will permit program and line managers to take action to reduce total IT 
 expenditures. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      The basic rules of the road for IT acquisitions are found in the 
 Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended.[6] 
 When IT acquisition provisions were originally added to the act in 1965, 
 the only IT items being purchased were large, expensive, mainframe 
 computer systems. Although computers are now more widespread in 
 government offices than typewriters were 20 years ago, and software is 
 often published in the tens of thousands of copies and is shipped to 
 users in shrink- wrapped boxes, the same IT procurement rules and 
 processes continue to be followed. As a result and unlike private sector 
 practices, federal government agencies now frequently spend excessive 
 amounts of time and effort acquiring IT items that are not commensurate 
 with either the cost or the technology life-cycle of the items being 
 procured. Even simple procurements for off-the-shelf items take far too 
 long, thereby delaying arrival and use of hardware and software needed 
 for effective program implementation. 
<p>
      GSA, through existing IT procurement delegation levels, has limited 
 executive branch agency authorizations to no more than $2.5 million for 
 an individual acquisition. While agency size and IT competence obviously 
 vary, it seems reasonable that a new approach to GSA oversight should be 
 considered. Increased agency authorization levels would give agencies 
 substantially more freedom to manage their own IT affairs. The existence 
 of a vigorous General Accounting Office, agency inspectors general, and 
 GSA information resource management program reviews should provide the 
 necessary oversight for those agencies unable or unwilling to manage 
 their IT affairs effectively. 
<p>
      Because off-the-shelf IT tools are now often integral to even 
 simple program implementation, the frequent delays in government program 
 execution caused by an inability to acquire IT tools quickly need to 
 end. Such delays, although quantifiable, are rarely recorded in 
 government accounting systems or even recognized as an added cost of 
 government operations. Program or line managers, having received budget 
 authority for the function under their direction, should have the 
 authority to buy a fully configured personal computer and relevant 
 software when program conditions require immediate action. 
<p>
      Process reengineering techniques hold the most promise for allowing 
 government users to be quickly supplied with state-of-the-art IT tools 
 at competitive prices.[7] A reengineered IT acquisition process for 
 short technological life-cycle, off-the-shelf IT tools can be achieved 
 by creating an "Electronic IT Marketplace."  This marketplace would 
 allow: 
<p>
 ---a dramatic decrease in the length of time it takes to get from 
 product announcement or requirement definition to contract award so as 
 to speed up the implementation of government programs dependent on IT 
 tools; and 
<p>
 ----a substantial decrease in the costs--both of the IT acquisition 
 process itself and of the accompanying program office and vendor staff 
 time involved.[8] 
<p>
       Implementation of such a dramatically new acquisition process like 
 an "Electronic IT Marketplace" will not be easily accomplished. 
 Because virtually all the existing statutes and regulations were 
 developed with paper-based transactions in mind, many adjustments will
 be needed. The benefits of a dramatically faster, more streamlined, and 
 more efficiently reengineered IT acquisition system are more than 
 sufficient to justify the preparatory work required to test the concept. 
<p>
       The use of antiquated, paper-based processes in much of the federal 
government imposes a substantial cost to the business being conduted. 
Because these costs are not captured by government accounting sysems, they 
are often thought invisible. Chrysler Corporation, for exampe, attributes 
much of its ability to bring new models to market more quickly than its 
competitors to the combination of an innovative taff team approach and the 
building of a new, IT-intensive Automotive 
 Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The technology in this new 
 center allows for easier and more rapid communication of information 
 among all team members, regardless of whether they are physically 
 adjacent. Using IT tools instead of paper, new body designs existing 
 only on a computer's screen are used to directly control the carving of 
 clay models of proposed new designs. This innovative use of IT, 
 eliminating the paper and most of the manual work previously required 
 with traditional approaches, allows new models to be brought to market 
 more quickly. 
<p>
      Government can slice substantial amounts of time and cost from its 
 acquisition process--not just for IT items, but for everything it buys--
 simply by eliminating the need for paper documents and records.[9] 
 Measured over any reasonable life-cycle, getting the paper out of the 
 system will pay the taxpayers dividends in the form of lower taxes just 
 as an IT-intensive environment has enabled Chrysler to bring new models 
 to market at lower prices. Other than additional government automation 
 and networking resources, there are relatively few impediments to moving 
 to a paperless electronic data interchange (EDI) acquisition system. 
 Vendors should appreciate an EDI system because it will reduce their 
 costs as well. 
<p>
      To enable government managers to make IT acquisitions with 
 efficiencies approaching those found in the private sector, providing 
 visibility to IT acquisition process costs and including them as part of 
 program implementation costs is of exceptional urgency. If IT 
 acquisition costs are removed from overhead accounts, the fees charged 
 by executive branch acquisition entities can be budgeted for within 
 program activity budget submissions and included in program activity 
 accounting systems as a separately identifiable expense for each 
 individual acquisition requiring such support. The added costs the 
 present IT acquisition process imposes on IT tools when they are 
 purchased by the government will thus be highlighted, allowing managers 
 to manage more effectively.[10] For example, at present, the costs of IT 
 acquisition support provided by the Defense Commercial Communications 
 Office, a fee-for-service organization, are capped at 2 percent. 
 Removing IT acquisition staff costs from overhead accounts and placing 
 them on a fee-for-service basis--combined with program manager freedom 
 to negotiate the most cost-effective arrangement possible from any IT 
 acquisition office--will promote competition among acquisition 
 organizations and give program managers the opportunity to be held 
 accountable for their own and their program's effectiveness.[11] 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Actions</b><P>

      Although the following actions are recommended in other NPR 
 accompanying reports, they are summarized here to show how they 
 collectively address the acquisition problems facing the IT community. 
<p>
 1. Conduct a two-year pilot test of a modernized IT acquisition 
 framework. (1)  
<p>
      The administrator of GSA should conduct a two-year pilot test of a 
 modernized IT acquisition framework. 
<p>
 2. Increase delegation of authority to agencies. (1) 
<p>
      The administrator of GSA should increase delegation levels for 
 competitive IT procurements. 
<p>
 3. Expand use of commercial credit card. (1) 
<p>
      The heads of all federal agencies and the Federal Acquisition 
 Regulatory Council should adopt the recommendations for expanding the 
 use of the International Merchants Purchase Authorization Card. 
<p>
 4. Pilot test innovative approaches under the Multiple Award Schedule 
 program. (1)  
<p>
      The administrator of GSA should begin a pilot test of an 
 "electronic IT marketplace." 
<p>
 5. Expand electronic commerce. (2) 
<p>
      The President should issue a directive establishing a 
 governmentwide program for engaging in electronic commerce, and the 
 Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council should revise the Federal 
 Acquisition Regulation to support full implementation of EDI. 
<p>
 6. Provide incentives for improved IT acquisition service efficiency. 
 (2)  
<p>
      The President should issue a directive  instructing agency heads on 
 franchising service functions, OMB should establish an Implementation 
 Team to facilitate franchising implementation, and the President's 
 Management Council should assume overall responsibility for franchising 
 implementation for IT acquisition activities. Simultaneously, agency 
 heads should authorize executive branch agency program and line managers 
 to use any officially established IT acquisition entity conducting 
 business in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

<p>
<H2>IT12:  Provide Incentives for Innovation</H2>

<p>
 <b>Creating the Win-Win Scenario</b>
<p>
      Federal agencies expect to spend over $25 billion in fiscal year 
 1993 to buy and use information technology (IT) but the dollars are 
 being used so agencies can work faster--not smarter.1 Agency use of IT 
 has failed to keep pace with private industry, where IT innovations have 
 enabled companies large and small to reengineer their business 
 practices. More IT dollars must be focused on the innovation 
 needed for government reinvention as opposed to the automation of 
 existing processes. 
<p>
      To promote innovation, the government needs to reinvent its funding 
 of information technology and its relationships with the IT industry. 
 Agencies must be encouraged to experiment and accept managed risks, 
 which are inherent in innovation. Agencies, the IT industry, and the 
 public will benefit from funding mechanisms and contract terms that 
 encourage the continual introduction of IT solutions--and make 
 government more responsive. 
<p>
      Four recommendations are presented here to foster much needed IT 
 innovation in and among agencies by overcoming fiscal, procedural, and 
 cultural barriers and by providing opportunities for creative 
 partnerships between government and the IT industry: 
<p>
 ---retain a portion of agency IT savings for reinvestment, 
<p>
 ---promote performance-based contracting for IT,
<p>
 ---use multi-year funding for agency IT projects, and 
<p>
 ---establish a governmentwide venture capital fund for innovative IT 
 projects. 
<p>
 
<b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      The Budget Paradigm: 
     Today, agency IT managers have few organizational incentives to
 innovate.[2] In addition to the cultural resistance that reinvention can
 generate, funding of new IT initiatives has become increasingly difficult.
 Agencies face budget reductions in direct response to any savings
 generated by IT innovation. IT managers are thereby provided with negative
 incentives to challenge the prevailing culture and accept the risks
 inherent in innovation. New investment in and experimentation with IT is
 relegated to a low priority in the face of recurring budget constraints. 
<p>
      Agency budgets must include the funds for IT innovation as well as 
 the funds to operate, maintain, and modernize existing information 
 systems. Agencies that have successfully innovated using IT must be 
 allowed to continue IT investment and experimentation. Success-based 
 funding of IT innovation would provide a new incentive for managers to 
 reinvent agency business practices, since the funds available for new IT 
 investment would relate to savings previously achieved. 
<p>
      Contracting Practices.
 With the technical complexity of IT procurements, most agencies have
 favored low-risk, fixed-price contracts that place the IT industry in the
 role of a supplier of commodities rather than a partner in innovation.
 This approach may work when agencies want IT commodities, but it is
 unresponsive to agencies seeking creative IT solutions, since the
 contractor is encouraged to sell as much of the offered product or service
 as the agency is willing to buy. For example, agencies frequently lease
 equipment from a contractor. Since the contractor needs to fully
 depreciate the investment in capital equipment being leased to the
 government, the contractor is discouraged from recommending solutions that
 would result in termination of the lease. The leased equipment remains in
 the agency despite the availability of new, more cost-effective products.
 Under these circumstances, there are few incentives for the IT industry to
 partner with agencies to get current technologies in place. 
<p>
      Contractors must be allowed to be more than suppliers of goods and 
 services. Contract terms need to incentivize the contractor to perform 
 as a partner, potentially permitting the contractor to share in actual 
 cost savings realized by the agencies in implementing new solutions 
 while minimizing the financial risks when agencies accept new solutions 
 in place of old. Agencies need to create win-win scenarios for 
 government-industry relationships. This points to making improvements in 
 the contract vehicle itself. 
<p>
      The objectives of major IT initiatives are not easily met by a 
 single contract type. The acquisition of innovative information 
 technology often requires a complex systems integration effort that may 
 best be articulated as a combination of fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, 
 incentive, indefinite delivery, time-and-materials, and labor hour 
 provisions within an overall contract structure. Integral to the 
 contract, clauses incorporating performance incentives, award fees, and 
 value engineering must be crafted as positive instruments of reinvention 
 through IT innovation rather than high-risk exceptions to
 accepted procurement practice. 
<p>
      Through effective management of hybrid contracts, industry IT 
 providers can be given performance-based incentives for making the 
 government more effective and efficient. Where contract terms and 
 conditions allow the industry provider to increase profits by saving the 
 government money, a win-win scenario is created. The price curves in IT 
 hardware and the rapid pace of technology evolution make this scenario 
 possible. For example, a creative solution that uses IT to save an 
 agency $1.00 can be shared as $0.50 in savings to the government and 
 $0.50 in increased profits to the industry provider. This solution truly 
 puts the government and industry in a strategic partnership, working 
 together and using IT-based approaches to reengineer government. 
<p>
      The Office of Federal Procurement Policy has previously encouraged 
 the use of performance and quality measures in service contracts, but 
 limited knowledge and mixed experiences with this type of contracting 
 have resulted in uneven implementation by the agencies.3 Agency IT 
 managers and contracting officials need to be educated and encouraged to 
 use performance-based contracting techniques for IT. Hybrid contract 
 types and contractual relationships based on partnership represent a 
 significant culture change to many in both the government IT and 
 contracting communities. As a starting point, a reeducation process is 
 needed to change the common perception of the Federal Acquisition 
 Regulations (FAR) as imposing an inflexible structure for government 
 contracting.4 Too few government IT acquisitions have effectively used 
 the latitude provided by the FAR.
<p>
      However, success stories will need to demonstrate the advantages of 
 this approach on a pilot basis before the risks of trying something new 
 will be accepted more broadly. As an example of successful performance-
 based contracting, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
 has documented its experiences with the HUD Integrated Information 
 Processing Services (HIIPS) procurement, a 12-year contract valued at 
 $540 million. The HIIPS program office used performance mechanisms to 
 create a strategic partnership with a vendor that has realized savings 
 for the government in excess of $30 million 
 since 1991.5 
<p>
 
 <b>Funding for IT.</b>
<p>
     Major reinventions based on innovative uses of IT may begin with 
 discrete, well-defined pilots, but are typically implemented as complex, 
 multi-year programs. Such programs experience schedule changes because 
 of a variety of unpredictable circumstances, with corresponding 
 adjustments in required funding. The annual appropriations process is 
 inconsistent with the funding flexibility required to effectively 
 conduct these programs and efficiently acquire IT. On the contrary, the 
 year-end spending phenomenon of annual appropriations works against IT 
 innovation by encouraging agencies to acquire IT commodities that 
 support current agency automation practices. Existing IT solutions and 
 technologies are perpetuated and become more difficult to reengineer 
 based on the ever-increasing "sunk cost." Contracts become "dumping 
 grounds" in the recurring year-end "spend it or lose it" syndrome of 
 fiscal year funding. For example, analysis of the federal government's 
 purchasing practices have shown that 50 percent of all personal 
 computers are purchased in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.[6] The 
 multi-year characteristics of IT programs demand more flexible funding 
 mechanisms to provide effective funding support. 
<p>
      IT innovations that are authorized by specific appropriation should 
 be provided multi-year funding. Although multi-year funding can be 
 accomplished now through the appropriations process, it is done 
 selectively. Greater emphasis on multi-year appropriations is needed for 
 IT innovation. Another means of providing multi-year funding is through 
 the use of legislatively established working capital funds (WCFs). One 
 current example of the benefit of multi-year IT funding is available 
 from the Department of the Treasury. The department operates its working 
 capital fund in conjunction with its Executive Agent Program to fund 
 selected agencywide IT projects.[7] This approach has generated 
 documented savings conservatively estimated at $45 million. The Treasury 
 attributes these savings directly to the multi-year aspects of its fund. 
 Additional savings have also been realized through the reduced staffing 
 requirements and economies of scale inherent in an agencywide 
 program.[8] 
<p>
      Current legislation authorizes several agencies to operate such 
 funds.[9] However, the legislation does not consistently address IT 
 services within the scope of these funds. New legislation to revise WCFs 
 to support IT innovation may be required. In addition, effective use of 
 multi-year funding requires concerted agency effort. As the fund 
 manager, an agency must have in place the expertise and procedures to 
 ensure accountability of the funds expended for each IT program on a 
 continuing basis over multiple fiscal years. This requirement can 
 present a challenge to agencies unfamiliar with this funding 
 arrangement, but the experience of agencies with successful track 
 records managing similar funds can serve as a resource base. For 
 example, the Treasury publishes a handbook that documents
 the specific procedures that department has used to successfully manage 
 major IT programs funded through its WCF.10 
<p>
      In today's budgetary environment, proposals for innovative 
 interagency use of IT are viewed as low priorities compared to the 
 operation, maintenance, and modernization of existing agency systems. 
 Even promising IT pilots often fail to achieve full implementation. 
 Senior managers are too often unwilling to risk scarce agency dollars on 
 IT innovations with current agency operations and personal careers at 
 stake. This business-as-usual approach to IT funding by agencies will 
 not generate the innovative solutions that are the core of government 
 reinvention. No mechanism currently exists to identify and fund cross-
 cutting innovations that will have multi-agency or governmentwide 
 impact. 
<p>
      IT innovation should be fostered governmentwide through the 
 creation and operation of a fund that operates as the analog of a 
 venture capital firm in the private sector. This fund
 complements the Innovation Capital Fund recommended in a companion NPR 
 report.[11] Operation of a venture capital fund would allow agency 
 innovators to compete for available funding, ensure that agency 
 initiatives are screened through a critical due diligence process, and 
 permit agency resources to be augmented by the fund to enable selected 
 reinvention projects to proceed. However, the fund's benefit would not 
 be just as a dollar pool for funding IT. A governmentwide IT innovation 
 program would draw the attention and participation of state and local 
 governments and the IT industry, all of whom stand to benefit from IT 
 innovation in government. Thus, the manager of the fund would be
 positioned to broker the expertise and resources of other interested 
 parties in fund-sponsored projects further leveraging fund dollars. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Retain a portion of agency information technology savings for 
 reinvestment. (2) 
<p>
       By July 1994 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
 should instruct agencies to identify IT savings in agency budget 
 submissions for potential reinvestment starting in fiscal year 1996. As 
 part of its instructions, OMB should establish the reporting 
 requirements by which agencies quantify IT savings and track 
 reinvestment in successive fiscal years as part of agency budgets. The 
 instructions to initiate this budget process must be available to 
 agencies no later than July 1994, to accommodate the fiscal year 1996 
 budget cycle. 
<p>
      Another NPR accompanying report proposes that up to 50 percent of 
 agency appropriations unobligated at the end of a fiscal year be 
 identified for carryover to the next fiscal year.[12] For IT savings, 
 this could be accomplished in two ways. During the current fiscal year, 
 recognized savings could be transferred to an agency's WCF to support 
 IT innovation.[13] In future years, recognized savings could be 
 identified within the annual budget and appropriations process and 
 included in agency appropriations. Through these two mechanisms, a 
 percentage of recognized savings would effectively be carried forward to 
 fund credible programs for IT innovation and experimentation. Such 
 programs would specifically take advantage of new IT technology, 
 demonstrate measurable improvements in agency services, and realize 
 additional savings. 
<p>
      OMB should also collaborate annually with the General Accounting 
 Office to identify the minimum agency accounting procedures and 
 performance measurement criteria required to support agency claims of IT 
 savings. This will facilitate agreement between OMB and congressional 
 appropriations committees on the specific agency savings that will be 
 considered for reinvestment. Results of the collaboration should be 
 reflected in the OMB instructions recommended earlier. 
<p>
      Success-based funding must be grounded in an auditable baseline of 
 agency performance in terms of outcomes and costs in order to attribute 
 specific savings to IT innovation. Only those agencies that meet the 
 challenge of demonstrating auditable results would receive the benefits 
 of success-based funding. Consistent accounting procedures and 
 performance measurement criteria must be employed across agencies to 
 clearly identify those savings resulting from IT innovations. The close 
 relationship between documented agency savings from IT innovation, 
 agency budgets, and the appropriations process point 
 to the central role of OMB in implementing success-based funding. 
<p>
 
 2. Promote performance-based contracting for information technology. (2) 
<p>
      The Administrator of GSA, by April 1994, in coordination with the 
 interagency team developing a plan for Federal IT acquisition, should 
 lead a governmentwide effort to promote performance-based contracting 
 for IT, starting with the preparation of an action plan by July 1994. A 
 concerted effort is essential to address the needed revision of agency 
 IT acquisition practices, development of new training materials, and 
 publication of case studies to exemplify performance-based contracting. 
 Consideration should also be given to include specific language in the 
 FIRMR and FAR encouraging performance-based contracts
 and clarifying the latitude available for IT procurements. 
<p>
 
 3. Use multi-year funding for agency information technology projects. 
 (3) 
<p>
      Beginning in July 1994 OMB should identify major agency innovations 
 appropriate for multi-year funding beginning with agency budget 
 submissions for fiscal year 1996. OMB should then collaborate with the 
 congressional appropriations committees on an annual basis to secure 
 multi-year funding for these IT projects thereby establishing its 
 acceptance and use. 
<p>
      OMB should also complete an agency-by-agency review of current WCF 
 legislation by December 1994. Based on the results of this review, OMB 
 should assist agencies in establishing or revising WCFs to support 
 multi-year funding for agency IT innovation. 
<p>
 
 4. Establish a governmentwide innovation  fund for innovative 
 information technology projects. (3) 
<p>
      By September 1994, OMB should develop a proposal to establish a 
 government- wide innovation fund - including draft legislation, if 
 needed. This fund would support projects with significant benefits to 
 more than one program or agency. Enabling legislation for the fund 
 should parallel the legislation for existing agency WCFs; with 
 concurrence from appropriations committees, appropriated monies should 
 be transferred to the fund and retained without fiscal year spending 
 restrictions until expended on fund-sponsored initiatives. The 
 legislation would also contain provisions establishing funding 
 procedures and operating mechanisms that distinguish this fund from a 
 traditional WCF. Consideration should be given to the options of 
 creating an independent fund or expanding the scope of the existing 
 Information Technology Fund administered by the General Services 
 Administration.[14] 
<p>
      Considerations in the fund's operational framework must ensure 
 that the fund is established and operated with the conditions necessary 
 to promote partnership with the IT industry; leverage the fund with 
 other resources of federal, state, and local agencies, and the private 
 sector; and manage the risk of IT innovation. The criteria by which 
 initiatives are evaluated and selected for fund sponsorship are critical 
 to the value of the fund. The criteria should be established, reviewed, 
 refined, and published in a process open to public comment. The 
 objective of the criteria should be to identify those initiatives that 
 present the best value to the government, considering both return on 
 investment and risk. The criteria would need to address potential 
 improvement of agency, interagency, and intergovernmental operations. 
 Implementation costs, demonstrated savings, agency competency, 
 technological feasibility, interagency and intergovernmental 
 commitments, and the participation of the IT industry would all be 
 carefully weighed. 
<p>
      Capital equivalent to 1 percent of the federal government's annual 
 expenditures for IT would provide sufficient capital to operate the 
 fund. Based on fiscal year 1993 estimates, the 1 percent formula would 
 result in a funding level of approximately $250 million.[15] However, it 
 would be self-defeating to IT innovation to obtain this funding from 
 agency IT funds which are already constrained. Therefore, funding should 
 be identified from within existing agency program appropriations and, 
 with concurrence from the appropriations committees, transferred to the 
 fund to avoid new appropriations. The method of capitalization, together 
 with procedures for periodically reviewing and setting the funding level 
 in succeeding fiscal years, would be key ingredients of the enabling 
 legislation to establish the fund. The relationship of the fund and 
 fund-sponsored initiatives to agency information system plans, budgets, 
 and appropriations points to OMB for fund oversight and development of 
 its operational framework. 
<p>
      Recommendation of projects to be sponsored by the fund would be an 
 appropriate role for the Government Information Technology Services 
 (GITS) Working Group proposed earlier in this report. In addition, the 
 views of state and local government and the private sector should be 
 considered through an advisory role for industry groups and government 
 associations and/or a consultant role for 
 distinguished innovators.

<H2>IT13:  Provide Training and Technical Assistance in Information 
Technology to Federal Employees</H2>
<p>
 <b>People Helping People Cope with Technology</b>
<p>
      Every year, increasing numbers of federal workers are expected to 
 use information technology (IT) skills and knowledge in performing their 
 jobs. However, many members of the federal workforce lack sufficient 
 training and background to use new technologies effectively, and many 
 managers fail to realize the importance of IT training. Compared with 
 private industry, the federal government invests few dollars and little 
 time in IT training and retraining.[1] Without this investment, the 
 federal workforce is unable to keep pace with the rapid changes in 
 technology and improved methods of customer service. Federal agencies 
 rely on information technology and are increasingly dependent on the 
 skills and capabilities of their workforce to enhance productivity and 
 ensure quality service to the American public. Yet they provide 
 insufficient incentives to their workforce to seek IT education and 
 training as well as insufficient opportunities to obtain 
 training--even when it is desired and necessary--and do not generally 
 incorporate IT training in their strategic mission planning. 
<p>
      The cost of insufficient or no training in information technology 
 is significant. In a worst-case scenario, people do not use their 
 computers at all, and the organization's investment in hardware and 
 software is wasted. In a less extreme circumstance, every time a user 
 relies on a formal support function rather than performing IT work on 
 his or her own, the organization pays at least $25 in overhead and 
 salaried time. Every time a user asks a coworker for help, it costs 
 from $15 to $100.[2] 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
      Modest changes could improve the knowledge and skills of the 
 federal workforce. Skills enhancement efforts at all levels of the 
 federal workforce are crucial, because IT is a fundamental enabler of 
 organizational change. IT awareness must also be improved at all levels 
 of the federal workforce to encourage and support continuing reinvention 
 efforts.
<p>
      Senior managers have not developed the kind of experience and 
 expertise in IT that they have in finance, human resources, and 
 accounting.[3] At a minimum, they need a basic knowledge of how to 
 ensure the development and use of management information systems and 
 other technological resources that meet their agency's needs.[4] 
 Recently, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) began working with a 
 task force of senior executives to refine Senior Executive Service (SES) 
 qualifications to better match the competencies and skills identified in 
 the recent update of the SES Management Excellence Framework.[5] 
 There is a need to address IT competency in this effort, as well as 
 ensure that it is made a part of the SES recertification program. 
 Including IT competency in the SES recertification program will 
 emphasize IT as an integral part of the continuous and comprehensive
 learning organization. In order to provide basic knowledge, an IT course 
 should provide insight on how to integrate technology into the 
 workplace, include development strategies for using new technology to 
 manage and improve program effectiveness, and explain the impact of 
 technological changes on the organization. 
<p>
      The General Accounting Office recommends that an agency's senior 
 official for information resources management (IRM) play a leading role 
 in defining and preparing the agency's technology plan, and then ensure 
 that the ongoing and proposed systems development projects fall 
 logically within this plan. Federal IRM leaders need to be highly 
 competent individuals with the appropriate background and capabilities 
 to administer IRM programs and manage IRM resources. 
<p>
      The federal government lacks a mechanism that would allow an end 
 user to receive on-the-spot assistance with simple IT questions 
 regarding hardware configuration, new technologies, application software 
 packages, and information resources needed to perform various program 
 and administrative responsibilities. Throughout the workforce there are 
 individuals who have both the expertise and desire to assist colleagues 
 in solving such problems. There is a need for a support system that can 
 be institutionalized as a network of individuals with specific skill 
 sets available to help colleagues via electronic (e.g., bulletin boards, 
 e-mail, on-line databases, etc.) or personal interaction. These 
 individuals can function as on-line pals to provide agencies with help-
 desk functions where none presently exist and to diffuse innovation. 
<p>
      The federal government spends billions of dollars each year in IT 
 contracts and acquisitions. A majority of the contracts and acquisitions 
 do not include training provisions in the initial design stages; as a 
 result this places a tremendous burden on the overall agency training 
 budget. 
<p>
 
<p>
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Establish a program to train nontechnical senior executives and 
 political appointees in information technology. (2) 
<p>
      By June 1994, the Government Information Technology Services 
 Working Group should direct OPM and the General Services Administration 
 (GSA) to jointly develop and administer a training program, which should 
 begin by September 1994. OPM and GSA should consult with each agency on 
 the program development and implementation strategies at the agency 
 level. The program can be delivered as a series of executive technology 
 seminars implemented through "centers of excellence" such as the 
 Information Resource Management College of the National Defense 
 University, the Federal Executive Institute, or a university. The 
 program could be modeled after the New York City Department of 
 Personnel's Executive Development Program, which consists of monthly 
 half-day sessions on a variety of sophisticated IT and management 
 topics, including strategic planning/top-down planning, reengineering, 
 implementing systems, electronic mail, video conferencing, voice-
 enhanced technologies, geographic information systems, database 
 management systems, imaging, and multi-agency complaint and inspection 
 systems. 
<p>
      Program participants should develop a clear understanding of how 
 their organization can benefit from information technology; learn 
 effective uses of IT--particularly in the federal sector; and intensify 
 their commitment to using, managing, and implementing IT. Program topics 
 could include IT acquisition and implementation, principles of 
 organizational change and the impact of new technologies, customer 
 service, and the role of technology in stimulating service redesign. In 
 addition, the program should provide an opportunity for executives to 
 share their experiences in IT implementation with their peers. 
<p>
 2. Require "minimum competency" in information technology for Senior 
 Executive Service candidates. (1) 
<p>
      Agencies and OPM, by September 1994, should jointly require that 
 candidates demonstrate a minimum competency in IT prior to their 
 appointment in the SES. Specifically, candidates should be able to (1) 
 integrate technology into the workplace, (2) develop strategies using 
 new technology to manage and improve program effectiveness, and (3) 
 understand the impact of technological changes on the organization.[6] 
<p>
      Agencies and OPM should also require that IT competency be included 
 in the SES recertification program. The standard for IT competency in 
 SES recertification should include the development and use of management 
 information systems and other technological resources to meet an agency 
 "s current and future needs. 
<p>
 
 3. Require IRM managers to meet certification standards. (1) 
<p>
     OPM and GSA should identify IRM competencies and skills requirements 
 for IRM managers, establish an IRM Executive Institute to provide needed 
 management training, and identify programs or centers of excellence for 
 implementation. All federal employees pursuing an appointment to an IRM 
 management position should be required to complete a 2-year IRM 
 management training program or demonstrate mastery of competencies 
 before receiving their appointment. 
<p>
      The first training program should begin by September 1994. It 
 should consist of courses and seminars tailored to achieve the 
 individual IT needs of each agency. The program should provide a clear 
 vision of how an organization can benefit from information technology 
 and provide the skills needed to develop an agencywide IRM management 
 strategic plan that is linked to overall agency goals and objectives. In 
 addition, the program should build the competency required to manage 
 major IT acquisitions of general purpose
 data processing and telecommunications systems, facilities, and related 
 services. Various components of the IRM Executive Institute could 
 partner with programs such as GSA's
 Trail Boss Program, the Federal Acquisition Institute, and/or the 
 centers of excellence listed in action 1. 
<p>
 
 4. Promote collegial assistance for IT. (1)
<p>
      Each agency head should develop a mechanism for identifying 
 individuals with varying levels of IT expertise who wish to participate 
 as on-line pals. The existing Federal Information Resources Management 
 Policy Council (FIRMPoC) should be responsible for coordinating the 
 governmentwide collegial assistance program.[7]  This program should be 
 developed by December 1994. 
<p>
 
 5. Include training as part of all information technology contracts and 
 acquisitions. (1) 
<p>
      By January 1995, each agency' IT contracts or acquisitions in the 
 early stages of development, and all future acquisitions and contracts, 
 should include a provision for training.

<H2>Reengineering Through Information Technology</H2>
<p>
Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<p>

<b>Methodology</b>
<p>
      The National Performance Review's (NPR) Information Technology 
 (IT) Team consisted of information technology professionals, budget, and 
 logistics personnel from the public and private sectors. The team 
 undertook quality functional deployment (QFD) to define the project and 
 provide a framework for its decisionmaking and ongoing activities. A QFD 
 is a structured total quality management exercise used by planning 
 groups to clarify issues and problems to be addressed and identify 
 strategies to obtain optimal results while achieving objectives within 
 predetermined time frames. The principles developed for guiding the IT 
 Team in the creation of its recommendations were a product of QFD. 
<p>
      The team identified the following issues as priorities to be 
 addressed in order for information technology to support the delivery of 
 government services adequately. 
<p>
 ---The information technologies currently employed by the 
 federal government are not delivering what the customer needs, nor is 
 its potential being fully utilized.
<p>
 ---The federal government does not adequately 
 coordinate the systems now in place. 
<p>
 ---There is insufficient understanding of who the customers for 
 information technology are and what their needs are. 
<p>
 ---Too many barriers exist within the government, both 
 regulatory and legislative, to use information technology effectively. 
<p>
 ---All levels of the government workforce need continuous 
 education in information technology. 
<p>
      All of the team's decisions, which are presented as 
 recommendations, were made within the framework of solving the above-
 listed issues. Having developed its framework, the IT Team then 
 proceeded to review federal agency planning documents, studies, reports, 
 issue papers, and the current literature on innovative approaches being 
 piloted or planned in the government and private sectors. The team also 
 held a series of meetings with government and private industry 
 representatives to discuss the latest developments in new technology. 
 Team members also reviewed the federal regulatory framework for 
 information technology acquisition. All IT Team recommendations were 
 coordinated with those of the other NPR agency and cross-cutting teams.

<Title>Reinventing Human Resource Management</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Reinventing Human Resource Management</H2>
<P>
<HR>
<p>
<b> Executive Summary</b>
 <p>
 In 1991, the Navy's Human Resources Office in Crystal City, Virginia, 
 processed enough forms to create a mountain of paper 3,100 feet in 
 height--or roughly six times as high as the Washington Monument. 
 Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department recently determined that the 
 total weight of the federal personnel laws, regulations, directives, 
 case law, and departmental guidance required to make human resource 
 management (HRM) decisions was 1,088 pounds.
<p>
 But problems with Washington's personnel system, which affect 2.1 
 million non-Postal Service employees in the executive branch, go well 
 beyond paperwork. Indeed, the overly prescriptive system has a very 
 real impact on how government works--or doesn't. As John Sturdivant, 
 national president of the American Federation of Government 
 Employees, told the National Performance Review (NPR):
<p>
 The Federal government's current personnel management "system" must 
 be candidly termed "management by regulation." In this regard, the 
 Office of Personnel Management micro-manages individual agencies from 
 Washington through the detail-intensive Federal Personnel Manual. . . 
 [A]gencies follow suit by issuing additional volumes of personnel 
 regulations that generally parrot, with even further limitations, 
 their parent agencies' dictates.(1)
<p>
 The federal human resource administrative system contains major 
 impediments to efficient and effective management of the workforce. 
 It's a patchwork of rules and requirements that confound rather than 
 serve customer needs. It's process-driven; results are a by-product, 
 not a measure of accountability. At the day-to-day operating level, 
 it's not user-friendly--to managers, to employees and their 
 representatives, or to personnel specialists.
<p>
 Recognition of the problems is not new. In 1983, a National Academy 
 of Public Administration (NAPA) panel observed, "The present 
 personnel management system is far too process oriented. It is much 
 too rigid and needs major change. . . . Process drives out 
 substance."(2) Also, the panel noted, "Management processes, 
 centrally designed and dictated, often become overly proceduralized. 
. . . Personnel technicians rather than line managers end up making 
 personnel decisions, thus putting further distance between the line 
 managers and their personnel responsibilities."(3)
<p>
 These problems have compounded over time. Over the years, "anecdotal 
 mistakes prompted additional rules," the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM) wrote in 1988. The same document also noted that:
<p>
 When the new rules led to new inequities, even more rules were added. 
 Over time . . . a maze of regulations and requirements was created, 
 hamstringing managers, doing little to convince employees that their 
 employer treats them fairly, and often impeding federal managers and 
 employees from achieving their missions and from giving the public a 
 high quality of service.(4)
<p>
<p>
 <b>Structure of the Existing System</b>
 <p>
 The civil service revolves around merit system principles requiring 
 that positions be filled through fair and open competition, with the 
 best qualified candidate chosen without regard to political 
 affiliation or other non-merit factors, and protecting career workers 
 from arbitrary dismissal.
<p>
 OPM's director, who serves as the President's personnel officer, 
 promulgates human resource policy directives that support, interpret, 
 or otherwise implement Title 5, United States Code; the Code of 
 Federal Regulations; miscellaneous executive orders; case law from 
 various adjudicative bodies, such as the Federal Labor Relations 
 Authority (FLRA); Civil Rights Acts; and Equal Employment Opportunity 
 Commission (EEOC) management directives.
<p>
 Along with OPM, organizations with authority to regulate, direct, or 
 enforce human resource policy include the Merit Systems Protection 
 Board (MSPB), FLRA, EEOC, the Office of Special Counsel, the Justice 
 and Labor Departments, and the General Accounting Office. About 
 40,000 people help administer the federal government's civilian human 
 resource administrative system. 
<p>
 "Most of the personnel laws we use today were written for a troubled 
 civil service of 1883," OPM Director James B. King explained in May 
 1993. "We must cut the cord to regulations that were right for their 
 time a century ago, but which hog-tie managers today. In their place, 
 we need systems and mentalities that, while still based in merit and 
 fairness, will let managers manage today and into the future."(5)
<p>
 Though varying in size from a few dozen to several hundred thousand 
 employees, all executive branch agencies have internal structures for 
 administration of human resources. In each, directors of personnel 
 and directors of equal employment opportunity (EEO) advise and 
 support the agency head--developing policies and guidance, executing 
 authorities delegated to the agency, preparing required reports, 
 acting for the agency with external organizations such as OPM and 
 EEOC, and generally administering programs related to human 
 resources. The personnel directors are linked to OPM through 
 membership on the Interagency Advisory Group.
<p>
 Supporting the personnel directors, headquarters personnel staffs 
 perform functions at the agency level akin to those that OPM performs 
 for the entire federal service. In large departments, personnel 
 staffs are also located at subordinate levels such as regions and 
 bureaus. Operating personnel offices and EEO staffs exist at the 
 field or service delivery levels, providing day-to-day advice to 
 managers and employees and processing personnel actions.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Problems with the Existing System</b>
 <p>
 Today, the system's functional operating components present a 
 burdensome array of barriers and obstacles to effective HRM. Hiring 
 is complex and rule-bound; managers can't explain to applicants how 
 to get federal jobs. The classification and pay systems are 
 inflexible. The performance management system is not adequately 
 linked to the organization's mission and goals. The labor relations 
 program is adversarial. The federal workplace is not family-friendly, 
 with its overly restrictive leave practices and limited 
 implementation of available programs. Diversity programs are 
 fragmented, and affirmative employment planning and reporting 
 processes are duplicative and resource-intensive. Agencies see little 
 value in the efforts of central guidance agencies to monitor and 
 control their activities. 
<p>
 At the operating personnel office level, processes for delivering 
 human resource services have remained largely unchanged for years, 
 and customers accept them as the norm. In a 1993 special study of 
 federal personnel offices, MSPB concluded, "Unfortunately, for a 
 variety of reasons, some of the functions assigned to personnel 
 offices are too often simply not done well or are of little relevance 
 to line managers in their focus on mission accomplishment."(6) Human 
 resource administration is forms driven, labor intensive, and time 
 consuming. Managers and personnelists alike labor under rules and 
 procedures requiring the meticulous handling of paper. With 
 incomprehensible procedural and regulatory requirements, managers shy 
 away from learning or accepting responsibility for HRM.
<p>
 To what can we attribute this proliferation of external controls and 
 procedural constraints? In a forthcoming book, public administration 
 professor Patricia Ingraham observes:
<p>
 In the pulling and hauling between the President and Congress . . . 
 the permanent bureaucracy remains a target for control by both. The 
 pattern of control is similar in both cases: discretion for members 
 of the career service is to be limited whenever possible; control is 
 to be exerted through additional levels of political appointees or 
 other staff responsible to the President and/or Congress; and 
 accountability will be defined as responsiveness to those 
 controls.(7)
<p>
 <p>
<b> The Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 To understand the need for change, and the nature of changes 
 required, we must first understand the extent to which accountability 
 has been defined in terms of procedural controls. The 1983 NAPA panel 
 found that ". . . accountability is divided and varies by functional 
 areas within personnel management in such a manner that everyone and 
 no one is fully accountable."(8)
<p>
 In his 1993 study of the role of the federal inspectors general, Paul 
 Light concluded:
<p>
 Despite experiments with performance incentives, such as merit pay, 
 and occasional investments in civil service reform, the definition of 
 accountability in government has remained relatively constant over 
 the past fifty years: limit bureaucratic discretion through 
 compliance with tightly drawn rules and regulations. . . . 
 [A]ccountability is seen as the product of limits on bureaucratic 
 discretion--limits that flow from clear rules (commands), and the 
 formal procedures, monitoring and enforcement that make them stick 
 (controls).(9)
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Principles to Guide Change: A Vision for the Future</b>
 <p>
 To reinvent HRM, we must redefine accountability in terms of results-
 -and we must do so within the context of decentralization, 
 deregulation, simplicity, flexibility, and substantially increased 
 delegations of authority.
<p>
 The recommendations in this report will create a system in which the 
 President, Congress and, through them, citizens will hold agency 
 managers accountable for mission accomplishment while adhering to 
 principles of merit, equity, and equal opportunity. NPR sees the 
 following assumptions as the basis for forming human resource 
 management policies in the federal government. In the future:
<p>
 --- Federal executives and managers should be responsible for HRM and 
 accountable for their actions and the results of them.
<p>
 --- Federal executives and managers should own HRM administrative 
 systems. That is, they should help design them, accept them in 
 principle, know how to make them work, and share confidence that they 
 help achieve desired results.
<p>
 --- Federal executives and managers should receive advice and 
 technical assistance from staff advisors with expertise in 
 administering HRM administrative systems.
<p>
 --- HRM staff advisors should be viewed as part of the management 
 team, not servants of management or the system's police.
<p>
 --- The quality and effectiveness of HRM administrative support 
 should be measured by their contributions to achieving the agency's 
 mission, goals, and priorities.
<p>
 --- Within a governmentwide legal framework, agencies should tailor 
 HRM administrative systems to meet unique needs that arise from their 
 organizational culture, consonant with fundamental principles of 
 merit and equity and without the volumes of regulations that stress 
 process rather than results.
<p>
 --- Mistakes or failures to comply with regulations should not prompt 
 additional or more-stringent regulations; instead, individual 
 managers should be held administratively accountable for their 
 actions.
<p>
 --- Authority to make HRM decisions should be vested in line managers 
 and delegated to an agency's lowest practical level, including to 
 self-managed work teams operating in flattened organizational 
 structures.
<p>
 --- Executives and managers should value the federal workforce; labor 
 and management are partners in carrying out each agency's mission.
<p>
 Given these assumptions, NPR's vision in the human resource 
 management arena is one in which managers can adjust work and people 
 to meet mission demands in a cost-effective manner; create and 
 maintain a quality, diverse workforce; lead, develop, train, set high 
 expectations for, reward, and discipline employees; foster a quality 
 work environment that lets employees manage work and personal 
 responsibilities; and promote cooperative relationships with 
 employees and unions. The ideal system is free of political influence 
 and embodies merit system principles. "[A]gency executives and 
 managers take primary responsibility, and [are] held strictly 
 accountable, for observance of merit principles and the prevention of 
 prohibited personnel actions; for enforcing high standards of 
 employee performance and conduct, and for taking necessary actions 
 when such standards are not met."(10)
<p>
 Administrative systems for the management of human resources that 
 underpin this vision will be simple to use, easy to understand, self-
 renewing, continuously improving, and cost-effective. NPR's 
 recommendations will help achieve the vision by: 
<p>
 --- creating a flexible and responsive hiring system, 
<p>
 --- reforming the classification system, 
<p>
 --- improving performance management systems, 
<p>
 --- targeting the objectives of employee training and development,
<p>
 --- enhancing programs to provide family-friendly workplaces, 
<p>
 --- improving workplace due process, 
<p>
 --- focusing equal employment opportunity on achieving results, 
<p>
 --- eliminating excessive red tape, and 
<p>
 --- forming labor-management partnerships.
<p>
 These recommendations require dramatic changes in the roles and 
 responsibilities of line managers and their HRM advisors, and in 
 labor-management relationships. Managers and supervisors will have 
 more latitude to exercise judgment in their actions affecting 
 employees. This latitude carries a large element of risk and 
 concomitant accountability for results. Managers must have access to 
 quality, responsive advice, and assistance from HRM professionals who 
 truly understand the organization's HRM needs.
<p>
 Personnel offices must shift from reactive processors of paperwork to 
 responsive consultants and advisors. This shift requires 
 personnelists to view the manager as a customer with needs to 
 anticipate and meet with responsive service, including electronic 
 support systems. This change in roles and relationships must include 
 a similar orientation toward the workforce. Cooperative relationships 
 with organized labor must be established and maintained, with unions 
 viewed as partners.

Enable Managers to Create and Maintain a Quality, Diverse Workforce

<H2> HRM01:  Create a Flexible and Responsive Hiring System</H2>
 <p>
 <b> Background</b>
<p> 
 The system through which applicants are considered for competitive 
 appointment to positions in the federal government is a merit system-
 -candidates are selected based on their relative ability to perform 
 the job without regard to nonmerit factors, including political 
 affiliation. There are nine merit system principles, covering (1) 
 recruitment to achieve a work force from all segments of society, and 
 selection and advancement following fair and open competition; (2) 
 employment without regard to nonmerit factors; (3) equal pay for work 
 of equal value; (4) standards of conduct; (5) efficient and effective 
 use of the federal work force; (6) retention and separation based on 
 performance; (7) effective education and training; (8) protections 
 against arbitrary action and prohibition against interfering with an 
 election; and (9) protection against reprisal for disclosing 
 violations or mismanagement.(1)
<p>
 The law also defines prohibited personnel practices, including 
 discrimination on the basis of nonmerit factors such as nepotism, 
 political affiliation, and marital status.(2) It stipulates that "the 
 head of each agency shall be responsible for the prevention of 
 prohibited personnel practices, for the compliance with and 
 enforcement of applicable civil service laws, rules and regulations, 
 and other aspects of personnel management."(3)
<p>
 The first merit principle deals with recruitment and hiring. The 
 merit system requires that (1) individuals be qualified; (2) 
 appropriate sources be identified; (3) all segments of society be 
 represented in the work force; (4) selection and advancement be 
 determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and 
 skills; and (5) fair and open competition be afforded to ensure that 
 all receive equal opportunity.(4)
<p>
 The Merit Hiring System. 
 The competitive examining system for external candidates that has 
 developed around these requirements is controlled by the Office of 
 Personnel Management (OPM). Although OPM may delegate examining 
 authority to agencies, by law OPM must conduct examinations for 
 positions that are common to agencies. With OPM approval, agencies 
 may directly hire candidates in a limited number of occupations where 
 recruitment shortages have been identified--that is, where there is 
 potentially a job for every qualified applicant.
<p>
 Throughout the year, OPM issues general notices or open announcements 
 soliciting applications for particular occupations for which it 
 retains examining authority. Managers wishing to fill vacancies from 
 external sources must ask the personnel office to submit to OPM a 
 request for a certificate of eligibles. Using an internal, 
 unpublished rating scale, OPM rates and ranks candidates, whose names 
 are then forwarded to the manager in ranked order. The actual list of 
 candidates forwarded to the manager may not represent the best 
 candidates, as higher-ranking individuals may have already been 
 referred out to another agency. The rules surrounding selections are 
 exactly the same for both OPM-generated certificates of eligibles and 
 certificates issued by agencies with delegated examining authority. 
<p>
 Although the certificate may contain many names, the manager is bound 
 by law to select one of the top three available candidates, and may 
 not pass over a veteran to select a nonveteran unless a request to 
 pass over the veteran for reasons of qualifications or suitability is 
 approved. Although authority to approve requests to pass over 
 veterans is delegated to agencies, OPM must rule on requests to pass 
 over veterans who are 30 percent or more compensably disabled. 
 Managers may choose to interview all, some, or none of the 
 candidates, but in no case may they subject candidates to further 
 examination. Certificates may be returned unused when managers 
 determine that candidates are unsatisfactory, which can result in 
 significant time delays in filling positions, as alternative methods 
 must then be considered. The General Accounting Office found in 1992 
 that managers returned 57 percent of certificates and chose to use 
 alternate means.(5)
<p>
 Merit Promotion. 
 OPM rules that govern competition among internal candidates, commonly 
 termed merit promotion, are found in Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 
 335. Agencies typically construct internal rating and ranking 
 procedures in order to identify the best qualified. Candidates are 
 evaluated by personnelists, a subject matter expert, or a panel of 
 subject matter experts, then either named to the selecting official 
 as best qualified or eliminated from further consideration for that 
 vacancy based on a cutoff score established by the evaluator(s). In 
 most agencies, the selecting official does not participate in the 
 rating, ranking, and referral process. Managers are free to select 
 any candidate from among those referred by the panel.
<p>
 In 1989, in connection with a study to explore OPM's simplification 
 initiatives, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) concluded 
 that:
<p>
 The OPM initiatives which agencies thought were the most effective 
 were those which the agencies felt would assist in the hiring of 
 high-quality employees and those that expedited the hiring process. 
 Clearly, the provision of prompt recruitment and placement services 
 to operating officials is a priority in agencies' personnel 
 programs.(6)
<p>
 Can today's civil service hiring system meet the needs of federal 
 managers for the 21st century? Most would maintain that the system 
 cannot even meet current needs, and that reinvention is already long 
 overdue, for the reasons summarized below.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 The need for change is well documented. When describing the federal 
 hiring system in 1988, OPM Director Constance Horner noted, "The 
 current system is slow; it is legally trammelled and intellectually 
 confused; it is impossible to explain to potential candidates. It is 
 almost certainly not fulfilling the spirit of our mandate to hire the 
 most meritorious candidates."(7) In that same year, the Hudson 
 Institute's Civil Service 2000 predicted that 
<p>
 . . . hiring and retention [will become] much more competitive in the 
 years ahead. Because these tight labor markets are likely to develop 
 in different ways in different states and to shift quickly in 
 response to economic and population changes, it is essential to 
 decentralize responsibility and to provide more flexibility in hiring 
 and personnel management than is characteristic of the current 
 system.(8) 
<p>
 Dwindling resources, shifting markets, and emerging technologies 
 compound the need to ensure that every single employee becomes a 
 vital partner in mission attainment and program delivery. Thus, 
 identifying the impediments to carrying out an effective hiring 
 program and exploring the extent to which these impediments can be 
 alleviated become an absolute business necessity to ensure an 
 organization's survival.
<p>
 The problems with the hiring system fall into the following major 
 categories:
<p>
 Lack of Accountability. 
 The single greatest failing of the hiring system is lack of 
 managerial involvement in the front-end recruitment and evaluation of 
 candidates for employment--in other words, lack of accountability. 
 Managers who do attempt to participate in the external recruitment 
 process in most cases must send potential applicants to OPM or to 
 delegated examining units to be examined, in striking contrast with 
 the ability of private industry recruiters to make immediate offers 
 of employment to qualified candidates and to establish closer ties to 
 professional and community recruitment sources. Managers must wait to 
 receive candidates who have been rated and ranked by OPM or delegated 
 examining units, and are required by law to choose from among the top 
 three available candidates. When considering internal candidates, 
 they make selections from among candidates who have been determined 
 by others to be the best qualified. Managers are then able to blame 
 the system for undesirable outcomes, such as perceived inequity or 
 underrepresentation, if they have followed all of the rules.
<p>
 Failure to Meet Customer Needs. 
 In 1989, the National Commission on the Public Service observed that, 
 "Even when the public sector finds outstanding candidates, the 
 complexity of the hiring process often drives all but the most 
 dedicated away."(9) In 1990, MSPB observed that, "Potential 
 applicants are frequently discouraged by the confusion they 
 experience when trying to get a job with the federal government."(10) 
 The system is time consuming and unresponsive; despite improvements 
 in the automated delivery of examining services, the best candidates 
 frequently go elsewhere before federal managers are able to make firm 
 offers of employment. The fact that managers are forced to send some 
 potential applicants to OPM to be examined is of particular concern 
 at remote field locations where access to OPM services is necessarily 
 limited. The issue is not merely convenience; more importantly, the 
 public's perception of the federal government as a responsive 
 employer suffers tremendously when agency managers are forced to send 
 applicants to OPM for examination, with no guarantee they will ever 
 be within reach for positions at that agency on a centralized 
 register. In 1989, the National Commission on the Public Service 
 found that:
<p>
 Government faces an enormous challenge in recruiting America's top 
 college graduates. On the one hand, outstanding graduates doubt that 
 the public sector can fulfill their dreams of meaningful, challenging 
 careers. On the other hand, they find that the complexity of entry 
 makes public sector jobs among the toughest to get.(11)
<p>
 Restricted Competition. 
 Qualified candidates are automatically eliminated from managers' 
 consideration based on narrow point score distinctions reflecting 
 only some of the attributes of individual candidates. The system 
 undermines recruitment initiatives as managers recruit candidates who 
 may not be within reach on certificates of eligibles, and are 
 therefore unavailable for selection. Overly restrictive qualification 
 standards and time-in-grade requirements can eliminate candidates who 
 are in fact able to perform the duties of the position. When 
 centralized OPM registers are filled and examinations are closed, 
 candidates are prevented from applying for position vacancies. 
 Temporary employees as a rule may not apply to be considered for 
 vacancies being filled under internal (merit promotion) procedures. 
 Thus, the open competition required by the merit system principles 
 becomes subject to arbitrary limitations. Obtaining excellence is 
 more a matter of luck and persistence than design.
<p>
 Complexity. 
 The system is so complex and rule-bound that managers are unable to 
 explain to applicants how to get a federal job. Staffing law, 
 regulations, and Federal Personnel Manual guidance comprise hundreds 
 of pages, to which departments and agencies add their own 
 interpretive guidance and implementing directives. The system is 
 overly constrained by statute and regulation; over 300 appointing 
 authorities provide little useful management information and require 
 interpretation by personnel specialists.
<p>
 This complexity has evolved over time as particular statutes, 
 regulations, and related guidance were developed and implemented to 
 address specific situations or perceptions of mismanagement. For 
 example, the law requires that temporary assignments to other 
 positions (details) be made in 120-day increments(12) as a means to 
 control the internal movement of employees. However, the centralized 
 and highly controlled systems designed to ensure the equitable 
 delivery of examining services in fact serve to prevent managers and 
 applicants from either understanding or making full use of available 
 options. In 1993, the National Research Council concluded, "The 
 federal civil service system, with its strong emphasis on internal 
 equity, has long hampered the government's abilities to compete for 
 scarce talent in the labor market and to reward exceptional 
 individual performance."(13)
<p>
 The Ideal System. 
 An ideal hiring system would enable managers to hire, develop, and 
 retain a quality, diverse, productive, and ethical workforce in 
 constantly changing labor markets; empower managers to balance the 
 competing demands of multiple stakeholders; and hold managers 
 accountable for adherence to principles of merit and equal 
 opportunity through a performance-based assessment of staffing 
 outcomes. The ideal system would be decentralized to create a link 
 between an agency's recruitment efforts and those candidates who are 
 actually hired. 
<p>
 A decentralized system would permit agencies to establish their own 
 priorities for agency-based recruitment initiatives. Tailored 
 approaches designed to tap into local labor markets could provide 
 managers with expanded opportunities to increase the diversity of the 
 candidate pool. Flexible and responsive agency-based systems would 
 permit managers to adapt to fluctuations in the labor market. Federal 
 recruiters would be empowered to compete with private sector 
 recruiters. A significantly enhanced, automated employment 
 information system could immediately link candidates with nationwide, 
 or communitywide, job opportunities by occupational specialization. 
 Freed from constraining layers of mind-numbing regulations, personnel 
 specialists would be able to become partners with management in the 
 development of staffing initiatives to support overall strategic 
 planning objectives.
<p>
 Experience has shown that such a system can be successful. In July 
 1990, a formal demonstration project to test an alternative staffing 
 system was implemented within the Department of Agriculture (USDA) at 
 approximately 140 experimental and 80 comparison locations nationwide 
 within the Forest Service and the Agricultural Research Service. The 
 project's key initiatives include a streamlined, agency-based 
 recruitment and hiring system that completely replaces the OPM 
 register process; recruitment incentives; and an extended 
 probationary period for research scientists. In connection with its 
 ongoing responsibility to conduct a formal evaluation of project 
 impact and implementation, the Pennsylvania State University reported 
 that "the demonstration initiatives are widely seen as providing a 
 flexible and responsive set of recruitment and selection procedures 
 that are preferable to pre-existing procedures (e.g., central 
 registers). The reported benefits from the demonstration project 
 include increased access to the local labor market, greater control 
 over the hiring process, and increased likelihood of quality 
 candidates in the candidate pool, among others."(14) The evaluators 
 proceed to describe "a possible unanticipated benefit associated with 
 increased recruitment of labor from local labor markets . . . the 
 sense that public perceptions of the agency as an employer and 
 community member have [improved]."(15)
<p>
 The emphasis on merit that characterizes the actions that follow is 
 designed to ensure that the professional career service remains free 
 from political influence and that human resource management is based 
 on and embodies the merit system principles.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Authorize agencies to establish their own recruitment and 
 examining programs. Abolish central registers and standard 
 application forms.(16) (3) 
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should forward draft legislation to 
 Congress delegating to federal departments and independent agencies 
 full and complete authority to develop and implement merit systems 
 for employee selection and advancement based on the merit system 
 principles. Legislation should be enacted to allow departments and 
 agencies to conduct examinations for positions that are common to 
 agencies in the federal government, and to redefine the roles of OPM 
 and agencies with respect to the examining process. Within 30 days of 
 enactment by Congress, OPM should develop the broad policies and 
 general principles through which the new legislation would be 
 implemented. Federal departments and independent agencies should 
 establish merit systems for recruiting and evaluating candidates for 
 selection and advancement. These systems should be based on the 
 policies and principles established by OPM in accordance with 
 applicable statutes and reflect the input of the federal human 
 resource management community. 
<p>
 Individual federal departments and agencies should be permitted to 
 conduct examinations for positions that have requirements common to 
 agencies in the federal government. OPM should be able to compete 
 with departments and agencies to provide examining services. 
 Department secretaries and agency heads should be responsible for 
 holding managers accountable for the judicious use of these 
 authorities. OPM would be responsible for (1) notifying department 
 secretaries and agency heads if violations are identified, and (2) 
 ensuring that corrective actions are taken, as appropriate. In cases 
 where violations are identified that involve secretaries and agency 
 heads, OPM should be authorized to conduct an investigation and 
 recommend an appropriate course of action to the President.
<p>
 Completely decentralizing the hiring process will result in the 
 establishment of agency-based, market-driven hiring systems, which 
 will, in turn, improve managers' ability to hire, develop, and retain 
 a quality workforce, reflective of our nation's diversity. 
 Streamlined, agency-based systems will permit more timely offers of 
 employment and be more readily understandable to applicants. Access 
 to increased numbers of candidates will facilitate the attainment of 
 workforce diversity goals and objectives.
<p>
 How will accountability be defined in the context of decentralization 
 and substantially increased delegation of authority? Some may believe 
 that increased flexibility will lead to increased incidence of merit 
 system abuse. However, decentralization of responsibility for 
 recruitment and examining is expected to increase managers' 
 participation in and control over the staffing process, thereby 
 reducing their ability to blame the system for unsatisfactory 
 outcomes. Managers will become even more accountable for adherence to 
 merit principles and for preventing prohibited personnel practices as 
 increased flexibility leads to correspondingly increased performance 
 expectations. An April 1993 National Academy of Public Administration 
 report described this shift in the definition of accountability:
<p>
 The means for accountability focuses on the exercise of leadership 
 and judgment within broad guidelines, rather than on detailed rules 
 and procedures and prior controls . . . [deriving from] clear 
 principles of fairness, equity and individual rights. . . . 
 Accountability measures should be mission oriented and results 
 driven. . . . [T]he new framework emphasizes measuring accountability 
 by: measuring accomplishment of mission, goals and objectives; 
 assessing results, e.g., product and service quality and customer 
 satisfaction; assessing public trust (customer satisfaction) and 
 institutional health (e.g., employee morale, attrition rates); and 
 evaluating compliance with civil service laws, regulations and 
 policy.(17)
<p>
 Managers' responsibility for ensuring adherence to merit principles 
 and preventing prohibited personnel practices will increase as they 
 become more closely involved in all phases of recruitment and hiring. 
 Extensive training must be provided to ensure that managers 
 understand how the merit principles are applied in the context of 
 making personnel decisions. The success of managers' efforts will be 
 evaluated using performance-based outcome measures, for example, 
 employee morale and workforce diversity. Experience has shown that 
 greater flexibility permits managers to become more involved in and, 
 therefore, more accountable for program results. The Pennsylvania 
 State University reported that, using the decentralized approach 
 being tested under the USDA demonstration project, "both managers and 
 personnelists reported greater participation in the recruitment 
 process, and viewed manager-personnelist interactions as more 
 important in determining the success of the hiring process."(18)
<p>
 
 2. Allow federal departments and agencies to determine that 
 recruitment shortages exist and directly hire candidates without 
 ranking.(19) (3) 
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should forward draft legislation to 
 Congress to allow OPM, and departments and agencies, to establish 
 categories in which candidates can be directly hired to coincide with 
 the establishment of decentralized, agency-based hiring systems.
<p>
 Federal departments and agencies will have the authority to directly 
 hire candidates without ranking when recruitment shortages exist 
 after considering the following factors, as applicable:
<p>
 --- the failure of recent efforts to recruit high-quality candidates 
 for similar positions,
<p>
 --- recent turnover in similar positions,
<p>
 --- labor market factors that may negatively impact the ability of 
 the agency to recruit high-quality candidates for similar positions 
 now or in the future, or
<p>
 --- special qualifications needed for the position that are in short 
 supply.
<p>
 OPM should establish additional categories where candidates may be 
 directly hired, for example, persons with targeted disabilities, 
 candidates with outstanding academic qualifications, or other 
 categories as appropriate.
<p>
 
 3. Reduce the number of competitive service appointment types to 
 three.(20) (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should forward draft legislation to 
 Congress to streamline and redefine appointments in the competitive 
 service and redefine the length of the initial probationary period. 
 By fall 1994, OPM should revise its regulations to redefine the 
 length of the probationary period for initial appointment to a 
 supervisory or managerial position.
<p>
 Appointments to positions in the competitive service should fall into 
 one of the following categories:
<p>
 --- Permanent: appointment leads to career status, employees receive 
 full benefits; 
<p>
 --- Temporary indefinite: appointments are temporary, but without 
 time limitation; employees receive full benefits; or
<p>
 --- Temporary not to exceed (NTE): appointments are made not to 
 exceed one year, with option to renew for one additional year; 
 benefits are limited.
<p>
 Temporary NTE appointments are used to meet short-term staffing 
 needs. Temporary indefinite appointments are not permanent but will 
 be made without time limitation to permit agencies to more easily 
 adjust staffing levels to meet fluctuations in workload that may 
 extend beyond the two-year time limit on temporary NTE appointments. 
 Employees serving under temporary NTE or temporary indefinite 
 appointments are not subject to governmentwide rules on reduction in 
 force.(21) Agencies will involve employee representatives in 
 determining the length of temporary indefinite appointments through 
 collective bargaining. Agency flexibility to design merit-based 
 hiring systems will substantially reduce the need for the majority of 
 excepted service appointments currently established under Schedules A 
 and B.(22) Excepted appointments will continue to be used for 
 positions of a confidential or policy-determining character (Schedule 
 C), or positions for which eligibility depends upon factors other 
 than education and experience, for example, family income (such as 
 student aid), local residence, or acceptability to foreign officials.
<p>
 To provide an adequate period of time in which to make retention 
 decisions, the duration of the initial probationary period upon 
 permanent appointment without time limitation to a position in the 
 competitive service and the probationary period upon initial 
 appointment to a supervisory or managerial position will be extended 
 from one to a maximum of three years. Agencies would be permitted to 
 determine an appropriate length of time for specific occupations or 
 positions, which will be announced to candidates in advance. Agencies 
 will involve employee representatives in determining the length of 
 the initial probationary period upon permanent appointment without 
 time limitation through collective bargaining.
<p>
 
 4. Permit nonpermanent employees to compete for permanent positions 
 under agency procedures for internal placement.(23) (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM will forward draft legislation to 
 Congress to allow nonpermanent employees who were initially hired 
 using competitive procedures to be considered along with internal 
 candidates for permanent positions being filled under merit 
 promotion. Following two years of performance that meets established 
 expectations within a five-year period, temporary NTE and temporary 
 indefinite employees will be permitted to apply to be considered for 
 selection and appointment to permanent positions under internal 
 placement procedures. Within 30 days of enactment, OPM should issue 
 appropriate guidelines for implementation.
<p>
 
 5. Abolish the time-in-grade requirement. Create a general 
 qualifications framework that permits agencies to augment or modify 
 qualification standards for both internal and external placement 
 actions. (1)
<p>
 By spring 1994, the director of OPM should revise the regulations to 
 abolish the time-in-grade requirement.(24) In addition, OPM should 
 revise its guidance concerning governmentwide qualification 
 standards.(25) OPM should continue to implement a framework of 
 generic qualification standards that permits agencies to identify and 
 develop experience requirements for specific series. Agencies would 
 be permitted to modify standards for both external and internal 
 placement actions, including promotions, when the agencies determine 
 that candidates can successfully perform the work of the position 
 although they may not fully meet the qualification requirements in 
 the generic standards. Agencies may augment standards with selective 
 placement factors (for example, foreign language proficiency) but may 
 not require additional amounts of education or experience beyond 
 those required by the standards. Decisions to either augment or 
 modify standards should be made before vacancy announcements are 
 issued and will be publicized in the announcement.
<p>
 
 6. Eliminate all statutory rules on detailing employees to temporary 
 assignments.(26) (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should forward draft legislation to 
 Congress to repeal the statutory time limitation on details of 
 employees. Within 30 days of enactment of the legislation, OPM should 
 issue appropriate guidelines for implementation. The 120-day 
 limitation on details will be removed, and agencies will have the 
 authority to determine the appropriate duration of a temporary 
 assignment.
<p>
 
 7. Create a governmentwide employment information system to inform 
 the public of job opportunities. Coordinate the development and 
 operation of common automated systems to facilitate agency staffing 
 policies and operations. (1)
<p>
 By September 1994, the director of OPM should develop and implement 
 an expanded job information service featuring a user-friendly, state-
 of-the-art electronic information network to which customers can 
 easily gain access. By September 1994, OPM and agencies should 
 collaborate in developing a core automated personnel operations 
 support network to reduce the cost and inefficiency of separate 
 agency systems.
<p>
 A substantially refined and expanded automated employment information 
 system should be installed to which applicants can gain telephone or 
 electronic access. Services provided at Federal Job Information 
 Centers should be expanded, and agency access to the Central 
 Personnel Data File (CPDF) increased. CPDF should be extensively 
 reconfigured to provide management information for the purpose of 
 monitoring workforce statistics, including those which relate to 
 managerial accountability, such as employee turnover and selection 
 data by race, gender, and disability categories.

<H2> HRM02:  Reform the General Schedule Classification and Basic Pay System</H2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 Approximately 1.6 million federal civilian employees--about 75 
 percent of the nonpostal civilian workforce--are covered by the 
 General Schedule (GS) classification and basic pay system. (The 
 remaining 25 percent are covered under a variety of special pay 
 systems, the largest of which is the Federal Wage System, which 
 covers over 300,000 blue-collar employees in trades and crafts 
 occupations.) The GS system was established in 1949 and was intended 
 to provide a standard framework for establishing the pay hierarchy 
 for federal employees in white-collar occupations.
<p>
 The central core of the GS classification system is codified in law. 
 The law establishes 15 grades and describes the level of work at each 
 grade. As stated in the law, the purpose of the classification system 
 is to ensure that equal pay be provided for substantially equal work 
 (by ensuring equal grade for equal work) and that work be classified 
 based on its difficulty, responsibility, and qualification 
 requirements. The law provides the Office of Personnel Management 
 (OPM) with a central role in establishing classification standards 
 and reviewing agency classification actions (through periodic audits 
 and hearings of employee appeals). OPM has final authority in 
 classification matters.
<p>
 OPM has established over 450 separate job categories called series. 
 For example, there are 34 different series in the field of biological 
 sciences alone, including such series as Plant Pathology, Plant 
 Physiology, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Soil Science, and 
 Irrigation System Operation. For many of these 450 series, OPM has 
 published classification standards that agencies must apply in 
 assigning grades to jobs. The series-specific classification 
 standards describe the nature of work and set forth criteria or rules 
 for determining the appropriate grade level. Series standards tend to 
 be fairly detailed and can require considerable time and 
 classification expertise to apply. Many of the standards have not 
 been revised for many years and are viewed as out-of-date.(1)
<p>
 The GS basic pay structure is directly based upon the grades in the 
 classification system. There are 15 overlapping pay ranges that 
 correspond with the 15 grades. Until passage of the Federal Employees 
 Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), the GS basic pay structure 
 consisted of a single nationwide pay schedule (although higher 
 special salary rates could be paid in response to significant 
 recruitment and retention problems).(2) However, FEPCA now provides 
 for locality-based comparability payments based on average pay 
 disparities between federal and non-federal workers.(3) The same 
 locality pay percentage will apply to all employees in a given local 
 pay area, thus maintaining on a local basis the pay relationships 
 among all jobs in the GS hierarchy of grades, consistent with the 
 equal pay principle.
<p>
 By law, basic pay rates within any GS grade are set at one of 10 
 fixed step rates. Employees performing at an acceptable level of 
 competence progress through the rate range in accordance with 
 statutory waiting periods (one to three years depending on the step). 
 In addition, employees may receive additional step increases--called 
 Quality Step Increases (QSIs)--based on outstanding performance, 
 subject to a limit of one QSI per year. While a special merit pay 
 progression scheme applies to managerial employees covered by the 
 Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS), that system 
 expires on October 31, 1993.
<p>
 In recent years, several federal agencies have been conducting, with 
 some success, special demonstration projects that tested broadbanding 
 classification systems within the GS framework. A broadbanding system 
 involves both the consolidation of job categories (job banding) and 
 the merging of grades or pay ranges (grade banding). Tailored within-
 band pay progression schemes were also developed for each project. 
 The oldest and most well-known broadbanding demonstration project is 
 a Department of the Navy project covering two research laboratories 
 in Southern California (commonly referred to as the China Lake 
 project).
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 A strong case can be made that the current federal classification and 
 basic pay system is in need of significant reform. The problems with 
 the current system are summarized below:
<p>
 Lack of Mission Focus. 
 The GS classification system was premised on the idea that internal 
 equity would help the government more effectively and efficiently 
 accomplish its various missions by ensuring that employees are 
 compensated based on the difficulty and responsibility of their work, 
 by addressing employee concerns about pay fairness, by reducing 
 interagency competition for employees based on pay, and by 
 simplifying the pay setting process. Over time, the ideal of internal 
 equity has emerged as the supreme goal of the system, instead of 
 being viewed as a means to attaining the larger goals associated with 
 effective government. Consistent with the focus on internal equity, 
 system administrators have sought to achieve greater precision, even 
 though the additional precision did not result in--and perhaps even 
 worked against--more effective government. A new and better balance 
 is needed--a balance that can be achieved by a less precision-
 oriented classification system that provides for greater agency 
 flexibility and is more supportive of agency missions without 
 undermining the long-term governmentwide interests that originally 
 prompted establishment of the system.
<p>
 As a recent National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) report 
 notes, "The degree of precision with which jobs are classified under 
 this [the General Schedule classification] system is neither 
 warranted by the methodology nor necessary to support pay equity or 
 to organize work efficiently."(4)
<p>
 Low Credibility. 
 According to a recent survey of federal employees conducted by OPM, 
 only 31 percent of employees agree that their pay is fair considering 
 what other people in their organization are paid.(5) Thus, despite 
 all the attempts to build precision into the system through central 
 control and rules, the fairness of the system appears to be 
 questioned by the vast majority of the people whose opinion is 
 perhaps most important. Ironically, it appears that the more 
 precision that is sought in job evaluation, the more likely that the 
 measurements of equity will be incomplete (because equity factors 
 that could be considered under a less precise approach have been 
 eliminated) and open to criticism (due to the specificity of the 
 measurements as well as the high expectations created by the precise 
 approach). Furthermore, a precise system that cannot be easily 
 enforced invites rule bending and breaking, which further undermines 
 system credibility. In meetings with federal managers and personnel 
 specialists, National Performance Review (NPR) staff were repeatedly 
 told how agency managers are able to beat the system to get the 
 results they want. There is a strong argument that the classification 
 system would be viewed as more fair by employees if it were less 
 precise but more honest about its reliance on human judgment.
<p>
 According to James E. Colvard, former Deputy Director of OPM, "The 
 current classification system allows the manager to be precisely 
 wrong. What the manager needs is the opportunity to be roughly 
 right."(6)
<p>
 Complexity. 
 The GS classification system is difficult to understand and to use. 
 This prevents managers--who actually best know the work being 
 classified and its value to the organization--from assuming the 
 primary role in classifying jobs. Instead, the system is largely run 
 by OPM and agency personnel specialists with classification expertise 
 (2,000 of whom are classified in a special Position Classification 
 job series). The system's complexity promotes excessive paperwork and 
 slow, cumbersome administrative procedures. It also makes it 
 difficult to maintain currency. Over 7 percent of the standards are 
 more than 20 years old.(7)
<p>
 As the NAPA report notes, "In an era of growing pressures for 
 efficiency, productivity, flexibility, customer satisfaction, and 
 goal-directed results, the [General Schedule] classification system 
 is mired in expensive, time-consuming, rule-driven complexity."(8)
<p>
 Fragmented Accountability. 
 Accountability for classification is fragmented among OPM, agency 
 personnel offices, and agency program managers. Not only does this 
 fragmentation produce tension and conflict among the parties, but it 
 also prevents any one party from assuming responsibility for the 
 consequences of classification decisions. Since many federal managers 
 do not operate under a fixed payroll budget or a total operating cost 
 budget, they do not necessarily feel an obligation to consider the 
 long-term cost consequences of classification actions. On the other 
 hand, OPM and agency personnelists do not have to face the 
 consequences that classification actions have on program missions. 
 There is a clear need to consolidate accountability for mission and 
 classification in one place. This suggests giving classification 
 authority to line managers while ensuring that they are accountable 
 for managing budget dollars prudently and paying employees fairly, in 
 accordance with governmentwide standards.
<p>
 The Federal Section of the International Personnel Management 
 Association states that "the role of the personnel professional must 
 be redefined to emphasize the desired shift to a consultative 
 relationship with managers, rather than the heretofore traditional 
 role of classification decision-maker."(9)
<p>
 Inflexibility. 
 One-size-fits-all rigidity characterizes the GS classification and 
 pay system. Agency managers point out that agencies have diverse 
 missions, challenges, organizational structures, values, and 
 cultures, and that they must respond to ever-changing external 
 conditions. The classification system must not be so immutable that 
 it cannot respond to new ways of designing work, the changing value 
 of jobs, or changes in the work itself. While some flexibilities have 
 been incorporated within the pay system (e.g., special salary rates 
 and entry pay above the minimum rate) to compensate for the 
 classification system's rigidity, the restrictions that accompany 
 many of these pay flexibilities severely limit their usefulness. Even 
 if the classification system is made more flexible, additional pay 
 flexibilities are needed to allow agencies to respond to localized 
 labor market fluctuations and to use pay progression schemes that 
 better fit the culture and goals of the organization.
<p>
 As the Merit Systems Protection Board noted, "These [General 
 Schedule] grade level criteria have come to be viewed as 'cast in 
 stone' . . . [r]esulting in virtually fixed and therefore 
 unresponsive standards. . . . Since the classification standards 
 aren't readily adapted to changes which may occur in how society 
 values certain kinds of work, the classification system can rarely, 
 if ever, be a proactive tool of personnel management policy."(10)
<p>
 Hierarchical Orientation. 
 As currently administered, the GS classification system seems to 
 facilitate or reinforce hierarchical structures. Part of the reason 
 may lie in the reliance on specialized, narrow jobs, which tends to 
 lead to the creation of organizational stovepipes structured by 
 function instead of by mission. Perhaps more important is the fact 
 that the classification system more readily provides higher grades 
 for supervisory work than for expert-level nonsupervisory work. NPR 
 staff heard from many different sources that supervisory positions 
 are frequently created as a means of providing employees with higher 
 grades. All of this suggests that a more flexible classification 
 system designed to encourage more broadly defined jobs and to more 
 readily permit dual career ladders could facilitate the streamlining 
 or delayering of federal organizations.
<p>
 Billions of dollars in precious tax revenues are squandered annually 
 to support a federal management structure that is excessively bloated 
 and that is unavailable to perform "front line production work." 
 These needless layers upon layers of management are not benign. They 
 significantly delay work product getting out timely and they 
 micromanage to justify their existence thereby ultimately creating 
 customer (public) dissatisfaction. The related pay and classification 
 problems have contributed to this "pyramiding" of supervisors upon 
 supervisors to justify grade levels.(11)
<p>
 The interrelated problems described above point to the need for a new 
 mission-driven classification and basic pay system--a system that 
 achieves a better balance between flexibility and accountability, 
 that is simpler to understand and administer, and that can be used 
 proactively as a tool to help reshape the federal government. To 
 achieve change in the classification and pay area without producing 
 chaos, it is essential to develop a flexible system that allows 
 agencies to take incremental steps based on their needs and levels of 
 readiness to assume greater responsibilities.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Remove all grade-level classification criteria from the law while 
 retaining the 15-grade structure. (3)
<p>
 The director of OPM should submit proposed legislation to Congress by 
 fall 1994 that would repeal the classification criteria for the 15 
 grades in the General Schedule system now codified in law.(12)
<p>
 The statutory classification criteria have remained essentially 
 unchanged since 1949.(13) The government should have the flexibility 
 to make changes in the classification criteria in response to changes 
 in the work world without going through the legislative process. 
 Initially, OPM should administratively adopt the existing criteria 
 and then make changes as warranted.
<p>
 In addition to providing needed flexibility, removing the 
 classification criteria from the law would also help reinforce the 
 idea that, like private sector employees, federal employees do not 
 have a statutory entitlement to a precise grade or pay level.
<p>
 
 2. Provide agencies with flexibility to establish broadbanding 
 systems built upon the General Schedule framework. (3)
<p>
 The director of OPM should submit proposed legislation to Congress by 
 fall 1994 that would (1) authorize OPM to approve the banding of GS 
 grades (and associated pay ranges), subject to the condition that the 
 content definition of any band be linked to the GS grade-level 
 definitions, and (2) reduce the restrictions on the demonstration 
 project authority so that it can be a more proactive management tool. 
 The proposed legislation should also include provisions making clear 
 that matters relating to the setting of base pay rates are not 
 conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining. Within one 
 year of enactment of this legislation, OPM should publish detailed 
 information on the initial set of options available to agencies under 
 these new authorities.
<p>
 OPM should work with agencies to develop standard banding patterns 
 that incorporate job banding, grade banding, and within-band pay 
 progression schemes. Some of these standard patterns may permit the 
 incorporation of blue-collar jobs now under the Federal Wage System. 
 Agencies can choose among the menu of standard patterns without need 
 for OPM approval. In addition, agencies will be able to request OPM 
 approval of minor variations in the standard patterns. OPM approval 
 of these minor variations would not be time-limited.
<p>
 Unique broadbanding systems that do not fit under one of the standard 
 patterns should be approved under a revised demonstration project 
 authority. The demonstration project authority should be revised by 
 eliminating (1) the limit on the number of employees covered by any 
 project, (2) the limit on the number of active demonstration projects 
 permitted, (3) the requirement that Congress be notified regarding 
 the tentatively approved project plan 180 days in advance of the 
 beginning of the project, and (4) the requirement that OPM promulgate 
 regulations.(14) OPM regulations on demonstration projects will be 
 repealed and replaced with written guidance.(15) OPM will require 
 only the minimum amount of data needed to evaluate the project, and 
 overly burdensome quantitative research methodologies will not be 
 imposed. Demonstration projects will be approved by OPM for a five-
 year test period, after which a successful project will be converted 
 to a permanent alternative system. For broadbanding demonstration 
 projects, OPM will publish special project approval criteria so that 
 any agency meeting the criteria will be assured of approval.(16)
<p>
 Based on tests in the federal government (e.g., the Navy's China Lake 
 demonstration project) and on the experience of private sector 
 companies with broadbanding systems, broadbanding does not appear to 
 be a panacea. It carries its own set of challenges and may not be a 
 good fit for every organization or every occupational group. 
 Broadbanding can meet resistance in organizations in which 
 hierarchical rank is important. It can also lead to increased salary 
 costs if the organization does not have (1) managers who are skilled 
 at managing employee pay, (2) an effective performance management 
 system, or (3) appropriate budget controls. However, broadbanding 
 does offer many potential benefits, including simplified 
 classification procedures, empowered managers, more broadly skilled 
 employees, greater lateral job mobility, more flexibility in 
 establishing dual career ladders, and the opportunity to redesign 
 work and create flatter organizations.(17) The recommended approach 
 allows agencies that are ready to move toward broadbanding under a 
 structured approach that manages the associated risks. It would also 
 allow OPM to assume the role of facilitator and promoter of 
 innovation.
<p>
 
 3. Modify the standard 15-grade classification system that applies to 
 those employees not covered by a broadbanding system. (3) 
<p>
 The director of OPM should submit proposed legislation to Congress by 
 fall 1994 that amends the classification law to give employing 
 agencies authority to make final classification decisions and to 
 eliminate OPM's review and compliance authority, effective one year 
 after enactment. During the one-year interim period, agencies should 
 give appropriate training to line managers who will be given 
 classification responsibilities and develop appropriate decision 
 support systems (e.g., human resource planning and costing models). 
 OPM should immediately begin the process of simplifying the standard 
 classification system by reducing the number of job categories used 
 for classification purposes and by developing abbreviated standards 
 that focus solely on full-performance (i.e., journey) levels of work. 
 In addition, as recommended earlier in HRM01, OPM should issue 
 regulations by spring 1994 deleting the requirements that employees 
 serve some minimum amount of time at a lower grade level to qualify 
 for a higher grade (i.e., time-in-grade requirements).(18)
<p>
 OPM should be responsible for developing and maintaining the 
 classification tools to be used by agencies participating in the 
 modified standard 15-grade classification system. OPM should publish 
 the primary classification standard setting forth the basic 
 evaluation criteria that will guide all classification decisions. In 
 the first stage of the simplification effort, it should also publish 
 30 to 50 job-specific classification standards that cover only the 
 most populous jobs and selected benchmarks. Eventually, all paper 
 standards will be eliminated and replaced by a manager-friendly 
 automated classification program. Since OPM standards will focus 
 solely on full-performance levels of work, agencies will be free to 
 assign grades to entry and developmental levels under their own 
 authority and standards, consistent with job qualification 
 requirements.(19) 
<p>
 Agencies should classify full-performance level jobs using the OPM 
 standards, subject to a requirement that final classification 
 decisions be made at a level of management that operates under a 
 fixed budget that includes all pay-related costs. OPM will not have 
 authority to overrule an agency classification action. Each 
 department or agency should be required to provide for internal 
 reviews of a position's classification when requested by an employee. 
 A classification decision would be appealable to a body outside the 
 agency, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, only on the 
 limited grounds that the decision constituted a prohibited personnel 
 practice; the agency's judgments as to the value of different types 
 of work would not be subject to review.(20)
<p>
 A governmentwide job titling system should be retained to support a 
 governmentwide human resources database and external salary surveys; 
 however, job categories should be consolidated to the maximum extent 
 appropriate. It is expected that the number of job series (currently 
 over 450) would be reduced by one-half or more.
<p>
 The modified standard classification system is expected to greatly 
 simplify the job classification process and provide agencies and 
 their line managers with greater flexibility along with 
 accountability for proper administration. The link between 
 classification and budget will be strengthened. With the elimination 
 of its review and compliance authority, OPM would no longer have the 
 role of classification police. The elimination of the time-in-grade 
 requirements will allow managers to promote qualified employees 
 without delay; in addition, since the minimum time-in-grade 
 requirements seem to be viewed by many employees as length-of-service 
 requirements triggering automatic promotion, their elimination may 
 help reinforce the principle that promotions are based on 
 qualifications and abilities, not longevity.
<p>
 
 4. Provide agencies under the standard 15-grade system with 
 additional flexibilities in setting base pay rates. (3)
<p>
 The director of OPM should submit proposed legislation to Congress by 
 fall 1994 that will modify the GS within-grade pay progression 
 scheme. In addition, OPM should submit proposed legislation to 
 Congress by fall 1994 that will provide employing agencies with 
 certain additional flexibilities in setting base pay rates, effective 
 one year after enactment (to correspond with the effective date of 
 the classification system modifications). This latter piece of 
 legislation will include provisions making clear that agency 
 decisions to use or stop using any of the new pay flexibilities are 
 not subject to collective bargaining.
<p>
 The 15-grade pay structure and a standard within-grade pay 
 progression scheme similar to the current scheme will be retained. 
 However, the rigid 10-step framework for progression within each pay 
 grade will be abandoned. Within-grade increases will be equal in 
 dollar value to the current step increases and the waiting periods 
 will remain essentially the same.(21) The main differences will be 
 that Quality Step Increases or QSI's (perhaps renamed as Exceptional 
 Performance Increases) can be less than a full within-grade increment 
 and that an employee's initial rate in grade (upon hire or promotion) 
 will not be required to equal a fixed step rate. This modified 
 standard within-grade progression scheme will also apply to GS-13 to 
 -15 managerial employees who are now covered by PMRS, which expires 
 on October 31, 1993.
<p>
 Agencies should also be able to establish special, alternative 
 within-grade pay progression schemes through a revised demonstration 
 project authority. For example, agencies may wish to experiment with 
 schemes that base within-grade pay progression on the acquisition of 
 specific skills and competencies or that move toward greater use of 
 variable pay (i.e., one-time bonuses and awards) instead of base pay 
 adjustments.
<p>
 Agencies should be given discretionary authority to approve a base 
 pay differential of 10 percent (of the GS base rate) for mission-
 critical positions with a grade no higher than GS-14 that, in the 
 agency's judgment, are significantly undervalued under the standard 
 classification criteria, based on the value assigned by the agency to 
 those mission-critical positions relative to the value (i.e., grades) 
 of other positions in the agency.
<p>
 Agencies should be given discretionary authority to set entry pay up 
 to 10 percent higher than the minimum rate of the entry grade if, in 
 the agency's judgment, it is necessary to meet its recruitment goals. 
 (The authority to set entry pay at any rate in the entry grade based 
 on superior qualifications will also continue.)
<p>
 Agencies should be given discretionary authority to establish, for 
 grades GS-14 and below, local special rate schedules up to 10 percent 
 higher than regular rates (including any locality pay adjustment) for 
 occupations in which recruitment and retention efforts are 
 significantly handicapped due to inadequate pay levels. These special 
 rates can be phased out, at agency discretion; however, the phase-out 
 must be conducted in a way that prevents any employee from suffering 
 an absolute reduction in pay. Thus, agencies should be required to 
 time the phase-out of a special rate to coincide with the effective 
 date of general pay increases. (OPM's authority to approve higher 
 special salary rates upon agency request will also continue. However, 
 the rules for administering OPM-approved special rates should be 
 modified expressly to allow agencies to phase out special rates at 
 their discretion, consistent with the rules for agency-approved 
 special rates.)(22)
<p>
 The intent of the recommended changes is to provide agencies with 
 greater flexibility. While the modifications to the standard within-
 grade pay progression scheme are not dramatic, they will eliminate 
 unnecessary rigidity and allow agencies to make finer distinctions 
 with respect to certain pay decisions. Also, those agencies that wish 
 to adopt a special pay progression scheme can do so through the 
 liberalized demonstration project authority, which will allow for 
 permanent adoption of a successful project as an alternative system. 
 The new flexibilities to increase base pay (subject to overall budget 
 constraints) will permit agencies to respond quickly to special 
 situations and reduce the temptation to manipulate the classification 
 system. Given the visibility of the proposed pay flexibilities, 
 agencies would have strong internal and external incentives to use 
 them prudently. OPM evaluation and reporting on agency pay practices 
 would reinforce accountability. The new rules for phasing out special 
 salary rates would make clear that special rates are paid at agency 
 discretion and are not a matter of statutory entitlement.
<p>
 
 5. Establish reporting requirements that apply to both the modified 
 standard system and any broadbanding system. (3)
<p>
 In conjunction with the law changes proposed above, the director of 
 OPM should submit proposed legislation to Congress by fall 1994 that 
 would expressly authorize OPM to collect compensation data from 
 agencies and require advance public notice of significant 
 classification and pay actions. OPM will develop specific reporting 
 requirements, including the following:
<p>
 --- Agencies will be required to issue a 60-day advance public notice 
 regarding their intention to upgrade or downgrade any group of 
 positions with 100 or more incumbents, or to authorize special salary 
 rates or a mission-critical differential.
<p>
 --- Agencies will be required to provide OPM with data on 
 compensation practices. To the maximum extent possible, the data will 
 be collected through OPM's Central Personnel Data File system, which 
 will be enhanced as necessary. OPM will issue an annual public report 
 providing selected compensation data (e.g., number and percentage 
 employees in full performance level grades or bands by job category 
 and agency, average and median salaries by job category and agency, 
 total payroll costs by job category and agency, etc.), with 
 historical data also provided for comparison purposes.
<p>
 The overall fiscal impact of the proposed changes to the 
 classification system (i.e., broadbanding and decentralization) can 
 be monitored and controlled within agency budget constraints. Agency 
 decisions could produce additional costs in some areas while 
 providing offsetting savings in other areas. As the classification 
 system is simplified and automated and as line managers assume 
 responsibility for classifying positions, the amount of staff years 
 devoted to classification by personnelists (and associated 
 administrative costs) should be significantly reduced in the long 
 term.
<p>
 No cost estimate can be assigned to the special pay flexibilities 
 being proposed since they are discretionary. It is presumed that 
 agencies will have to absorb within their budgets any increased costs 
 associated with use of these discretionary authorities. It should be 
 noted that elimination of the fixed steps in the GS pay system would 
 prevent $80 million in conversion costs (not anticipated in the 
 President's budget) that would otherwise result from slotting PMRS-
 covered managers back into a fixed-step schedule.

<H2> HRM03:  Authorize Agencies to Develop Programs for  Improvement of Individual and 
Organizational Performance</H2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 Following the lead of the private sector, the Civil Service Reform 
 Act of 1978 established governmentwide performance management systems 
 for federal employees that linked employee pay to individual 
 performance.
<p>
 The system was designed to serve as a vehicle to improve agency and 
 individual performance through improved communications of performance 
 expectations between employees and supervisors. A yearly work plan, 
 consisting of critical elements and performance standards, was 
 envisioned to support agency planning and accomplishment of work. 
 Ongoing feedback from the supervisor, including a formal, end-of-the-
 year appraisal, would provide feedback to the employee. Management 
 decisions on promotions, awards, training, and retention were to be 
 linked directly to the performance management process.(1)
<p>
 Currently, there are separate performance management systems for 
 supervisors and general managers (GM) included in the Performance 
 Management and Recognition System (PMRS), and employees included in 
 the General Schedule (GS). PMRS expires on October 31, 1993; thus, 
 new legislation is required. Congress established a PMRS Review 
 Committee as part of the PMRS Amendments of 1991 to advise the Office 
 of Personnel Management (OPM) on improvements to PMRS. Congress 
 reaffirmed its commitment to the linkage of pay and performance in 
 the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of November 5, 
 1990, and directed OPM to establish a Pay for Performance Labor 
 Management Committee to advise OPM on the design and establishment of 
 pay for performance systems for GS employees. In May 1993, OPM 
 circulated a working draft proposal for changes in performance 
 management systems titled "Principles and Features of Performance 
 Management Reform." The OPM recommendations are similar to the 
 National Performance Review recommended actions.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
<p>
 Performance management systems for GS and GM employees, in the view 
 of virtually all observers (e.g., the General Accounting Office, 
 Merit Systems Protection Board, National Academy of Public 
 Administration, National Research Council, and academic researchers 
 such as Perry and Ingraham), have not resulted in the desired 
 improvements in individual and organizational performance. The 
 failure of performance management systems to improve performance 
 results from several factors:
<p>
 --- Performance management systems were designed to meet multiple, 
 sometimes conflicting purposes (performance, pay, retention, 
 development), and as a result meet none of them.
<p>
 --- Systems are governmentwide, inflexible, and not responsive to the 
 varying needs and cultures of diverse federal agencies.
<p>
 --- Systems are not owned by managers who must make them work but 
 are, instead, seen as belonging to OPM.
<p>
 --- There is an overemphasis on dealing with the poor performer, and 
 insufficient emphasis on improving the performance of the majority of 
 employees who meet expectations now but can do even better in the 
 future.
<p>
 --- Systems are perceived as top-down control mechanisms rather than 
 tools for empowering employees and supervisors to improve 
 performance.
<p>
 --- Systems emphasize individual performance and do not support 
 emerging efforts to manage group and organizational performance.
<p>
 --- Employees report that too frequently there is inadequate 
 communication of performance expectations and feedback on 
 performance.
<p>
 --- There are perceived inaccuracies in performance ratings, 
 perceived rating quotas, and negative perceptions of the fully 
 satisfactory rating.
<p>
 --- The performance appraisal is often threatening to employee and 
 supervisor alike, inhibiting the opportunities for meaningful 
 communication.
<p>
 --- Performance ratings are generally thought to be inflated, e.g., 
 the average rating for a GM employee in 1991 was 4.1 on the required 
 five-point scale; for GS employees, the average rating was 3.95.
<p>
 --- Performance ratings are unevenly distributed by grade, gender, 
 occupation, geographic location, ethnic group, and agency.
<p>
 The ideal performance management program will have one objective: 
 improvement of individual and organizational performance. Agencies 
 will be required to develop performance management programs that meet 
 their unique needs and are consistent with the culture of their 
 organization. Performance management programs will seek to improve 
 the performance of all employees, both the majority of employees who 
 meet performance expectations now and the few who do not. Employees 
 and their representatives will be involved in design and 
 implementation of performance management programs and with 
 development of performance expectations. 
<p>
 Feedback on performance--during and at the end of the period--should 
 be developmental in nature, focusing on how to improve future 
 performance. To reinforce the emphasis on improvement of future 
 performance, performance ratings and awards should be disassociated 
 and independent of each other; i.e., after a determination is made 
 that performance meets expectations, a further determination would be 
 made to decide which of the employees who meet expectations will 
 receive special recognition. Decisions about recognition could 
 include factors unique to work group and organization mission and 
 culture.
<p>
<p>
<b> Action</b>
 <p>
 Authorize agencies to design their own performance management 
 programs. (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should submit draft legislation to 
 Congress to authorize agencies to design and implement performance 
 management programs based on the following principles:
<p>
 --- Performance management is a developmental tool with one 
 objective: improvement of individual and organizational performance.
<p>
 --- Employees and/or their representatives must be fully involved in 
 design and implementation of performance management programs and in 
 development of performance standards; in the case of employees 
 represented by a union, collective bargaining will be required.
<p>
 --- Employees must be involved in development of performance 
 expectations and receive feedback for improvement of future 
 performance.
<p>
 --- At least two levels of performance must be identified: meets and 
 does not meet expectations.
<p>
 Complete decentralization of performance management within a 
 framework of broad, governmentwide principles is expected to result 
 in development of agency-based performance management programs that 
 meet each agency's unique needs. Agencies should be able to develop 
 performance management programs that seek improved performance of all 
 employees. Development of agency-based programs will result in 
 programs that are owned by agency managers. 
<p>
 Involving employees and their representatives in development and 
 implementation of performance management programs should result in 
 programs that are owned by employees. Identifying a single objective 
 for performance management makes it easier to achieve that objective, 
 and to evaluate the success of performance management programs. 
 Disassociating performance ratings and awards reinforces the emphasis 
 on the objective of performance improvement. Agency heads, who are 
 responsible for organizational performance, should be held 
 accountable for development and use of performance management 
 programs. Results-oriented accountability factors include 
 improvements in organizational performance, ownership of the system 
 by employees and supervisors, and the vigilance of employee unions 
 and associations of management-level employees.

<H2> HRM04:  Authorize Agencies to Develop Incentive Award and Bonus 
 Systems to Improve Individual and Organizational Performance</H2>
<p> 
 <b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 Federal law provides for monetary awards for various categories of 
 employees and requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to 
 issue regulations to govern agency awards programs. OPM has issued 
 supplemental guidance for use by agencies in designing and managing 
 productivity gainsharing programs. Agencies also establish 
 nonmonetary and honor award programs under their own broad 
 administrative authority. 
<p>
 Since 1978, Congress, following the lead of the private sector, has 
 attempted to link pay and performance through merit pay and other pay 
 for performance programs. The current merit pay system for 
 nonmanagerial General Schedule (GS) employees provides that employees 
 with a fully successful rating receive within-grade step increases at 
 scheduled intervals (from one to three years depending on position in 
 rate range). In addition, employees may, no more than once a year, 
 receive additional step increases--Quality Step Increases--based on 
 outstanding performance. The Performance Management and Recognition 
 System (PMRS) applies to supervisors and managers at grades 13-15. 
 Employees covered by PMRS who are rated fully successful receive the 
 general GS increase and an annual merit increase and are eligible for 
 performance awards. Employees rated less than fully successful 
 receive a partial or no general increase and are not eligible for 
 merit increases and performance awards.
<p>
 Congress reaffirmed its commitment to pay for performance in the 
 Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. In May 1993, OPM 
 circulated a working draft proposal, "Principles and Features of 
 Performance Management Reform," which describes reform of employee 
 performance planning, assessment, and incentive systems.
<p>
 In 1991, two congressionally mandated committees made recommendations 
 for improving pay for performance for federal government employees in 
 "Advancing Managerial Excellence: A Report on Improving the 
 Performance Management and Recognition System," which looked at PMRS 
 for managerial employees, and "Strengthening the Link Between Pay and 
 Performance: Report of the Pay for Performance Labor Management 
 Committee," which considered pay for performance for nonmanagerial 
 employees. PMRS expires on October 31, 1993. As a result, legislation 
 will be needed to provide a substitute performance incentive system 
 for GM employees.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 Pay for performance programs have had mixed results in both the 
 public and private sectors. After several years of experience and 
 study, informed observers (e.g., the General Accounting Office (GAO), 
 the Merit Systems Protection Board, the National Research Council) 
 agree that (1) there is insufficient empirical evidence that pay for 
 performance programs are effective, and (2) variable pay or bonuses 
 are superior to base pay adjustments for improving employee 
 performance. Federal employees generally do not believe that pay and 
 performance are in fact linked, and the majority of employees do not 
 believe they were treated fairly with regard to awards.
<p>
 Governmentwide incentive programs are not responsive to organization-
 specific needs and objectives, workforce characteristics, and agency 
 cultures. The emphasis is primarily on incentives and awards for 
 individual performance, not those that recognize organizational or 
 team performance, or even individual contributions to team 
 accomplishments. The current approach promotes competition, with 
 winners and losers, rather than cooperation and cohesion, which are 
 important elements in most successful government programs. 
 Productivity gainsharing is not widely used even though it has proven 
 to be an effective tool for improving organizational performance. 
 Agencies do not approach bonuses and awards in a comprehensive 
 manner--each award or award category is seen as independent of all 
 other bonuses and awards. Monetary awards tend to be emphasized and 
 non-monetary awards deemphasized. Finally, it is generally believed 
 that pay for performance initiatives have been insufficiently funded, 
 which contributes to their lack of effectiveness.
<p>
 A promising but relatively little-used approach to linking awards 
 with improved performance is productivity gainsharing. GAO defines 
 gainsharing as "incentive systems that measure gains in employee 
 productivity and share the savings generated between employees and 
 the organization."(1) Typically about half of the savings or gains 
 are retained by the organization, and the other half are divided 
 among the employees who were responsible for those savings. GAO 
 looked at 18 gainsharing programs in the Department of Defense (DOD) 
 and found that all of them reported documented cost savings ($7,000 
 to over $1 million) and indirect benefits such as decreased sick 
 leave usage and reduction in overtime costs.(2) They concluded: 
 "DOD's gainsharing efforts to date demonstrate that individual/small 
 group programs can generate cost savings and other related 
 improvements."(3) GAO also looked at private gainsharing efforts and 
 found similar success. GAO identified three major trends in private 
 sector gainsharing: "gainsharing programs based on organizationwide 
 productivity measurements are replacing programs based on individual 
 or small group productivity measurements . . . organizational 
 "gainsharing programs are achieving high success rates . . . [and] 
 private sector firms are increasingly using employee participation 
 systems in their gainsharing programs."(4)
<p>
 An ideal performance incentive system provides managers with the 
 tools they need to reward and motivate excellent performance. Base 
 pay adjustments are predictable--which is important to employees; 
 variable pay or bonuses can be used as an incentive for improving 
 employee performance--which is important to managers. The awards 
 available are both monetary and non-monetary and are designed to be 
 consistent with the unique characteristics of the work, the 
 workforce, and culture of the organization. Individuals, teams, and 
 organizations are rewarded and recognized for performance. 
 Productivity gainsharing is used as an incentive to improve 
 organizational performance.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Authorize agencies to develop their own incentive programs. (3) 
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should submit draft legislation to 
 Congress to authorize agencies to develop their own incentive 
 programs. Agency-based incentive award and bonus programs should be 
 based on the following principles:
<p>
 --- The objective of incentive programs is improvement of individual 
 and organizational performance.
<p>
 --- An employee who meets performance expectations is eligible for 
 recognition through an incentive program that includes monetary 
 awards or bonuses and/or non-monetary awards (base pay adjustments 
 are discussed in HRM02, "Reform the General Schedule Classification 
 and Basic Pay System").
<p>
 --- Employees and their representatives will be involved in 
 development of incentive programs, which, in the case of employees 
 represented by an employee union, will be through collective 
 bargaining.
<p>
 --- Departments and agencies are encouraged to experiment with 
 alternatives to traditional employee incentive programs, such as 
 organizational and team recognition and non-monetary recognition 
 (e.g., increased authority, additional resources, or a menu of reward 
 options from which employees or teams of employees can choose).
<p>
 Complete decentralization of incentives within a framework of 
 governmentwide principles is expected to result in development of 
 agency-based incentive systems that are unified, consistent with 
 agency cultures, and owned by managers and employees who will help 
 develop them. Employee and union involvement will be required. Base 
 pay adjustments should remain predictable and uniform, in keeping 
 with the recommendation of the Pay for Performance Labor Management 
 Committee. Variable pay in the form of non-monetary and monetary 
 incentives would be available as a tool for performance improvement.
<p>
 2. Encourage agencies to establish productivity gainsharing programs 
 called Federal Performance Sharing to support the reinvention and 
 change effort. (1)
<p>
 The director of the Federal Quality Institute should form, sponsor, 
 and support a temporary team of government experts to plan and 
 implement a six-month campaign to encourage establishment of 
 gainsharing programs, called Federal Performance Sharing, by agencies 
 governmentwide. To achieve its objective, the team may conduct 
 briefings, develop training programs, organize conferences, 
 consult/provide technical assistance, develop information systems, 
 develop reporting systems, and organize interagency networks. 
 Performance sharing should be a cooperative effort between employees 
 and managers. Employees and their representatives must be involved in 
 the creation, design, and implementation of agency-based Federal 
 Performance Sharing, which, in the case of employees represented by 
 an employee union, will require collective bargaining.
<p>
 Performance sharing could be an important incentive for employees and 
 managers to implement National Performance Review (NPR) 
 recommendations; if by implementing NPR recommendations, employees 
 and managers can make government work better and cost less, they can 
 share in the savings. Performance sharing emphasizes results, mission 
 accomplishment, and empowerment, and is an appropriate incentive for 
 reinvention.

<H2> HRM05:  Strengthen Systems to Support Management in Dealing with Poor Performers</H2>
<p> 
 <b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Merit Systems Protection 
 Board (MSPB), after collecting data through surveys and/or site 
 visits, concluded that effective federal managers can and regularly 
 do deal with poor performers, either rehabilitating them or removing 
 them. MSPB reported that about 64 percent of the federal supervisors 
 they surveyed had dealt with at least one poor performer in the past 
 two years; 90 percent said they counseled and worked with poor 
 performers informally; and 88 percent said they would take formal 
 action if and when such informal actions fail.(1) Similarly, GAO 
 reported, "Contrary to general perceptions, supervisors were 
 generally willing to deal with their poor performers and expressed a 
 willingness to deal with them in the future."(2) However, GAO also 
 reported that supervisors view the process for dealing with poor 
 performers as unduly difficult and time-consuming. GAO found that an 
 average supervisor spent about five hours per week working with each 
 poor performer under his or her supervision and that this time 
 commitment could last for months. Furthermore, GAO found that the 
 slowness of the process discouraged some supervisors from taking any 
 serious action against a poor performer.(3)
<p>
 GAO noted that supervisors have the greatest difficulty dealing with 
 employees who are rated minimally satisfactory. This rating falls 
 between unsatisfactory and fully satisfactory in five-level rating 
 systems. There are few actions that a supervisor can take to deal 
 with employees who are rated minimally satisfactory, and, as a 
 result, some employees remain at this level for extended periods of 
 time. One option that GAO proposed for consideration was eliminating 
 the minimally satisfactory rating.(4)
<p>
 The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) sought to make it easier 
 for managers to deal with poor performers by developing better 
 performance management systems and reforming the appeals and 
 grievance processes to make them less of a deterrent to employee 
 discipline. As noted in HRM03, CSRA and post-CSRA performance 
 management systems have not resulted in improved individual and 
 organizational performance. CSRA did modify the burden of proof 
 necessary to sustain a performance-based adverse action. Whereas the 
 burden of proof in an adverse action because of misconduct is the 
 preponderance of evidence standard, there is a lower standard of 
 proof on an agency in an appeal of a performance-based adverse 
 action--the substantial evidence standard. Legal experts explain: 
 "This means, in practice, that even if the employee presents a good 
 argument that he performed his job, the supervisor's judgment that 
 the employee did not accomplish his job will be accepted unless the 
 supervisor's opinion is unreasonable or has no factual support. This 
 evidentiary standard has resulted in nearly all performance-based 
 adverse actions being sustained by the MSPB . . ."(5) They also point 
 out potential difficulties: "The most frequent reason an agency has 
 difficulty sustaining a performance-based adverse action is an 
 inadequately developed performance standard."(6)
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 There are improvements in systems, culture, and skill that can help 
 managers deal more effectively with poor performers.
<p>
 Improved Systems. 
 As noted in HRM03, current performance management programs have 
 multiple conflicting objectives and as a result meet none of them--
 most importantly, the objective that performance improve. In 
 addition, performance management programs were not designed to be 
 consistent with or supportive of agency culture and are not owned by 
 agency managers. The actions contained in HRM03 are designed to 
 result in agency-based performance management programs that seek 
 improvement in the performance of all employees and identify poor 
 performers for appropriate action. Agencies would, for example, be 
 able to design performance management systems that do not include the 
 minimally satisfactory rating. Agencies can use the performance 
 incentives described in HRM04 to motivate employees to improve their 
 performance. Agencies also need to develop their own approaches to 
 help poor performers improve their performance so it meets 
 expectations, and take appropriate action if performance expectations 
 are not met after assistance is provided.
<p>
 It is also important that changes be made in performance systems to 
 reduce the amount of time it takes to deal with poor performers. For 
 example, the length of time that poor performers are given to 
 demonstrate improved performance is often considered excessive. The 
 30-day notice period that the law requires before removal or certain 
 other adverse actions can be taken is also too long. After action is 
 taken against poor performers, there can be a lengthy review and 
 appeal process. While an employee's right to due process must be 
 protected, there is a need for streamlining the current processes. 
 The actions outlined in HRM08, "Improve Processes and Procedures 
 Established to Provide Workplace Due Process for Employees," if 
 adopted, would contribute to streamlined appeals processes, 
 especially if agencies adopt alternative dispute resolution methods.
<p>
 Cultural Changes. 
 GAO recommended that "agency management . . . focus on creating an 
 environment within which supervisors are encouraged and motivated to 
 identify poor performers and are properly trained and supported when 
 they attempt to deal with them."(7) Similarly, 25 percent of the 
 supervisors surveyed by MSPB reported that lack of management support 
 was an obstacle to taking action against poor performers. Managers 
 and supervisors must be more effectively supported in dealing with 
 poor performers. Agency management must be held accountable for 
 establishing a culture that supports high performance and development 
 of excellent performance management programs. Managers and 
 supervisors throughout an agency must be held accountable for using 
 culture and programs to achieve organizational goals, improve 
 employee performance, and rehabilitate or remove poor performers. 
 Moving to a more results-oriented management culture will support 
 this change.
<p>
 Improved Knowledge and Skills. Training can be an effective way to 
 improve supervisory skills. The most critical skills are the 
 interpersonal skills that a supervisor needs to communicate with an 
 employee to develop performance standards, provide performance 
 feedback, and improve employee performance. Supervisors also need 
 skill in performance planning and performance management. Knowledge 
 of performance management and disciplinary policies and procedures 
 should be part of a comprehensive training effort and made readily 
 available to managers or supervisors through written or electronic 
 job aids that explain the rules and how to apply them. Managers and 
 supervisors also need technical assistance from knowledgeable 
 consultants with expertise in this area.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Reduce by half the time required to terminate federal managers and 
 employees for cause. Make other improvements in the systems for 
 dealing with poor performers. (3)
<p>
 In designing performance management programs as outlined in HRM03, 
 agencies should include methods through which the time frames for 
 terminating employees for cause will be reduced by half. To support 
 this effort, the director of OPM will develop legislation to change 
 the required time for notice of termination from 30 days to 15 days. 
 This legislation should also require the waiting period for a within-
 grade increase to be extended by the amount of time an employee's 
 performance does not meet expectations; that is, only the time that 
 an employee's performance meets expectations will be creditable 
 toward the required waiting period.
<p>
 
 2. Develop a culture of performance that supports supervisors' 
 efforts to deal with poor performers. (1)
<p>
 Agency heads should create an organizational culture in which high 
 performance is expected and performance management programs are seen 
 as tools for achieving high performance. Agency heads should hold 
 managers and supervisors accountable for dealing with poor 
 performers--ensuring that managers (1) give assistance to employees 
 who fail to meet performance expectations, and (2) take appropriate 
 action (e.g., reassignment, demotion, or removal) if the employee's 
 performance does not improve. Agencies should develop methods and 
 procedures for monitoring how managers and supervisors deal with poor 
 performers and use the information collected to identify issues that 
 require the attention of top management, such as changes in the 
 performance management system or skill deficiencies that can be 
 addressed through training.
<p>
 
 3. Improve supervisors' knowledge and skills in dealing with poor 
 performers. (1)
<p>
 Agency heads should give managers and supervisors training as needed 
 in performance management, including development of performance 
 standards and the interpersonal skills required for successful 
 management of performance. Agencies should give managers and 
 supervisors support (such as job aids or expert systems) and 
 assistance (e.g., consultation as needed) in improving the 
 performance of all employees, especially the poor performers, and in 
 removal of employees if performance does not improve.
<p>
 Developing effective systems that are focused specifically on 
 performance improvement, creating a culture where high performance is 
 expected and recognized and poor performance dealt with effectively 
 and expeditiously, and ensuring that supervisors have the knowledge, 
 skills, and support they need to improve employee performance are 
 expected to enhance the efforts of supervisors to deal with poor 
 performers. Requiring agencies to monitor efforts to deal with poor 
 performers and using that information to improve systems, culture, 
 and support for performance improvement should help keep attention 
 focused on this critical issue.

<H2> HRM06:  Clearly Define the Objective of Training as the Improvement 
 of Individual and Organizational Performance; Make Training More 
 Market-Driven</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
 The Government Employees Training Act (GETA) of 1958 authorizes 
 agencies to manage their own training, determine their own training 
 needs, and select and fund training to meet those needs. The Volcker 
 Commission offered the following assessment of agency effectiveness 
 in exercising that authority:
<p>
 Federal training is suffering from an identity crisis. Agencies are 
 not sure what they should train for (short-term or long-term), who 
 should get the lion's share of resources (entry level or senior 
 level), when employees need additional education (once a year or more 
 often), and whether mid-career education is of value. . . . Career 
 paths are poorly designed, executive succession is accidental and 
 unplanned, and real-time training for pressured managers is virtually 
 nonexistent. At both the career and presidential level, training is 
 all-too-often ad hoc and self-initiated.(1)
<p>
 To strengthen training in government, the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM) assumed a more active leadership role and, in 1992, 
 developed a series of human resource development policy initiatives 
 including requirements for comprehensive training needs assessment, 
 employee orientation, and management development.
<p>
 In the high-performing organization, training is seen as an 
 investment in a strategic resource and thus is funded to the extent 
 required for achievement of organizational mission; these excellent 
 organizations are often called "learning organizations." The ideal 
 training program is designed to improve individual and organizational 
 performance. Training must be based on a careful needs assessment and 
 rigorously evaluated to ensure that it is cost-effective. Based on a 
 training needs assessment, one or more tools may be selected to help 
 employees, individually or in teams, develop the knowledge, skills, 
 and abilities they need to improve performance. Some of the more 
 common learning methodologies include coaching, counseling, on-the-
 job training, developmental job assignments, computer-based 
 instruction, job aids, expert systems, independent study, and 
 classroom instruction.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 Training is not always seen primarily as a tool for improving 
 individual and organizational performance; GETA cites "increasing 
 economy and efficiency in the Government" as the purpose of training. 
 GETA places a series of limitations on use of training from non-
 governmental sources, which results in regulations on how training is 
 to be managed. Limitations appropriate in 1958, when training was in 
 its infancy in both government and the private sector, are no longer 
 relevant. GETA requires that training be related to the official 
 duties of an employee, which has been interpreted by some to preclude 
 retraining and multi-skilling of government employees. Training is 
 too frequently ad hoc and employee-originated, and seldom linked to 
 strategic or human resource planning. Information for more strategic 
 management of training is generally not available. Managers generally 
 are not able to determine the effectiveness of or the return on their 
 investment in training. Interagency training is frequently perceived 
 by agency managers as not responsive to their needs and too costly 
 when compared to other sources of training.
<p>
 Many observers believe that training in the federal government is 
 inadequately funded; the Volcker Commission found that in 1989 the 
 government spent "about three-quarters of 1 percent of its payroll 
 dollars on civilian training, compared with 3 to 5 percent in the 
 most effective private firms."(2) Training is usually seen as a cost, 
 not an investment. Training costs are not generally included in cost 
 estimates for new systems or programs, and usually are not a part of 
 the budget process. Training is too often a quick fix even though it 
 may not be the best solution to a performance problem or the best way 
 to impart knowledge about a regulation or requirement. Training is 
 frequently seen as something that happens only in the classroom, and, 
 as a result, other methods for improving performance such as job 
 aids, expert systems, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring, 
 developmental work assignments, job redesign, and computer-based 
 instruction are not considered.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Deregulate training and make it more responsive to market sources. 
 (3)
<p>
 The director of OPM should submit draft legislation to Congress by 
 January 1994 that would amend GETA to:
<p>
 --- identify the objective of training: improvement of individual and 
 organizational performance,
<p>
 --- change the requirement that training be related to performance of 
 official duties to relate it to mission achievement, and
<p>
 --- eliminate the distinction between government and non-government 
 training.
<p>
 Clarifying the purpose of training in GETA will strengthen the 
 emphasis on performance improvement and results. Linking training to 
 the mission of the department or agency rather than the official 
 duties of the employee will facilitate retraining and multi-skilling 
 during a period of transition and change. Removing the distinction 
 between government and non-government training will help deregulate 
 training and make it more responsive to market forces.
<p>
 
 2. Give agencies the flexibility to use savings realized from 
 reinvention to increase their investment in employee training and 
 development. (1)
<p>
 Agencies are encouraged to invest part of the savings resulting from 
 implementation of National Performance Review recommendations and 
 actions in training and development of employees, supervisors, and 
 managers to support further reinvention and change. Training funded 
 in this manner might include quality improvement, benchmarking, 
 performance measurement, customer service, reengineering and 
 leading/managing change. Training could also be provided to help 
 employees acquire the knowledge and skills they need to do their 
 current jobs better, or retrain them for different jobs. 
<p>
 Authorizing agencies to use savings resulting from reinvention to 
 finance employee training and development provides additional 
 incentive for reinvention, increases the funds available to invest in 
 employee training, and helps ensure that the federal workforce 
 becomes more effective and productive.

Enable Employees to Manage Work and Family Responsibilities
<HR>
<p>
<H2> HRM07:  Enhance Programs to Provide Family-Friendly Workplaces</H2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
 The federal government has traditionally been viewed as a family-
 friendly employer with many programs in place to help employees 
 balance work and family responsibilities. The Federal Employees 
 Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1978 gives agencies the 
 authority to provide flexible and compressed work schedules for their 
 employees.(1) The Federal Employees Part-time Career Employment Act 
 of 1978 requires federal agencies to increase part-time opportunities 
 for federal employees at all grade levels.(2) In 1990, Congress again 
 tried to increase the availability of part-time employment for 
 interested individuals by requiring the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM) to establish a job sharing program.
<p>
 The Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act of 1988 authorizes agencies 
 to participate in voluntary pilot leave transfer and leave bank 
 programs.(3) The federal government does not provide short-term 
 disability benefits for its employees, except for job-related illness 
 and injuries, so leave sharing helps employees maintain some or all 
 income through a period of temporary disability or family medical 
 crisis. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993(4) provides up to 12 
 administrative workweeks of unpaid family and medical leave for 
 federal employees.(5)
<p>
 In January 1990, the General Services Administration (GSA) and OPM 
 implemented the Federal Flexible Workplace Pilot Project (Flexiplace) 
 to gain experience and information from work-at-home programs, 
 satellite work center programs, and flexiplace accommodations for 
 disabled workers. Congress demonstrated continued support for the 
 Flexiplace project in September 1992, when it appropriated $5 million 
 to GSA to establish three telecommuting centers. The telecommuting 
 centers will provide alternate worksites for federal employees who 
 currently commute long distances between their homes and worksites in 
 the Washington, D.C., area.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 Changes in societal values and demographics indicate that family-
 friendly policies and workplaces will become increasingly critical 
 for recruitment, retention, and improved productivity of employees. 
 Family-friendly policies serve the needs of a diverse workforce 
 struggling to manage child care, elder care, family emergencies, and 
 other personal responsibilities while at the same time remaining 
 committed to professional development and advancement. Governmentwide 
 implementation of these policies will enable agencies to foster a 
 quality work environment that meets the emerging needs of their 
 employees and customers. The benefits of family-friendly policies are 
 well documented:
<p>
 Recent studies of such companies as Johnson & Johnson and American 
 Telephone & Telegraph show that helping employees resolve work and 
 family conflicts boosts morale and increases productivity. The J&J 
 study found that absenteeism among employees who used flexible time 
 and family-leave policies was on average 50% less than for the work 
 force as a whole. It also found that 58% of the employees surveyed 
 said such policies were very important in their decision to stay at 
 the company--the number jumped to 71% among employees using the 
 benefits.(6)
<p>
 In 1991, the Conference Board concluded:
<p>
 Flexitime improves basic work conditions by allowing adjustments in 
 commuting times, reducing anxiety about tardiness, and shifting 
 management's focus away from monitoring attendance. . . . [F]lexible 
 work schedules increase employee responsibility, independence and 
 growth potential, thus motivating the employee. . . . Flexitime was 
 typically mentioned as the arrangement found most advantageous in 
 reducing absenteeism and turnover.(7)
<p>
 
 A federal employee writing to the National Performance Review 
 stressed that part-time employment and job sharing is an important 
 option for many federal employees.
<p>
 Workers should be offered a chance to convert to part-time status 
 whenever possible, if they think their finances will permit it, in 
 order to have more time with young children or aging or infirm 
 parents, or to attend to their own health problems, or to continue 
 their education to stay abreast of changing technology. . . . Some 
 individuals might want part-time work as an alternative or precursor 
 to full retirement.(8)
<p>
 
 The Progressive Policy Institute's Mandate for Change emphasized that 
 the federal government should take a leadership role in flexiplace 
 work arrangements, including telecommuting.
<p>
 The federal government, which as one of the nation's largest 
 employers led the way in the use of flex-time schedules, should begin 
 to offer telecommuting options to qualified interested employees. In 
 addition to the parenting advantages that telecommuting provides for 
 families with small children, it offers economic and environmental 
 advantages for society by reducing the number of commuters.(9)

 Flexiplace and telecommuting reduce individual and family stress, 
 save valuable commuting time, reduce commuting and work-related costs 
 for the employee, and increase civic involvement and volunteerism in 
 nearby communities. Flexible work arrangements will generate 
 environmental and energy conservation benefits by alleviating traffic 
 congestion, reducing air pollution, and reducing consumption of 
 fossil fuels. Evaluation of the federal government's Flexiplace pilot 
 found that vehicle usage decreased for 82 percent of participants 
 during rush hour and 35 percent of participants during non-rush hour; 
 sick leave usage decreased for 45 percent of participants.(10) The 
 evaluation went on to say: "More than 90 percent of the supervisors 
 and 95 percent of the participants judged that Flexiplace job 
 performance was either unchanged or improved relative to pre-
 Flexiplace performance levels."(11)
<p>
 
 OPM's final evaluation of the Flexiplace pilot concluded:
<p>
 Flexiplace shows promise as a mechanism for reducing Federal 
 operating and health care costs. Indications of improved job 
 performance (productivity), reduced usage of sick leave (benefits), 
 improved health (health care), and reduced vehicle usage 
 (transportation/energy issues) for a significant portion of the 
 participant group suggest long run reduction in costs associated with 
 these areas.(12)
<p>
 The evaluation found that the actual organizational costs of 
 Flexiplace were minimal. More than 80 percent of supervisors reported 
 no additional costs.(13) Significant monetary savings will occur as 
 agencies begin to include flexible workplace arrangements in their 
 federal building planning and technology purchasing strategies. "[W]e 
 anticipate long run reductions in facility costs with expanded 
 utilization of Flexiplace. The ability of agencies to implement 
 successful Flexiplace pilots with minimal funding, however, is a 
 strong indication of the applicability of Flexiplace to diverse 
 organizations."(14)
<p>
 The federal government should be viewed as a model employer in the 
 availability and flexibility of quality of worklife programs that 
 emphasize the tools employees at all levels need to manage their work 
 responsibilities and personal lives more effectively.(15) Successful 
 programs will foster interagency and intergovernmental partnerships, 
 encourage cooperation between management and employees, spark 
 collaborative ventures between public and private organizations, and 
 bring harmony to the workplace and community in which they reside.
<p>
 
 Some of the problems and barriers faced by agencies and employees 
 include:
<p>
 Legislative Barriers to Innovation. 
 Federal agencies are stymied in their efforts to address emerging 
 employee needs because most employee benefit policies are codified 
 into law--literally requiring an act of Congress to modify them. 
 Legislation bars most agencies from experimenting with different 
 benefit policies; therefore, the governmentwide implications of 
 options such as cafeteria benefit plans and flexible spending 
 accounts are not known. In a 1992 report, the General Accounting 
 Office stated:
<p>
 
 The likelihood of federal agencies falling behind their nonfederal 
 counterparts in the work/family area may be even greater in the 
 future. The rapid growth of nonfederal work/family programs, such as 
 flexible benefits, flexible spending accounts, and child care 
 assistance, suggest that these programs could well become standard 
 employment policies in the future. Thus, whereas the adoption of 
 work/family programs today may give an employer a competitive 
 advantage, in the future, employers may need to offer these programs 
 just to avoid being at a competitive disadvantage.(16)
<p>
 Legislative barriers prevent many agencies from implementing flexible 
 work arrangements with their employees; some of the barriers for 
 Flexiplace were waived for the duration of the pilot project when 
 Congress passed legislation in November 1990.(17) Some examples of 
 the limitations placed upon agencies attempting to provide dependent 
 care services include a law that limits agencies to providing the 
 facility and services related to the maintenance and operation of 
 child care centers located solely in federally owned or leased space, 
 and a September 31, 1992, decision of the U.S. Comptroller General 
 that the law prohibits agencies from using appropriated funds for 
 adult day care programs or contributing any financial resources to 
 private adult day care centers.(18)
<p>
 Lack of Clear Agency Support and Implementation of Available 
 Programs. Many agencies have not developed policies advocating the 
 use of flexibilities available to help employees balance work and 
 family responsibilities. In a recent survey of federal employees 
 conducted by OPM, only 53 percent of employees with dependent care 
 needs believe their agencies understand and support family issues. 
 Approximately 38 percent of employees indicated that their agencies 
 do not provide any dependent care services beyond Employee Assistance 
 Programs. Approximately 77 percent of employees with dependent care 
 needs who are currently working fixed schedules are interested in 
 working compressed/flexible schedules.(19) OPM found that:
<p>
 [T]he employee survey data suggest that certain agencies may have 
 internal barriers that make supervisors reluctant to approve employee 
 requests to work part-time. Of the supervisors who have denied 
 employee requests to work part-time, at least 19 percent did so 
 because of internal barriers, i.e., the agency's internal systems 
 made it difficult and/or that their agency stressed full-time 
 employment.(20)
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Implement family-friendly workplace practices while continuing to 
 ensure accountability for quality customer service. (2)
<p>
 The President should issue an Executive Order in summer 1994 
 advocating (a) adoption of compressed/flexible, part-time, and job 
 sharing work schedules; and (b) implementation of flexiplace and 
 telecommuting where appropriate.
<p>
 
 2. Provide telecommunications and administrative support necessary 
 for employees participating in flexiplace and telecommuting work 
 arrangements. (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, OPM and GSA should submit proposed legislation to 
 Congress repealing section 1348 of title 31, United States Code, 
 "which prohibits federal agencies from paying for telephone 
 installation and service in private residences with appropriated 
 funds . . . installing residential phone lines to connect to the new 
 [Federal Telecommunications System] FTS 2000 service [and] FTS 2000's 
 fiber optic network which will carry a varied mix of voice, data, and 
 video services on a single line . . . [and] purchasing a fax machine 
 for installation in a private residence."(21) A temporary provision 
 allowing agencies to use appropriated funds to pay for telephone 
 installation and service in private residences was included in the 
 fiscal year 1994 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.
<p>
 
 3. Expand the authority to establish and fund dependent care 
 programs. (3) 
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should submit proposed legislation 
 to Congress removing statutory limitations on dependent care programs 
 and giving agencies the authority to focus on the needs of their 
 employees and develop programs that will enhance organizational 
 effectiveness and improve employee productivity.(22)
<p>
 Agencies should work with employees to develop the most effective and 
 beneficial ways to meet the needs of a workforce struggling with the 
 responsibilities of child care, elder care, and caring for ill family 
 members. Agencies could decide to implement sliding fee payment 
 schedules for dependent care, contribute financial resources to 
 privately led consortia, allow reimbursement of dependent care 
 expenses incurred as a result of emergency assignments or emergency 
 travel, and/or permit employees to use official time to carry out 
 responsibilities associated with membership on a federally sponsored 
 center's board of directors.
<p>
 
 4. Allow employees to use sick leave to care for dependents.(23) (1) 
<p>
 The director of OPM should issue regulations by spring 1994 that will 
 allow employees to use accrued sick leave to care for sick or elderly 
 dependents. OPM should also propose legislation that will allow 
 employees to use accrued sick leave to make adoptive arrangements. 
 The definition of child, spouse, and parent should be consistent with 
 definitions contained in the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
 This policy indicates that the federal government recognizes the 
 burden family illness places on employees and was recommended in part 
 by the Merit Systems Protection Board in 1991.(24) The Bureau of 
 Labor Statistics found that in the private sector, 36 percent of 
 employees can use sick leave to care for a sick child.(25) OPM found 
 that in the public sector:
<p>
 Forty-six State governments, whose sick leave accrual policies 
 generally are more comparable to those of the federal government, 
 allow use of sick leave for [family illnesses]. The State of New 
 York, for example, implemented such a policy by regulation in 1957. 
 New York State allows employees to use up to 15 days of sick leave 
 each year in the event of family illness or death and reports that 
 this benefit has not generated administrative problems or pressure to 
 expand the circumstances under which sick leave may be used.(26)
<p>
 
 5. Give returning employees credit for previously accrued unused 
 federal sick leave. (1)
<p>
 The director of OPM will issue regulations by spring 1994 that would 
 recredit unused sick leave to employees who have been separated and 
 subsequently reemployed by the federal government, regardless of the 
 length of separation.
<p>
 Current regulations recredit sick leave only if employees return to 
 federal service within 3 years and do not take into account the 
 changing needs of employees and the change in demographics since 
 their implementation in 1962. Although only a relatively small number 
 of employees are affected by the 3-year limitation, OPM found that 
 "about 60 percent of all Federal employees who are reemployed after a 
 break in service of more than 3 years are women, and about 65 percent 
 are reemployed in grades GS-1 through 7."(27)
<p>
 
 6. Expand the demonstration project authority to allow projects on 
 employee benefits and leave.(28) (3)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the director of OPM should submit proposed legislation 
 to Congress removing the statutory limitations on employee benefits 
 and leave in the demonstration project authority.(29) Removal of 
 these limitations would authorize agencies to develop innovative 
 projects that meet the needs of their employees while addressing the 
 tax and revenue implications of flexible spending accounts, dependent 
 care assistance programs, and cafeteria benefit plans. Agencies could 
 also choose to combine sick leave and annual leave into a personal 
 leave system or provide short-term disability coverage.
<p>
 
 7. Reauthorize voluntary leave transfer/bank programs. (3)
<p>
 Congress should reauthorize the Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act 
 of 1988, which terminates October 31, 1993, with minor technical 
 changes. This legislation is currently before Congress with minor 
 technical changes to improve program operations, including a 
 provision to eliminate the restriction that prohibits interagency 
 transfers of annual leave between agencies covered by the leave 
 transfer and leave bank programs.(30)
<p>
 Voluntary leave transfer programs enable employees who experience a 
 personal or family medical emergency and who exhaust all their 
 available annual paid leave to receive donated annual leave from 
 their fellow federal employees. Employees in voluntary leave bank 
 programs make contributions of annual leave to their agency leave 
 bank and can receive annual leave from their agency leave bank if 
 they experience a personal or family medical emergency and have 
 exhausted all their available paid leave. James King, Director of 
 OPM, indicated that:
<p>
 Agencies like the leave sharing program largely because it enables 
 them to retain valuable employees throughout a personal or family 
 emergency. Agencies have reported that this benefit far outweighs any 
 hardship caused by employee absences. In many cases, employees who 
 were leave recipients under the leave sharing program were able to 
 work intermittently while participating in the program. Several 
 agencies have experienced a decline in the number of employee 
 requests for leave without pay and advanced leave as a result of 
 leave sharing.(31)
<p>
 During fiscal years 1991 and 1992, the program served more than 
 23,100 employees, and over 3,742,600 hours of annual leave were 
 donated/used.(32) "More than 96 percent of Federal employees with 
 dependent care needs are satisfied with the Federal leave sharing 
 program," OPM reported.(33)

<H2>Reinventing Human Resource Management</H2>
<P>
Hold Managers Accountable for Adherence to Principles of Merit and Equal Opportunity
<HR>
<p>
<H2> HRM08:Improve Processes and Procedures Established to Provide 
 Workplace Due Process for Employees</H2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
<p> 
 Workplace due process includes the various avenues of redress that 
 employees may pursue when they believe agency management has treated 
 them unfairly. For example, the equal employment opportunity (EEO) 
 complaint process is available to employees who believe an action is 
 discriminatory. An individual who has been suspended, reduced in 
 grade or pay, or removed may file an appeal. An employee may protest 
 other management actions by using an administrative or negotiated 
 grievance procedure. Unions (or management) may file unfair labor 
 practice charges or negotiability disputes.
<p>
 These various avenues of redress are governed by separate legal and 
 regulatory authorities. Due process is typically pursued first within 
 the employing agency and, failing resolution, may then be taken 
 before a third party for adjudication. Since enactment of the Civil 
 Service Reform Act in 1978, four agencies adjudicate disputes between 
 employees and agency management: the Merit Systems Protection Board 
 (MSPB), the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), the Equal Employment 
 Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Federal Labor Relations 
 Authority (FLRA). It is possible for a mixed case arising from the 
 same set of circumstances to be pending at the same time before two 
 or more of these agencies.
<p>
 Decisions by these agencies may be further appealed to the courts. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has 
 exclusive jurisdiction over most appeals from MSPB decisions. Equal 
 employment opportunity (EEO) and labor cases are handled by other 
 courts, usually based on geography. These courts may conflict with 
 one another in deciding similar cases, causing uncertainty in the law 
 as it applies to federal employees.(1)
<p>
 Internal agency processes and procedures that must be used prior to 
 access to the third parties vary by subject matter. They also tend to 
 be functionally stovepiped, with grievances handled by employee 
 relations specialists, EEO complaints handled by EEO specialists, and 
 unfair labor practice charges dealt with by labor relations 
 specialists.
<p>
 In addition to stovepiping, internal agency systems of redress tend 
 to be driven to inflexibility by adherence to process and procedural 
 correctness. Managers are advised of this necessity based on the fear 
 of being overturned in a third party forum due to harmful error. 
 Strict adherence to established administrative procedures governing 
 the large number of appeals and complaints filed by federal employees 
 every year has also contributed to high cost and lengthy delays 
 involved in exercising due process rights.
<p>
 Implementation of National Performance Review recommendations will 
 dramatically change the workplace, for managers in particular. 
 Increased flexibility and elimination of mandatory processes and 
 procedures will give managers greater freedom to exercise judgment. 
 For managers and employees alike, this represents high risk and an 
 unprecedented culture change. Managers must be held accountable for 
 their actions, and employees must have ways to take issue with 
 perceived unfair or discriminatory treatment. Sensitive, responsive, 
 and fast avenues of due process protect the rights of both managers 
 and employees and provide a powerful mechanism for ensuring that 
 managers are held accountable for their human resource management 
 decisions.
<p>
 Many federal agencies are turning to alternative dispute resolution 
 (ADR) methods as a way to improve their internal systems of redress, 
 with the clear objective of solving problems at the worksite and 
 reducing the number (and the associated costs) of cases appealed to 
 third parties. In 1990 Congress enacted two federal laws that endorse 
 the use of ADR in the way agencies resolve disputes.(2) According to 
 the authors of a recent article:
<p>
 Both the scope and the goals of the Administrative Dispute Resolution 
 Act are ambitious. In effect, the new law endorses the use of 
 facilitation, mediation, and other more formal procedures (such as 
 arbitration) as means to resolve the conflicts that inevitably arise 
 in the conduct of federal government business. The goal of the 
 legislation is to encourage agencies to use dispute resolution 
 techniques that can achieve more cost-effective and satisfying 
 results than traditional administrative procedures or litigation.(3)
<p>
 The Department of Health and Human Services has made noteworthy 
 progress with interest-based problem-solving approaches to ADR 
 developed in cooperation with the National Treasury Employees Union. 
 Their methods include a Negotiated Discrimination Complaint 
 Arbitration Process, the Early Complaints Resolution Process, and the 
 Departmental Appeals Board Mediation Service.
<p>
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 Critics of the current forums and mechanisms for due process have 
 recommended the establishment of a single adjudicatory body for 
 federal employee appeals, complaints, and labor disputes. The primary 
 reason cited for change is the issue of overlapping jurisdiction in 
 the processing of complicated mixed cases, which causes confusion and 
 frustration on the part of everyone involved.(4) An additional 
 complication is the jurisdiction of the federal courts with review 
 authority over federal EEO and labor matters. While the Court of 
 Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction of appeals 
 from MSPB, jurisdiction of the other courts in other areas is often 
 based upon geography. Thus, federal employees governed by common 
 nationwide policies and laws may "receive inequality of justice as a 
 result of nothing more than their residence in different parts of the 
 country."(5) Additionally, the lack of nationally uniform resolution 
 of issues in EEO and labor matters may contribute to legal confusion 
 about the governing laws from circuit to circuit, may increase the 
 cost of litigation, and may be wasteful and inefficient.(6)
<p>
 In addition to the procedural constraints, internal agency systems of 
 redress are often adversarial in nature and do not have the 
 confidence of managers or employees. They are costly and time 
 consuming. Workplace problems that are not resolved in a timely and 
 sensitive way impair productivity and morale and impede mission 
 accomplishment. Use of ADR methods during the informal or early 
 stages of due process can alleviate these problems, thereby improving 
 the workplace climate, reducing the number of formal cases pending 
 before third parties, and reducing the costs of litigation.
<p>
<p>
 <b>Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Eliminate jurisdictional overlaps. (2)
<p>
 By fall 1994, the President should issue a memorandum directing the 
 MSPB Chair to establish a working group to examine and make 
 recommendations for eliminating jurisdictional overlaps in 
 administrative due process cases. The memorandum should also direct 
 EEOC, FLRA, and OSC to provide staff to the working group, which will 
 draft any legislative proposals needed to eliminate mixed-case 
 processing and submit proposed administrative and legislative 
 proposals in a final report by spring 1995. By separate memorandum, 
 the President should direct the Attorney General to examine the 
 feasibility/desirability of creating a single court of appeals with 
 nationwide jurisdiction over all people issues, such as EEO, labor 
 relations, veterans affairs, civil service, et al. A single court 
 would ensure greater consistency of decisions, focus legal and 
 judicial expertise, and alleviate the workload problems in the 
 circuit courts caused by escalating criminal and other litigation. 
 The results of this examination should be presented to the President 
 by spring 1995.
<p>
<p>
 2. All agencies should establish alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
 methods and options for the informal disposition of employment 
 disputes. (1)
<p>
 By December 1994, each agency head should make available to all 
 worksites methods and options for resolving disputes that are 
 alternatives to established procedures governing EEO complaints, 
 labor disputes, grievances, and appeals. The director of the Office 
 of Personnel Management (OPM) should eliminate, by December 1994, all 
 regulations governing internal agency grievance and appeal 
 procedures, thus freeing agencies to tailor ADR techniques to various 
 situations. EEOC should continue to provide guidance and assistance 
 in application of ADR to the complaint process and should eliminate 
 regulations requiring specific processes to be used in the informal 
 stage, thus also freeing agencies to creatively apply ADR. OPM and 
 EEOC should jointly develop comprehensive training programs for 
 managers, employees, and dispute resolution specialists. Training 
 should cover ADR techniques and options and should be made available 
 to agencies, for example as train-the-trainer, to eliminate 
 duplication of effort among agencies.

<h2> HRM09:  Improve Accountability for Equal Employment 
 Opportunity Goals and Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 It is the policy of the U.S. Government to provide equal opportunity 
 in employment for all persons, to prohibit discrimination in 
 employment because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, 
 age, or handicap, and to promote the full realization of equal 
 employment opportunity through a continuing affirmative employment 
 program in each agency.(1)
<p>
 However, several factors in federal agencies indicate a lack of 
 adherence to this policy. Those factors include glass ceilings, 
 barriers to Americans with disabilities, the lack of management 
 accountability, and negative attitudes and perceptions.
<p>
 Glass Ceilings for Women and Minorities. 
 "Despite a dramatically growing presence in the workplace . . . 
 progression into the middle and senior levels of management has been 
 elusive for minorities and women. . . . There is a [glass] ceiling. . 
 . . The term glass ceiling refers to invisible, yet real or 
 perceived, barriers which appear to stymie advancement opportunities 
 for minorities and women."(2)
<p>
 Constance Berry Newman, former Director of the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM), said that ". . . the percentages of women and 
 minorities in the SES [senior executive service] and the pipeline to 
 the SES are unacceptable."(3) Most of the SES positions are held by 
 white men. Women hold only 12 percent of these positions, and 
 minorities hold only 9 percent.(4)
<p>
 A fundamental means of enabling qualified women and minorities to be 
 appropriately represented in the pipeline to the SES is to ensure 
 that they are appropriately present in agencies' key jobs--jobs that 
 can lead to middle and upper management positions.(5) There is a 
 great disparity in the promotion rates for women and minorities in 
 administrative and professional occupations at the grades 9 and 11 
 levels. This disparity has a significant impact on the number of 
 women and minorities in high-graded jobs, as grades 9 to 11 are the 
 gateways between entry-level jobs and senior-level jobs for most 
 federal government employees.(6)
<p>
 "At a September 1991 national conference . . . officials from [the 
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)], OPM, the Merit 
 Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority 
 said in public forums that shattering the glass ceiling in the 
 federal government will depend on (1) getting women and minorities 
 into the job tracks that lead to top management and (2) providing 
 them with the necessary training and development opportunities to 
 progress within those job tracks."(7) Doing this will require 
 leadership from the top and accountability for results.
<p>
 Americans with Disabilities. 
 Females and ethnic minorities are not alone in their 
 underrepresentation in the federal workforce. The largest 
 underemployed minority group in America is Americans with 
 disabilities.(8) Persons with disabilities are underrepresented at 
 all levels. Passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
 heightened the awareness of federal managers, supervisors, and 
 employees on the issues of employment, training, and advancing people 
 with disabilities.(9) However, in 1990 only 6 percent of federal 
 employees had disabilities and only 1 percent had severe 
 disabilities.(10)
<p>
 Federal agencies must, and have begun to, develop and implement 
 effective strategies to ensure that persons with disabilities are 
 given equitable employment opportunities in the federal government. 
 Under Project Able Beneficiaries Link to Employers, OPM, the Social 
 Security Administration, and state vocational rehabilitation offices 
 in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia are working in 
 partnership to create a new referral system that will place employees 
 in direct contact with qualified potential employees with 
 disabilities. In addition, OPM, in cooperation with the Department of 
 Veterans Affairs, announced in June 1993 the implementation of a 
 nationwide Job Ready Disabled Veterans Connection, which enables 
 federal agencies to have rapid access to referral lists of job ready 
 disabled veterans.
<p>
 The current initiatives are commendable, but the federal government 
 must continue to implement effective systems to increase the 
 representation of job ready Americans with disabilities. There is a 
 very real opportunity today for OPM to facilitate employment, 
 training, and advancement of people with disabilities through a major 
 campaign aimed at those managers and supervisors who make these key 
 decisions.(11)
<p>
 Lack of Management Accountability. 
 This administration has clearly demonstrated its commitment to equal 
 opportunity and valuing workforce diversity. However, the 
 longstanding lack of management accountability is a critical flaw in 
 and barrier to current efforts to accomplish equal opportunity in the 
 federal workforce. Currently, there is neither a consequence system 
 for agency heads and their managers who do not plan, develop, and 
 implement creative ways in which to accomplish equal opportunity 
 goals nor a reward system for those who do.(12)
<p>
 While it is important to deregulate, decentralize, and provide a 
 certain degree of management flexibility, increased flexibility in 
 the absence of appropriate accountability could undermine equal 
 opportunity and affirmative employment efforts. Numerous reports 
 issued by the General Accounting Office cite discrimination within 
 the government.(13) Accountability must be encouraged by the 
 President's reaffirmation of top-down commitment.
<p>
 Agencies must review, evaluate, and control managerial and 
 supervisory performance in such a manner as to ensure a continuing 
 affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of 
 equal opportunity, and provide orientation, training, and advice to 
 managers and supervisors to ensure their understanding and 
 implementation of the equal employment opportunity policies and 
 programs.(14)
<p>
 Equal opportunity and workforce diversity should be an integral part 
 of the mission of each and every federal agency. Constance Berry 
 Newman states that "real equal employment opportunity will come about 
 only when each and every executive, manager, supervisor, and employee 
 is committed to and held accountable for equal opportunity. . . . 
 Agency heads must hold their managers and supervisors responsible for 
 EEO [equal employment opportunity] by building it into their 
 performance agreements and standards."(15)
<p>
 Negative Attitudes and Perceptions. 
 Negative attitudes and perceptions are very powerful barriers to 
 equal employment opportunity and workforce diversity. According to 
 Linda Winikow, corporate policy expert, "On the one hand, civil 
 rights legislation has done an enormous amount to wipe out the legal 
 impediments to inequality. But all too many of the attitudes that 
 prevented the flowering of diversity still exist. Executives have an 
 obligation to recognize that this isn't simply a side issue. It is a 
 fundamental management issue. A manager's first job is to manage--to 
 bring people to their full potential. The glass ceiling does exist, 
 but senior management's job is to do everything possible to provide 
 the training and the climate for success."(16)
<p>
 EEOC recognizes that treating EEO functions as side issues fosters 
 perceptions of a conflict of interest. EEOC reiterated this concern 
 in an October 1992 management directive that states:
<p>
 In order for the agency to implement a continuing affirmative 
 employment program to promote equal employment opportunity and to 
 identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and policies, the 
 agency shall appoint a director of Equal Employment Opportunity, who 
 shall be under the immediate supervision of the agency head. Agencies 
 must avoid conflicts of position or conflicts of interest as well as 
 the appearance of such conflicts. . . . In order to maintain the 
 integrity of the EEO investigative and decision making processes, 
 those functions must be kept separate from the personnel 
 function.(17)
<p>
 In addition, the Code of Federal Regulations states that ". . . the 
 EEO director shall be under the immediate supervision of the agency 
 head . . ."(18) Yet, some federal agencies still treat EEO as a side 
 issue rather than as a fundamental management issue with identifiable 
 accountability.
<p>
 Experts who have spent many years actively advocating equal 
 opportunity in the federal workforce are also concerned about the 
 effect of negative attitudes and perceptions. Dr. Harriett Jenkins, 
 Director, Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, says, 
 "Employees must perceive that there are credible efforts to eradicate 
 discriminatory barriers and resolve complaints, [and] those efforts 
 must be real and visible. . . . Because personnel and EEO are 
 inextricably related, it is sometimes incorrectly assumed that EEO 
 should be a sub-part of personnel or human resource offices. This 
 reflects a lack of understanding of the managerial functions of the 
 director of EEO, whose authority flows directly from the head of the 
 agency."
<p>
 "The director serves as an advisor to the head of the agency and 
 other levels of managers. She or he is a catalyst and implementer of 
 sensitive organizational assessment, corrective management 
 strategies, and ongoing oversight and monitoring of the agency's EEO 
 progress. He or she has the responsibility of assisting the agency 
 head and other levels of managers to comply with civil rights laws, 
 remove barriers to full integration, eliminate subtle and overt 
 discrimination, adjudicate allegations of discrimination, 
 affirmatively reach out to all groups, and ensure that all personnel 
 management decisions are made on merit. . . . Whoever has 
 responsibility for EEO functions has to have the agency head's 
 imprimatur to help the line managers bring about constructive change 
 and full integration of the organization. It is the managers and 
 supervisors in every part of the agency who can determine the 
 successful achievement of the agency's EEO objectives."(19)
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 Agency heads and their managers must be held accountable to the 
 President, Congress, and the American public for creating, 
 developing, valuing, and maintaining a workforce that is reflective 
 of our nation's citizenry.(20)
<p>
 While improvements have occurred and the current administration has 
 set the stage for equal opportunity and diversity, the current 
 federal civilian workforce does not reflect the nation's diverse 
 working population. Overall, the federal government has not been 
 successful at eradicating discriminatory barriers, and attracting, 
 retaining, and advancing members of all segments of society at all 
 grade levels. It has been even less successful at integrating members 
 of underrepresented groups into middle and upper management. Much 
 work is still needed to ensure that equal opportunity becomes an 
 integral part of each federal agency's strategic business plan and 
 that management is held accountable for achieving results.
<p>
 Government is paying an enormous cost for the glass ceiling that 
 keeps qualified women, minorities, and disabled persons 
 underrepresented at all levels in the federal government. It is 
 underusing a major segment of its human resources and delaying 
 attainment of an important goal of the Civil Service Reform Act of 
 1978 and other civil rights laws--full representation of all segments 
 of society at all grade levels in government.
<p>
 As noted by the Council for Excellence in Government, "The federal 
 government needs a career executive leadership cadre reflecting the 
 diversity of America's population. . . . Today there is neither 
 sufficient leadership nor adequate diversity among career executives. 
 . . . The government can develop a diverse group of leaders, but it 
 must take dramatic action to mount an effective governmentwide 
 program and to hold management responsible for achieving 
 results."(21)
<p>
 It is imperative that federal agencies parallel the push for 
 diversity that this President has started with his political 
 appointments. The government should reaffirm its commitment to equal 
 employment opportunity. Whoever has the primary responsibility for 
 EEO functions must be a full, active member on the agency's senior 
 management team that has responsibility for the allocation of the 
 agency's resources. Federal agencies must focus on action and results 
 and must institute a real system of accountability.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Action</b>
 <p>
 Charge all federal agency heads with the responsibility for ensuring 
 equal opportunity and increasing integration of qualified women, 
 minorities, and persons with disabilities into all levels and job 
 categories, including middle and senior management positions. (2)
<p>
 The President should issue an Executive Order to all agency heads by 
 fall 1994 stating his commitment to attaining a diverse federal 
 workforce and increasing the representation of qualified minorities, 
 women, and disabled persons at all levels, including higher levels at 
 which they are most underrepresented. The Executive Order should also 
 establish the requirement that each agency head should:
<p>
 --- build EEO and affirmative employment elements into the agency's 
 strategic business plan and include effective measurements for impact 
 and change;
<p>
 --- require executives, managers, and supervisors to develop, 
 implement, monitor, and evaluate the organization's affirmative 
 employment plans;
<p>
 --- ensure that a critical element on EEO, affirmative employment, 
 and diversity is built into the performance plans and evaluations of 
 all managers and supervisors;
<p>
 --- ensure that the director of EEO reports directly to the agency 
 head and is a full participant on the senior management team(s) 
 responsible for all resource allocations;
<p>
 --- demonstrate a commitment to EEO and affirmative employment and 
 provide employees a visible sign of credible efforts through such 
 actions as annual policy statements on equal employment opportunity 
 and affirmative employment;
<p>
 --- identify qualified, as well as high-potential, women, minority, 
 and disabled candidates and implement developmental programs to 
 provide opportunities to effectively prepare them to compete for and 
 hold executive leadership positions; and 
<p>
 --- provide recognition of those managers and organizations that 
 consistently perform well in the EEO and affirmative employment 
 areas, and ensure appropriate disciplinary action in cases where 
 there is a finding of discrimination.
<p>
 Presidential leadership and an Executive Order that mandates 
 management accountability for equal employment opportunity goals and 
 accomplishments will reassure employees, applicants, and the American 
 public that there is governmentwide commitment to and accountability 
 for creating a federal workforce that reflects America's diverse 
 citizenry.

<H2>Reinventing Human Resource Management</H2>
<P>
<HR>
<p> 
<h2>HRM10:  Improve Interagency Collaboration and 
 Cross-Training of Human Resource Professionals</h2>
<p> 
 <b>Background</b>
 <p> 
 Total integration of equal employment opportunity (EEO) into every 
 aspect of human resource management policy and practice in the 
 selection, placement, training, and advancement of civilian employees 
 of the federal government is vital to creating and maintaining a 
 federal workforce that is truly reflective of our nation's diverse 
 citizenry. In order to accomplish this integration, there must be 
 effective collaboration among federal supervisors, managers, 
 personnel professionals, civil rights professionals, and equal 
 opportunity professionals.
<p>
 EEO and Affirmative Employment Reporting. 
 "Strong EEO and Affirmative Action plans play vital roles in the 
 management of diversity. They are stepping stones to valuing 
 diversity wherein differences are identified and an atmosphere is 
 created that promotes respect for these differences as well as ways 
 to benefit from them."(1) However, current EEO and affirmative 
 employment (AE) reporting requirements are fragmented. While agencies 
 must submit data to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Central 
 Personnel Data File (CPDF), similar data must be submitted to the 
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
<p>
 The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created the Federal Equal 
 Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP), which requires agencies to 
 conduct affirmative recruitment for those occupations and grades in 
 which women and minorities are underrepresented. The act assigned to 
 OPM the responsibility for assisting agencies in their affirmative 
 recruitment efforts and for overseeing FEORP.(2)
<p>
 Executive Order 12067 (June 30, 1978) assigned to EEOC responsibility 
 for providing coherence and direction to the government's EEO 
 efforts. It also provided for standardized data collection 
 procedures.
<p>
 EEOC requires federal agencies to submit multi-year AE plans and 
 annual accomplishment reports to evaluate the representation of 
 minorities, females, and disabled persons in the federal workforce. 
 In addition, OPM requires agencies to submit FEORP plans and reports, 
 as well as disabled veterans affirmative action program plans and 
 reports. There needs to be one comprehensive assessment of agency 
 EEO/AE goals, objectives, and accomplishments.
<p>
 Agencies must integrate EEO/AE into their overall strategic business 
 plans, which are developed, evaluated, and monitored by management. 
 Agencies must build their plans around barrier analysis, develop 
 goals, implement strategies to achieve these goals in a specified 
 time frame, and hold managers and supervisors accountable for 
 results.
<p>
 Cross-Training. 
 Cross-training is the first step to creating a competent federal 
 human resource management team. Personnel professionals must 
 understand and adhere to basic EEO and civil rights guidelines in 
 order to ensure that personnel functions and actions are fair and 
 equitable for all employees and applicants. Likewise, EEO and civil 
 rights professionals must understand and adhere to the basic 
 personnel guidelines.
<p>
 The roles and responsibilities of EEOC and OPM present an opportunity 
 for them to work together to provide leadership and training 
 necessary to integrate EEO into every aspect of human resource 
 management policy and practice. These two agencies must make a 
 concentrated effort to ensure ongoing communications and 
 understanding of EEO and AE efforts to achieve a diverse, competent, 
 and productive federal work force. They must provide joint leadership 
 to EEO, civil rights, and personnel professionals to create, develop, 
 review, and improve effective ongoing governmentwide efforts.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 It is imperative that EEOC and OPM collaborate to jointly provide the 
 necessary leadership and cross-training to ensure an effective 
 approach to and outcome of federal human resource management efforts. 
 These efforts must include effective EEO and AE initiatives.
<p>
 EEO/AE plans and accomplishment reports foster agency commitment to 
 and awareness of EEO/AE efforts within organizations and guide the 
 way to increased employment opportunities for qualified women, 
 minorities, and disabled persons.
<p>
 However, there needs to be one comprehensive, automated EEO/AE report 
 for federal agencies. An inordinate amount of resources are devoted 
 to preparing duplicative reports. More importantly, treating the four 
 groups (women, minorities, disabled persons, and disabled veterans) 
 separately is contradictory to the vital mission of accomplishing 
 overall workforce diversity and streamlining government functions.
<p>
 Although each agency must be personally responsible for internal 
 EEO/AE goals and accomplishments, EEOC must continue to fulfill its 
 responsibility under Executive Order 12067--to provide coherence and 
 direction to the government's EEO efforts. EEOC must seek out, 
 identify, recognize, and reward best EEO and AE practices in federal 
 agencies. EEOC must perpetuate those best practices throughout the 
 federal government.
<p>
 In addition, OPM must ensure that the CPDF can generate necessary 
 data and that the capabilities of the CPDF are fully used. For 
 example, the collection of minority college and university 
 information in the CPDF is essential for conducting affirmative 
 employment analysis.(3)
<p>
 <p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Establish an Interagency Equal Employment Opportunity and 
 Affirmative Employment Steering Group under the joint chair of EEOC 
 and OPM. (2)
<p>
 The President, by memorandum, should direct the Chair of EEOC and the 
 director of OPM to establish an Interagency Equal Employment 
 Opportunity and Affirmative Employment Steering Group. The purpose of 
 the group should be to:
<p>
 --- provide to human resource professionals governmentwide equal 
 opportunity and affirmative employment leadership, communication, and 
 coordination in workforce diversity planning;
<p>
 --- identify and perpetuate best EEO/AE practices throughout the 
 federal government; and
<p>
 --- aid, among equal opportunity, civil rights, and personnel 
 professionals, communication that focuses on EEO/AE concerns and 
 issues and shares successful initiatives.
<p>
 This steering group will comprise directors of equal employment 
 opportunity, personnel, and civil rights from a cross- section of 
 federal agencies, including small agencies. The committee will 
 convene monthly for the first 6 months. After that, the EEOC chair 
 and OPM director will establish the appropriate schedule for 
 meetings, conferences, and seminars.
<p>
 
 2. Require appropriate cross-training for human resource management 
 professionals. (1)
<p>
 The first and most important purpose of the EEO/AE Steering Group 
 should be to advocate effective cross-training and rotational 
 assignments for EEO, civil rights, and personnel professionals. 
 Agency heads should be required to ensure that federal EEO and civil 
 rights professionals receive cross-training and rotational 
 assignments in federal personnel management before being promoted to 
 supervisory and management positions. They should also ensure that 
 personnel professionals receive cross-training and rotational 
 assignments in federal EEO and civil rights before they are promoted 
 to supervisory and management positions. EEOC and OPM should jointly 
 identify the appropriate core training, as well as the time frame in 
 which the training should be obtained, to foster human resource 
 management competence throughout federal agencies.
<p>
 Collaboration between EEO, civil rights, and personnel professionals 
 will assist agencies in understanding, evaluating, and preventing 
 practices that give rise to EEO complaints.
<p>
 
 3. Combine all equal opportunity and affirmative employment reports 
 into one comprehensive assessment of the total workforce EEO/AE data. 
 (2)
<p>
 By memorandum, the President should direct the Chair of EEOC, in 
 coordination with the director of OPM, to blend the reporting 
 requirements for agencies to compile one comprehensive assessment of 
 their equal employment opportunity and affirmative employment 
 efforts, including specific actions needed to eradicate barriers and 
 increase representation of minorities, women, and disabled persons at 
 all levels, including middle and upper management levels. EEOC and 
 OPM should conduct a thorough examination of all current EEO/AE 
 reporting requirements to ensure the appropriateness and 
 effectiveness of the new comprehensive agency assessment report. 
 These changes should be effective with the fiscal year 1995 
 submission requirements.
<p>
 
 4. Modify the Central Personnel Data File to enable total automation 
 of the EEO/AE data reporting requirements. (2)
<p>
 By memorandum, the President should direct the director of OPM, in 
 coordination with the Chair of EEOC and a working group of agency 
 officials, to ensure that the necessary data resources, including any 
 appropriate changes to the CPDF, are used to generate all data needed 
 to meet EEO/AE reporting requirements. All current EEO/AE data 
 reporting requirements should be examined for necessity and value. 
 This examination of requirements and subsequent redesign of the CPDF 
 should begin immediately and should be completed during fiscal year 
 1995.
<p>
 Implementation of these actions will decrease duplicated efforts and 
 redundancy within and across federal agencies. It will reduce, 
 simplify, and automate the reporting requirements, while maintaining 
 the requirement for agencies to submit the necessary information. 
 There will be a substantial reduction in the administrative costs of 
 EEO and AE programs. This will be tremendously beneficial to the 
 overall federal EEO/AE efforts since agencies will be able to spend 
 more time and effort focusing on results rather than on paper 
 processes. 
<p>
 In addition, implementation of these actions will foster coordinated, 
 governmentwide commitment to creating, implementing, and 
 accomplishing equal opportunity and affirmative employment goals to 
 create a federal workforce that is reflective of the American 
 citizenry.
<p>
 Implementation of these actions will require ongoing commitment and 
 coordination between EEOC and OPM. This partnership is critical to 
 the accomplishment of a competent, productive, and diverse federal 
 workforce.(4)

<HR>
<p>
<H2> HRM11:  Strengthen the Senior Executive Service So That It 
 Becomes a Key Element in the Governmentwide Culture Change Effort</H2> 
 <p>
<b> Background</b>
 <p> 
 The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 established the Senior Executive 
 Service (SES) as a separate personnel system. Incumbents of the SES 
 include most of the top policy and managerial positions in the 
 executive branch except for those requiring Senate confirmation. SES 
 executives potentially serve as key links between the top political 
 appointees and the rest of the career civil servants that staff 
 federal agencies.
<p>
 By September 1992, about 8,800 SES positions had been allocated by 
 the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and 8,200 positions had 
 been filled. About 700 of these were filled by political appointees. 
 The political appointees provide the necessary policy controls, while 
 the career SES managers provide a politically neutral, responsive, 
 skilled group of managers and leaders. As originally envisioned, SES 
 members serve the twin objectives of change and continuity: on the one 
 hand, helping the top officials of a new administration to steer 
 their agencies in the directions set by the newly elected President; 
 on the other, carrying forward the institutional memory of Government 
 and maintaining high standards of public service. It is a balancing 
 act of great delicacy.(1)
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 OPM's role. 
 The original vision of the SES, as outlined above, is still valid. 
 Missing, at this juncture of its history, is an institution and 
 process to give its members a focus and mission that takes them 
 beyond their individual job and organization performance concerns. 
 OPM's role has been more administrative and technical; as a result, 
 the SES has not evolved to the extent originally envisioned. If the 
 SES is to evolve, OPM's role must become more facilitative and 
 consultative, working in concert with the agencies. 
<p>
 Change involves a long-term commitment. The SES can provide the 
 continuity and long-term tenacity required for significant change 
 governmentwide. This change will involve the federal government 
 culture. Managers at all levels will have to view their roles 
 differently than many do now. A recent Brookings Institution report 
 called for "[a] performance-driven federal government . . . staffed 
 by managers and administrators imbued with a new entrepreneurial 
 spirit. . . . What matters is the ability of the leaders to inspire, 
 to infuse value. . . . Such leaders are in short supply."(2)
<p>
 The Complex Mix of SES Positions and Roles. 
 It was intended that the SES consist of generalist managers with the 
 ability and incentives to take on assignments where they would be 
 most effective in accomplishing agency missions. For many reasons, 
 however, this objective has not been met.
<p>
 There is a small group of senior executives who occupy key leadership 
 positions linking the President's top appointed officials with those 
 charged with carrying out public policy. These key executives can be 
 career or non-career. They will play a pivotal role in the success of 
 government programs and policies and in reinventing the executive 
 branch.
<p>
 The majority of senior executives, however, now serve in the SES 
 because of their technical expertise, often as key advisors and 
 managers of support staffs or as operational managers responsible for 
 parts of line (legislative) programs, rather than as agency-level 
 leaders and program executives. While all are important positions, 
 this mixture of roles makes it difficult to develop and manage the 
 SES as a resource for agency management as originally intended.
<p>
 Tensions Between Career Senior Executives and Political Appointees. 
 Both the Merit Systems Protection Board and the General Accounting 
 Office have pointed to the poor relationships that often exist 
 between career SES members and political appointees.(3) These 
 relationships often emerge as significant management problems. A 
 certain amount of tension is natural; however, there are a number of 
 aggravating circumstances that should be alleviated.
<p>
 Over the years there has been an increase in the number of non-career 
 SES appointees. This in turn has meant fewer career executives in key 
 leadership positions and fewer career jobs that are meaningful.(4) In 
 addition, the short tenure of political appointees means that they 
 provide less program stability and continuity because of the 
 abbreviated time frames in which they operate. Change in large 
 organizations takes time, is usually incremental, and needs tenacious 
 and persistent leadership over a period of years.
<p>
 Agency Weaknesses in Managing the SES. 
 Compounding this problem has been agency behavior in selecting, 
 developing, using, and rewarding executives. Whereas some agencies 
 have done a good job in creating an effective executive cadre, others 
 have not treated their senior executives as a key resource or 
 integrated the selection and development of their executives with 
 their vision of a more effective agency. Because OPM can continually 
 allocate additional SES positions, agencies have less incentive to 
 rethink their current use of SES positions. In many cases, the focus 
 needs to be changed from creating more SES positions to better use of 
 current positions.
<p>
 The need to more effectively select and develop agency SES cadres is 
 compounded by the expected exodus of SES members in the coming years. 
 A National Academy of Public Administration study estimates that over 
 "one third of the SES--or 2,600 executives--will be eligible to 
 retire" by January 1994.(5) Most will also have completed three years 
 at their highest salary rate, thus creating another incentive to 
 retire. This not only provides opportunities to select executives who 
 can contribute quickly to agency change efforts, but allows agencies 
 to improve the diversity of their SES membership. To achieve this, 
 agency leadership must focus on these needs and incorporate solutions 
 into their strategic planning efforts.
<p>
 The SES as a Culture Change Force. 
 For the most part, the executive branch projects an image of a 
 hierarchical, highly conservative, and risk-averse culture. Trust 
 levels are low at all levels of government and in most organizations. 
 Most employees including executives are uncomfortable with this 
 situation and are ready to work toward solutions.
<p>
 Vice President Gore has offered one alternative. He expects that the 
 National Performance Review will result in and require significant 
 culture change in the executive branch. The real drivers of change 
 will have to be the career and non-career executives. In other words, 
 significant culture change must rely on leadership.
<p>
 The reinventing government effort intends to decentralize authority 
 and accountability to a greater extent. Management will have fewer 
 rules, will be held accountable for results, and will be responsible 
 for significant changes in the years to come. Because culture change 
 on a scale as envisioned by the President, Vice President, and 
 Cabinet is a long-term endeavor, institutions and processes must be 
 developed to support this change. The SES should be managed as a 
 strategic resource to bring about change governmentwide and at the 
 agency level. If institutional leadership means cultivating a shared 
 view of a new direction and culture, then OPM and its director must 
 create new vehicles that help build such a shared view and remove the 
 perception of OPM as a controller and regulator.
<p>
 The following actions have been developed to support these culture 
 changes. Agency leadership must bear a large measure of 
 responsibility for culture change and the creation of very different 
 management values and behaviors. These changes cannot be made 
 immediately; rather, they will take time to allow for adequate 
 research, experimentation, learning, and consultation with an array 
 of stakeholders. The actions provide for such a beginning.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p>
 1. Create and reinforce a corporate perspective within the Senior 
 Executive Service that supports governmentwide culture change. (1)
<p>
 To change the culture of the executive branch, a corporate approach 
 to managing executive resources will be needed. Although agencies 
 have primary responsibility for engendering change within their own 
 organizations, the director of OPM is an important link between the 
 government as a whole and individual agencies. As a leader for change 
 and a consultant to agency management, OPM should foster a corps of 
 executives with a corporate vision, committed to fundamental change 
 over the long term and, at the same time, reflective of the civil 
 service values of merit and diversity.
<p>
 OPM can work toward this goal in the following ways:
<p>
 --- Ensuring that the corporate vision for change is adequately 
 reflected in OPM's governmentwide management development curricula 
 (e.g., the Federal Executive Institute and the Management Development 
 Centers); OPM will ensure that management development emphasizes the 
 vision of government in the 21st century, the ways executives will 
 foster that change effort, and concepts for a more effective 
 executive SES corps.
<p>
 --- Recommending governmentwide SES policies and management 
 development strategies in support of government culture change 
 efforts.
<p>
 --- Overseeing an executive information system that both supports the 
 executive search process and provides status reports on the SES in 
 support of policy decisions, agency succession planning, and 
 development efforts.
<p>
 
 2. Promote an agency corporate executive level succession planning 
 model. (1)
<p>
 OPM, in consultation and coordination with agencies, should promote a 
 corporate succession planning model for agencies to use in 
 identifying, selecting, and developing their senior executive 
 staffing resources. These efforts should be linked to each agency's 
 strategic plans and budget, support their unique and specific needs, 
 and incorporate such objectives as broadening the agency's skill mix 
 and improving the diversity of the agency's SES membership.
<p>
 
 3. Enhance voluntary mobility within and between agencies for top 
 senior executive positions in government. (1)
<p>
 Data show that, prior to entering the SES, incumbents have held a 
 variety of positions and moved functionally and geographically; yet, 
 once in the SES, their career paths have been relatively insular, 
 indicating that the SES corps has been underused.(6) In other words, 
 many senior executives stay in the same functional area or agency and 
 are not encouraged to make use of their abilities to serve in a wider 
 range of jobs or different agencies. The National Academy of Public 
 Administration has called for enhanced and broadened mobility 
 strategies geared not only to agency requirements, but to the 
 corporate objectives of the government as a whole.(7)
<p>
 OPM will act as a catalyst to encourage mobility of executives both 
 within and between agencies. The purpose would be two-fold: first, to 
 assist agencies in identifying executives who have demonstrated, 
 through actual performance, the ability to bring about changes or 
 manage in different circumstances and who can apply the values 
 inherent in reinvented government principles while dealing with 
 system realities; and second, to provide executives an opportunity to 
 broaden their skills and perspectives and to be placed in positions 
 where they can make their greatest contribution to a reinvented 
 government.
<p>
 This proposal is intended to establish an SES cadre that not only 
 takes a governmentwide view of its role, but is a vehicle to help 
 individuals move to positions where their special expertise is 
 needed. By no means does the proposal intend to make every senior 
 executive mobile and a generalist, since there are many executives 
 whose expertise, experience, and interests are tied to a particular 
 agency, occupation, or position. In fact, most executives have been 
 chosen for their technical program expertise and need to remain where 
 they are most effective. This is normally an agency issue and needs 
 to be left in the hands of agency management with suitable safeguards 
 in place.

<H2> HRM12:  Eliminate Excessive Red Tape and 
 Automate Functions and Information</H2>
<p>
<b> Background</b>
<p> 
 The federal personnel system is clogged with unnecessary process 
 constraints and thousands of pages of regulations. In 1983, the 
 National Academy of Public Administration concluded:
<p>
 The present personnel management system is far too process oriented. 
 It is much too rigid and needs major change. . . . Thousands of pages 
 of personnel regulations tend to remold personnel managers into 
 personnel technicians. Because of the complexity of these 
 regulations, line managers tend to abdicate their responsibilities 
 for personnel decisions and fail to give personnel management the 
 high priority it deserves. Process drives out substance.(1)
<p>
 Ten years later, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) has expanded to 
 over 10,000 pages of policies, regulations, guidance, and processing 
 instructions. Additional agency directives parallel and often 
 supplement the FPM. While agency directives and the FPM contain 
 information needed by line managers, they are primarily written for 
 the personnel administrators upon whom managers must depend for 
 interpretation. Additionally, until recently, OPM has not led any 
 efforts to use technology to reduce the number of manually prepared 
 required reports or to enhance agency accountability systems.
<p>
 The past 10 years have also seen a technology explosion. Every agency 
 has a data system that supports internal operations and feeds into 
 the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) of the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM). However, agency systems are outdated and are not 
 interoperable; while complex processes contained in the FPM or agency 
 regulations have been automated, automation has focused primarily on 
 internal personnel office operations almost to the exclusion of 
 managers' needs.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
<p>
 Managers and human resource administrators must be freed from 
 unnecessary process constraints in order to focus on mission instead 
 of efforts to overcome obstacles to its achievement. As process 
 constraints are eliminated, use of technology needs to expand to 
 eliminate manually prepared reports, provide access to information, 
 support management decisionmaking, and monitor organizational 
 performance.
<p>
<p>
<b> Actions</b>
 <p> 1. Phase out the entire Federal Personnel Manual and all agency 
 implementing directives. (2)
<p>
 The President should issue an Executive Order that declares that the 
 FPM will be substantially revised, reduced, or otherwise eliminated 
 by December 1994, and that
<p>
 --- directs OPM to involve agencies in identifying those portions of 
 the FPM that are essential, should be retained and for whom, are 
 useful and to whom, and are unnecessary;
<p>
 --- restricts agency supplementation of law and regulation; and
<p>
 --- requires maximum delegation of personnel management authorities 
 to the lowest practical organizational level within agencies and to 
 line managers or self-managed work teams operating in flattened 
 organizational structures.
<p>
 The positive implications of this action are the short-term 
 elimination of unnecessary red tape and the potential for 
 streamlining and simplifying all aspects of the personnel system. On 
 the other hand, additional time may be needed to implement it fully, 
 especially in light of other National Performance Review (NPR) 
 recommendations. However, the objective can be met if pursued as a 
 priority and if agencies are involved in the governmentwide effort. 
 Additionally, the process itself will ensure that all NPR personnel 
 recommendations are addressed.
<p>
 
 2. Replace the Federal Personnel Manual and agency directives with 
 automated personnel processes, electronic decision support systems, 
 and manuals tailored to user needs. (1)
<p>
 The director of OPM should accelerate and expand efforts already 
 under way to streamline and automate personnel processes in 
 coordination with the FPM review process and to avoid redundant 
 develop-ment costs. Governmentwide deployment of the Department of 
 Defense/Navy automated personnel action processing system application 
 should be examined for potential cost savings. Costs for centrally 
 developed systems or applications should be shared on a pro rata 
 basis among all participating agencies with OPM providing seed money.
<p>
 
 3. Identify and develop useful accountability measures that can be 
 automated. (1)
<p>
 The director of OPM, with the assistance of agency managers and staff 
 experts (personnel, planning, information management, and budget), 
 should develop, by December 1994, automated methods or accountability 
 measures for use by agency heads to monitor exercise of delegated 
 personnel management authorities. A variety of data sources could be 
 tapped, including OPM's CPDF, the Survey of Federal Employees, and 
 any reports that may continue to be necessary. Indicators that could 
 be used to measure accountability include cash award trends to note 
 unusual patterns, or conversions from excepted to career appointments 
 to identify potential violations of merit principles. Such management 
 information systems can be powerful tools for use in ensuring that 
 managers are properly exercising the increased delegations envisioned 
 by NPR. They also should be an element of the reinvented oversight 
 program called for in the NPR accompanying report on the Office of 
 Personnel Management.

 <p>
<b> Background</b>
<p> 
 The federal service labor-management relations statute, Title VII of 
 the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978, provided the authority 
 for employees to unionize, bargain collectively, and participate with 
 agency management in making decisions that affect their working 
 conditions. Prior to enactment of the statute, the federal labor 
 management relations program was authorized by a series of Executive 
 Orders. The statute was a blend of policies and approaches from 
 Executive Order and the law governing labor-management relations in 
 the private sector, the National Labor Relations Act.
<p>
 Title VII of CSRA recognizes that "labor organizations and collective 
 bargaining in the public service are in the public interest"; 
 establishes the Federal Labor Relations Authority to administer the 
 program, issue policy decisions, and adjudicate labor-management 
 disputes; prohibits strikes and lockouts; prohibits agency shop or 
 fair share representational fees; and prohibits bargaining on issues 
 that are the focus of most private sector bargaining such as wages, 
 fringe benefits, and issues related to hiring, firing, promoting and 
 retaining employees.
<p>
 The General Accounting Office (GAO) summarizes the differences 
 between the federal labor-management relations program and the labor-
 management relations program in the nonfederal sector as follows:
<p>
 Bread and butter issues, such as wages, fringe benefits, and any of 
 many other issues relating to hiring, firing, promoting, and 
 retaining employees, which are the focus of private sector 
 bargaining, generally cannot be negotiated in federal contracts. . . 
 . [F]ederal sector bargaining has been generally limited to the way 
 personnel policies, practices, and procedures are implemented. 
 Traditional bargaining incentives, i.e., strikes and lockouts, are 
 prohibited. Agency shop or fair share representation fees, are 
 prohibited. Under the federal program, employees are entitled to 
 select a union to represent them, but they cannot be compelled to 
 join or pay a fee for the representation that the union is required 
 to provide.(1)
<p>
 Currently, about 60 percent of the federal workforce--1.3 million 
 employees--are represented by federal unions; 80 percent of the 
 employees who are eligible for union participation are represented by 
 an employee union. They are represented by approximately 125 labor 
 organizations in approximately 2,200 bargaining units. The three 
 largest federal employee unions are the American Federation of 
 Government Employees, which represents more than 600,000 employees; 
 the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which represents more 
 than 150,000 employees; and the National Federation of Federal 
 Employees, which represents approximately 150,000 employees.(2)
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 The federal workforce is changing. While the number of employees has 
 remained constant for the past 10 years, the workforce has changed in 
 a variety of other ways: it is much more diverse, with more 
 minorities and women; it is better educated; it is more mobile; and 
 more employees work in professional, scientific, and highly technical 
 jobs than ever before.
<p>
 Consistent with national trends, federal employees want to 
 participate in decisions that affect their work. Employee involvement 
 is accomplished through a variety of means including employee unions, 
 quality circles, quality of work life initiatives, self-managed work 
 teams, and perhaps most significantly in recent years, Total Quality 
 Management (TQM). The rapid expansion of TQM in the federal 
 government has dramatically increased the opportunities for employee 
 involvement. GAO reported that 68 percent of federal installations 
 are working on various phases of TQM, with involvement of about 13 
 percent of their employees.(3) TQM experts point out that union-
 management cooperation is a prerequisite for a successful TQM 
 program. GAO reported that 59 percent of the installations surveyed 
 reported that employee unions were involved in TQM implementation. 
 The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) cites as an 
 example of labor-management cooperation the Internal Revenue Service 
 (IRS)-NTEU Joint Quality Improvement Process, which was started in 
 1987, and which has spread throughout IRS, resulting in cost savings 
 as well as improved labor-management relations. NAPA recommends that 
 this success be replicated.(4)
<p>
 In a report issued in 1991, GAO concluded that piecemeal technical 
 revisions to the federal labor-management relations program would not 
 be appropriate and comprehensive reform was needed. The report noted 
 that "the federal labor-management relations program is not working 
 well . . . (1) the program is too adversarial and often bogged down 
 by litigation over procedural matters and minutiae; (2) some dispute 
 resolution mechanisms are too lengthy, slow, and complex; and (3) 
 ineffective FLRA management has weakened the program."(5) These 
 conclusions have been widely supported, for example, by NAPA in its 
 1993 report on federal human resource management.
<p>
 
 The following example of traditional bargaining illustrates the 
 current state of affairs:
<p>
 . . . traditional negotiation techniques were used to address all 
 term and mid-term collective bargaining matters. Union and management 
 developed positions on issues, submitted inflated proposals to each 
 other, argued vigorously, and concealed the degree of importance they 
 attached to each proposal in order to demand a significant concession 
 by the other party to drop any proposal, however inflated or 
 unimportant. The eventual outcome or agreement was determined through 
 a series of power plays using a number of different tactics. For 
 example, sometimes the union or management walked out of the 
 negotiations. Discussions focused on personalities and anecdotal data 
 rather than the issues. On occasion, the union picketed to draw 
 attention to its concerns. Information was withheld by both parties. 
 Sometimes management ended the dialogue by merely declaring issues to 
 be nonnegotiable. The net result of these tactics was a labor-
 management relationship built on acrimony, distrust, confrontation, 
 and litigation. Few efforts were made to resolve problems informally. 
 Once negotiations were concluded, problems arising during the 
 administration of negotiated agreements were usually addressed 
 through grievance procedures or unfair labor practice charges.(6)
<p>
 In developing its report, GAO solicited the views of union officials, 
 management officials, and neutral experts at the national level, as 
 well as union officials and managers at the local level. To summarize 
 the views of these participants in the federal labor-management 
 relations program: 
<p>
 --- Federal collective bargaining has not accomplished the objectives 
 of the statute. Bargaining processes are too legalistic and 
 adversarial and too often lead to litigation over procedural matters 
 and minor disputes.
<p>
 --- Some dispute resolution processes are too slow, lengthy, and 
 complex. 
<p>
 --- Over two-thirds of the national level officials and experts 
 supported an agency shop approach whereby employees would be required 
 to pay fees to the unions that represent them even if they do not 
 belong to the union. Local-level union officials strongly supported 
 agency shop, while two-thirds of local-level managers surveyed did 
 not.
<p>
 --- The greatest divergence of opinion was over the scope of 
 bargaining--the extent to which working conditions could be 
 negotiated by union and management. Over half of the agency officials 
 opposed any change, while all union officials and 80 percent of 
 neutrals supported increased bargaining rights. At the local level, 
 96 percent of union officials wanted a broader scope of bargaining, 
 as did 21 percent of managers.
<p>
 --- Most union officials, national and local, and neutral experts 
 agreed that labor-management relations is a low priority for federal 
 agencies; management officials disagreed.
<p>
 --- Agency officials and neutral experts believe that unions file too 
 many unfair labor practice charges over minor issues, while union 
 officials claim that the problem is FLRA's failure to take actions to 
 deter violations by agency officials.
<p>
 --- Everyone agreed that more attention must be given to cooperative 
 labor-management relations.
<p>
 FLRA, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), and a 
 few individual agencies have been encouraging and facilitating labor-
 management cooperation and partnerships in federal labor relations. 
 However, their efforts have been hampered by a statutory framework 
 that focuses on the traditional adversarial model.
<p>
 Given bargaining processes that are too legalistic and adversarial, 
 and dispute resolution processes that are slow, lengthy, and complex, 
 virtually all participants consider the federal labor relations 
 programs to be very costly and ineffective. A comment by one of the 
 experts interviewed by GAO succinctly illustrates the prevailing 
 view: "We have never had so many people and agencies spend so much 
 time, blood, sweat, and tears on so little. In other words, I am 
 saying I think it is an awful waste of time and money on very little 
 results."(7)
<p>
 While there is agreement that the program is not cost-effective, it 
 is difficult to determine the exact cost. Several agencies that were 
 asked for information about the cost of their labor-management 
 relations program responded that cost data were not available and 
 that lengthy, costly studies would be required to determine them. In 
 1982, GAO conducted its only study of federal-labor management 
 relations costs, estimating the cost to the government of processing 
 the 6,448 unfair labor practices (ULPs) filed in that year to be 
 $25.9 million.(8) The cost of processing the 8,851 ULPs filed in 1992 
 must be significantly greater than $25.9 million. 
<p>
 GAO cited the need for a new labor-management relations framework 
 that "motivates labor and management to form productive relationships 
 to improve the public service; makes collective bargaining 
 meaningful; improves the dispute resolution processes; and is 
 compatible with innovative human resource management practices that 
 emphasize employee involvement, team building, and labor-management 
 cooperation."(9)
<p>
 NAPA supported the GAO recommendation for comprehensive reform, 
 concluding, "The labor-management relationship is critical for the 
 employee involvement so vital to organizational change. Without the 
 improved participation and communication that comes with greater 
 employee involvement, efforts at empowerment and commitment will 
 flounder. Adversarial bargaining on win-lose issues will coexist with 
 cooperative win-win bargaining. But cooperation will create more 
 forums for joint problem solving and planning that improve results 
 for both labor and management, and ultimately the employee and the 
 organization."(10)
<p>
 The changes envisioned by the National Performance Review (NPR) will 
 result in a government composed of high-performing organizations that 
 are mission-driven and results-oriented with a clear focus on meeting 
 the needs of customers. Hierarchy will give way to participation and 
 teamwork. Employees will be highly skilled and motivated, empowered 
 to make changes and continuously improve the quality of services 
 provided. The transformation from the current to the desired state of 
 government can only be achieved by transforming the labor-management 
 relationship from an adversarial relationship to a partnership for 
 reinvention and change.
<p>
 One of the first steps in reform of any system is development of a 
 vision of the future that key stakeholders are committed to achieve. 
 A vision for federal labor-management relations describes the desired 
 federal government workplace of the future and, within that 
 workplace, the labor-management relations program that is one of its 
 essential elements. A group of union officials, managers, and neutral 
 labor-management experts met with NPR staff to develop the following 
 vision of labor-management relations in the year 2000.(11)
<p>
 
 Vision of Cooperative Labor Management Relations in the Federal 
 Government
<p>
 In the future, the federal workforce should be valued as a full 
 partner in decisionmaking. There should be equal access to 
 information among management, employees, and unions. As a result, 
 employees will be involved in decisions that affect them. Where 
 employees are represented by an employee union, labor and management 
 should be partners in carrying out the mission of the organization. 
 Both labor and management should value diversity. There should be a 
 shared sense of mission and values throughout the organization that 
 is understood by everyone.
<p>
 Federal organizations should be model employers providing the private 
 sector with exemplary models of high-performing organizations. They 
 should place authority and decisionmaking at the lowest appropriate 
 level of the organization--the work unit. Issues should be resolved 
 through a single, collaborative process that is not destructive to 
 the partnership. Given the effectiveness of federal organizations, 
 public service should be viewed as a desirable career by both current 
 and potential employees.
<p>
 There should be a partnership between union and management that 
 enables government organizations to become high-performing 
 organizations. This, in turn, should result in high-value, high-
 quality, effective government. The purpose of the partnership should 
 be to provide an open forum for the discussion and resolution of 
 problems, both procedural and substantive, dealing with conditions of 
 employment that significantly affect the operation of the 
 organization. Problem resolution should be accomplished through a 
 deliberate, consensual team approach that is shaped by the input of 
 all concerned partners rather than through traditional negotiating 
 postures. The goal is to create an effective labor-management 
 relationship based upon partnership and trust that utilizes the 
 strengths of both parties to meet and mutually resolve issues in a 
 way that enhances the effectiveness of both labor and management.
<p>
 Employees, management officials, and union leaders should be 
 continuously trained in support of the labor-management relationship, 
 which in turn should lead to creation of high-value, high-performing 
 government organizations. Training should be provided in the areas of 
 facilitation, problem-solving, negotiation, leadership, and quality.
<p>
 Performance should be continuously improved on an organizational and 
 individual level throughout the entire government; unnecessary 
 conflict should be avoided; unavoidable conflict should be recognized 
 and channeled to closure quickly, without animus; and individual and 
 institutional (i.e., labor-management) cooperation should be 
 encouraged and rewarded. The appeals process should be fair, simple, 
 determinative, fast, and inexpensive. There should be incentives for 
 labor-management cooperation and strong disincentives for labor or 
 management to violate the partnership or to fail to settle or resolve 
 issues within the partnership.
<p>
 Union effectiveness is one of the cornerstones of the productive 
 workplace partnership. Union effectiveness requires a strong, 
 professional, financially secure union that represents the interests 
 of all employees.
<p>
 Unions and management should work together as partners to transform 
 the way organizations are structured, work is performed, and services 
 are delivered. Management and unions should design systems and 
 solutions to issues involving efficiency, productivity, quality, and 
 how the job gets done. Placement of authority and decisionmaking in 
 the work unit should be aided by the absence of artificial barriers 
 to bargaining at any level.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Action</b>
 <p>
 The President should issue an Executive Order that identifies labor-
 management partnership as a goal of the executive branch and 
 establishes the National Partnership Council. (2)
<p>
 When many people think of labor-management relations, they visualize 
 an adversarial relationship. Depending on their viewpoint or 
 experience, they may see management assuming a posture to protect its 
 authority and do all it can to ensure efficiency at the cost of 
 reduced benefits and wage cuts. Others may see unions as wanting work 
 rules that prevent organizations or work groups from being more 
 effective, and insisting on bargaining or grieving over the most 
 mundane and inconsequential issues.
<p>
 Depending on their perspective, some people may see ideas such as 
 labor-management partnership and cooperation simply as code words for 
 allowing managers to bypass unions to get employees to work harder, 
 faster, and less wisely, with fewer protections. Others may see 
 cooperative initiatives simply as opportunities for unions to bargain 
 over pay, organization mission, and goals, and receive more 
 concessions in work and seniority rules, benefits, and protections 
 for ineffective workers.
<p>
 The Executive Order would dispel these images. It would make it clear 
 that the goal is an entirely new concept of labor-management 
 relations. The Executive Order should contain two parts and be 
 accompanied by a presidential statement, as outlined below.
<p>
 
 Executive Order, Part 1: Concepts.
<p>
 --- The goal of any labor-management partnership is the creation of a 
 high-performance organization to deliver quality services to the 
 American people in a way that integrates employee and other 
 stakeholder interests.
<p>
 --- Partners work for each other, not against each other. They 
 respect each other's contributions and have a sense of ownership of, 
 and share in decisions that affect, the organization's products and 
 services.
<p>
 --- Partners work in team environments that value contributions based 
 on knowledge and experience, and blend these contributions to enhance 
 quality, creativity, flexibility, and responsiveness.
<p>
 --- Management's role shifts from an emphasis on protecting its 
 authority to promoting empowerment at the lowest practical levels to 
 provide for employee and union participation.
<p>
 --- The union's role shifts from a reactive posture to proactive 
 employee representation in support of agency mission accomplishment 
 and workplace effectiveness.
<p>
 --- When we speak of employees and partnerships, and when employees 
 have collectively decided to elect representatives to speak on their 
 behalf, then the unions and employees must be treated as full 
 partners.
<p>
 --- Changing the culture of the federal government requires 
 overcoming resistance from employees and managers alike. Each 
 naturally will believe that the change may bring certain losses of 
 what they value. Developing a partnership in any change effort 
 provides the institutional help to support movement to the federal 
 workforce and organization of the future.
<p>
 Executive Order, Part 2: Methods. Following are some methods that 
 should be put into place through the Executive Order to support goal 
 attainment. The National Partnership Council may suggest other 
 methods.
<p>
 --- Create the National Partnership Council to champion the 
 partnership goal.
<p>
 --- Encourage the formation of similar councils or labor-management 
 committees at appropriate levels in each agency, or adapt existing 
 bodies to meet this purpose, and identify and/or train facilitators 
 for these labor-management committees as needed.
<p>
 --- Encourage systematic training of significant portions of agency 
 staffs (including line managers and first line supervisors) and union 
 officials (including stewards) in alternative dispute resolution 
 (ADR) techniques, interest-based bargaining approaches, and joint 
 problem-solving/decisionmaking methods.
<p>
 The National Partnership Council. The Executive Order should provide 
 the charter for the National Partnership Council and encourage 
 similar partnership arrangements at a variety of levels in each 
 agency. By October 1993, the President should announce the 
 appointments to the council and the date it should begin its work. He 
 should explain that achieving the partnership goal throughout the 
 executive branch requires a knowledgeable and experienced group to 
 champion such a change. Such change will be incremental and build on 
 actual models and successful experiences. The council should serve as 
 such a group and help steer the executive branch toward the 
 partnership goal. In describing the council, the Executive Order 
 should contain the following elements:
<p>
 --- Permanent members:
<p>
      -     Deputy Secretary, Department of Labor
<p>
      -     Deputy Director for Management, Office of Management and
            Budget (OMB)
<p>
      -     Director, OPM
<p>
      -     Chairperson, FLRA
<p>
      -     Director, FMCS
<p>
      -     Presidents of the three largest federal unions
<p>
      -     Representative, Public Employee Department, AFL-CIO (to
            represent smaller federal unions).
<p>
 --- Rotating members (1-year appointments, may be extended):
<p>
      -     Two deputy secretaries from departments other than Labor.
<p>
 --- Responsibilities and authority:
<p>
      -     champion the creation and support of partnerships in the 
 executive branch; collect and disseminate information about, and 
 provide guidance on, partnership efforts, including results achieved;
<p>
      -     bring together expertise both within and outside the 
 federal government to learn about and foster partnership 
 arrangements;
<p>
      -     participate in the development of legislation related to 
 the partnership goal, to include the creation of a flexible and 
 responsive hiring system and the reform of the General Schedule 
 classification system; and
<p>
      -     engage in other activities that promote partnership 
 efforts not prohibited by statute.
<p>
 --- Staff support and funding:
<p>
      -     OPM, FMCS, FLRA, OMB, agencies, and unions will make staff 
 available on a temporary or permanent basis to the council, as 
 needed. The council will decide on the procedures for acquiring and 
 using staff support.
<p>
      -     The council may form permanent or temporary committees 
 that will be responsible for specific issues or projects.
<p>
 --- Council's objective: the Executive Order should charge the 
 council with proposing to the President statutory changes needed to 
 help make the partnership goal a reality. The council should be 
 responsible for deciding on the process for developing the proposals. 
 The process should:
<p>
      -     model the partnership concepts and decisionmaking 
 techniques the council is championing;
<p>
      -      involve stakeholders both within and outside the 
 executive branch;
<p>
      -     build on the work already done by the NPR multi-
 stakeholder problem-solving team; and
<p>
      -     produce a strategy to build the political consensus 
 necessary to enact major changes in the statutory framework.
<p>
 Agency Partnership Committees and Councils. The Executive Order 
 should encourage each agency to foster partnerships with employee 
 unions. This may involve creating, at various levels, processes and 
 groups to foster partnerships, or adapting existing structures and 
 processes to meet this need. Each agency should be responsible for 
 the form this takes. However, agencies should be asked to ensure that 
 their processes and groups
<p>
 --- foster partnerships that move the organization toward high 
 performance and support the agencies' quality improvement and culture 
 change efforts as well the agencies' goals and missions,
<p>
 --- support the efforts of the National Partnership Council,
<p>
 --- share the results of agency partnership efforts,
<p>
 --- take the lead in ensuring that agency staff gain skills and 
 knowledge in joint problem solving, group facilitation, interest-
 based bargaining, and alternative dispute resolution techniques, and
<p>
 --- evaluate progress focusing specifically on improvements in 
 organizational performance resulting from the partnership.
<p>
 Presidential Statement. The presidential statement will accompany and 
 provide the rationale for the Executive Order and make the case for 
 the partnership by articulating the following:
<p>
 --- The partnership goal means that agency mission achievement will 
 be jointly and continually pursued through "innovative approaches 
 that maximize the contributions of individual employees, managers and 
 the Union" working together to achieve these objectives, as outlined, 
 for example, in the 1992 IRS-NTEU partnership agreement.
<p>
 --- Collective bargaining will take place less in an adversarial 
 setting with parties bringing their positions to the table, but 
 increasingly through interest-based bargaining that insists upon 
 consensus decisionmaking and trust within the partnership.
<p>
 --- Although grievances, complaints, and disputes are to be expected, 
 it is envisioned that less than 10 percent of those conflicts will be 
 settled outside the partnership. This means that formal complaint and 
 grievance processing procedures will be used infrequently with 
 informal dispute resolution techniques providing a foundation for the 
 partnership.
<p>
 --- There is a place for disagreements, adversarial behavior, and 
 different approaches to problems; however, these will occur prior to 
 decisions being made because airing different viewpoints and then 
 achieving joint decisions are the essence of partnerships.
<p>
 --- Requirements fixed in law will not be subject to negotiation; 
 however, management and unions are obligated to use interest-based 
 forms of negotiation on issues, both procedural and substantive, 
 dealing with conditions of employment that significantly affect the 
 operation of the organization.

<H2> HRM14:  Provide Incentives to Encourage Voluntary Separations</H2>
 <p> 
 <b>Background</b>
 <p> 
 Throughout the federal government, departments and agencies are being 
 asked to work more efficiently, that is, with fewer resources. To 
 achieve this goal, many organizations are facing potentially massive 
 restructuring and downsizing. Incentives are needed to encourage 
 voluntary separations, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for 
 relocating, reassigning, or separating employees under reduction in 
 force procedures.
<p>
<p>
<b> Need for Change</b>
 <p>
 According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), voluntary 
 early retirements among eligible employees have dropped from 
 approximately 17 percent in the mid-1980s to 4 percent in 1992. After 
 remaining relatively constant at approximately 36 percent during the 
 same time period, regular optional retirements dropped to 23 percent 
 in 1992.(1) Overall attrition from federal service is at its lowest 
 level since 1973, when OPM began tracking these data.
<p>
 The federal government's recent experience with separation incentives 
 suggests that a large percentage of employees will choose regular or 
 early retirement if incentives are included. The Office of Thrift 
 Supervision (OTS) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), in 1991 and 
 1992, respectively, offered lump sum payments equivalent to six 
 months' salary to persons eligible for either early or regular 
 retirement. In OTS, 38 percent of early retirement and 53 percent of 
 regular retirement eligibles accepted the offer. In USPS, 27 percent 
 of early retirement and 43 percent of regular retirement eligibles 
 accepted. In 1993, Department of Defense (DOD) employees were offered 
 the lesser of $25,000 or the amount the employee would otherwise be 
 entitled to receive as severance pay. About 20 percent of early 
 retirement eligibles and 40 percent of regular retirement eligibles 
 have retired from DOD recently.(2)
<p>
<p>
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Provide departments and agencies with the authority to offer 
 separation pay. (3)
<p>
 By October 1993, OPM should forward draft legislation to Congress to 
 permit any department or agency to offer cash payments to encourage 
 eligible employees to voluntarily separate from the federal service, 
 whether by retirement or resignation, to avoid or minimize the need 
 for involuntary separations due to reduction in force, 
 reorganization, transfer of function, or similar action. The 
 legislation should include a comprehensive, governmentwide strategy 
 for determining the dates during which cash payments would be offered 
 to maximize acceptance rates. Eligible employees would be those 
 serving under permanent appointment without time limitation for a 
 continuous period of at least 12 months, excluding reemployed 
 annuitants and employees who would otherwise be eligible for 
 disability retirement. The law will include a provision requiring 
 repayment of separation pay should the individual become reemployed 
 by the federal government within two years of the date of separation. 
 Departments and agencies will fund the costs of this measure from 
 within their available appropriations.
<p>
<p>
 2. Decentralize the authority to approve early retirement. (3)
<p>
 By October 1993, OPM should forward draft legislation to Congress to 
 allow OPM to assess an actuarial charge against agencies to cover the 
 estimated present value of the added cost to the retirement fund of 
 early retirement, currently estimated at 9 percent of final pay. Once 
 the new legislation has been enacted, OPM should delegate broad 
 authority under the relevant section of the current law(3) to permit 
 departments and agencies to make their own determinations using the 
 criteria outlined in the law to allow their employees to retire 
 early.(4) 
<p>
<p>
 3. Authorize departments and agencies to fund job search activities 
 and retraining of employees scheduled to be displaced. (3)
<p>
 By spring 1994, OPM should convene an interagency task force to 
 develop proposals, including legislation if necessary, by September 
 1994 to allow departments and agencies to fund job search activities 
 and retraining to facilitate placement of employees who are otherwise 
 scheduled for downgrade or separation.
<p>
<p>
 4. Expand outplacement services. (1)
<p>
 By March 1994, OPM should develop and implement a comprehensive, 
 readily available, state-of-the-art information system for the 
 purpose of informing employees about the availability of federal and 
 other public sector job opportunities.
<p>
<p>
 5. Limit annual leave accumulation by senior executives to 240 hours. 
 (3)
<p>
 By October 1993, OPM should forward draft legislation to Congress to 
 delete the section of the law that exempts the annual leave 
 accumulated by members of the Senior Executive Service, the Senior 
 Foreign Service, the Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service, 
 the Senior Cryptologic Executive Service, and the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive 
 Service from the limitation otherwise imposed by that section on 
 annual leave accumulation.(5) Annual leave accumulation for 
 individual senior executives will be limited to 240 hours. This 
 limitation would bring senior executives in line with other 
 government employees and serve as an incentive for some senior 
 executives to take advantage of separation incentives.

<Title>Improving Program Design</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Improving Program Design</H2>
<P>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p>
 Federal programs are often a story of good intentions 
 gone awry. Consider, for instance, the case of 
 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients who are 
 also eligible for food stamps. Congress, hoping to 
 improve service to, and participation of, those SSI 
 beneficiaries, concluded that the Departments of 
 Agriculture and Health and Human Services should 
 coordinate the delivery of food stamps at Social 
 Security Administration (SSA) offices. Subsequently, 
 however, the General Accounting Office (GAO) found 
 that this design resulted in duplicated efforts and 
 poor service.
<p>
 Another flawed program design is the federal student 
 loan program which has guaranteed $142 billion in 
 loans, paid $35 billion in interest, and lost $19 
 billion in defaulted loans since 1965, yet it 
 generates hundreds of millions of dollars in profit 
 every year for private corporations. Poor program 
 design also contributed to lax federal regulation of 
 the savings and loan industry, which will cost 
 taxpayers some $300 billion before the crisis ends. 
 More recently, the Federal Aviation Administration 
 struggled to keep up with rapid growth in airline 
 service because of serious institutional constraints, 
 prompting some experts to recommend transforming it 
 into a government corporation.
<p>
 These experiences are not isolated. Many federal 
 programs are badly designed, ill-conceived and 
 fatally flawed. Innumerable bureaucratic horror 
 stories publicized by journalists, pundits, 
 politicians, and civil servants have unfairly turned 
 phrases like "good government" into oxymorons.
 [Endnote 1] GAO has identified 17 federal programs as
 high-risk activities especially vulnerable to waste,
 fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.[Endnote 2] The Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) currently has 104
 programs on its high-risk list.[Endnote 3]
<p>
 The number and severity of these problems has 
 undermined the public's trust in government. Perhaps 
 not since the beginning of the Great Depression have 
 Americans shown such little confidence in 
 Washington's ability to provide the service that the 
 nation deserves. And, unlike Watergate, Iran-Contra, 
 and other political scandals, the problem is not 
 rooted in the episodic vices and failures of 
 individuals. Instead, Americans are increasingly 
 frustrated by the enduring deficiencies in our 
 government's structures and processes.
<p>
 Often, government problems are rooted in the poor 
 foundations upon which public programs are built--
 ambiguous goals, weak operational concepts, and 
 careless implementation design. Now, both program 
 design and program evaluation are enjoying heightened 
 prominence with enactment of the Government 
 Performance and Results Act of 1993. It requires the 
 executive branch to produce both performance plans 
 and performance reports; these requirements should 
 prompt agencies to foster better program designs and 
 more rigorous program evaluations.
<p>
 Federal programs come in a wide assortment. 
 Sometimes, the federal government provides cash 
 payments to individuals, such as with Social 
 Security. At other times, it provides benefits only 
 indirectly, such as when it offers tax incentives for 
 builders to construct low-income housing. The 
 particular method of delivery of public service 
 (e.g., direct subsidies, tax incentives, loan 
 guarantees, regulations, etc.) should be tailored to 
 the specific requirements and circumstances of the 
 constituency to be served.
<p>
 To be sure, political considerations, both in the 
 executive branch and Congress, play a major role in 
 influencing the shape and funding of most federal 
 programs. Nevertheless, these programs also should be 
 rationally formulated and designed. In fact, sound 
 designs that are based on objective criteria could 
 yield programs that are more likely to win 
 administrative and legislative approval.
<p>
 At present, the federal government lacks any 
 systematic, disciplined approach to program design. 
 In designing programs, officials all too often fail 
 to anticipate the unintended consequences. Program 
 evaluation in OMB and many agencies is less prominent 
 than it once was. Yet we need broadly applicable 
 techniques for designing effective, cost-efficient 
 programs, especially in an era of fiscal austerity. 
 We also should apply program design technology to 
 existing programs as part of program review, 
 evaluation, and redesign processes. In time, the 
 objective criteria that we develop may help us better 
 determine what services the federal government should 
 provide, and what we should discontinue. The 
 following are examples of such objective criteria:
<p>
 1. Identify who benefits and how they benefit.
<p>
 2. Define and evaluate alternate methods of 
    program delivery.
<p>
 3. Examine program compatibility.
<p>
 4. Assess cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
<p>
 5. Evaluate consistency with accepted 
    management principles.
<p>
 6. Ensure financial feasibility.
<p>
 7. Determine feasibility of implementation.
<p>
 8. Provide for program flexibility.
<p>
 9. Institute performance measurement and 
    program evaluation.
<p>
 10.Build in cessation provisions.
<p>
 Whatever criteria are chosen, the federal government 
 needs to develop a formal discipline of program 
 design. The National Performance Review recommends 
 four presidential initiatives. 
<p>
 First, the President should direct the President's 
 Management Council to sponsor the development and 
 publication of a comprehensive handbook that would 
 address the strengths and weaknesses of alternative 
 program designs. It should include a complete review 
 of relevant literature, a compilation of existing 
 federal programs, a discussion of different 
 approaches, an assessment of comparative advantages, 
 analyses of case studies, and model designs for 
 program types.
<p>
 Second, the Council should designate one or two 
 agencies to test program design capability to 
 determine its value and costs. For these pilot 
 projects, agencies might create modest program design 
 offices--staffed by individuals qualified in program 
 design, management and evaluation--to help senior 
 officials design new programs and assess existing 
 ones.
<p>
 Third, the Council should take steps to help Congress 
 design better programs. It should work with the 
 Congressional Research Service (CRS) so the CRS will 
 include program design concepts in all of its 
 relevant training materials. In addition, the Council 
 should encourage CRS, GAO, the Congressional Budget 
 Office, and key congressional staff to participate in 
 program design training.
<p>
 Fourth, the Council should commission program design 
 courses to educate and train current and future 
 policymakers, program designers, and managers. Such 
 education might include short seminars, a longer 
 residential course, the introduction of program 
 design into existing management development programs, 
 and offerings at graduate schools of public 
 administration.

<H2>Improving Program Design</H2>
<p>
<H2> The Need for Change</H2>
<p> 
  In a speech at a conference in Atlanta some years 
 ago, a federal official told a story about a young 
 attorney working on Capitol Hill who was asked to 
 draft a bill to regulate some aspect of the airline 
 industry. He started by looking up and copying the 
 law that addressed similar concerns with the 
 railroads. Finding some provisions which did not seem 
 applicable to railroads, he did further research and 
 discovered that the railroad bill had been lifted 75 
 years earlier by another attorney from a law passed 
 early in the 19th century to regulate canals. Justice 
 Oliver Wendell Holmes said that "in the law, an ounce 
 of history is worth a pound of logic.''[Endnote 1]
 However, in the design of federal programs,
 unfortunately both are often missing. Consider the
 following 1981 exchange before a subcommittee of the
 House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs:
<p>
 Chairman Blanchard: Have you made any conclusions as 
 to where governmental loans are an effective policy 
 instrument and where they are not? Where loan 
 guarantees are an effective policy instrument and 
 where they are not? How they work, in what instances 
 they work well and where they don't, and where they 
 can be effective and where they aren't? Because we 
 are looking at these in relation to other tools that 
 the government has to operate...Have there been 
 any studies on...federal use of direct spending 
 versus loans versus loan guarantees versus the tax 
 code, and then the various types of tax preferences 
 and their effectiveness in different instances?
<p>
 The witnesses responded that they were unaware of any 
 such literature.[Endnote 2] Earlier the Congressional
 Research Service observed:
<p>
 These program differences underline the ways in which 
 the programs have evolved. There have been no overall 
 guidelines or framework within which these programs 
 are created. They have evolved over time to meet 
 particular needs and situations. This generally ad 
 hoc framework has led to a situation where, except 
 for vast generalizations, it is hard to make specific 
 statements concerning the characteristics of federal 
 loan guarantees.[Endnote 3]
<p>
 Is there a systematic, disciplined approach to 
 program design in the Federal Government? There is 
 not. An extensive literature search and consultation 
 with experts inside and outside government reveal an 
 overwhelming consensus that the lack of attention to 
 program design means that federal activities are less 
 effective and less economical than they should be. 
 Program designs are frequently characterized by 
 insufficient rational analysis and failure to 
 anticipate unintended consequences. Often this can be 
 attributed to the poor foundations upon which the 
 programs were built- ambiguous goals, weak 
 operational concepts and careless implementation 
 design. It is rare to compare programs across agency 
 and department lines in terms of what they do and how 
 they do it. We do not have a methodology with which 
 to compare them.
<p>
 Some public policy/administration academics have 
 attempted to develop a rational, disciplined approach 
 to program design. In 1985, A Workbook in Program 
 Design for Public Managers  noted the absence of any 
 preexisting attempt to provide this discipline and 
 recognized its own limitations, stating ". . . at 
 best, this workbook is but a beginning
 effort.''[Endnote 4] In 1986, the classic text
 Politics, Position and Power (Fourth Edition) proposed
 twelve criteria for evaluating the design and
 organization of new or existing programs.[Endnote 5]
 In 1989, the Urban Institute published a primer on
 program reviews that outlined criteria for analyzing
 program alternatives.[Endnote 6]
<p>
 While academic interest in program design seems to 
 be growing, the practical applications have been few. 
 "Over time, legislation has suffered more and more 
 from wishful thinking, sloppy drafting, and woeful 
 disregard for public-sector organizational 
 principles.''[Endnote 7] A congressional effort to
 establish a program design discipline for a segment of
 related governmental programs can be found in the 1988
 public law which elevated the Veterans Administration
 to departmental status. The law provided for the 
 establishment of a National Commission on Executive 
 Organization, generally patterned on the first Hoover 
 Commission. Its charter would have required ". . . 
 establish[ment of] criteria for use by the President 
 and Congress in evaluating proposals for government 
 corporations and government-sponsored enterprises and 
 subsequently overseeing their performance.''
 [Endnote 8] The new commission could have been
 activated by presidential initiative; however, it was
 not.
<p>
 Rigorous assessments of federal programs and their 
 designs were once an active responsibility of OMB; 
 however, current oversight responsibilities regarding 
 program design are cloudy. In OMB and many agencies, 
 program evaluation as a related discipline is also 
 less prominent now.
<p>
 Both program design and program evaluation will 
 become more prominent under the new Government 
 Performance and Results Act of 1993. The Act requires 
 performance plans and performance reports from the 
 executive branch; hence, agencies may be prompted to 
 foster sound program designs as well as rigorous 
 program evaluation.
<p>
 What are the consequences of the absence of a 
 rational program design process? Too often programs 
 are designed without careful consideration of the way 
 that similar designs have worked previously or the 
 potential benefits of alternate designs.[Endnote 9] It
 is no wonder news media, federal auditors, politicians
 and taxpayers are critical of a government that too
 often creates federal programs that do not meet public 
 expectations. A consequence is sagging public 
 confidence in the ability of government to deliver.
<p>
 For example, flawed program design accounts for poor 
 public service in food stamp application processing 
 for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) applicants and 
 recipients. Congress believed that food stamp program 
 participation would increase, and more streamlined 
 public service would occur, if the Departments of 
 Agriculture and Health and Human Services coordinated 
 the delivery of food stamp services at Social 
 Security Administration (SSA) offices. For SSI 
 clients eligible and willing to apply for food stamps 
 at SSA field offices, SSA staff complete an 
 application and forward it to a state food stamp 
 office for further consideration.[Endnote 10] GAO
 concluded: 
<p>
 The process for taking food stamp applications at SSA 
 has not worked well...further, the process as 
 designed results in duplication of effort and poor 
 service to clients...the food stamp applications 
 used are unnecessarily complex and lengthy.'' 
 [Endnote 11] 
<p>
 There are many other examples of poor programs that 
 have received public criticism because they fail to 
 meet various design criteria. These include:
<p>
 --Regulation of Savings and Loan Institutions.
   The government intended to use federal 
   deposit insurance to subsidize the cost of loans and 
   increase the availability of mortgage money for home 
   buyers. To avoid the misuse of a government guarantee 
   such as deposit insurance, the government must 
   establish an effective and independent supervisory 
   agency. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board lacked this 
   independence from the savings and loan industry that 
   it was supposed to supervise. The ultimate cost of 
   that regulatory failure will amount to some $100 
   billion.[Endnote 12]
<p>
 --Reduction of Crime. In attempting to reduce 
   burglaries, the Law  Enforcement Assistance 
   Administration tried to increase the effectiveness of 
   limited numbers of law enforcement officials through 
   large investments in  sophisticated 
   telecommunications in police cruisers. These efforts 
   were much less effective than Neighborhood Watch 
   programs which greatly increased the number of people 
   participating in crime surveillance at minimal 
   cost.[Endnote 13] The consideration of alternatives in
   the design of federal programs is all too rare. 
   Consequently the allocation of program resources 
   often is not optimal in accomplishing desired ends.
<p>
 --Federal Catfish Research. The Senate has 
   noted that catfish research is conducted in at least 
   four agencies: Fish and Wildlife Service (Interior), 
   Animal and Plant Inspection Service (Agriculture), 
   Agriculture Research Service, and Agriculture 
   Cooperation Service. Although a 1988 report by the 
   Inspector General at the Department of Commerce 
   (itself conducting independent catfish studies) 
   recommended that the work be consolidated, it still 
   has not been done.[Endnote 14] Federal catfish
   research raises a variety of design questions. How
   compatible are these research efforts with each other?
   Are they complementary or redundant? What are the
   aggregate costs for federal catfish research and are
   they justified by the benefits?
<p>
 --National Air Traffic Control. The Federal 
   Aviation Administration (FAA)  is responsible for 
   airline safety in the United States and administers 
   the nation's air traffic control system. Commentators 
   have repeatedly pointed to problems confronting the 
   FAA as it works to keep up with rapid growth in 
   airline service and cope with federal budget 
   constraints and inflexibility in its institutional 
   structure. Recently the National Airline Commission 
   recommended that the FAA become a government 
   corporation so that it can regain the capacity to 
   carry out its essential  functions.[Endnote 15]
<p>
 What is a program? In this context, a program is "a 
 particular combination of authority, organizations, 
 resources and personnel assembled to achieve specific 
 public purposes.''[Endnote 16] At times, the federal 
 government's role is very direct, such as payment of 
 cash to Social Security beneficiaries. Alternatively 
 the role can be indirect, such as the establishment 
 of tax incentives for the private sector to provide 
 low income housing.
<p>
 In the field of public administration, two other 
 levels of analysis have been proposed. One analyzes a 
 set of programs or a program cluster aimed at a 
 specific, common target group.[Endnote 17] For
 example, there are many programs addressing the income
 maintenance needs of the poor. Rather than considering
 a single program's design in isolation, the preferred
 focus is to diagnose program effectiveness as a whole.
<p>
 A second alternative is to focus on the generic tools 
 of government action, the techniques of social 
 intervention used in particular public
 programs.[Endnote 18] Reinventing Government
 identifies 36 such mechanisms, ranging from grants to
 tax policies.[Endnote 19] In some program designs,
 more than one tool may be used; therefore, it is
 helpful to examine how well each tool works, either
 alone or in combination with others.
<p>
 Frequently, each of these perspectives merits 
 consideration. For example, consider a category of 
 programs using more than one method of delivery--job 
 training. It can be delivered in many forms including 
 tax policy, grants, loans, loan guarantees, technical 
 assistance, information, referral, seed money, and 
 jaw boning. Whatever combination of delivery tools 
 may apply to a specific public purpose, it would be 
 desirable to understand the programmatic impact of 
 the tools individually and collectively in order to 
 design the best portfolio.
<p>
 Why do we need an emphasis on program design? 
 Effective and efficient delivery of programs is a 
 major determinant of the public's confidence in its 
 government. Although the approval and funding of most 
 federal programs are inevitably shaped by political 
 considerations (both in Congress and the executive 
 branch), the formulation and design of these programs 
 should be grounded in rational and valid public 
 purposes. Sound designs based on objective criteria 
 can yield programs more likely to win bureaucratic 
 and political approval. A program design discipline 
 that can increase the likelihood of a program's 
 success is especially important in a time of 
 especially austere fiscal constraints. In addition, 
 this program design discipline should be applied to 
 existing programs as part of program review and 
 redesign processes.[Endnote 20] The American public is
 willing to support programs if it is confident the
 programs address issues important to them and the
 solutions have a reasonable probability of success
 (e.g., health care reform).[Endnote 21]

<P>
<H2>Program Design Criteria</H2>
<p>
  Whatever the purposes of any public program, its 
 logic and internal consistency can be exposed and 
 analyzed using objective rational criteria. The 
 following is a set of criteria which could be applied 
 systematically when designing or redesigning 
 programs.[Endnote 1] Research and development to
 further the field certainly will refine and augment
 this list.
<p>
<p>
 <b>1. Identify Who Benefits and How They Benefit</b>
<p>
 All program designs require clear, explicit 
 identification of the primary beneficiaries and the 
 specific benefits they can expect. Without this 
 foundation, no rational program design methodology 
 can be sustained. Programs designed to solve 
 particular problems should be consistent with the 
 missions of the agencies responsible. However, both 
 the problems addressed and the missions pursued 
 should always be framed in the context of who 
 benefits.
<p>
 Prioritize Beneficiaries. The public purposes and 
 program goals must be defined in terms of benefits to 
 individuals and/or groups. There are two levels of 
 beneficiaries, primary and secondary, which must be 
 reflected in a program's design. 
<p>
 Primary beneficiaries benefit directly from a 
 program. To illustrate, the Department of Veterans 
 Affairs serves veterans; the programs it administers 
 clearly define categories of veterans who qualify as 
 beneficiaries. Other programs' intended primary 
 beneficiaries are not as clear. Consider government 
 programs allowing removal of trees from federal 
 lands. In this latter case the class of primary 
 beneficiaries may be the loggers--who would otherwise 
 be unemployed--the logging companies, the domestic 
 and foreign timber consumers, or the recreational 
 users who object to despoiling the environment. 
 Secondary beneficiaries are those individuals, groups 
 of individuals, or organizations benefiting 
 indirectly from a program. For example, state 
 governments are the secondary beneficiaries of 
 federal grants for education.
<p>
 Finally, a class of interested parties, not strictly 
 beneficiaries of a program, are stakeholders, such as 
 taxpayers. The taxpayers deserve the most effective 
 and efficient design possible to maximize the return 
 on their investment in tax dollars.
<p>
 Validate the Need. It is essential to verify that the 
 need exists and will persist. The program designers 
 must be able to document that the need is more than a 
 short-term aberration. The determination of who 
 benefits and how they benefit should be validated by 
 the intended beneficiaries themselves, which is the 
 essence of customer-driven government. Federal-level 
 involvement must also be justified. The program must 
 avoid addressing obsolete problems or needs that are 
 more effectively solved through state or local 
 initiatives, through the private sector, or by 
 nonprofit organizations.
<p>
 Determine Program Size and Scope. Program designers 
 must also determine the size and scope of the 
 population to be served so the course of action 
 matches the problem. How many people are affected? 
 What are the eligibility criteria? What are the 
 characteristics of the affected populations 
 (geography, socio-economic factors, etc.)? What level 
 of diversity exists among the populations affected? 
 What is the minimum program size necessary to achieve 
 the results required?
<p>
 If there is more than one problem to be addressed, 
 the program designers must identify each need and 
 prioritize solutions to avoid unbalanced or skewed 
 designs. Social Security is an example of a program 
 that has well-defined beneficiaries and missions. It 
 is designed to provide income to individuals (and 
 their eligible family members) who are retired or 
 disabled. The Social Security Administration has long 
 viewed its mission as the right check, to the right 
 person, in the correct amount, on time. Clear 
 eligibility criteria enable reliable estimates of 
 client populations and size of benefits.
<p>
 Inspire Public Confidence. Program design should give 
 the program credibility with the public. There is a 
 common perception that the political process does not 
 always place program priorities on the appropriate 
 beneficiaries. Without strong public confidence, 
 programs are hindered from gaining approval and 
 overcoming resistance during implementation. A 
 federal program should appear to make sense both in 
 intent and by design as a valid commitment of public 
 resources.
<p>
<p> 
<b>2. Define and Evaluate Alternate Methods of Program Delivery</b>
<p>
 After clearly defining program goals and 
 beneficiaries, the designers should consider any 
 alternate forms of program delivery. Not all public 
 needs must be satisfied by direct federal delivery of 
 services. Alternatives to direct government service 
 include regulatory requirements, government sponsored 
 enterprises, tax incentives, government guarantees, 
 monitoring and enforcement, etc.
<p>
 Different program delivery methods can often attain 
 similar ends, although costs and schedules are not 
 likely to be the same. Education is a prime example. 
 Education has been delivered in many forms such as 
 direct cash payments to veterans, categorical grants 
 to states to fund educational initiatives at the 
 local level, block grants, tax exemptions, 
 privatization, etc.Two sources of potential 
 alternatives are the list of 36 governmental 
 mechanisms that were identified by Osborne and 
 Gaebler in Reinventing Government, and the program 
 tools identified by Professor Lester Salamon of Johns 
 Hopkins University.[Endnote 2] Salamon suggests that
 the major tools of public action should be studied in 
 a well-structured framework:
<p>
 Given the great proliferation of instruments that the 
 public sector uses, and the likelihood that this 
 proliferation will continue as a result of the 
 privatization movement and the resource constraints 
 under which government is operating, the development 
 of a body of knowledge that can help guide the 
 selection of tools and instruct program managers 
 about the consequences of these choices seems 
 increasingly worthwhile.[Endnote 3]
<p>
 Review Against Assumptions. Alternatives must be 
 reviewed explicitly against fundamental assumptions. 
 What are the critical success factors identified by 
 the beneficiaries? How has success been measured and 
 how well does each program design address the needs 
 identified? What is each design's ability to serve 
 people, to adapt to emerging technology, and to use 
 existing facilities? What are the possible unintended 
 consequences or adverse effects of each design 
 mechanism? How do they compare to the status quo? 
 Examples of programs which merit review against their 
 initial assumptions include job training, veterans 
 health care, and sundry entitlement programs.
<p>
<p>
 <b>3. Examine Program Compatibility</b>
<p>
 It is rare that any new program is so independent and 
 autonomous that it enters a domain totally 
 unpopulated by preexisting efforts. Consequently, 
 program design should be mindful of compatibility and 
 complementarity with existing infrastructure or 
 related programs. 
<p>
 Comparative Advantage. What does this program do that 
 is unique? Would another program or program design 
 perform these functions better? What would 
 beneficiaries lose if this program did not exist? 
<p>
 Complementarity. Does the program complement other 
 programs that serve the same beneficiaries? Does the 
 program needlessly duplicate or overlap other 
 programs at the federal, state, or local levels? Does 
 the program foster cooperation or does it create 
 barriers between beneficiaries and administrators? To 
 illustrate, one-stop shopping, which provides 
 multiple services conveniently at one place, 
 contributes to integrated program delivery and is 
 being considered by the Department of Labor for 
 workforce development.[Endnote 4]
<p>
 Harmony. Is the program consistent with the mission 
 of the agency which would administer it? Does it 
 create conflict in the agency? Is the program more 
 compatible with another agency's mission? Are another 
 agency's programs more interrelated and would that 
 agency therefore be a better fit? How easy is it to 
 add the program to an existing organizational 
 structure? Will it replace one or more existing 
 programs? Does it create or reduce redundancies?
<p>
 Catalyst. Does the program foster competition or does 
 it encourage monopolies? Does it serve as a catalyst? 
 Does the program design result in the empowerment of 
 people and communities so they have a vested interest 
 in how the program is run? Is there positive leverage 
 with other programs or destructive interference? Does 
 the sum of all programs encourage the right behavior 
 or do perverse incentives motivate dysfunctional 
 behavior?
<p>
 <b>4. Assess Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency</b>
<p>
 Program designers should apply cost-effectiveness and 
 efficiency criteria to the program as a whole and to 
 specific program elements (including organizational 
 structures, program delivery, and administrative 
 support functions) to estimate:
<p>
 --cost (total, marginal, and/or 
   administrative, as a measure of overhead) per unit of 
   benefit (defined as program outputs or outcomes); and
<p>
 --productivity (unit of benefit per full time 
   employee or field office).
<p>
 Program designers also should consider the program's 
 social efficiency; i.e., how the program might be 
 designed to achieve the greatest net benefit to 
 society as a whole. In this context, benefits and 
 costs are defined more inclusively than in analyzing 
 cost-effectiveness, although there probably will be 
 some overlap. To determine efficiency, analysts would 
 employ the standard techniques of benefit-cost 
 analysis to estimate the net social benefits of one 
 or more program designs. Steps include:
<p>
 --identifying major relevant impacts of the 
   policy, including direct and indirect impacts on the 
   program's direct beneficiaries, other affected 
   groups, and society as a whole;
<p>
 --categorizing costs and benefits for various 
   affected groups; and 
<p>
 --quantifying dollar impacts. 
<p>
 In principle, the program design which is estimated 
 to achieve the highest net benefit should be 
 selected. However, optimizing distributional benefits 
 (to either primary or secondary beneficiaries) 
 typically conflicts with optimizing aggregate social 
 welfare. Some times this may be appropriate (i.e., 
 targeted programs). At other times some might 
 criticize the selection of sub-optimally efficient 
 programs as pork-barrel spending. Making explicit the 
 trade-offs inherent in each design can help inform 
 the debate.
<p>
<p>
<b> 5. Evaluate Consistency with Accepted Management Principles</b>
<p>
 While the field of management is not a precise 
 science, it does represent an accumulation of 
 knowledge useful in illuminating the strengths and 
 weaknesses of public programs. Using generally 
 accepted management principles to evaluate various 
 program designs may help identify both inherent 
 deficiencies and alternative remedies. Where 
 violations of conventional wisdom are appropriate, 
 the justifications should be clear and convincing.
<p>
 Among the numerous management principles applicable 
 to program design to be given particular emphasis are 
 those consistent with the core values of reinventing 
 government, namely:
<p>
 --serving customers,
<p>
 --empowering employees,
<p>
 --empowering communities to solve their own 
   problems, and
<p>
 --fostering excellence.
<p>
 For example, program designers should consider the 
 following reinvention principles that improve the 
 efficiency and effectiveness of their programs:
<p>
 --create a clear sense of mission,
<p>
 --steer more, row less,
<p>
 --delegate authority and responsibility,
<p>
 --replace regulations with incentives,
<p>
 --develop budgets based on outcomes,
<p>
 --inject competition where appropriate,
<p>
 --search for market, not administrative, 
   solutions, and
<p>
 --measure success by customer satisfaction.
<p>
<p>
 <b>6. Ensure Financial Feasibility</b>
<p>
 Given the increasingly strong drive to reduce the 
 federal budget deficit, and competing claims on 
 limited funding, affordability is an inevitable 
 criterion for evaluating new and existing public 
 programs. Although not all programs have direct 
 budgetary impact, many do. Typically, cost 
 calculations and estimates can be difficult to 
 derive. Accounting methods interact with funding 
 streams and auditing requirements in ways that are 
 not always sensible or consistent.
<p>
 Nevertheless, the program cost must be known if the 
 government is to avoid incurring unlimited 
 liabilities. A program's budgetary costs can be 
 determined in a variety of ways, each of different 
 interest to different constituencies. Among the 
 alternate cost elements that may be relevant are:
<p>
 --total life cycle costs: the full costs of 
   creating, operating, maintaining, and terminating the 
   program from inception to conclusion (where end 
   points are reasonably defined);
<p>
 --annual budget requirements: the amount that 
   must be appropriated annually to sustain/maintain the 
   program throughout its lifetime;
<p>
 --risk of cost overruns: the probability that 
   actual program costs will exceed approved budget 
   levels including the expected cost of unbudgeted 
   contingent liabilities;
<p>
 --revenue generation: the expected income 
   return to the Treasury from the program's operation; 
   and

   collected or recaptured to the amount owed the U.S. 
   Treasury.
<p>
<p> 
<b>7. Determine Feasibility of Implementation</b>
<p>
 Even the best designed program will not be effective 
 in its execution if fatal flaws of implementation are 
 not considered during its design. Unfortunately, 
 those persons most familiar with implementation do 
 not usually play key roles in design, depriving 
 policy officials of the opportunity to obtain field 
 validation and assessment before final decisions on 
 design. Without effective implementation, program 
 proponents will not see their goals successfully 
 accomplished.Given the number and types of federal 
 programs, it is unrealistic to formulate universal 
 principles of implementation that apply exactly to 
 all programs. Yet it may be instructive to identify a 
 few common pitfalls to consider in the designs of 
 many types of public service programs.
<p>
 Foremost, implementation should be embedded in the 
 program design.[Endnote 5] Therefore, the more that
 programs explicitly consider anticipated difficulties
 and conditions of implementation, the fewer the
 surprises and the more likely program success.
 Although detailed operational plans are not usually
 developed during the program design phase, at least
 some consideration in broad outline would be prudent 
 management and politics. However, implementation must 
 not compromise or obscure the program's basic purpose 
 and integrity. If political realities so dilute the 
 program's integrity that the original intent is no 
 longer served, then managers should abort the design 
 rather than succumb to the temptation of just getting 
 anything approved.
<p>
 Second, it is imperative to identify clearly who is 
 ultimately responsible for the program to anticipate 
 their capacity to administer and to ensure 
 accountability. We cannot know the barriers and 
 impediments to success without knowing clearly who 
 (which organization(s)) is charged with carrying out 
 the program. An objective assessment of the 
 capabilities of the agencies through which the 
 program resources and responsibilities will flow 
 could pinpoint potential roadblocks, sources of 
 conflict, and choke points that might hamper 
 implementation. And, as trite as it sounds, those 
 responsible for implementing a program must know what 
 they are supposed to do. Policies, if not clear, 
 accurate, and consistent, may cause misunderstanding 
 and confusion, and confer discretion that may be 
 roundly abused. For federal programs to be 
 implemented more effectively, we must ensure the 
 following:
<p>
 (a) those bearing the major responsibility     for 
     implementation are aware of what isactually happening 
     in another unit of government, a field agency, or the 
     private sector;
<p>
 (b) those responsible for implementation earnestly 
     strive to achieve the stated program goals and 
     mission;
<p>
 (c) policies and actions are decisively made and 
     clearly transmitted; and
<p>
 (d) decisions and policies encourage creativity, 
     flexibility, and adaptability.
<p>
 Third, an accurate description of the organizational 
 network directly affected by the program would 
 identify the critical relationships and points of 
 coordination required or implied by program 
 operations. This might include a flow chart of 
 transactions depicting key relationships. Omissions 
 and redundancies are more easily and economically 
 remedied in the planning stages than later. 
 Implementing policies and programs requires a 
 coordination of efforts between various groups and 
 organizations, particularly regarding complex 
 policies or decisions.
<p>
 Fourth, the timing of critical events is absolutely 
 essential. Although many alternate sequences of 
 activities are possible, key deadlines may not be 
 discretionary (e.g., budget approvals, legislative 
 requirements, awarding of contracts, etc.) and 
 certain schedules offer distinct advantages over 
 others. More programs suffer from overly ambitious 
 timetables than from unduly conservative ones; 
 effective implementation requires sufficient time.
<p>
 Fifth, in designing programs, attention must be given 
 to resources. However, due to various political 
 compromises and conflicts, sufficient resources often 
 are not available to implement a program properly. 
 Program designers may not be aware of inadequate 
 resources or may choose to ignore the problem. There 
 are several important components of resources 
 critical to implementation, including:
<p>
 (a) adequate staff with the appropriate knowledge 
     (programmatic and managerial);
<p>
 (b) sufficient information on how a program or 
     decision is to be implemented and the 
     support/approval of other necessary agencies and 
     participants;
<p>
 (c) necessary authority to permit the programs or 
     decisions to be implemented; and
<p>
 (d) facilities and equipment necessary to implement 
     the program or decision.
<p>
 Sixth, prudent experimentation before committing the 
 government to a major public investment could help 
 avoid expensive misadventures and illuminate the 
 pitfalls in uncharted domains. While pilot 
 demonstrations are not appropriate for all programs, 
 they are highly desirable under a wide range of 
 conditions such as:
<p>
 (a) high risk programs--where the consequences of 
     ailure are catastrophic or life threatening;
<p>
 (b) where the economic investment is substantial 
     enough to justify small experiments;

 (c) where there is significant complexity--either 
     organizational or programmatic (e.g., health care, 
     homelessness, economic renewal);
<p>
 (d) where there is great uncertainty surrounding the 
     proper solutions;
<p>
 (e) where there is intense public controversy or low 
     political consensus; and
<p>
 (f) when there is no immediate urgency that precludes 
     more deliberate exploration of alternate approaches.
<p>
 <b>8. Provide for Program Flexibility</b>
<p>
 Perhaps the only universal element in all federal 
 programs is the certainty that even the most 
 carefully formulated plans and policies will not be 
 realized exactly as designed. Given the inordinately 
 long gestation periods for many public programs, 
 coupled with lengthy implementation periods, it may 
 be as long as five years before a program may be 
 mature enough to sustain a valid evaluation. 
<p>
 In the meantime, the conditions and constraints under 
 which a program operates may have changed 
 significantly from when it was first conceptualized. 
 Therefore, the design of programs should permit 
 enough management flexibility to allow agencies to 
 adapt to external changes, unforeseen circumstances, 
 variations in resource levels, and schedule changes. 
 In addition, program designs should free implementing 
 organizations to tailor programs to local 
 circumstances. Where initial rigidity in structure is 
 necessary, waiver authority is essential to 
 accommodate exceptional cases and unanticipated 
 conditions.[Endnote 6]
<p>
 While no one can anticipate every possible 
 contingency, the most likely changes (e.g., budget 
 erosion, schedule slippage, personnel shifts) should 
 not have catastrophic impacts on well-designed 
 programs. Programs dependent on critical, highly 
 sophisticated, specialized, or scarce resources 
 (e.g., key individuals, unproven technology, rare 
 expertise, unique facilities) are fragile because 
 they are vulnerable to uncertainties in the 
 availability, quality, and quantity of these 
 essential resources. For example, many attempts to 
 modernize automated information systems often under- 
 or over-estimate the availability of state of the art 
 technology, resulting in either investments in 
 obsolete hardware/software or costly delays waiting 
 for technology to catch up.
<p>
 Two especially critical flexibilities involve 
 schedule and budget. With the enormous vagaries of 
 when and what will survive the approval processes 
 both in the executive and legislative branches, and 
 the uncertainties of program execution, good program 
 designs must withstand significant variations in time 
 (i.e., date of initiation, rates of progress, 
 completion milestones, etc.) and budget availability 
 (both total amount and annual appropriations). 
 Programs should be designed to absorb reasonable 
 schedule changes with minimal impact. Similarly, 
 robust programs should yield acceptable returns on 
 investment over a wide range of program size (i.e., 
 they should be fairly elastic over different scale 
 levels). Programs that are designed as all or nothing 
 versus those that can be bought by the yard are 
 especially brittle in the face of inevitable 
 uncertainties in the appropriations and 
 authorizations processes.
<p>
<p>
 <b>9. Institute Performance Measurement and Program Evaluation</b>
<p>
 Program designs should incorporate feedback 
 mechanisms enabling managers and policymakers to 
 assess how well a program works in terms of both 
 implementation and achievement of program goals. Of 
 course, program designers first must sufficiently 
 identify the program's goals and specific performance 
 objectives to measure outcomes.
<p>
 Take, for example, the Customs Service's trade law 
 violation detection program. In fiscal 1991, U.S. 
 Customs did not detect about 84 percent of the 
 estimated trade law violations in imported
 cargo.[Endnote 7] Does a detection rate of 16 percent
 indicate success? A strong design should require
 benchmarks for success/failure and delineate when a
 program should be redesigned, concluded because
 successful, or terminated for failure.
<p>
 Designers, in consultation with potential users of 
 the performance data, should monitor a range of key 
 performance indicators.[Endnote 8] A wide range of
 types of data could be collected and reported,
 including a program's:
<p>
 --inputs (e.g., funding and staff, 
   beneficiary characteristics),
<p>
 --workload,
<p>
 --outputs (services/final products),
<p>
 --outcomes of products or services (i.e., for 
   a job training program, the number ofjob placements 
   that result in a year's employment),
<p>
 --efficiency and/or productivity,
<p>
 --beneficiary satisfaction,
<p>
 --employee satisfaction, and
<p>
 --service quality and timeliness.
<p>
 A performance measurement system also requires 
 identified data sources and reliable collection and 
 reporting methods. The value of the information 
 provided should be carefully weighed against the 
 costs of data collection, including the burden 
 imposed on reporting entities (such as state and 
 local governments). Where practical, performance 
 reports should be designed to meet the diverse 
 information needs (in terms of both quantity and 
 particular indicators presented) of the various users 
 of performance data (e.g., beneficiaries, line staff, 
 and program managers, senior agency officials, OMB, 
 etc.). Nonetheless, compromises among users may be 
 unavoidable.
<p>
 The new Government Performance and Results Act of 
 1993 will institutionalize performance measurement 
 throughout the federal government. Key elements of 
 this legislation include strategic plans, performance 
 plans, performance reports, managerial flexibility 
 waivers, and performance budgeting. This Act requires 
 a variety of pilot projects which could provide 
 fruitful opportunities for the application of the 
 several program design criteria suggested here.
<p>
<p>
 <b>10. Build in Cessation Provisions</b>
<p>
 There is a common perception that some government 
 programs and organizations outlive their usefulness 
 yet continue to exist without rational purpose or 
 tangible benefit. Government has often been 
 criticized as being totally incapable of abandoning 
 programs, despite success, failure, or lack of 
 evidence of either. Many government programs do not 
 explicitly provide for their conclusion or 
 termination for any cause whatsoever. A program 
 design which does not address the ultimate fate of 
 the program is at best incomplete, at worst self-
 perpetuating. Although some programs have no expected 
 expiration (e.g., Social Security), others do possess 
 an ultimate end point (e.g., inoculation programs 
 should cease when the disease is essentially 
 eliminated, as in the case of smallpox). 
 Determination should be made at the onset as to what 
 marks the success or failure of a program. When these 
 benchmarks are established, it will be easier to 
 decide when to redesign a program or just stop.
<p>
 The Helium Fund Program was created in 1925 to ensure 
 helium supplies for blimps. It has accumulated a 176-
 year supply of helium along with a $1.4 billion debt. 
 All original objectives (except paying for itself) 
 have been met, and private suppliers could meet all 
 federal needs at lower cost.[Endnote 9] The obvious
 question is who are the primary beneficiaries of this
 program now that blimps are not critical to national
 security or commerce? Moreover, the helium program
 lacks any cessation provisions, an all too common
 failing in program design.
<p>
 Sunset laws have a checkered history.[Endnote 10]
 While enjoying a surge of popularity at the state
 level in the 1970s and early 1980s, sunset laws have
 produced mixed results and many states are repealing 
 ineffective sunset legislation. In January 1993, a 
 sunset bill (S. 186) was reintroduced in the 103d 
 Congress which would require formal reauthorization 
 of federal programs every ten years. Given the amount 
 of controversy around the applicability of sunset 
 requirements to federal agencies, the bill's future 
 is uncertain. Perhaps more promising avenues exist in 
 strengthening reauthorization requirements by 
 incorporating rigorous performance measurements and 
 enforcing appropriate discipline in both the 
 executive and legislative branches of government.

<p>
 What Can be Done to Develop and Promulgate Program 
 Design? 
<p> 
 Program design criteria are merely the foundation for 
 more efficient and effective federal programs. To 
 establish a credible discipline of program design, 
 the criteria and the technology used in successful 
 design should be developed more fully throughout the 
 federal government. The following are recommendations 
 for developing a formal discipline of program design.
<HR>
<P>
<H2> DES01: Activate Program Design as a Formal Discipline</H2> 
<p>
 The President should direct the President's 
 Management Council (PMC) to sponsor as a high 
 priority project the development and publication of a 
 comprehensive handbook that will enable federal 
 managers and policymakers to understand the strengths 
 and weaknesses of alternative program designs.
 [Endnote 1] This policy research should include but
 not be limited to:
<p>
 --a complete review of the literature 
   relevant to program design (e.g., program evaluation, 
   public policy, policy implementation, public 
   administration);
<p>
 --the development of a comprehensive taxonomy 
   of existing federal programs to highlight the 
   important structural differences and similarities 
   across the government;
<p>
 --the identification of the different design 
   approaches (i.e., tools and modalities) used in 
   federal programs to serve the public;
<p>
 --an assessment of the comparative advantages 
   of various program designs under different 
   circumstances across several federal agencies;
<p>
 --a compilation of analyses of representative 
   case studies that illustrate the consequences of 
   superior and inferior program designs; and 
<p>
 --the creation of model designs for each 
   program type (e.g., grants, loans, insurance, 
   regulatory mandates, tax preferences).
<p>
 This initiative should be completed on an expedited 
 basis with the first products to be delivered within 
 one year and the final products delivered no later 
 than three years. This project would be funded 
 through the National Science Foundation. External 
 participants in this effort should include 
 established sources of relevant expertise such as the 
 National Academy of Public Administration, the 
 Brookings Institution, universities, and other public 
 policy analysis organizations.
<p>
 A governmentwide conference on program design could 
 jump start the development of program design by 
 convening agency representatives, congressional 
 staffers, state and local constituencies, academics, 
 and other policy experts. The conference would have 
 three objectives:
<p>
 --survey the extent and quality of existing 
   program design knowledge;
<p>
 --identify specific opportunities for 
   education and research; and
<p>
 --develop a blueprint for a decade-long, 
   governmentwide training strategy.

 the criteria and the technology used in successful 
 design should be developed more fully throughout the 
 federal government. The following are recommendations

<p>
<HR>
<p>
<H2> DES02: Establish Pilot Program Design Capabilities in 
One or Two Agencies</H2>
 <p>
 After development of the handbook, the PMC should 
 designate one or two agencies to pilot test program 
 design capability to determine the value and costs of 
 this function for a reasonable probationary period 
 such as two years. For example, these pilots could 
 establish a modest program design office in each 
 agency staffed by personnel qualified in program 
 design, management, and evaluation. The purpose of 
 these offices would be to help senior officials 
 design new programs, assess alternate program 
 designs, and review existing programs for design 
 integrity. Other mechanisms and structures for 
 creating program design capability would be 
 permissible. Where those pilots prove successful, 
 program design capabilities would be expanded to 
 other agencies on an incremental basis. However, if 
 they fail to meet predetermined performance criteria, 
 the pilots would be restructured or terminated.
<p>
 The long-term ideal for institutionalizing sound 
 program design is the integration of good design 
 practices in the program formulation and management 
 processes organic to each agency and department. The 
 most significant advantage to establishing program 
 design functions at the agency level is that it 
 brings program design capabilities closer to the 
 customers and program managers. If reinventing 
 government is to be successful, there must be a 
 comprehensive cultural change in the agencies. The 
 placement of the program design function at the 
 agency level should help to facilitate cultural 
 change where many program designs originate and where 
 programs are implemented.
<p>
 A principal disadvantage of this approach is that the 
 design staffs may be unduly constrained and 
 influenced by their immediate environments. They may 
 find it difficult to elevate their perspectives to a 
 higher plane that would foster fresh, creative 
 approaches to the design of agency programs. Also, 
 innovative inter-agency opportunities may be harder 
 to conceive and implement if the program design 
 function is totally embedded within a single agency. 
 However, the pilot demonstrations should indicate if 
 this is an insurmountable handicap or if feasible 
 remedies are available.
<p>
 All agencies should be encouraged to test program 
 design principles in their reinvention laboratories. 
 Principles could be applied to either an existing 
 program or to the design of a new program. The 
 reinvention laboratory would provide a protected 
 setting in which to examine the possibility of 
 improved outcomes based on improved design features. 
 Some agencies (e.g., Interior) have emulated the 
 National Performance Review structure and have 
 program design teams. The agency team can provide 
 advice and assistance to the laboratory regarding the 
 proper use of design principles and the evaluation of 
 success or failure.

   next action (DES04).
<p>
 Many, if not most, federal programs originate in 
 Congress. Yet program design as a concept or a 
 function is given scant attention there. Among the 
 offices that participate in the preparation of 
 legislation, varying degrees of emphasis are placed 
 on program design. And there is no general, 
 consistent pattern of the use of these offices. The 
 principal drafters of legislation--the Offices of the 
 Legislative Counsel of the Senate and the House--
 while they do not make program policy, generally do 
 provide a legal framework and historical context that 
 provide a basis for the program design process. CRS, 
 GAO, and CBO often play significant roles in 
 providing analyses and information used to prepare 
 legislation and in reviewing and shaping draft 
 legislation, and thus contribute to program design. 
<p>
 CBO's role is generally limited to analysis of the 
 fiscal implications of proposed legislation. 
 Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and efficiency of a 
 proposed program as well as its financial viability 
 might be an appropriate expansion of the traditional 
 CBO role. CRS also offers extensive training programs 
 and provides research materials to congressional 
 staff on a wide range of subjects, many of which 
 could have significant program design implications. 
 If all these offices were able and willing to provide 
 expert advice on program design, members and staff of 
 Congress would be better equipped to apply the 
 recommended program design criteria. 
<p>
 Strengthening program design capabilities and 
 encouraging greater use of available resources in the 
 legislative branch would not only improve program 
 design, it would also enhance the formulation of 
 programs by framing the debates which occur on and 
 off the floors of both Houses. Ideally, the 
 individuals developing program design in Congress 
 would cooperate on the design of new programs as well 
 as share expertise concerning tools of public action 
 and obstacles to solid program design. This 
 cooperation would also be extended by congressional 
 offices and staff to the executive branch at the 
 agency level and to the Executive Office of the 
 President and could perhaps reduce some of the 
 traditional friction between these two branches of 
 government.[Endnote 2]

<H2>Improving Program Design</H2>
<p>
Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<p>
 What Can be Done to Develop and Promulgate Program 
 Design? 
 <p>
 Program design criteria are merely the foundation for 
 more efficient and effective federal programs. To 
 establish a credible discipline of program design, 
 the criteria and the technology used in successful 
 design should be developed more fully throughout the 
 federal government. The following are recommendations 
 for developing a formal discipline of program design.
 <p>
<H2> DES04: Commission Program Design Courses</H2>
<p>
 In conjunction with its sponsorship of research and 
 development on program design, the President's 
 Management Council should commission the development 
 of a family of program design courses to educate and 
 train several generations of current and future 
 policymakers, program designers, and managers. If 
 informed, reasoned program design is to flourish 
 throughout the federal government, training and 
 education will be important factors in that 
 evolution. Given the wide variation in design 
 knowledge and needs across government, a multitiered 
 approach to education would be superior to a single 
 course of instruction for everyone. A comprehensive 
 education strategy for program design might include:
<p>
 --a series of short seminars (1-3 days), each 
   focused on a particular mode of public service 
   delivery such as federal subsidies, tax incentives, 
   voucher systems, government sponsored 
   enterprises/corporations, privatization of services, 
   loan guarantees, regulatory initiatives, etc. The 
   target audience for such courses would be agency 
   program specialists (GS 12-15), congressional 
   staffers, budget examiners, and auditors who have 
   need for in-depth knowledge of a specific type of 
   program design and its strengths and weaknesses. 
   These seminars could be disseminated through agency 
   training programs, the Office of Personnel 
   Management's (OPM) executive development centers, the 
   Department of Agriculture Graduate School, and 
   commercial/non-profit institutions such as the 
   Brookings Institute, National Academy of Public 
   Administration, the Congressional Management 
   Foundation, etc.;
<p>
 --a longer residential course (5-10 days) 
   which would provide a comprehensive overview of 
   program design covering several different design 
   modes comparing the relative advantages and 
   disadvantages of each. The target audience for this 
   course would be program generalists or senior 
   government policymakers who require broader exposure 
   across a variety of programs. This course could be 
   available through the Federal Executive Institute, 
   the Federal Quality Institute, nonprofit 
   organizations, and/or academic institutions;
<p>
 --introduction of program design subjects 
   into existing management development programs such as 
   agency executive development courses, OPM seminars, 
   senior military schools, and Senior Executive Service 
   candidate development programs; and
<p>
 --a variety of academic offerings at graduate 
   schools of public administration, public policy, 
   government, and political science. To reach future 
   generations of public servants, the design of 
   government programs should be taught in graduate 
   curricula. If visible academic institutions were to 
   include program design courses as academic electives 
   or requirements, future civil servants would be 
   better educated and vigorous research may begin to 
   emerge as faculty and graduate students collect, 
   synthesize, and create material for their courses.
<p>
 Schools of public policy and administration should 
 heed the advice of Professor Herbert Simon, Nobel 
 Laureate in Economics, who suggested a more active 
 role for universities in teaching design:
<p>
 The professional schools will reassume their 
 professional responsibilities just to the degree that 
 they can discover a science of design, a body of 
 intellectually tough, analytic, partly formalizable, 
 partly empirical, teachable doctrine about the design 
 process . . . [S]uch a science of design [is] not 
 only possible but is actually emerging at the present 
 time. It has already begun to penetrate the 
 engineering schools, particularly through programs in 
 computer science and "systems engineering," and 
 business schools through management science. [Endnote 3]

<Title>Streamlining Management Control</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Streamlining Management Control</H2>
<P>
Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2> Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
 At times, the federal government's management control system 
 resembles a theater of the absurd. Until 1985, for instance, Congress 
 required the Secretary of Education to report biennially about the 
 Office of Education Professional Development, even though that office 
 closed in 1981. Such overkill, however, is not limited to the 
 Education Department--not by a long shot. With a staff of about 300, 
 the Merit Systems Protection Board must produce 70 congressionally 
 mandated reports this year. It gave the job to 4.2 full-time 
 employees, at an estimated cost of $257,121.(1)
<p>
 There is no control over the controls: 
<p>
 --- One agency requires 23 signatures to purchase a single personal 
 computer.
<p>
 --- Another agency routes routine responses to congressional 
 inquiries through nearly two dozen offices for approval.
<p>
 --- Nearly 890 laws govern the Defense Department's efforts to 
 purchase items.
<p>
 --- The Agriculture Department uses over 1,088 pounds of federal 
 personnel laws, regulations, directives, case laws, and departmental 
 guidance to make personnel decisions.
<p>
 --- In one Interior Department regional office, over 33,000 pages of 
 internal regulations and handbooks are used to govern fewer than 200 
 employees. 
<p>
 --- For one mid-size agency--the National Aeronautics and Space 
 Administration--over 130 audits of the agency were performed this 
 past year by outside groups such as the General Accounting Office and 
 the Merit Systems Protection Board.
<p>
 
<b> Management Control System is Vast</b>
<p>
 In their totality, the federal government's management control 
 methods are vast, complex, and very expensive. The primary 
 responsibility of approximately one in three federal employees is to 
 exert control over the other two-thirds and non-federal grantees and 
 contractors. The system includes about 280,000 formally designated 
 supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control 
 functions, costing billions of dollars. Another nearly 267,000 people 
 in internal staff positions--including legal, personnel, procurement, 
 budget, and financial management staff--also spend a large portion of 
 their time performing control functions.
<p>
 Moreover, these staffs have increased relative to the government's 
 overall work force. Although executive branch personnel grew only 7 
 percent in the decade after 1980, the number of employees in the 
 personnel function increased 11 percent, the number in financial 
 management increased 27 percent, and the number in procurement 
 increased an amazing 60 percent.
<p>
 Meanwhile, the federal government is awash in watchdog organizations-
 -the General Accounting Office, Office of Personnel Management, 
 Office of Management and Budget, General Services Administration, 
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Office of Government Ethics, 
 offices of general counsel, and Offices of Inspector General--
 totalling about 36,000 employees.(2) The presence of these watchdogs 
 results in each agency maintaining an internal staff dedicated to 
 coordinating and tracking their reviews. Together they cost taxpayers 
 billions to guard against the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse. 
 Line managers and employees expend still more staff time providing 
 data and information to these reviewers. In addition to these 
 reviews, Congress conducts oversight by holding hundreds of hearings 
 and requiring about 5,000 written reports a year.
<p>
 How much, in its entirety, does the federal government's management 
 control system cost? Since government accounting systems do not track 
 the costs of controls, no one can say precisely. However, the 
 salaries and benefits of associated staff--one in three federal 
 employees--is estimated to total about $35 billion a year. (3)
<p>
 
<b> A Prime Target for Reinvention</b>
<p>
 Given that management control is essentially overhead--i.e., it does 
 not produce government services--it is a prime candidate for big 
 improvements. The trick, of course, is not to eliminate all controls, 
 especially during a period of change.(4) Organizations need controls 
 to ensure that they are achieving missions and goals within the 
 boundaries of laws, regulations, and officially agreed-upon behavior. 
 Besides, potentially major problems remain. "Are there other HUDs 
 today?" the Assistant Comptroller General for Accounting and 
 Financial Management rhetorically asked Congress not long ago, 
 referring to the Housing and Urban Development Department's recent 
 management scandals. "Unfortunately, I believe there are."(5)
<p>
 The challenge, then, is to devise control systems that are useful, 
 not overbearing. They must help the government achieve the results 
 that it desires--not stand in the way, as they currently do. And they 
 must help enhance the public's confidence that its tax dollars are 
 being spent wisely.
<p>
 Interestingly, as the federal government's management control systems 
 expanded, public confidence dropped. These controls, meanwhile, have 
 not been sufficient to prevent some of our worst management scandals-
 -with savings and loan institutions, and at HUD and the Defense 
 Department.
<p>
 In any organization, all members exercise some control over 
 operations. Generally, "control" refers to monitoring work to ensure 
 its quality.(6) Monitoring, in turn, requires feedback to assess 
 progress and outcomes. While all employees have some control 
 responsibilities, leaders, managers, and supervisors have the 
 broadest responsibilities over their process and organizational 
 units. 
<p>
 
<b>Making Controls Customer-Focused</b>
<p>
 Currently, increasing numbers of successful private and public 
 organizations recognize that a management control system must support 
 their efforts to become more customer-focused. These organizations 
 operate according to a management strategy of continual improvement, 
 rather than meeting minimum specifications. They define "improvement" 
 as innovation in a product or service, producing more than minimum 
 requirements or specifications, and eliminating waste. The consumer 
 product revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, initially driven by the 
 Japanese, showed Americans that they, indeed, could have better 
 products that cost less.
<p>
 Clearly, the federal government must also do more with less. Thus, it 
 must redesign its approach to management control, consistent with a 
 focus on customers and quality. Specifically, it must develop a new 
 strategy that lets it anticipate, meet, and even exceed its 
 customers' needs and expectations. This new strategy requires a 
 careful assessment of how the government currently operates, so it 
 can distinguish useful processes from those adding no value to 
 products or services.
<p>
 
<b> Characteristics of the Existing System</b>
<p>
 Two requirements govern the role of "management control" in the 
 executive branch: Specified outcomes must be achieved as effectively 
 and efficiently as possible; and work must follow the dictates of 
 laws, regulations, and agreed-upon behavior. Three types of people 
 perform control functions: employees, line managers (supervisors, 
 program managers, agency heads, the President), and staff (e.g., 
 Offices of Inspectors General (OIG's), personnel offices, legal 
 offices).
<p>
 This report focuses primarily on broad controls used by staff 
 functions--largely those controls that affect the culture within the 
 bureaucracy. Other accompanying reports of the National Performance 
 Review address related aspects of management control, such as staff 
 controls within specific functions (e.g., personnel) and controls 
 used by line managers, such as front-line supervisors.
<p>
 Management control in the federal government has five general 
 characteristics:
<p>
 --- It is primarily based on problem detection rather than problem 
 prevention.
<p>
 --- It is increasingly performed by staff functions, such as OIG's, 
 personnel staffs, budget staffs, and procurement staffs, in addition 
 to or instead of line management.
<p>
 --- The methods used to inspect, review, audit, investigate, 
 evaluate, monitor, and appraise federal programs and employees focus 
 mainly on negative aspects of control--namely, detecting waste, 
 fraud, and abuse.
<p>
 --- It emphasizes compliance monitoring--ensuring rules are followed-
 -more than it does ensuring outcomes are achieved or customer needs 
 are met.
<p>
 --- Its methods were created at different times, and for different 
 purposes--they were not developed as a whole--thus producing a 
 piecemeal, confusing approach to management control in general.
<p>
 The government's over-reliance on compliance monitoring and negative 
 feedback has stifled improvement and innovation--at the expense of 
 program customers. Altogether, the federal government has created a 
 managerial culture that is reactive and oriented toward maintaining 
 the status quo. The present system needs more than an oil change. It 
 must be streamlined and reengineered, not only in its methods but 
 also its focus, values, and culture.
<p>
 
<b> Direction for Change</b>
<p>
 People on the line--employees and their immediate supervisors--should 
 perform most control and oversight. They should focus on continually 
 cutting waste, preventing problems, making improvements, and 
 innovating. External staff organizations--such as the General 
 Accounting Office, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Equal 
 Opportunity Employment Commission--should recast their roles to 
 support line managers by providing information on "best practices" 
 and assessing these managers' oversight activities, not performing 
 the activities themselves. 
<p>
 If the federal government has long had a disjointed approach to 
 management control, why does it remain in such disarray? Primarily, 
 because the executive branch's interest in sound leadership and 
 strategic management has lacked consistency. In addition, the 
 executive branch and Congress have tended to react hastily to the 
 whims of the press and public opinion, imposing broad solutions to 
 isolated problems. Over several administrations, the executive 
 branch's abdication of the fundamental responsibility to manage 
 effectively has encouraged incomprehensible, fragmented, incredibly 
 costly management control.
<p>
 The worldwide quality movement clearly shows that control systems 
 with minimal layers and clear roles and responsibilities are far 
 superior to over-control.(7) A system with multiple layers of 
 supervision, inspection, and other forms of "checking," existing 
 simultaneously in both line management and staff support offices, 
 ironically produces less control and very high costs. Those 
 responsible for oversight assume that others with the same roles are 
 performing their functions thoroughly. At the same time, those 
 receiving multiple versions of guidance from multiple groups grow 
 confused about what's expected and important. As a result, 
 accountability for achieving results is lost.
<p>
 
<b> Recommendations</b>
<p>
 This report recommends how to both pare back the old and create the 
 new. Its recommendations fall into three general categories: (1) 
 taking a systematic approach; (2) improving internal control; and (3) 
 improving external control.
<p>
<b> Become Systematic.</b>
<p>
 The President's Management Council should develop a comprehensive 
 vision of a streamlined management control system for the executive 
 branch. This new system would strengthen the role of line management, 
 emphasize rewarding improvements and reducing waste, use appropriate 
 measures of performance and feedback loops, and make sure the methods 
 complement one another rather than overlap or contradict one another. 
 This reinvented system will improve control and, at the same time, 
 save billions of dollars a year.
<p>
<b> Improve Internal Control. </b>
<p>
 The federal government's Internal Controls program--established to 
 implement the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982--must 
 become a useful tool for line managers. Such an approach will be 
 launched via a new version of OMB Circular A-123, "Internal Control 
 Systems," which creates the framework for complying with the Act.
<p>
 In addition, the role of agencies' Offices of General Counsel (OGC) 
 must be clarified so that they can better help their agencies achieve 
 their missions. This requires defining who the OGC staffs' clients 
 are, creating incentives and better performance measures to tie OGC 
 staff performance more directly to mission achievement, and creating 
 "feedback loops" from agency line managers to OGC's to help them 
 better serve their customers.
<p>
 Also, internal regulations must be cut substantially. The amount of 
 detailed rules and regulations on the books nourishes our compliance-
 oriented culture. By cutting internal rules and regulations by at 
 least half within the next three years, the government would save 
 much time and money directly and help create an atmosphere that 
 encourages improvement and innovation.
<p>
 Finally, the expanded use of waivers would encourage innovation and 
 more appropriate use of resources in accomplishing a program's goals. 
 Waivers would allow federal, state, or local organizations to gain 
 exceptions to how they execute laws, rules, or regulations, 
 especially in cases when applying blanket rules makes no sense.
<p>
<b> Reinvent External Controls.</b>
<p>
 Improving external controls must start with a new vision of the roles 
 and activities of Offices of Inspectors General (OIG's), which have 
 been a growing source of concern among line managers since their 
 establishment, beginning just over 15 years ago. The laws give these 
 offices great latitude, and the offices vary greatly in how they 
 conduct their business. Such differences raise fundamental questions 
 about what functions these offices should emphasize and how they 
 should execute them. Generally, OIGs should emphasize overseeing line 
 management's control systems more than their traditional role of 
 compliance monitoring. In addition, they should collaborate more with 
 line management, although not to the extent that this would destroy 
 OIGs' independence and objectivity.
<p>
 The General Accounting Office (GAO) could add to the progress it has 
 made through its formal quality management approach. Specifically, 
 GAO could better document the best practices it finds during audits 
 and create feedback loops with agencies to better assess and improve 
 the effectiveness of GAO's oversight.
<p>
 Finally, Congress should set a goal of eliminating at least half of 
 the 5,000 reports that it requires each year from the executive 
 branch. This action would save the government millions of dollars 
 each year and would help focus congressional oversight on the most 
 important areas.

<h2> SMC01:  Implement a Systems Design Approach to Management Control</h2>
<P>
 <b> Background</b>
<p>
 A striking characteristic of the federal government is its constant 
 struggle to control a conglomerate of agencies several times larger 
 than any existing holding corporation. It uses a labyrinth of 
 disjointed mechanisms--put in place by both the executive branch and 
 Congress--in an attempt to achieve control. The existing control 
 mechanisms were developed at different points in time, primarily as 
 individual reactions to specific problems. In aggregate, they were 
 patterned after corporate control structures of the Industrial Era in 
 the 1930s--large, centralized, top-down. These premises are no longer 
 appropriate in an Information Age environment of rapid change and 
 technology that makes information readily accessible to managers and 
 employees at many different levels in an organization. The existing 
 system provides the illusion of control. But in fact, these 
 mechanisms overlap, duplicate, confuse, and sometimes contradict each 
 other. Even a cursory look at the federal approach to management 
 reveals an overly layered and poorly coordinated set of controls 
 characterized by ambiguity and often focused on unimportant things. 
 And its cost is enormous--one estimate places it conservatively at 
 $35 billion a year. As a result, the existing system steals precious 
 resources from the real job of government: serving the customer.
<p>
<b> Line Versus Staff Controls.</b>
<p> 
 Control in the federal government is exerted by two groups--line 
 management and staff offices. Line management, or "line control," is 
 exercised by each agency's program offices, such as the managers in a 
 local Social Security office. Typically, line managers monitor 
 performance and appraise their employees, and they write procedures 
 and ensure they are complied with. They also conduct formal program 
 evaluations, and they develop internal controls. Oversight of line 
 managers is performed by management levels above the program office 
 within the agency, such as a regional Social Security office. 
<p>
 The sum total of line management control and oversight is very large 
 and, many believe, overdone. There are over 278,000 supervisors and 
 managers in the federal government--about 1 in 7 federal employees. 
 This has contributed to horror stories of over-management; for 
 example, the lengthy "chop chains" for sending an official letter, 
 entailing as many as 10 or 15 formal check points, any one of which 
 can change the contents. The result: A simple letter may take months 
 to get sent.
<p>
 Staff offices, on the other hand, can be both internal or external to 
 an organization. "Internal" staff offices exert control in at least 
 two ways--granting permission to act or second-guessing decisions. 
 The first, granting permission to act, would include actions such as 
 the general counsel staff saying that a proposed action is legal; a 
 procurement office awarding a contract; or a personnel office 
 classifying a job at a certain grade level. Staff control can also be 
 exerted through second-guessing, or "oversight," which usually is a 
 formal assessment of compliance with rules. Most internal staff 
 oversight is conducted by program evaluation offices, the procurement 
 office, the personnel office, and financial managers. Oversight 
 methods include investigations, audits, reviews, evaluations, and 
 inspections.
<p>
 A variety of "external" organizations also have a direct or indirect 
 role in staff oversight. These include Congress, the General 
 Accounting Office (GAO), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services 
 Administration (GSA), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
 (EEOC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Merit Systems 
 Protection Board (MSPB), the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), and 
 the Offices of Inspectors General (OIG's). Currently, over 36,000 
 federal employees--not including Congress--conduct "external" 
 oversight (see Appendix B for an illustrative listing of most of 
 these staff organizations).
<p>
<b> Control functions grew faster than other functions. </b>
<p>
 Over the past decade, control functions grew faster than the 
 executive branch as a whole. While executive branch personnel grew 
 seven percent between 1980 and 1990-91, employment in the personnel 
 function increased 11 percent. In financial management, the increase 
 was 27 percent and, in procurement, it jumped 60 percent. (See figure 
 1.)
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 Despite the fact that billions are spent on control, the public still 
 considers waste, fraud, and abuse to run rampant in the federal 
 government. The average American believes the government wastes 48 
 percent of every tax dollar.(1) Ironically, a contributing factor is 
 the existing system of fragmented controls. A lack of accountability 
 and the inappropriate focus of existing controls contribute to, 
 rather than erase, this perception.
<p>
 There are models of effective control systems. The worldwide quality 
 movement clearly has proven that control systems with minimal layers 
 and clear roles and responsibilities are far superior to the federal 
 government's system of over-control.(2) In contrast, a control system 
 with multiple layers of supervision, inspection, and other forms of 
 "checking," existing simultaneously in both line management and staff 
 support offices, results in less control and very high costs. Over-
 control results in less control because those responsible for 
 oversight assume that others also responsible for oversight are 
 performing their functions thoroughly. However, in reality, multiple 
 versions of guidance from multiple groups diffuses accountability and 
 confuses line staffs about what is expected and important.
<p>
 Fragmented Controls Contribute to an Ambiguity of Responsibility. 
 With so many roles to be played and so many individuals and 
 organizations involved, overlap and confusion of responsibilities has 
 grown. Many strongly differing points of view exist about what roles 
 these groups do play and should play. Clear roles and focus are 
 needed. One premise is that, because line management's own oversight 
 has been allowed to atrophy, staff groups have had to assume these 
 functions. For example, a few Inspectors General now have inspection 
 offices in addition to their standard audit and investigation 
 offices. These inspection offices vary widely in purpose, staffing, 
 and operations, but they do have some common features. They 
 concentrate on shorter-term studies, producing more timely results. 
 These reviews range from quick responses to congressional inquiries, 
 to on-site management reviews, to in-depth evaluations of program 
 practices. These latter evaluations concentrate on program 
 effectiveness and efficiency (how well and at what cost programs are 
 achieving their objectives) and program integrity (how well programs 
 are protected from wrongdoing). GAO on occasion has conducted the 
 same kinds of evaluations, sometimes for the same reasons.
<p>
 Lamentably, this activity by some parts of the audit community 
 reflects the type of program evaluations some managers believe line 
 management should be conducting internally. It is better in the long 
 term to insist that line managers properly execute their control and 
 oversight functions. To foster this, external overseers should 
 reorient their focus to evaluating the effectiveness of the control 
 and oversight systems put in place by management.
<p>
<b> Inappropriate Focus. </b>
<p>
 Most staff controls are focused on "before the fact" control 
 mechanisms on inputs, such as controls over outlay budgets and 
 staffing levels, and compliance with rules. Most high-performing 
 organizations have shifted their focus to "after the fact" controls 
 on outcomes, such as results-oriented budgets and performance 
 measures. Studies of organizations that have made the shift show 
 decreases in the costs of delivering services, largely because of the 
 ability to reduce the cost of the control systems. While there are 
 some organizations where "before the fact" controls may be 
 appropriate, there are many where a change in approach can improve 
 services and cut costs.(3)
<p>
<b> Costs of This Approach to Control are Too High. </b>
<p>
 The existing management controls system swallows untold millions of 
 staff hours and requires an estimated 660,000 "control" employees at 
 a cost of approximately $35 billion dollars. This estimate includes 
 all line and staff managers and employees performing appraisals, 
 audits, reviews, investigations, evaluations, inspections, and 
 monitoring.(4) It does not include the costs imposed on those that 
 are being appraised, audited, reviewed, investigated, evaluated, 
 inspected, or monitored.
<p>
 There is no upper limit imposed on how much "management control" is 
 imposed on a given organizational unit or program. Formal audits, 
 reviews, investigations, and inspections in a single governmental 
 organization can easily total hundreds per year and can be initiated 
 at any hierarchical level in the system, from Congress, the central 
 management agencies, or a department headquarters on down. And there 
 are no accounting systems to adequately document these costs. 
 Notably, no one is assigned responsibility for controlling these 
 costs or ensuring these resources are being spent wisely. There is no 
 control over the controls.
<p>
 There is an alternative that seems to have proven successful in the 
 private sector. The quality management approach--which focuses on 
 preventive actions and results-oriented measures (e.g., customer 
 satisfaction) --can provide a systematic framework for gaining 
 control over the controls. It can help sort out the proper functions 
 of doing vs. monitoring work, of line vs. staff, of internal vs. 
 external control, and of the use of inspection vs. prevention 
 methods.
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 Redesign the existing set of control mechanisms for the executive 
 branch, using a systems design approach. (2)
<p>
 The President's Management Council (PMC) should create a streamlined 
 and cost-effective management control system for the federal 
 government. It should begin by documenting the existing system of 
 requirements for control (laws, regulations, rules), classifying the 
 types of methods used (audit, reviews, evaluation), and identifying 
 who does them. It should then assess alternative approaches to use as 
 benchmarks and design a new vision of management control. The PMC 
 should then use this information to design a new, more cost-effective 
 system on behalf of the American taxpayers.
<p>
 The new management control system should reflect four 
 characteristics:
<p>
 1.     It should be based on systems thinking. Subsystems, such as 
 audits, inspections, investigations, reviews, appraisals, and 
 evaluations, are part of the overall management system. These 
 subsystems must be better defined and their interrelationships better 
 understood in order to eliminate costly redundancy and confusion over 
 accountability.
<p>
 2. Line managers must be accountable for, and have authority over, 
 management processes and systems. While this is an axiom in high-
 performing organizations, it is uncharacteristic of today's federal 
 government. The new management control system would:
<p>
 --- Have line management primarily responsible for management control 
 and be given the necessary resources to accomplish this (e.g., 
 program evaluation staff).
<p>
 --- Have staff organizations performing a secondary support role for 
 management control. Staff oversight would be minimized, though 
 sufficient to ensure that line managers perform their control 
 functions (i.e., by reviewing their control and improvement systems). 
 Staff should not normally perform control functions for line managers 
 (unless fraudulent activity is suspected).
<p>
 --- Shift the emphasis from compliance audits, performed by external 
 staff organizations, to ongoing reviews and monitoring performed by 
 line management. Oversight activities must be integral to line 
 management's overall management control system.
<p>
 3.     It should be based on trust, not mistrust. The current 
 approach to management control and staff oversight emphasizes the 
 negative, causing employees to resist management controls rather than 
 use them as guides for improving. Management in high-performing 
 organizations assumes that most people, under most circumstances, are 
 honest, well-intentioned, and eager to contribute to the 
 organization's goals. The small minority who are not well-intentioned 
 should be dealt with accordingly. The government's current approach 
 implies that all employees are suspect; this does not create an 
 atmosphere for constructive improvement.
<p>
 4.     It should be based on measurement and feedback. According to 
 private sector quality management experts, "The right measures are 
 critical to the effective management of work process. If you cannot 
 measure your results, then you cannot control your process and 
 improve your performance."(5) A key principle of measurement and 
 feedback is that people respond to what is measured. Redirecting 
 government from an emphasis on input measurement toward measurement 
 of outcomes, results, and customer satisfAction will be a major step 
 toward this objective.
<p>
 A second private sector measurement principle is based on the fact 
 that there is variation in all processes. As a result, managers must 
 properly analyze and interpret the meaning of their production 
 data.(6)
<p>
 The final measurement principle recognizes that waste is present in 
 all processes to varying degrees, but management and employees must 
 continually reduce waste.(7) Some Baldrige Quality Award winners have 
 succeeded in greatly reducing waste. For example, thanks to its "Six 
 Sigma Program," Motorola now has some manufacturing processes that 
 produce less than 3.2 defects per million potential defects.

<h2>SMC02:  Streamline the Internal Controls Program to Make it an 
 Efficient and Effective Management Tool
</h2>
<p>
 <b>Background</b>
<p>
 "Internal controls" are an integral part of any organization's basic 
 management processes. Internal controls ensure that organizational 
 missions are being met through effective and efficient means. They 
 are intended to protect an organization's resources and assets from 
 fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. The formal internal controls 
 program of the federal government consists of two parts: (1) the 
 design and implementation of internal controls, and (2) the review of 
 the adequacy of those internal controls.
<p>
 The traditional view of internal controls is rooted in financial 
 management and accounting. This view is being integrated into the 
 broader context of "management controls." This broader view has been 
 growing in acceptance in government circles since the late 1980s. 
 Internal management control techniques include policies, procedures, 
 and organizational plans, and physical arrangements.(1) These include 
 time clocks or sign-in sheets, computer password protections, and 
 required signatures to approve travel documents. Controls also 
 include the separation of duties--a form of checks and balances. 
 Effective internal management controls keep dishonest employees from 
 paying secretarial staff the amount due an executive; and they keep 
 Head Start grant money from being awarded to drug dealers.
<p>
<b> Financial Integrity Act. </b>
<p>
 Concern over inadequate management controls led Congress to enact the 
 Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) in 1982. The act 
 establishes a review process of internal accounting, administrative 
 controls, and accounting systems. Each agency must report annually to 
 the President and Congress on the condition of its management 
 controls and accounting systems, self-report "material control 
 weaknesses," and describe the Actions that will be taken to correct 
 the material weaknesses.(2) FMFIA requires the Office of Management 
 and Budget (OMB) to issue guidelines and the General Accounting 
 Office (GAO) to issue internal control standards.(3)
<p>
 OMB Circular A-123, "Internal Control Systems," implements FMFIA. It 
 requires agencies to segment their organizations and functions into 
 assessable units or components. Reviews of these components' 
 management controls are carried out through Risk Assessments, 
 Management Control Reviews, and Alternative Management Control 
 Reviews as prescribed by OMB. OMB's guidelines are intended to place 
 the responsibility with the line manager to assess the adequacy of 
 the management controls of his or her organizational component.
<p>
 Typically, however, small staffs in each agency have been dedicated 
 to monitoring the requirements of FMFIA and OMB Circular A-123. In 
 addition, GAO and Inspector General (IG) staffs selectively review 
 agencies' management controls. Therefore, the annual reports are a 
 combination of material control weaknesses that have been uncovered 
 by managers, management control staffs, GAO, and/or the IG.
<p>
<b> Action on Weaknesses. </b>
<p>
 According to OMB, since 1982, agencies have reported approximately 
 4,500 material weaknesses and corrected 3,855 of them. Currently, 645 
 material control weaknesses are pending.(4) Overall, the reports 
 indicated that the majority of the weaknesses had been disclosed by 
 IG or GAO staffs. Some agencies, such as the Department of Veteran's 
 Affairs, rely on IG staffs to disclose problems with management 
 controls. Others, such as the Department of Health and Human Services 
 (HHS), rely more heavily on management staff to disclose the 
 weaknesses. In 1992, the majority of HHS' material weaknesses had 
 been disclosed by line managers.(5)
<p>
 Some agencies have high-level management councils that assist the 
 agency head in determining which identified weaknesses should be 
 included in the annual report and in tracking the progress of 
 corrective Actions. In addition, the interagency Management Control 
 Coordinating Council exists to share information across agencies 
 regarding the implementation of FMFIA.
<p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 The Management Control Coordinating Council believes FMFIA has the 
 potential for being an early warning tool.(6) "Are there other HUDs 
 today?" the Assistant Comptroller General for Accounting and 
 Financial Management asked rhetorically in his 1990 testimony to 
 Congress. "Unfortunately, I believe there are," he continued.(7) For 
 this reason, the government needs a tool such as FMFIA to provide an 
 early warning of problems. However, FMFIA and OMB Circular A-123 have 
 not ensured that effective management controls were in place. As a 
 result, scandals occurred, wasting the taxpayers' dollars and eroding 
 their confidence. If proper management controls had been in place, or 
 if their ineffectiveness had been brought to the attention of high-
 level executives sooner, these debacles might not have occurred.(8)
<p>
 Agency heads must ensure internal management controls are in place 
 and must be sure that they are appropriate and effective. Too few or 
 inadequate management controls may exist in some instances. 
 Conversely, there can be too many management controls that are 
 counterproductive and not cost-effective because they are process-
 oriented, not results-oriented.(9) For example, to ensure that 
 employees are working the appropriate number of hours, management 
 sometimes asks employees to punch a time clock each day or sign in 
 and out on a time sheet. Would it not be more significant to show 
 that they have completed the required work at the required level of 
 quality?
<p>
<b> Current Approach is Hollow. </b>
<p>
 While management controls must be cost-effective, so should the 
 review of these controls. FMFIA and A-123 have been criticized 
 because they are seen as hollow, inflexible procedures. One agency 
 refers to FMFIA as "flim-flam." While many people interviewed 
 consider management controls as important tools to safeguard the 
 government's assets and resources, FMFIA generally is perceived as a 
 labor-intensive, paperwork-focused reporting requirement with little 
 positive results. It treats management controls as a separate, staff-
 run program, not an integral part of line management.
<p>
 Many agencies have developed their own techniques for fulfilling the 
 FMFIA requirement. Therefore, it is critical that OMB, through its 
 circular and guidelines, give agencies sufficient flexibility to 
 tailor their programs to their missions. However, the Internal 
 Control Guidelines, issued by OMB in 1982, have not been revised to 
 reflect the fact that many agencies' needs for management control 
 differ. They prefer to have the flexibility to develop their own 
 FMFIA programs, guided only by general policy, not detailed 
 prescriptive guidelines.
<p>
 Current Approach Does Not Make Line Managers Responsible. 
 A key to establishing a practice of reporting problems early is to 
 have those that sight the problems first--usually front-line 
 employees or line managers--reporting them. However, in general, 
 there is a lack of incentives for managers to report problems. Some 
 managers are concerned that sanctions will result from reporting 
 weaknesses.(10) In addition, some managers find that high-level 
 management is sometimes uninterested in correcting management control 
 problems(11) and that adequate resources are not available for 
 corrective Actions. And yet, management controls are an integral 
 function of effective management. Accountability for and the review 
 of management controls should be in the hands of the line 
 managers.(12) They need to explicitly be held responsible for 
 reporting these problems and resolving them promptly.
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>s
<p>
 1. Rewrite OMB Circular A-123, "Internal Control Systems," to be a 
 succinct document that defines the policy for establishing and 
 reviewing management controls. (2)
<p>
 OMB should rewrite--not revise--its Circular A-123 and should 
 incorporate the following concepts:
<p>
 --- Emphasize that management controls are more than financially 
 based.
<p>
 --- Emphasize reliance on line managers to incorporate management 
 controls into their regular operating practices and strategic plans.
<p>
 --- Emphasize managers' accountability for results. Are the 
 management controls appropriate and adequate? Do they help attain the 
 desired results of programs? Are customer needs being met? Are 
 resources and assets being used most efficiently?
<p>
 --- Encourage the use of a cross-functional (program and staff) 
 management council at all executive branch agencies. Include in its 
 responsibilities the review of management controls in terms of 
 operating practices as a whole and in the context of strategic and 
 quality management. These management councils should have a 
 membership that represents both line and staff management and should 
 include access to an information technology specialist(s).(13)
<p>
 --- Promote a role for auditors (IGs, GAO, FMFIA staffs) that is 
 secondary to but supportive of the line managers. Auditors should 
 review the agencies' processes for reviewing and implementing 
 management controls.
<p>
 --- Promote FMFIA as primarily a management tool to be used within 
 agencies--for identifying management control concerns and initiating 
 corrective Actions--and not solely as an external reporting process.
<p>
 --- Encourage agencies to include management information systems 
 experts in the development of management control systems.
<p>
 --- Promote the use of the FMFIA review process as an early warning 
 tool(14) to identify problems or "management control improvement 
 areas" long before they create wasteful practices.
<p>
 This new A-123 will set the direction for management controls and 
 their review and allow agencies to develop the flexibility to develop 
 their own system for management controls. Given the existence of 
 GAO's "Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government," 
 the OMB circular should be policy oriented.
<p>
 FMFIA--recast as a tool for line managers to ensure that adequate and 
 reasonable management controls are in place--should deemphasize the 
 role of outside auditors. OMB should convey to agencies that the 
 FMFIA annual report is not an end in itself--it is a tool to identify 
 management concerns and bring them to the attention of high-level 
 management. 
<p>
 
<p>
 2. Replace OMB's existing Internal Control Guidelines with a handbook 
 on management controls. (2)
<p>
 OMB, the President's Council on Management Improvement, and the 
 interagency Management Control Coordinating Council should jointly 
 develop a handbook on management controls to replace the Internal 
 Control Guidelines last issued by OMB in 1982.
<p>
 The new handbook would focus on the implementation of effective 
 management controls and not on cumbersome reporting requirements. It 
 should include:
<p>
 --- definitions of key items (e.g. material weaknesses, high risk, 
 management controls) as defined by those agencies identified as 
 having "best practices;" 
<p>
 --- identification of effective agency management control councils, 
 based on "best practices";
<p>
 --- examples of how to redirect resources to correct potential 
 weaknesses before they become real problems;
<p>
 --- examples of effective early warning systems;
<p>
 --- examples of combined review and reporting requirements; and
<p>
 --- names of individuals who are willing to provide training and 
 technical assistance.
<p>
 The handbook should be updated periodically through supplements or 
 complete revisions.
<p>
 
<p>
 3.     Revise government-sponsored management training to teach 
 management control as an integral function of management, not as a 
 reporting requirement. (1,2)
<p>
 Much of the training on management controls--by OPM and the agencies-
 -has been geared toward the reporting and review requirements of 
 FMFIA, not the significance of management controls as a management 
 tool. The role of management controls, and the techniques by which 
 managers ensure that resources are being properly used, must be a 
 normal part of all federal managers' training.

 " is one that: significantly impairs the mission of an agency or 
 component; deprives the public of needed services; violates statutory 
 or regulatory requirements; significantly weakens safeguards against 
 waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation of funds, 
 property, or other assets; or results in a conflict of interest. A 
 material control weakness should also: merit the attention of the 
 agency head/senior management, the Executive Office of the President, 
 and Congress; and/or exist in a majority of agency components or in a 
 major agency program or activity; and/or risk or result in the actual 
 loss of either $10 million or 5 percent of the resources of a budget 
 line item; and/or reflect adversely on the credibility of the agency 
 when reported to the public.
<p>
 3. The implementation of FMFIA is guided by OMB Circular A-123 
 "Internal Control Systems" (revised in 1986), OMB's "Internal Control 
 Guidelines" (issued in 1982), OMB's annual guidance, and GAO's 
 "Standards For Internal Controls In The Federal Government" (issued 
 in 1983). Many agencies have also developed handbooks.

<h2> SMC03:  Change the Focus of the Inspectors General
</h2>
<p>
  <b>Background</b>
<p>
 Congress established the Offices of Inspectors General (OIG's) in 
 response to growing public concern over fraud, waste, and abuse in 
 the federal government. Inspector General (IG) offices were organized 
 to perform external oversight of federal programs and operations. The 
 Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act) and subsequent amendments 
 require IG's to promote the efficiency, economy, and integrity of 
 federal programs. Audits and investigations attempt to identify 
 fraud, waste, and abuse, in part, by focusing on compliance with 
 requirements--i.e., by focusing on whether program offices, federal 
 employees, grantees, contractors, and others connected to the 
 government conform to laws and regulations. The FY 1994 President's 
 budget provided budget authority of $1.3 billion and staffing of over 
 15,000 staff years for IG's.(1)
<p>
 The IG community is diverse but closely knit. In 1981, the 
 President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was 
 established to encourage cross-communication among the 26 
 presidentially-appointed IG's. The Council is composed of the 26 IG's 
 and the Deputy Director for Management from the Office of Management 
 and Budget. The Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency was 
 established later for the 34 non-presidentially-appointed IG's for 
 the same purpose.
<p>
<b> An Evolving Role. </b>
<p>
 Many IG's place a major emphasis on monitoring agency compliance with 
 laws and regulatory requirements; however, no common vision exists 
 across all sixty OIG's.(2) While all perform compliance audits and 
 investigations, many also review annual financial statements of 
 agencies, and some have branched off into new areas, such as program 
 evaluation and collaborative program assessments.
<p>
 The IG Act requires that compliance audits meet the financial and 
 performance auditing standards established by the Comptroller General 
 of the United States. A financial audit determines whether financial 
 reports and related items are accurately presented according to 
 established and specific financial compliance requirements.(3) 
 Performance audits include both "economy and efficiency" and 
 "program" audits. Economy and efficiency audits determine whether the 
 entity is acquiring, protecting, and using its resources economically 
 and efficiently. In addition, economy and efficiency audits pinpoint 
 the causes of inefficiencies or uneconomical practices and whether 
 the entity complied with laws and regulations controlling economy and 
 efficiency. Program audits are intended to assess program 
 accomplishments and compare them to intended results or benefits; the 
 effectiveness of organizations, programs, activities, or functions; 
 and the compliance of an entity with applicable laws and 
 regulations.(4) The IG's submit their findings in audit reports to 
 their agency heads, investigative reports to U.S. Attorneys, and 
 semi-annual reports to Congress summarizing both audit and 
 investigative findings.(5) Many of NPR's agency recommendations were 
 initially found in these IG reports. IG work is initiated through 
 statute, legislative direction, agency head requests, input from line 
 managers, agency employees, and the IG offices themselves.(6)
<p>
 A few IG's have moved beyond compliance monitoring to develop more 
 collaborative, results-oriented relationships with management. For 
 example, the OIG at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
 established an office of evaluation and inspections that has 
 developed award-winning program evaluation expertise.(7) The HHS OIG 
 conducts "program inspections" using methods drawn from several 
 disciplines, including traditional program evaluations, policy 
 analyses, fiscal audits, program monitoring, compliance reviews, 
 investigations, and management analysis. 
<p>
 
<b> Need for Change</b>
<p>
 The majority of IG program audits focus on areas of non-compliance 
 with rules and regulations. As required by the IG Act, the IG's 
 report dollars recovered or better used based on these audits, and 
 the number of convictions obtained as a result of IG criminal 
 investigations, in semiannual reports to Congress. These reporting 
 requirements, along with previous administrations' requests for this 
 type of information, have encouraged the OIG's to allocate more 
 resources to audits that resulted in reports of non-compliance with 
 process requirements.(8)
<p>
 These compliance audits seek to foster program integrity by 
 identifying areas of non-compliance with statutes and policy, and by 
 using negative sanctions, sometimes targeted at individuals.(9) 
 However, audits that solely focus on compliance do not always foster 
 better government. They may, instead, spawn additional compliance 
 reviews and recommendations for more regulatory guidance, followed by 
 still more process regulations with which to be in non-compliance.
<p>
<b> Adversarial Relationships.</B>
<p> 
 Federal employees at several town meetings with the Vice President 
 voiced their beliefs that existing IG operations often create an 
 institutional culture that discourages entrepreneurship and 
 innovation due to excessive emphasis on compliance. Because the IG's' 
 audit work generally focuses on what is wrong, rather than creating a 
 balanced assessment of program results, agency personnel are often 
 reluctant to fully cooperate with IG staff for fear of being 
 implicated in wrongdoing.(10) As a consequence, IG's sometimes 
 reinforce rules at the expense of innovation and program 
 effectiveness.
<p>
<b> Shift in Focus Needed. </B>
<p>
 The IG's need to shift their focus in three aspects. First, IG's 
 should shift their strategic focus from conducting compliance reviews 
 to conducting evaluations of the effectiveness of the internal 
 control systems used by managers. For program management to be more 
 effective and accountable, managers must learn to self-monitor. 
 According to Dwight Ink, the president of the Institute of Public 
 Administration,
<p>
 . . . a serious problem occurs where agency management no longer has 
 auditors under its control because they have been all shifted to the 
 IG. In such cases, agency heads and program managers have lost much 
 of their capability to utilize auditors effectively in managing their 
 organizations. Consider for a moment the frustration and the 
 vulnerability of an agency head who wishes to look quickly at an 
 emerging financial problem, but has to wait until it has grown into a 
 scandal because the auditors are under someone else's control and 
 cannot help since they are too busy responding to a constituent 
 concern of a member of Congress.(11)
<p>
 Therefore, managers need to create their own capacity to audit 
 internal operations and ensure compliance--and not rely on the IG's 
 to do it for them.
<p>
 Second, IG's should see their mission as not only to identify 
 problems, but to get them solved. Too often IG recommendations are 
 based solely on IG staff judgments. In a number of a cases, these are 
 viewed as unreasonable by program staff and no action is taken. 
 Therefore, IG's need to build a collaborative, not adversarial, 
 relationship with the staffs being audited.
<p>
 And third, to maintain objectivity, IG recommendations must be viewed 
 by program management as being free from outside influence. One 
 impediment to objectivity is the appearance of a conflict-of-interest 
 when IG's accept bonuses from the heads of the agencies they oversee. 
 Of the 26 presidentially-appointed IG's, those from prior positions 
 in the Senior Executive Service are entitled to bonuses under the 
 Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. At least nine IG's accepted bonuses 
 between 1987 and 1989, which could call into question their 
 objectivity if called upon to investigate the agency heads who 
 approve the bonuses.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</B>
<p>
 1. Change the emphasis of IG's from compliance auditing to evaluating 
 management control systems. (1)
<p>
 IG's should shift their audit emphasis from ensuring compliance with 
 procedures to evaluating the effectiveness of line managers' own 
 systems of management control. By changing their emphasis, the IG's 
 will oversee the effectiveness of agency line management control 
 systems to ensure compliance with program requirements and efficient 
 and economical service delivery. The evaluations should:
<p>
 --- assess potential management, system, and service delivery 
 problems;
<p>
 --- analyze internal management evaluations for strengths and 
 weaknesses;
<p>
 --- identify alternative means of achieving results;
<p>
 --- test management controls to reduce unnecessary spending, improve 
 government purchasing, recover misspent funds, and detect areas 
 vulnerable to fraud and abuse; and
<p>
 --- identify unnecessary spending and ways to detect and prevent 
 fraud and abuse.
<p>
 Findings and recommendations should be limited to specific items 
 significant in terms of a review's objectives. Oversight reviews must 
 aim at one objective: timely, relevant, and accurate reports serving 
 as valuable management tools.
<p>
 Inspector General evaluations should not substitute for line 
 managers' own internal management program evaluations. Likewise, IG's 
 should not duplicate line management reviews. In agencies without 
 line management program evaluation capabilities, IG's could develop 
 this capability, possibly by shifting resources currently dedicated 
 to procedural compliance audits.(12)
<p>
 
 2. Change the IG's method of operation to be more collaborative and 
 less adversarial. (1)
<p>
 OIG's should conduct their reviews in a more collaborative manner 
 with line management. Together, they need to develop a relationship 
 built on trust. Government auditing standards strongly encourage a 
 collaborative approach between auditors and auditees. However, many 
 OIG's are burdened with a negative image because of their current 
 adversarial relationships with line management. Such a negative image 
 clearly indicates that some OIG staff either misinterpret the audit 
 standards or simply ignore them. Too often, some OIG staff fail to 
 give credit when credit is due, become obsessed with every 
 infraction, blind-side the auditees, or fail to distinguish between 
 the relevant and the insignificant. Together these practices lead 
 auditees to conclude that auditors simply mean to justify their own 
 existence rather than improve an auditee's program performance.
<p>
 This image could change if each audit begins with discussions between 
 the OIG and management staffs on objectives and audit methodology. 
 While the OIG must retain its independence in order to remain 
 objective, obtaining input from line management will ensure that 
 auditee concerns about the objectives and methodologies are 
 addressed. If concerns are resolved before the audit, mutual trust 
 may be easier to develop. Early discussion does not compromise an 
 IG's objectivity and prevents potentially damaging misunderstandings 
 at the audit's conclusion. More importantly, it also builds the basis 
 for action on implementing audit recommendations.
<p>
 
 3. Establish performance criteria for IG's. (1)
<p>
 The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the Executive 
 Council on Integrity and Efficiency--along with input from the Office 
 of Management and Budget--should establish criteria for judging IG 
 performance. While the National Performance Review recommends the use 
 of performance agreements for senior-level political appointees,(13) 
 IG's should be exempted from performance agreements because these 
 agreements may create the appearance of interfering with the 
 independence of IG offices. By having the IG's develop their own 
 performance measures through the PCIE and ECIE, the appearance of 
 interference with IG independence is mitigated. The performance 
 criteria should include an easily understood and usable performance 
 measurement system, one consistent with the Government Performance 
 and Results Act of 1993. The performance measurement system should 
 include the IG's' routine use of a feedback loop, consisting of 
 questionnaires to determine to what degree the OIG service to the 
 agency and Congress has been timely, relevant, accurate, and useful. 
 In addition, the performance measurements should show what steps 
 should be taken to improve IG performance. The feedback should be 
 shared with the agency head and OMB, and in IG semiannual reports to 
 Congress.
<p>
 
 4. Do not offer bonuses to IG's. (1)
<p>
 Agency heads should no longer offer bonuses to IG's, even if the IG's 
 are eligible for them under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. 
 There must be no question in the public's mind about an IG's 
 objectivity. Although presidential appointees generally are not 
 eligible for bonuses, some of the 26 presidentially-appointed IG 
 positions are filled by career civil servants who are still entitled 
 to receive bonuses as members of the Senior Executive Service. 
 Furthermore, many of the 34 non-presidentially appointed IG positions 
 are filled by career civil servants who also are eligible to receive 
 bonuses. Prohibiting bonuses will help avoid even the appearance of 
 impropriety among IG's.

 presidentially-appointed IG for the Government Printing Office.

 the American Society for Public Administration, a commendation for 
 leadership in federal program evaluation.

 12.     This shift in focus should not be construed as limiting an 
 IG's authority or independence under the IG Act. There may be some 
 value to conducting compliance audits sporadically. Each IG should 
 consciously assess the potential benefit to be realized by the agency 
 when a compliance audit is contemplated.

<h2> SMC04:  Increase the Effectiveness of Offices of General Counsel
</h2>
<P>
 <b>Background</b>
<p>
 In 1825, Charles Caleb Colton wrote, "The science of legislation is 
 like that of medicine in one respect: that it is far more easy to 
 point out what will do harm than what will do good." This statement 
 is also too often true today in the legal culture of the federal 
 government.
<p>
 The primary function of the Offices of General Counsel (OGC) in 
 federal agencies is to provide management with advice on legal 
 matters. Their role and their involvement in the decisionmaking 
 process is traditionally determined by the head of the agency and, in 
 some instances, subordinate officials.
<p>
 Offices of General Counsel are pivotal players in the clearance, or 
 "vetting," process inside departments and agencies. Their advice is 
 crucial in the increasingly litigious environment in which the 
 federal government finds itself. An Office of Personnel Management 
 (OPM) guide for a new general counsel identifies a dual role for 
 federal lawyers: interpreting the law and representing their clients' 
 interest.(1) The guide states there may be an actual or perceived 
 conflict between these dual roles. The result, the guide continues, 
 is that some program offices view the OGC as nay-sayers ("if you want 
 to be told you can't do something, go to the General Counsel's 
 office").(2)
<p>
<b> Cold vs. Hot. </B>
<p>
 As government managers in the 1990s struggle to improve their 
 operations, provide improved customer service, and cut costs, they 
 continually face an enormous web of legislation and regulations that 
 bind them to the past. However, in the quest to serve the greater 
 public good with diminishing resources, more than ever federal 
 managers will need to be more innovative. In order to accomplish 
 their agency's mission, top managers rely on their OGC to determine 
 the legal implications of management initiatives. In this regard, 
 general counsels are what veteran civil servant Arthur Flemming terms 
 "cold lawyers" or "hot lawyers." He attributes the terms to Oscar 
 Cox, who was President Franklin Roosevelt's solicitor general. Cold 
 lawyers are those who are satisfied with advising management that a 
 proposal is unacceptable because, based on their reading of the law, 
 there is no specific provision that allows management to do what they 
 want to do. They offer no options. They also fail to specify the 
 relative legal risks of the proposal. Hot lawyers are those who ask 
 management what they are trying to achieve and work with them to 
 devise proposals that will achieve it.(3) They offer options and they 
 specify the legal risks associated with them. Today, federal managers 
 need more hot lawyers.
<p>
 Some OGC staff believe the reason there are not more hot lawyers is 
 the restrained climate in which both managers and general counsels 
 have been asked to operate. Margaret Jane Porter, Chief Counsel of 
 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), shares this view. She 
 believes OGC staffs will respond in kind if a different environment 
 is established in the executive branch.(4) Managers and their OGC's 
 have been operating in a culture laden with red tape, which the 
 National Performance Review intends to change. Just as managers have 
 been disempowered, so have OGC staffs.
<p>
<b> Identifying the Customer. </b>
 George Schlossberg, an attorney in private practice who formerly 
 served on the OGC staff in the Defense Department, believes the 
 central issue facing federal attorneys is identifying the client or 
 customer. "Who is the client of a federal attorney in an OGC?" he 
 asks. "Is it the President, the department, the secretary of the 
 department, the mid-level government official posing the issue, or 
 the public at large?"(5) Schlossberg contends that the best premise 
 is one in which federal attorneys consider their clients to be the 
 bureau chiefs and section heads whom they regularly advise, subject 
 to their being overruled by the General Counsel. In the opinion of 
 another OGC staff member, the client is the Secretary.(6) In the view 
 of yet another OGC staff official, the client is the agency.(7) Other 
 OGC staff identify the public good or the taxpayer. Some suggest the 
 client varies depending on the issue at hand. According to the 
 National Aeronautics and Space Administration's OGC, management is 
 not a monolith, however, and when conflicts within line management 
 occur, mechanisms should be in place to identify and resolve them 
 early. Thus, while the general counsels to the secretaries agree 
 their personal client is the secretary, OGC staffs do not share a 
 common view as to who their client is.
<p>
<b> Previous Attempts to Create a Focus. </b>
 President Carter established the Federal Legal Council in 1979 by 
 Executive Order 12146 to promote coordination and communication among 
 federal legal offices and to become a forum for exchange of 
 information and ideas on matters of common interest. This council was 
 chaired by the Attorney General and included representatives from 15 
 other federal agencies on a rotating basis before it became inactive 
 in the mid-1980's. Thus, it has not played a significant role for 
 almost a decade.
<p>
 In addition, the Administrative Conference of the United States 
 (ACUS) has convened General Counsels for specific purposes in the 
 past. ACUS was established by Congress in 1964 as a permanent, 
 policy-neutral, independent government agency to study the efficiency 
 and fairness of the federal administrative process. The Conference 
 develops non-partisan recommendations to the President, the federal 
 departments and agencies, and the Congress on methods to improve the 
 procedures by which agencies administer regulatory, benefits, and 
 other government programs. 
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 There is a need to identify clearly who are the general counsel's 
 client(s). As in the case of almost all government employees, OGC 
 staff have multiple customers, internal and external to the 
 government. The challenge is to balance the various and sometimes 
 competing demands of the many customers. This is fundamental because 
 there are specific obligations that a lawyer has to fulfill when 
 representing a client. For example, the District of Columbia's Bar 
 has rules of professional conduct that state: "A lawyer shall 
 represent a client zealously and diligently within the bounds of the 
 law."(8) Further, they state: "A lawyer shall not intentionally (1) 
 fail to seek the lawful objectives of a client through reasonably 
 available means permitted by law and the disciplinary rules; or (2) 
 prejudice or damage a client during the course of the professional 
 relationship."(9) Other bar associations have similar codes of 
 conduct.
<p>
 Without a clear definition of who the client is, there is 
 incongruence between managers' expectations and OGCs' performance. 
 The confusion among OGC staffs results in dissatisf<b>Action</b> among many 
 managers because they believe they are the client and, therefore, 
 they expect the concomitant zealous representation that should accrue 
 in an attorney/client relationship.
<p>
 One way of clarifying who is the client would be to subject OGC's to 
 quasi-market forces. Redefine the roles of OGC's to separate their 
 service function--providing advice to managers--from their control 
 functions--serving as a vetter for policy proposals. Subject the 
 service function to market forces by allowing line managers to select 
 who they want to receive their advice from. This could be done 
 through the franchising route, or other related approaches. The 
 General Accounting Office, for example, has created a "client-
 oriented" approach in its general counsel's office by assigning legal 
 staff to serve specific line managers and soliciting these line 
 managers' input into attorneys' performance evaluations.
<p>
 A practice that has limited OGCs' effectiveness in some agencies is 
 management's failure to involve them in their early deliberations. 
 Some federal lawyers feel their advice appears ineffective or even 
 obstructive because they are consulted after decisions have already 
 been made. W.C. Parler, General Counsel at the Nuclear Regulatory 
 Commission (NRC), observed that when lawyers are included on 
 strategic planning and decisionmaking teams at the outset, 
 substantial resources can be saved.(10) He further believes that OGC 
 lawyers on these teams find that they have a responsibility to be 
 constructive, timely contributors and not to be obstacles who do not 
 provide creative options. One incentive to increase the chances that 
 program managers would consult with legal staff earlier in management 
 deliberations is to allow those managers who consult early to be 
 permitted to use a more streamlined final approval process.
<p>
 
 Actions
<p>
 1. Define clearly the clients of the Offices of General Counsel. (1)
<p>
 Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) should initiate 
 a high-priority project to convene a group of general counsels or 
 their equivalents, OGC staff members, and a representative of the 
 Department of Justice to define clearly who is the client of the 
 Offices of General Counsels within agencies. ACUS should serve as 
 facilitator to the group. This initiative should be completed on an 
 expedited basis. The definition statements should be completed within 
 one year. The resulting guidance should include a policy statement 
 that OGC's should help identify alternative approaches whenever a 
 proposed management initiative is deemed to be not legally 
 acceptable. The legal risks associated with management proposals 
 should also be specified and options suggested.
<p>
 In addition, ACUS should evaluate and recommend whether it would be 
 desirable to reconstitute and energize the Federal Legal Council to 
 address common legal issues related to the implementation of other 
 NPR recommendations, and the training needed.
<p>
 
 2. Use franchising and other market mechanisms to encourage OGC 
 staffs to respond appropriately to their clients. (1)
<p>
 Agency heads should encourage their general counsel staffs to be 
 responsive to their clients. For example, they should clearly 
 distinguish between OGC's service delivery and regulatory clearance 
 functions. They should allow line managers choice in selecting legal 
 assistance from the "service delivery" side. This choice could be via 
 a franchising operation or other mechanism. In addition, agency heads 
 should encourage better collaboration between legal staff and program 
 offices in OGC clearance functions.
<p>
 
 3. Develop performance measures and feedback loops for general 
 counsels to encourage close cooperation with clients. (1)
<p>
 Agency heads should develop performance appraisal plans for general 
 counsels that would measure the results of OGC efforts to assist 
 managers in their own efforts to be creative and entrepreneurial, 
 within the constraints of law. General counsel offices must develop 
 appropriate measures of performance with a special emphasis on 
 quality of service to the client(s). These measures should be 
 developed in collaboration with the agency line management structure. 
 Feedback loops between the clients and the OGC staff members should 
 be institutionalized.

<h2>SMC05:  Improve the Effectiveness of the General Accounting Office 
 Through Increased Customer Feedback 
</h2>
<P>
 <b>Background</b>
<p>
 One important duty of Congress is to oversee the operations of the 
 executive branch. Congress has several formal mechanisms to conduct 
 its oversight. These include hearings, agency reports, and audits and 
 evaluations by agency Inspectors General and its own General 
 Accounting Office (GAO).
<p>
 According to the Comptroller General, "The GAO assists the Congress 
 in its legislative oversight of the executive branch. We see our 
 mission as seeking to achieve honest, efficient management and full 
 accountability throughout government. We serve the public interest by 
 providing Members of the Congress and other policymakers with 
 accurate information, unbiased analysis, and objective 
 recommendations on how to best use public resources."(1) By 
 implementing this mission, GAO plays an important role in assuring 
 and improving the leadership and management practices of the 
 executive branch.
<p>
 GAO, under the leadership of Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, 
 began a formal Total Quality Management (TQM) initiative almost three 
 years ago.(2) "The agency's commitment to quality is the single most 
 important principle governing its work. We define high-quality work 
 as (1) objective and independently derived; (2) accurate, timely and 
 meaningful; and (3) presented in a way most useful to responsible 
 officials."(3) This initiative, with its strong focus on customers 
 and continual improvement, has already pointed the organization in a 
 direction to achieve these goals.(4) For example, GAO recognizes the 
 importance of crediting and publicizing best practices during an 
 audit as well as documenting problems. Another example is that it 
 intends to develop and institutionalize feedback loops from the 
 executive branch. This feedback would give it information that it 
 needs to improve its value-added contribution to better government.
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 GAO is perceived by many managers in the executive branch agencies as 
 being less effective than it could be in providing useful oversight 
 that leads to constructive changes. For example, GAO audits have 
 often documented only negative findings. These audits often did not 
 report best practices when they were uncovered, in part because staff 
 believed they were not encouraged to report success.
<p>
 A root cause of the perceived effectiveness gap is that GAO currently 
 lacks an institutionalized feedback loop from the executive branch 
 agencies, either individually or collectively. A feedback loop--such 
 as a questionnaire or interviews on the effectiveness of a GAO 
 review--would provide GAO management with information on how useful 
 its reports and reviews have been in pinpointing and solving 
 problems. Currently, GAO does not collect the information it needs to 
 continually improve the value and impact of its services. GAO's 
 "Yellow Book," which sets federal auditing procedures and standards, 
 clearly recommends describing "noteworthy accomplishments," as part 
 of audits, but it only partially addresses the need for feedback 
 loops.(5)
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 Improve GAO documentation of best practices and use of feedback 
 loops. (1)
<p>
 The President should work with the congressional leadership to 
 encourage GAO to document best practices when found. GAO should also 
 encourage agency management to spread best practices and 
 institutionalize them. As part of GAO's ongoing TQM initiative, it 
 should accelerate the process of developing feedback loops to GAO 
 from executive branch agencies. In addition, it should revise the 
 "Yellow Book" to further develop the concept of feedback loops.

<h2> SMC06:  Reduce the Burden of Congressionally Mandated Reports
</h2>
<p>
 <b>Background</b>
<p>
 The number of congressionally mandated reports required of federal 
 executive branch agencies continues to grow rapidly, following a 
 growth trend that has lasted a quarter century. In fiscal year 1980, 
 agencies produced approximately 4,000 reports in response to 
 congressional oversight requirements. Congress, this year, will 
 require executive branch agencies to prepare approximately 5,000 
 reports.(1) The preparation costs of these reports is believed to 
 exceed $100 million.
<p>
 One reporting requirement can spawn multiple reports. For example, 
 the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 required more than 38 
 reports from a single agency. Reporting requirements can be either 
 recurring (annual or semi-annual) or one-time. The Agency for 
 International Development (AID), for example, must submit 
 approximately 60 reports to Congress during fiscal year 1993; 
 approximately half are one-time requirements, but the remainder are 
 recurring reports.(2) But even one-time reports can impose 
 substantial burdens. The Department of Defense produced 654 one-time 
 reports in fiscal year 1993.(3) Reporting requirements affect small 
 as well as large agencies. For example, the Merit Systems Protection 
 Board (MSPB), an agency with a staff of about 300, must produce 70 
 congressionally mandated reports this year. These duties are assigned 
 to 4.2 full-time employees at an estimated cost of $257,121.(4)
<p>
 Various cost estimates of report production have been made over the 
 last 12 years. In 1980, the General Accounting Office estimated the 
 federal government spent $80 million producing 4,000 reports.(5) In 
 1983, $86 million was spent to produce 4,300 reports.(6)
<p>
 In addition to reports by agencies directly to Congress, central 
 oversight and management agencies such as the Office of Management 
 and Budget (OMB), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the 
 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also collect information from 
 federal agencies for submission to Congress.
<p>
 Table 1 summarizes the number of reports required by Congress from 
 selected agencies.(7)

 <p>
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 Congress ensures adequate oversight of the executive branch by 
 requiring agencies to regularly report on their activities. Some 
 reports, however, seem to have little intrinsic value. For example, 
 annual reports include the financial statements of Micronesia and the 
 Marshall Islands, and a report on the cost effectiveness of 
 furnishing therapeutic shoes to sample groups of Medicare 
 beneficiaries. Eliminating unnecessary reports will improve the way 
 government functions and streamline the bureaucracy. 
<p>
 In addition, some Inspectors General recommend that the Chief 
 Financial Officers Act be amended to allow discretion as to reporting 
 on the financial condition of government funds rather than requiring 
 annual reports on all funds. In addition, a special task force of the 
 President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency recommends 
 eliminating annual compliance reports such as management controls 
 over advisory and assistance awards and implementation of anti-
 influencing requirements.(8) The cost of these reports is believed to 
 greatly exceed their benefits.
<p>
 Many reports, while initially valuable, may no longer be necessary 
 for several reasons:
<p>
 --- They may address concerns that are no longer high priority, such 
 as the annual report on helium production, required since 1925.
<p>
 --- They may repeat information previously addressed in another 
 report. For example, the Annual Report from the National Advisory 
 Council on Continuing Education duplicates material in a separately 
 required report.(9)
<p>
 --- They may document only minor, procedural changes. For example, 
 Clearance Form for Data Reporting Burden is required annually of the 
 Department of Education by the Paperwork Reduction Act.
<p>
 --- They may concentrate on programs no longer in existence. For 
 example, the Secretary of Education was required as recently as 1985 
 "to report biennially to Congress on the findings and recommendations 
 of the Office of Education Professional Development, an office 
 abolished in 1981."(10)
<p>
 --- They may no longer provide useful information. For example, an 
 annual report on coal reserves disclosure from the Department of 
 Energy was found to be not useful "because U.S. coal reserves are 
 estimated to last in excess of 300 years."(11)
<p>
 Alternatives exist that could provide needed information at a much 
 lower cost. For example, an electronic information system shared by 
 congressional committees and executive branch agencies could allow 
 data to be exchanged quicker and at a lower cost. 
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Eliminate at least half of all congressionally mandated reports. 
 (3)
<p>
 Congress should set a goal of eliminating at least half of all 
 congressionally mandated reports. Agency heads should identify 
 candidate reports that can be combined with others or eliminated 
 altogether and supply adequate justification to Congress for that 
 Action.
<p>
 In the past, an essential factor in the elimination of reports has 
 been the provision of convincing reasons. In 1988, the General 
 Accounting Office concluded that inadequate justification of reports 
 proposed for elimination significantly contributed to the failure of 
 a 1986 congressional effort to reduce congressionally mandated 
 reporting requirements. In that effort, Congress eliminated 71 
 percent of the reports whose elimination agencies had adequately 
 justified. Elimination dropped to 10 percent when agencies did not 
 provide adequate justification. As a result, only 23 reports were 
 eliminated, out of a total of 240 recommended.(12)
<p>
 The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Subcommittee on 
 Oversight of Government Management, has recently revisited this issue 
 and is drafting legislation with bipartisan support to eliminate or 
 modify unnecessary or outdated reporting requirements. 
<p>
 
 2. Review new reporting requirements for management impact, and 
 include a sunset provision. (3)
<p>
 The growth of new reporting requirements also must be controlled. 
 Congress should assess the management implications, particularly the 
 cost, of each newly proposed reporting requirement. The cost of 
 requiring new information from the agencies should be compared with 
 the ensuing benefit. Congress and OMB should jointly develop 
 standards for Congress to apply when performing cost/benefit analyses 
 on newly proposed reporting requirements. Congress should report in 
 committee the cost/benefit comparison for each proposed reporting 
 requirement before its enactment.
<p>
 In addition, Congress should include a sunset provision requiring 
 congressional reassessment of each newly adopted reporting 
 requirement at least every two to four years. The sunset provision 
 would ensure that the information requested still merits the cost of 
 preparing and analyzing the report. Sunset provisions ensure that the 
 burdens of congressionally mandated reports are controlled.
<p>
 NPR's Improving Financial Management report proposes related measures 
 with respect to federal financial reporting requirements. 
 Specifically, that report proposes that the appropriate congressional 
 committees subject future financial reporting requirements to a 
 cost/benefit analysis.

<h2>SMC07:  Reduce Internal Regulations by More Than 50 Percent
</h2>
<P>
 <b>Background</b>
<p>
 The cost of internal agency directives is tremendous. The cost of 
 researching, writing, printing, storing, and maintaining internal 
 directives, guidance, and procedures are themselves huge. However, 
 the additional expenses of training, supervising, implementing, 
 waiting for clearances, collecting and analyzing data, monitoring 
 performance, and enforcing and auditing regulations, plus preparing 
 the countless reports, generate further costs not always easy to 
 measure but which are equally draining on limited agency resources. A 
 full accounting must also include the cost of delay, confusion, loss 
 of initiative, and paralysis resulting from the inevitable impression 
 on so many workers that nothing is permitted, least of all creativity 
 or initiative.
<p>
 The demands of internal directives and regulations are growing faster 
 than the executive branch itself over the past 10 years. Although 
 executive branch personnel grew only 7 percent between 1980 and 
 1990/1991, in the personnel function the number of employees 
 increased 11 percent, in financial management staff grew 27 percent, 
 and in procurement it jumped 60 percent.(1) In the case of 
 procurement, much of this growth is attributed to the increase in the 
 number of internal directives.(2)
<p>
 A Case Study. Figure 2 is a tally of internal regulations and the 
 number of pages of directives and regulations affecting one field 
 office in the Department of the Interior--a relatively unregulated 
 state office of the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho. In other 
 words, the total is a minimum rather than an average or a worst case. 
 Using the most conservative estimates, there are nearly 33,000 pages 
 of internal regulations and handbook requirements that apply to this 
 office of less than 200 people.(3) The numerous additional agencies 
 with at least partial jurisdiction, plus the case law and 
 interpretations, and various other commentaries, would increase the 
 total pages several fold, as would applicable state and local 
 regulations.
<p>
 This tally of directives, guidance, and regulations does not directly 
 measure their burden. A single regulation may impose a huge burden, 
 while in some cases there were several regulations per page. But the 
 tally does indicate how obsessive the regulatory process has become. 
 It is hard to believe that this number of regulations can be 
 internally consistent and always the best approach for local 
 circumstances.
<p>
 Sources of Overregulation. It is easy to blame the proliferation of 
 regulations on Congress, but the issue is more complex. Problems may 
 be seen as falling into one of three categories: general system 
 failures, individual failures (due to problems in training, 
 judgement, or integrity), and acceptable error levels. The private 
 sector approach, which admittedly may be very difficult in the public 
 sector, is to treat system failures aggressively, provided the 
 solution is cost-effective. It also rectifies individual failures by 
 providing training or other remedies to the individual (like firing 
 people who steal). General error rates are monitored to be sure they 
 do not become uncontrollable. The current government approach, by 
 contrast, is zero tolerance for error and treatment of every failure 
 as a general system failure, remedied solely by law or regulation 
 even if the occurrence was isolated.
<p>
 There are perverse incentives that contribute to the proliferation of 
 internal directives and regulations. For example, successful vendors 
 have a self-interest in complex procurement regulations--they have 
 adapted to them, they bar entry of competitors and, in certain cost-
 type contracts, vendors get paid for the time required to comply with 
 the regulations while outsiders do not. Federal employees rationalize 
 requests for larger staffs and position upgrades on the ever more 
 complex regulations their agencies must enforce.(4)

 GRAND TOTAL OF PAGES     32,918
<p>
 </pre>
 The tally of pages was conducted by actual count of pages. The tally 
 of regulations was conducted by actual count using the tables of 
 contents when available. Both tallies were conducted with assistance 
 and guidance from the responsible offices. In some cases, there is 
 more than one regulation to a page. Guidance in the handbooks is 
 required, equivalent to a regulation. Totals for OMB Circulars and 
 Bulletins and for BLM Instructional Memoranda are for Fiscal Year 
 1993--large quantities of additional ones are still in effect from 
 previous years. The tallies from handbooks and interpretive 
 statements are based on the number of directives within the handbooks 
 and interpretive statements respectively. The asterisk (*) notes 
 offices that were unable to provide tallies, usually because the 
 totals were larger than they were willing to count.
<p>
 Narrow definitions were used for regulations and handbooks. As a 
 result, their tallies are vastly lower than other published figures, 
 which include case law, interpretations, and other secondary sources. 
 These secondary sources frequently exceed 5,000 pages per agency.
<p>
 The tally is limited to the chain of command (the Department, the 
 Bureau, and the state office itself) and the primary federal agencies 
 with jurisdiction over the operations in the state office (Office of 
 Management and Budget, General Services Administration, Office of 
 Personnel Management, and the relevant portions from the Occupational 
 Safety and Health Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity 
 Commission, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of 
 Energy). The tally excludes the regulations of numerous additional 
 federal agencies with jurisdiction over aspects of the state office 
 (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency, Historic Preservation, Small 
 Business Administration, etc.).
<p>
 The tally also excludes the regulations and case law covering various 
 aspects of government legal process that also have jurisdiction over 
 the state office. These include the Administrative Dispute Resolution 
 Act, the Agency Practice Act, the Claims and Debt Collection Acts, 
 the Contract Disputes Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, the 
 Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act, the 
 Freedom of Information Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act, and 
 so forth.
<p>
 In short, the total of pages is a very conservative figure.
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 According to a 1992 study by the Merit Systems Protection Board, 
 procurement regulations have become so complex that it is no longer 
 reasonable to expect qualified procurement officers to use them 
 effectively.(5)This impasse is due to a combination of the large 
 number of complex regulations and the speed with which they must be 
 applied.
<p>
 Overregulation is not limited to procurement, but is a governmentwide 
 problem, according to a still-relevant 1983 study by the National 
 Academy of Public Administration:
<p>
 Federal management systems are now over-regulated in the sense that, 
 by accretion, each has acquired an overburden of controls, 
 limitations and constraints, reviews and approvals, data 
 requirements, and other mandates, which, in total, significantly 
 reduce their value and effectiveness.(6)
<p>
 Most regulations start with a law, usually designed to solve a 
 specific problem. The central management agencies (Office of 
 Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management, General 
 Services Administration) then develop a regulatory process to 
 implement the law. The departments then interpret how the regulations 
 should be applied in their agencies through additional 
 regulations.(7) The agencies and bureaus then customize that process, 
 frequently with regulations at both the national and regional level 
 and occasionally at the local level. This chain produces an 
 inevitable torrent of internal regulations. There is currently much 
 variation in compliance and enforcement of these regulations within 
 any given agency.
<p>
 <b>Goal of Internal Deregulation. </b>
<p>
 The goal of internal deregulation is to weed out needless regulations 
 so that: (1) the outcomes to be achieved are clearly articulated; (2) 
 responsibilities for decisionmaking and Action are clearly assigned; 
 (3) direct and objective measures of accomplishment exist; (4) 
 oversight shifts from process to outcome; (5) there is a clear 
 understanding of the fiscal and ethical propriety required in public 
 administration; and (6) the remaining regulations and requirements 
 for uniformity are given highest priority.
<p>
 Regulatory reform will greatly increase accountability, creativity, 
 and motivation, while decreasing the administrative costs of 
 completing work. The goal is certainly not to give federal workers 
 carte blanche to do as they choose, but allow them to get the job 
 done by the most sensible means possible within the bounds of fiscal 
 and ethical propriety.
<p>
 For years the burden of internal regulation has been something like 
 Mark Twain's observation about the weather: Everyone talks about it, 
 but no one does anything about it. But in the last few years there 
 have been enough experiments that a best practices model has emerged.
<p>
 A pivotal point was discovered at the Department of Commerce. 
 According to Alan Balutis, the Department's Director for Budget, 
 Planning and Organization, about two-thirds of the requests for 
 waivers from internal regulations submitted as part of Commerce's 
 reinvention effort seek relief from regulations not even required in 
 the first place. Balutis concludes that much of the internal 
 regulatory burden is self-inflicted, either from informal withdrawal 
 of authority by non-required reviews, from a desire for "security 
 blanket" documentation to avoid individual responsibility, or from a 
 control mentality that confuses 100 percent review with an 
 appropriate level of oversight. What is needed, Balutis said, is not 
 an edit of the regulations but meaningful reform.
<p>
<b> A Success Story: Forest Service. </B>
<p>
 Dale Robertson, then Associate Chief of the Forest Service, undertook 
 a bold reform in 1985. He saw his agency's budget declining while 
 overhead was increasing, and feared the Forest Service would strangle 
 in red tape.(8) The original 20-page handbook written by Gifford 
 Pinchot, the agency's founding director, had grown to a bloated tome 
 17 feet thick.
<p>
 Robertson selected four test units (three forests and a research 
 station) and completely deregulated them. He gave them authority to 
 reach their planning targets in the most efficient way they could 
 devise, discarding needless regulations on the condition that the 
 participants remained within the bounds of the law, basic policy, 
 budget integrity, and congressional direction.
<p>
 Robertson also implemented "end-results budgeting." The test units 
 were responsible for only one to eight line items, consolidating from 
 nine to 15 programs in a single line item. Budget performance would 
 be evaluated through output targets, such as number of acres 
 reforested, rather than solely through strict, detailed spending 
 targets. Appropriations would be biennial, and the four test units 
 would be free to shift dollars among any of the programs in a 
 consolidated line item.
<p>
 The General Accounting Office found that "end results budgeting is 
 conceptually sound."(9) Internal evaluations showed that the test 
 units also saved money. In the Eastern Region, for example, 11 
 separate hierarchies were merged into five team groups with 
 interlocking expertise and responsibilities. The regional office cut 
 its budget by $2 million, reduced its staff by 40 positions, and 
 reduced its overhead to the agency's lowest. The region provided 
 12,000 proposals that eliminated outdated rules, streamlined work 
 procedures, and improved the quality of work life.(10)
<p>
 It was only when the needless rules were stripped away and management 
 was empowered to use the budget wisely that the managers themselves 
 truly became accountable for goal accomplishment while maintaining 
 fiscal and ethical propriety, according to Bill Delaney, the analyst 
 responsible for evaluating the pilot program. In 1989, the Forest 
 Service chief acknowledged the success of the pilot study and signed 
 a new management philosophy establishing the pilot approach nation-
 wide.(11)
<p>
 Unfortunately, Congress rejected the proposal to permit service-wide 
 end-results budgeting, and the service's deregulation effort lost a 
 good deal of momentum. The 17 feet of regulations were reduced by 
 about two-thirds. But objective measures were not established, and 
 the revision of the hand-books was not included. Program managers 
 quietly shifted many of the requirements to handbooks or directives, 
 with the result that much of the deregulation progress was illusory. 
 The emphasis on management controls and documentation is still so 
 strong that the pilot efforts are "caught between two cultures," 
 according to Delaney. He sees the current rate of progress as slow.
<p>
<b> A Success Story: Department of Veterans Affairs. </b>
<p>
 The Department of Veterans Affairs reported success in its Management 
 Efficiency Pilot Program (MEPP). The MEPP, conceived as a three-year 
 pilot program starting in 1987, was supported departmentwide and by 
 the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The program's goals were to 
 provide flexibility to managers in the field, cut red tape, and ease 
 restrictions and reporting requirements.
<p>
 The results were positive. MEPP approved over 1,000 waivers. This 
 resulted in improved veterans service and millions in savings.(12) 
 The MEPP experiment went so well that it is currently being expanded 
 on an incremental basis beginning with 38 new MEPP sites. Waiver 
 requests continue being processed on an ongoing basis.
<p>
<b> A Success Story: Air Force. </b>
<p>
 In 1992, General Merrill A. McPeak, Air Force Chief of Staff, 
 established the Policy Review Initiative, headed by Brigadier General 
 M.L. Haines. The Initiative is replacing 1,510 regulations with 165 
 policy directives and 750 instructions. Each new policy averages 
 about five pages, of which no more than one page is the policy 
 itself, about three pages are the performance measurements, and the 
 remainder are definitions and applicability standards. The Initiative 
 will cut the 55,000 pages of intermingled policy and procedures to 
 approximately 18,000 pages, which will clearly separate policy from 
 procedure.
<p>
 The deregulation effort is managed by a staff of about 10 plus the 
 policy writers and various consulting editors. Full reform will 
 require about 30 calendar months and will be completed in fiscal year 
 1994. Hand-books, manuals, and other non-directive publications will 
 be produced over a five-year cycle.(13)
<p>
 To develop the basic performance measures, the team first identified 
 the decisions and the information bases for the decisions, and then 
 selected the most important outcome.(14) For example, the basic 
 performance measure for the motor pool is the percent of requests 
 filled with a suitable vehicle. The basic performance measure for the 
 lawyers was the number of case settlements favorable to the Air 
 Force, counting both cases won and settlements more favorable than 
 the expected trial outcome. The basic performance measure for long-
 range planning was the percent of plans incorporated into the budget. 
 The basic performance measures for pollution prevention were 
 reduction in pollutants purchased and pollutants discharged.
<p>
 There were initially many skeptics to General McPeak's initiative. 
 Developing the measures was difficult, requiring several versions to 
 eliminate perverse incentives. It was also difficult for individuals 
 to accept being held accountable to these standards. Most groups 
 initially believed their areas could not be measured. However, the 
 only areas where appropriate measures could not be developed were 
 those where high-level policy regulations were inappropriate.
<p>
 At the end of the initiative, the headquarters will be free to focus 
 on policy, using real measures of outcomes. And the field will have 
 clear guidance, clear delegations, clear accountability, and useful 
 handbooks.
<p>
 Now that all the policies, instructions, and handbooks are in digital 
 form, the Air Force is converting the entire set of documents to CD-
 ROM disks because of the dramatic cost savings.(15) The process will 
 be completed by mid-1994, at which point the Air Force will stop 
 printing paper copies.
<p>
 The entire Defense Department is now converting all its directives:
<p>
 First, to clarify--from top to bottom--its policy guidance, and to 
 ingrain forever the principle of clear, concise policy unmistakably 
 separated from essential procedures. Second, once the policy is 
 clarified and separated, policy accomplishment must be measured to 
 assess how well it is carried out. Third, procedures must be pushed 
 to the lowest possible level. People should be given the necessary 
 latitude to carry out policy in a way that best fits local 
 conditions.(16)
<p>
 The agencies noted above have cut their own regulations, but have no 
 power to reduce the thousands of regulations from the central 
 management agencies with jurisdiction over them. Deregulation is 
 often more difficult in the central management agencies, because so 
 many of the requirements are statutory. But the results are worth the 
 effort because of the appreciable cumulative effect on the remaining 
 agencies. The following example shows that the central management 
 agencies can also reduce the number of regulations.
<p>
 A Success Story in Progress: General Services Administration. 
 The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Improvement Project was 
 designed by GSA and the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council to 
 determine how the FAR could more effectively serve its customers: 
 government contracting personnel and the contractors. GSA sent 
 questionnaires for dissemination to 12 federal agencies, the Small 
 Agency Council, and the National Contract Management Association. 
 About 95 percent of the respondents suggested one or more ways to 
 improve the FAR.(17) The most common suggestions were to provide 
 greater flexibility in the FAR for exercising good business judgment, 
 to consult users in the formulation of necessary regulations, to 
 ensure that regulations are consistent and clear, to provide more 
 guidance but less regulation wherever possible, and to notify users 
 of regulatory revisions prior to their effective date. These are 
 essentially the same issues as for internal deregulation. The FAR 
 Council formed an Executive Committee, which reviewed the 
 recommendations and established 19 implementation projects broken 
 into four sub-groups: philosophy, policy, automation, and 
 training.(18) Most of the projects are scheduled for completion by 
 the end of 1995.
<p>
 The GSA approach may serve as a model for other central management 
 agencies to deregulate. In the future, such reform should include 
 objective performance measures. The Bottom Line Outcome Measures 
 developed by the OPM in conjunction with federal personnel directors 
 illustrate that meaningful performance measurement is possible even 
 in difficult-to-measure administrative areas.(19) A strong 
 deregulation effort in the central management agencies would inspire 
 other agencies by showing that deregulation is possible even in areas 
 highly constrained by laws. While it would be possible to deregulate 
 central management agencies first and then the remaining agencies 
 later, such sequencing would delay total deregulation many years.
<p>
<b> Two Basic Approaches. </B>
 There are two basic approaches to deregulation. The top-down method 
 (Air Force and GSA) is faster, more systematic, and emphasizes clear 
 headquarters policy. The bottom-up method is slower, but allows 
 testing and emphasizes field priorities. The bottom-up method can be 
 driven by either waivers (Veterans Affairs) or pilot sites (Forest 
 Service). Because waivers identify the specific decisions being 
 decentralized, they allow the changes to be more rapidly extended to 
 all offices. The experiences of these agencies show it is not only 
 possible to cut back on internal regulation, but also, with top 
 management support, it is relatively straightforward to dramatically 
 cut back, leading to better work at lower cost without endangering 
 fiscal and ethical propriety.
<p>
<b> Lessons Learned. </B>
 Identifying the need for deregulation is not enough. The solution has 
 to be successfully carried through to completion. A GAO study of 12 
 governmentwide management initiatives undertaken between 1970 and 
 1980 concluded that these initiatives failed to achieve their 
 objectives for a number of reasons: rapid turnover in executive 
 branch leadership, a lack of real consensus on what constitutes good 
 management, lack of careful implementation planning and execution, 
 and lack of adequate staffing and management attention to management 
 concerns.(20)
<p>
 The agency examples described above give some dimension to the levels 
 of leadership, consensus building, planning, resources, 
 administrative support, and sustained effort required to achieve 
 deregulation objectives. The number of people required and the length 
 of time will of course depend on the size and complexity of the 
 agency, but the total is smaller than first assumed. The range in the 
 agencies described above is 5-15 concentrated work years for the 
 headquarters policy task force, and probably a similar but more 
 dispersed number to write the field handbooks. Most agencies should 
 be able to conduct an effort this size within current employment 
 levels and budget.
<p>
 In addition, the headquarters task force and field writers will need 
 training. At the present time no such training exists, but the 
 Department of Defense Policy Directive Team has prepared a very 
 helpful work plan.(21) If there is a governmentwide push to reform 
 internal regulations, it would be appropriate to assign training to 
 federal training centers, which in turn could seek guidance in 
 training design from the agencies that have already undertaken such 
 efforts.
<p>
 There is no alternative to sustained sponsorship from agency top 
 management. Only senior staff can initiate radical deregulation and 
 overcome the inevitable resistance and conflicts. 
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 Reduce internal regulations by at least 50 percent over the next 
 three years. (2)
<p>
 The President should issue an executive order to all departments and 
 agencies--including central management agencies such as OMB, OPM, and 
 GSA--to cut the number and the pages of their internal directives and 
 regulations in half. An exception can be made for agencies that have 
 already recently met the goal, such as certain parts of GSA and the 
 Air Force.
<p>
 The Office of Management and Budget should be tasked with ensuring 
 sustained support of this deregulation effort, including exchanging 
 information, coordinating efforts, sharing solutions, and identifying 
 training needs and methods.
<p>
 To implement this executive order, departments and agencies should 
 develop plans for deregulation that include these four steps:
<p>
 
 1.     Purge agency internal regulations. Excise everything but the 
 highest level policy guidance plus the requirements of laws or other 
 immutable outside guidance, requirements of health and safety, and 
 requirements where national uniformity is absolutely required.
<p>
 
 2.     Establish an objective output measure for each policy. Agree 
 on terms.(22) Define the measure and show a sample bar chart as part 
 of the policy, so that it is evident what will be tracked and how. 
 Incorporate user satisfAction and economic measures as appropriate. 
 These measures may change with experience--plan for flexibility and 
 periodic review. Update measures in other systems (e.g., Chief 
 Financial Officer Act) as measures are proven to be successful.
<p>
 
 3.     Provide useful handbooks of best practices, technical 
 assistance, and other optional help. Get field practitioners to write 
 the handbooks rather than headquarters policy staff. This tends to 
 provide appropriate language and real help, and ensures that writers 
 do not have vested interests in inserting requirements into these 
 publications. If economical, publish the handbooks along with the 
 policies electronically or on CD-ROM.
<p>
 
 4.     Allow field staff to identify authorities and systems for 
 decentralization by requesting waivers from regulations. The 
 presumption is that most waiver requests will be granted, and the 
 requests will identify areas needing permanent decentralization. Both 
 the top-down deregulation and the bottom-up waiver requests are 
 needed so there is a "push-pull" effect, with deregulation driven 
 both by the headquarters and the field (also see SMC08: Expand the 
 Use of Waivers to Encourage Innovation).
<p>
 Agency heads should establish a speedy timetable and provide the 
 continuing resources, emphases, and conflict resolution needed to 
 complete successful regulatory reform. Agency heads must also ensure 
 that no "shadow" systems develop to retain decisionmaking at higher 
 levels. Agency heads must also guarantee that once a high-level 
 policy is established, there is rigorous, uniform enforcement and 
 that performance assessment is pursuant to the new standards.

 The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) made a one-time capital investment 
 of $900,000, which allowed annual cost savings of $600,000 by 
 eliminating conventional printing of publications and reducing 
 distribution and storage costs, plus annual cost avoidance of 
 $1,370,000 through the elimination of inserting page changes in DLA 
 publications. The CD-ROM disks are replaced every three months with 
 updated versions. In other words, the savings more than paid for the 
 conversion in the first year. The issues in comparing CD-ROM to 
 traditional printing are clearly identified and easy to understand:

<h2>  SMC08:  Expand the Use of Waivers to Encourage Innovation
</h2>
<P>
  <b>Background</b>
<p>
 While law and regulation are essential to good government, their 
 uniform application can stifle innovation, waste resources, and 
 stymie rather than fulfill program objectives. State and local 
 governments are often frustrated by federal requirements that offer 
 little or no benefit to communities that do not "fit the mold" for 
 which the requirement was created.(1) Categorical grants from the 
 federal government may require activities or levels of expenditure 
 for specific purposes (e.g., special education, drug rehabilitation) 
 in every state regardless of need or community priorities. The 
 enabling legislation usually prohibits federal agencies or state or 
 local governments from reprogramming scarce funds to meet the goals 
 of the program. Or overly detailed legislation may undermine 
 implementation. For example, agencies administering any of the 
 federal government's programs for the poor must verify many details 
 about people's lives. They must verify that a family receiving funds 
 under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program does not 
 own a car worth more than $1,500 in equity value. To give the same 
 family food stamps, it must verify that the family doesn't own a car 
 worth more than $4,500 in market value. Medicaid specifies a range 
 that it allows for the value of a recipient's car. There are 
 exceptions for each program."Why can't we talk about the same car in 
 all three programs?" queried Vice President Gore.(2) With a system of 
 waivers, it could be done.
<p>
 Federal agencies encounter similar frustrations with the dictates of 
 central management agencies, such as the Office of Management and 
 Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the 
 General Services Administration (GSA). These agencies are responsible 
 for implementing governmentwide policies. Like state and local 
 governments, federal line managers often find these rules and 
 regulations inapplicable to their needs. A frequent example expressed 
 in the Vice President's Town Hall meetings is the use of staffing 
 ceilings that restrict civil service hiring and therefore force 
 agencies to contract for services that would be more economically 
 performed in-house.
<p>
 A few agencies (Department of Health and Human Services, Department 
 of Defense (DOD), Internal Revenue Service) have been granted some 
 latitude under research and demonstration authorities to waive non-
 statutory requirements--largely with positive results. One success is 
 the Management Efficiency Pilot Program (MEPP) at the Department of 
 Veterans Affairs. Established in 1987, MEPP approved over 1,000 
 waivers resulting in improved veterans service, better resource 
 utilization, millions in cost savings, and improved employee 
 morale.(3) Unfortunately this increased discretion has not spread 
 widely throughout government.
<p>
 Each of the numerous laws, regulations, rules, and policies was 
 motivated by rational, well-intended, and fair-minded desires to 
 serve a specific public purpose or to solve a particular problem. 
 Taken together, however, they can create more problems than they 
 solve. Solutions to isolated problems often have unintended 
 consequences, often making a situation worse than the original 
 problem.
<p>
 <b>One Size Fits All. </B>
<p>
 Our system of laws and regulations can never be perfect. First, it is 
 exceedingly difficult to create laws and regulations that fit the 
 wide range of conditions found across America. Those requirements 
 that fit "on average" may be dysfunctional in situations that are not 
 typical. Second, laws and regulations from different parts of the 
 government can and do result in conflicting or incompatible 
 requirements. For example, food industries may have difficulty 
 meeting both the Food and Drug Administration's requirement for 
 equipment that is easily cleaned and the Occupational Safety and 
 Health Administration's requirement for equipment with noise 
 suppression. Third, as conditions, circumstances, and public needs 
 change, laws and regulations become less effective and appropriate, 
 even if they were initially well-drafted. As societal change 
 accelerates, this becomes an increasing problem.
<p>
<b> Exceptions? Change the Law. </b>
<p>
 The formal legal mechanisms to resolve these problems are changes in 
 the laws and regulations or the pursuit of judicial relief. These 
 processes, however, are time consuming, expensive, and uncertain. 
 Major statutory or regulatory changes can take years, and will not be 
 undertaken unless and until the authorities are truly convinced of 
 the <b>Need for Change</b>. Successful challenges to existing laws and 
 regulations require resources, expertise, and stamina to endure 
 lengthy and often frustrating appeals. Many potential petitioners are 
 intimidated by the high costs and slim chances of a successful 
 challenge. Instead, a state or local government may choose not to 
 apply for a federal program, or a federal manager may give only 
 minimal compliance or lip service to irrational restrictions. In the 
 end, the results sought by the Congress are only achieved at the cost 
 of decreased efficiency and effectiveness, or are not achieved at 
 all. The solution is waiver authority, which has the potential to 
 alert authors of laws or regulations to the <b>Need for Change</b>.
<p>
 Experience with DOD's Model Installation Program, the reinvention 
 labs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Forest Service 
 indicates that the returns from more liberal waiver approval are 
 substantial and the risks of abuse and evasion are low.
<p>
 
 <b>Need for Change</b>
<p>
 There is an overwhelming need for appreciable relief from ineffective 
 and unnecessary requirements, whether too general, ill-considered--
 counterproductive in some instances--or obsolete. Cases in which 
 strict adherence to law or regulation would result in unintended and 
 undesirable consequences should be of immediate interest to lawmakers 
 and regulators. Such circumstances provide opportunities for fruitful 
 reforms. A proposed waiver in furtherance of the statutory intent, 
 limited in scope and duration, and with measurable results is an 
 excellent means for testing an alternative regulatory scheme. It is 
 in the interest of lawmakers and regulators, as well as affected 
 parties, to encourage carefully crafted waivers and an expeditious 
 review process. In the best sense, such waivers are experiments for 
 government's reinvention, not its wholesale abdication.
<p>
 Improve Ways to Meet Program Goals. In the recently enacted 
 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Congress recognized 
 this need and instituted a process for "granting of managerial 
 accountability and flexibility waivers; that is, the opportunity to 
 be exempt from specific types of non-statutory administrative 
 procedural requirements, in return for achieving greater program 
 results than would otherwise occur."(4) This provision of the GPRA 
 applies to agencies in the executive branch with specific 
 limitations. "The requirements eligible for waiver are exclusively 
 those regarding the internal allocation and use of resources. They do 
 not include any requirements that directly affect persons or 
 activities outside the agency."(5)
<p>
 While the Congress "believes that the Act provides an important first 
 step in a direction that may pay significant dividends,"(6) realizing 
 the full potential of waivers requires a greater effort by both the 
 executive and legislative branches to extend the waiver process 
 beyond the administrative activities of Federal agencies. In addition 
 to the GPRA, other examples of current legislation providing waivers 
 include the Economic Enterprise Zone bill with broad, general waiver 
 authority and the Goals 2000: Educate America bill with tighter 
 limits on the granting of waivers.(7)
<p>
 A controlled waiver process must be based on the legal authority 
 being waived. Except when the courts intervene, only Congress can 
 legislate the conditions under which a statutory requirement can be 
 waived. Consideration of legislative requirements should include the 
 conditions under which waivers and exemptions would be appropriate; 
 such provisions should be incorporated into the statute. Generally, 
 it should encourage variations that improve chances for achieving 
 intended program results. Similar consideration should go into the 
 design of regulatory programs. A process that encourages waivers in 
 furtherance of the statutory intent, limited in scope and duration, 
 and with measurable results, can only foster the potential 
 effectiveness and efficiency of regulation.
<p>
 The controlling process for the waiver, however, should not in itself 
 become a bureaucratic nightmare. For example, the two-year waiver 
 process for certain state Medicaid grants requires 18 months of work. 
 So state officials have to reapply after only six months. As a 
 result, timeliness and the volume of paperwork required need to also 
 be factors in designing such a process.
<p>
 
 <b>Action</b>
<p>
 Establish a process for obtaining waivers from federal regulations 
 and identify the regulations for which this process applies. (1)
<p>
 The President should direct each agency to establish and publicize an 
 open process for obtaining waivers from that agency's regulations. 
 The process should address the following considerations:
<p>
 --- Waiver petitions, so as not to be frivolous, must be submitted by 
 heads of local or state governments (who may seek the counsel of 
 their senators or representatives) or heads of federal 
 departments/agencies. Waiver petitions from private entities or 
 individuals would be prohibited.
<p>
 --- Initial waiver decisions should be made in 60 days, but if no 
 decision is made, the waiver will be deemed to have been granted 
 unless the petitioned agency formally notifies the petitioner that it 
 has extended the period of consideration for a maximum of another 30 
 days. If no explicit decision is made in that time, the waiver would 
 be automatically approved.
<p>
 --- Input must be sought from the office with line responsibility for 
 issuing or implementing the regulation for which a waiver is sought, 
 perhaps by having that office make the initial decision on the 
 waiver. Where state or local agencies are affected, the appropriate 
 senators or representatives should be consulted by the petitioned 
 federal agency.
<p>
 --- A right must be included for the petitioner to appeal a denial to 
 an agency or department office not having line responsibility for the 
 issuance or implementation of the regulation at issue. (This might be 
 a waiver appeals board, the general counsel's office, an office of 
 program design, etc.) This is necessary to ensure that staff heavily 
 invested in the existing regulatory structure do not inappropriately 
 block innovative programs. The duration of the appeal should also be 
 limited to 60 days with no provisions for extension of the 
 consideration period.
<p>
 --- Decisions by the independent waiver appeals board can be appealed 
 to the head of the agency by either the petitioner or the responsible 
 office. This period should be strictly limited to 30 days.
<p>
 --- An office designated by the President could serve as ombudsman 
 from whom petitioners may seek help when a waiver decision is 
 appealed to the Secretary or agency head. A petitioner should be able 
 to present its position to this waiver office; this office would 
 advise the Secretary/agency head as to whether it thinks the waiver 
 should be granted or denied.
<p>
 --- All documents submitted by the petitioners to either the agency 
 or the waiver office must be made available to the public. Final 
 decisions must be announced promptly in the Federal Register.
<p>
 --- Initial waiver decisions need only signature approval to be 
 granted, while denials would have to be supported by written 
 explanations. All government officials who are formally a party to 
 the ultimate decision should be clearly identified for the record.
<p>
 Waiver authority should not be sought or instituted for all programs. 
 Waivers should further the statutory intent, be limited in duration 
 and scope, and have measurable results. Waiver authority is 
 appropriate when the petitioner needs a waiver to innovate, such as a 
 state developing a new welfare program. It is also appropriate when 
 changes in circumstances outpace changes in rules. It is 
 inappropriate when agencies are requiring public or private entities 
 to act for health, safety, or environmental reasons. For example, 
 states should not have any additional authority to seek waivers of 
 Clean Air Act requirements, either for themselves or for private 
 entities. Such waivers would not further the purposes of the 
 legislation.
<p>
 Agencies must designate those existing regulations or programs for 
 which the waiver authority will apply. The waiver process should be 
 instituted immediately for those regulations for which the agency has 
 the authority to do so. Where agencies need a statutory change to 
 institute the waiver process, the Administration should seek such 
 legislation. As new legislative requirements are proposed, explicit 
 provisions for waiver authority should be considered. The current 
 presumption that legislative requirements cannot be waived should be 
 reversed so that agency heads have authority to waive requirements 
 unless legislation explicitly prohibits waivers. The Administration 
 should seek legislation to accomplish such reversals.
<p>
 Each agency should be responsible for maintaining a data base 
 tracking waivers requested and granted by that agency, including the 
 expected duration and results of each waiver. When a waiver 
 demonstrates its value, or when significant patterns and trends 
 detected by the agencies suggest that regulations or laws create 
 pervasive problems, the agency should revise or abolish the 
 requirement. For example, 48 state agencies have waivers from the 
 Medicaid program allowing them to provide community-based services as 
 an alternative to nursing home care, which is the service routinely 
 covered by Medicaid.(8) With such a preponderance of states seeking 
 waivers, the basic policy clearly demands attention.

<Title>Intergovernmental Service Delivery</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Intergovernmental Service Delivery</H2>
<P>
<HR>
<UL>
</UL>
<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3></A>
<UL>
</UL>
<p> To understand the state of intergovernmental relations today, consider 
the state of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations 
(ACIR), a once-proud, federally funded institution that has fallen on hard times.
<p>
<p> Among the functions outlined in its charter, ACIR is supposed to bring together 
representatives of the federal, state, and local governments to 
discuss common problems; provide a forum to discuss how to coordinate grant 
and other programs requiring intergovernmental cooperation; provide 
technical assistance to determine how legislation in Washington would 
affect the 
federal system; recommend how best to allocate governmental functions, 
responsibilities, and revenues among levels of government; and suggest how 
to coordinate tax laws and administrative practices to achieve a more 
orderly, less competitive fiscal relationship among levels of government.
<p>
<p> Twenty years ago, ACIR was a prestigious institution that produced numerous 
analytical reports on the intergovernmental impact of federal policy. Its role 
was augmented by the establishment of intergovernmental offices in the Office 
of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office.
<p>
<p> But in recent years, ACIR has lost stature, influence, and resources. In 1986, 
Congress cut ACIR's budget by 53 percent. Most recently, Congress considered 
eliminating all funding and sharply reduced it further. Today, ACIR sometimes 
has trouble attracting a quorum to its meetings.
<p>
<p> The ACIR's decline is just one reason--albeit a symbolically important 
one--why state and local officials view the federal government as unconcerned 
about the intergovernmental effects of its decisions. More important are the 
federal government's decisions about how much money to give states and 
localities, how to package that money in grants and other programs, and 
how to require that states and localities offer services that Washington 
cannot afford to provide itself.
 <UL>
</UL>
<p><H3>THE HEALTH OF THE SYSTEM IS IN QUESTION</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
<p> The health of our intergovernmental system may strike some as a boring, 
merely philosophical matter. In fact, the importance of a well-functioning 
intergovernmental system can hardly be overstated. We cannot achieve the 
National Performance Review's (NPR) broad goals--cutting red tape, putting 
customers first, empowering employees to get results, and cutting back to 
basics--without a new approach to intergovernmental partnership in 
delivering services to the public.
<p>
<p> In addition, a well-functioning system is central to Americans' quality 
of life and Washington's ability to pursue a domestic policy agenda. 
Americans spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year to implement
 public policies at all levels of government. Hundreds of thousands of 
dedicated public employees, along with thousands of other committed 
citizens, work hard to solve human and societal problems, helping one 
another and striving to build a better country.
<p>
<p> Despite all of these efforts and money, Americans increasingly feel 
that public institutions and programs aren't working. In fact, serious 
social and economic problems seem to be getting worse. The percentage 
of low-birth-weight babies, the number of single teens having babies, 
and arrest rates for juveniles committing violent crimes are rising; 
the percentage of children graduating from high school is falling; 
welfare rolls and prison populations are swelling; median incomes for 
families with children are falling; more than half of children in 
female- headed households are poor; and 37 million Americans have no 
basic health care coverage or not enough.
<p>
<p> Why? At least part of the answer lies in an increasingly hidebound 
and paralyzed intergovernmental process. A significant number of federal 
domestic programs are administered through federal grants to state and 
local governments--for everything from wastewater treatment to well-baby 
care--or through income transfers administered jointly by federal and 
state governments. Together, these grant and income transfer programs 
will amount to an estimated $226.1 billion in fiscal 1994. Notwithstanding 
years of debate at all levels about grant consolidation and simplification, 
the number of grant programs--now more than 600--continues to escalate. 
Of these programs, 451--75 percent--are grants of $50 million or less.[Endnote 1]
 <UL>
</UL>
<p><H3>DUPLICATION AND OVERLAP</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
<p> So, too, do the problems of duplication and overlap. Take, for instance, 
the case of federal programs designed to help children and their families. 
Today, 10 departments and two independent agencies administer more than 140 
such programs. More than 15 percent of them are directly administered by the 
federal government, more than 40 percent by state governments, and another 
40 percent by local, private, or public groups.[Endnote 2]
<p>
<p> Unfortunately, the myriad of federal mandates and regulations that accompany 
grant programs are cumbersome and very costly to administer, lack a coordinated 
implementation strategy between levels of government, and are not achieving the 
intended outcomes. Each separate program has its own array of rules and 
regulations that must be observed, regardless of their impact on the 
effectiveness and quality of customer service. States and localities 
have limited ability to customize service delivery by integrating programs 
because of competing, often conflicting federal rules and requirements that 
accompany each grant program.
<p>
<p> In Cincinnati, for instance, local officials were working to restore a severely 
blighted but historical area. They were using federal Community Development Block 
Grant funds in conjunction with public and private resources to create new and 
rehabilitated affordable housing for residents of the area. But when they sought 
to combine these activities with federal job training funds to hire and train 
unemployed persons in the construction industry, conflicting federal regulations 
got in the way.[Endnote 3]<p>
<p>To the taxpayer "a tax is a tax" and "a service is a service" regardless of 
which level of government is responsible. Reinvention of the federal government
 must recognize this reality and must place a high priority on improving 
government management at all levels. <UL>
</UL>
<p><H3>INCREASED MANDATES</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
<p> Meanwhile, Washington has increasingly imposed mandated requirements and 
regulations (often without adequate funding to cover costs) to help realize
 policy objectives. As of December 1992, at least 172 pieces of federal 
legislation were imposing mandates on states and localities. "The federal 
government's own fiscal weakness has not made it any less eager to tell 
states and localities what to do," wrote Alice Rivlin. "Indeed, when its 
ability to make grants declined, the federal government turned increasingly 
to mandates as a way of controlling state and local activity without having 
to pay the bill."[Endnote 4]<p>
<p> A Vision for the Future. In a perfect world, we would consolidate the 
600 federal grant programs into broad funding pools, organized around major 
goals and desired outcomes--for example, safe and secure communities, a 
competitive workforce, healthy and self-sufficient families and children, 
or a clean environment. In addition, we would streamline administrative 
mechanisms, providing flexibility to account for regional differences and 
the diversity of needs; ensuring accountability by measuring performance 
and outcomes, not transactions and errors; and driving program design and 
management responsibility down to the point of contact between government
 and the end consumer. <p>
<p> To create this perfect world, we would have to massively reform the 
existing system of intergovernmental grantmaking. Such a reform would 
touch every federal department and agency, every congressional committee
 and subcommittee, every special interest and advocacy group, and each
 and every one of the thousands of states, counties, cities, townships,
 and special purpose districts across the country. <UL>
</UL>
<p><H3>Opportunity for Change</H3>
 <UL>
</UL>
<p> Previous reform efforts, mainly designed to consolidate grants and 
reduce administrative red tape, have largely flopped. President Reagan 
achieved limited success in his early efforts to create a system of 
block grants, but subsequent efforts to expand the model to other 
categorical programs have almost universally failed.<p>
<p>While the political obstacles to enacting such proposals continue 
to seem almost insurmountable, an opportunity for change may be at 
hand. Even Congress itself is becoming exasperated with the micromanaged 
nature of grantmaking.[Endnote 5] As one congressional staffer noted, 
"There is a tremendous pent-up legion of followers in Congress [and 
elsewhere] if forceful leadership is provided . . ." Recent actions, 
such as passage of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
Act, demonstrate some willingness by major congressional committees to 
approach grantmaking more rationally. In addition, the National Governors'
 Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures have developed 
a proposed grant consolidation plan, the spirit of which many see as feasible 
to provide increased flexibility to states and localities.<p>
<p> Even with an enthusiasm for change that breaks sharply with history, the 
federal government will not achieve its goals easily or quickly. We cannot 
achieve improvements solely, even primarily, through federal action. As a result,
 each partner in the system must work collaboratively with the others-- federal, 
state, and local--to refine the concepts and recommendations outlined in this
 report. Such collaboration has already begun; in mid-1993, President Clinton
 and Vice President Gore held discussions with the nation's governors and mayors.<p>
<p>
<H3>Goals of Change</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
<p> Specific solutions can be perfected and refined over time, but the basic 
needs are, and have been, clear for more than a decade:<p>
<p> 1. The number of categorical grants must be reduced;
<p>
<p> 2. Governments at all levels (but especially the federal government) must reduce 
the degree to which unfunded mandates are imposed on other levels of government;
<p>
<p> 3. Program rules and regulations must be fundamentally rethought and their focus
 changed from compliance to outcomes, from sanctions to incentives; and <p>
<p> 4. Federal interdepartmental and intergovernmental collaboration must be actively
 facilitated if any real improvement in government's credibility is to be successful.<p>
<p> The federal government will have to work with states and localities to define a 
more viable federal partnership, find the optimal balance between flexibility and 
accountability, while simultaneously addressing the budget constraints imposed by the 
federal deficit. <p>
<p> Federal, state, and local government attention should focus on mutually agreed-upon 
measurable outcomes for public service delivery. The intergovernmental relationship 
should be a partnership, not an adversarial or competitive system. Federal financial
 support should be provided to achieve broad goals, but also should provide latitude 
and flexibility in how to accomplish them and be tailored to real local needs. Rather
 than defining accountability by inputs, transactions, error rates, and failure to
 progress, the federal government should hold state and local governments accountable 
for performance. The system should support and reward what works, rather than imposing
 rules and sanctions on the majority because of errors or omissions by the minority.
<p>
<A NAME="index2"><H3>Recommendations</H3></A>
<p>
<p> In this report, we offer the following five broad recommendations on how to improve the system:
<p>
<p> --improve federal grant administration through simultaneous bottom-up and top-down initiatives;
<p>
<p> --cut red tape and eliminate roadblocks by allowing waivers of regulations that 
detract from accomplishing program objectives or interfere with effective service delivery; <p>
<p> --simplify cost reimbursement procedures, saving time and money;
<p>
<p> --eliminate needless paperwork by simplifying the compliance certification 
process and the common grant rule on small purchases; and
<p>
<p> --reinvent ACIR and promote collaboration between the federal government and
 its state and local partners across federal policymaking and administration.<p>
<p> If implemented, our recommendations will result in:
<p>
<p> --savings in overhead and administrative costs at all levels;
<p>
<p> --much greater flexibility up and down the line to design solutions that work;
<p>
<p> --more effective concentration of limited resources; and most importantly
<p>
<p> --a much greater likelihood that federal, state, and local objectives will be achieved.

</UL>
<p><H3>Improve the Delivery of Federal Domestic Grant Programs Background</H3>
 <UL>
</UL>
<p><H3>Background</H3>
<p>
<p>In the past 12 years, the trend toward federal categorical grantmaking
 has escalated dramatically-- to more than 600 federal grant programs that
 will spend an estimated $226.1 billion in fiscal year 1994. Some grants are 
distributed on a formula basis; many others on a competitive or discretionary
 basis; and still others as entitlements depending upon the enrollment of 
eligible participants.
<p>
<p> Federal grantmaking is not an end in itself. Funds are intended to 
promote federal policy objectives and contribute to the resolution of 
real problems affecting real people. Yet, state and local governments, 
and the clients and customers of the programs these federal funds 
support, face a maze of different and sometimes contradictory rules,
 regulations, administrative procedures, and program standards and
 requirements across this myriad of grants.
<p>
<p><H3>NEED FOR CHANGE</H3>
<p>
<p> The current system of federal grantmaking fragments the ability of government at 
all levels to address people's needs in an integrated manner. By establishing discrete 
and often incompatible eligibility standards, and administrative rules and requirements, 
the proliferation of categorical grants has made government at all levels less effective.
 Block grants, intended to overcome some of the limitations of categorical programs, 
are not immune from red tape and unintended consequences. These problems have 
contributed to the frustration of individuals and families that depend on 
federal assistance, and have added to taxpayer and customer cynicism about 
government's ability to manage.
<p>
<p> For example, there are more than 140 federal programs directed toward 
assisting children and their families. These funds are administered by 10 
different federal departments and two independent agencies. According to a
 Congressional Research Service report, over 15 percent of the programs are 
directly administered by the federal government, more than 40 percent are 
administered by state governments, and another 40 percent of the programs 
are directed through local private or public groups.[Endnote 1] The largest 
number of programs are aimed at providing educational and social service 
support. The largest amount of dollars, however, is designated for income 
support and nutritional programs. Each federal grant program has a distinct 
definition as to who it is intended to serve. For example, programs such as
 Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps are aimed at
 children and their families that meet specific income criteria--although 
the definition of income and assets differs for the two programs. In other
 programs, such as the social services block grant, recipients may be 
children or children and families or certain unrelated adults.<p>
<p><H3>The Evolution of Fragmentation</H3>
<p>
<p> Government programs are established as needs are identified. For
 example, a job training program is established to train the high school
 drop-out so that she or he can obtain a job and support the family.
 Another program is established to help someone recover from drug abuse,
 be rehabilitated from injuries in an accident, or recover from a crime.
Yet another program is established to help a person obtain safe, decent,
 and sanitary housing that is affordable. All are worthwhile programs.<UL>
</UL>
<p> But government service providers are hamstrung to integrate these
 programs if the customer happens to be the same person. Programs are 
operated by separate agencies (often in different geographic locations),
 by separate people with different expertise, and in accordance with rules
 and regulations developed and overseen by different federal agencies.
 <p>
<p> In the past few years, there has been increasing recognition at all 
levels of government that individuals and families, subordinate governments,
 special districts, and businesses and corporations may simultaneously be the 
client of a wide variety of programs. The failure to see the intergovernmental
 system from the perspective of the citizen-customer not only perpetuates 
inefficiency and wasted time, effort, and money, but also leads to poor
 program design and a significantly reduced probability that the goals and
 outcomes desired will be achieved.<p>
<p><H3>Example of Fragmentation</H3>
<p>
<p> One by one, block and categorical grants and their accompanying rules
 and regulations may make sense; but in combination they often defeat the 
very purpose for which they were established and undermine, rather than 
enhance, the ability of service providers and managers to be truly 
accountable for outcomes.
<p>
<p> For example, the Job Opportunity in Basic Skills (JOBS) program is funded through
 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is administered at the 
local level by social services departments. The JOBS goal is to help citizens become 
self-sufficient (get jobs) by providing education, work experience, job search training,
 and job placement.
<p>
<p> The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) is funded through the Department of Labor
 and is administered at the local level by community groups known as Private Industry
 Councils. The goal of this program is to help citizens become self-sufficient by 
providing training that leads directly to employment.
<p>
<p> Although these programs are intended to be compatible, they are seldom used
 together because: 1) they have different accounting requirements, 2) they have 
different evaluation procedures, 3) they have different eligibility requirements,
 and 4) funds from the two programs cannot be pooled. A person wishing to take 
advantage of both programs, therefore, must go to two sites and be qualified under
 each program's guidelines. Then they must attempt to arrange the training they
 need under the programs and coordinate them. On an administrative level, the 
programs require separate staff, separate offices, and other supporting costs.
 Consolidation of the programs would benefit the customer, the community, and 
the federal government.
<p>
<p> Or take, for example, a recent situation where local officials were working 
to restore a severely blighted but historic area of a city. Federal Community 
Development Block Grant funds were being used in conjunction with local public 
and private resources to create new and rehabilitated affordable housing for 
residents of the area. The city wanted to combine these housing and community
 redevelopment activities with federal job training funds to hire and train 
unemployed persons in the construction activity. However, this was not possible
 because of the conflicting regulations of the separate federal 
programs.[Endnote 2]<p>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. Create flexibility and encourage innovation by designing a bottom-up
 solution to the problem of grant proliferation and its accompanying red 
tape. (3)
<p>
<p> For decades, top-down proposals to solve the problems of federal grant 
management and administration have been offered. Most have failed, or failed
 to be completely effective, because of a combination of special interest
 politics, lack of effective inter- departmental planning and decisionmaking 
at the federal level, and competing and sometimes conflicting needs and 
priorities among and between other levels of government. The National 
Performance Review believes that the approach to the problem should be 
turned, quite literally, upside down.
<p>
<p> Instead of concentrating federal efforts on revamping all 600
 grants, reconciling the thousands of rules and regulations, and 
anticipating every possible instance when flexibility and latitude
 might enhance actual program outcomes at the state or local level,
 the responsibility of identifying the obstacles and designing the
 best solution should be given to the states and localities themselves.
<p>
<p> Let the grant consolidation solutions come from the bottom-up,
 in response to actual barriers and obstacles in the field. Create 
a partnership that offers administrative and regulatory relief when
 and where it really matters, and let the learning that process could
 generate gradually build a body of knowledge about how the overall 
system can or should be reformed.
<p>
<p> Precedent for "bottom-up-type" local initiative exists in some 
individual federal agencies and programs. EPA is experimenting with
 greater flexibility and latitude in meeting regulatory and grant 
requirements; the Job Training Partnership Act provided for fairly
 extensive local public-private partnership and autonomy; the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) provides
 for some greater local discretion.<p>
<p><H3>Challenging Assumptions</H3>
<p>
<p> Notwithstanding some of these experiments, the bottom-up concept will 
challenge many long standing federal attitudes and bureaucratic assumptions:
<p>
<p> --states and localities can't be trusted to protect minority rights and
 ensure fairness and equity;
<p>
<p> --if the federal government doesn't punish errors and omissions they will
 become the norm--federal systems have to prevent errors (even if it means 
impeding results);
<p>
<p> --statutory and administrative rules and regulations can control 
jurisdictions or grant recipients otherwise inclined to fraud, waste,
 and abuse;
<p>
<p> --each and every congressional committee and federal department
 and agency has a right to design its own standards and priorities--regardless
 of how it affects the citizen-customer;
<p>
<p> --the federal government is more competent and exercises better 
judgment than state and local elected officials and managers;
<p>
<p> --flexibility and latitude are inconsistent with performance and 
delivery on national programmatic goals; and
<p>
<p> --the federal government can design how best to do things, as well 
as the overall outcomes desired, from desks and offices in executive 
agencies and the halls of Congress in Washington, D.C.
<p>
<p> Each of these notions has had merit at points in our history and 
with respect to specific, often notorious cases of abuse. But they do
 not provide a foundation for reinventing government or refocusing our
 collective intergovernmental effort toward outcomes instead of process.
<p>
<p> To create a bottom-up solution, federal legislation will be required.
 Omnibus legislation that authorizes states and localities to consolidate 
funding streams and reconcile contradictory rules as a matter of right (for
 smaller amounts) and as a matter of federal-state-local negotiation for
 more complicated and comprehensive proposals should be the goal.
<p>
<p> Incentives should be provided in the legislation to encourage states 
and localities to design solutions from the citizen-customers' 
perspective--to integrate services at the point of contact between
 citizen- customers and the government and to eliminate their own state
 and local bureaucratic barriers to more effective outcomes.
<p>
<p> Partnership should be the hallmark of the proposal-- between the 
federal and lower levels of government, and among and between the public, 
private, and private non-profit sectors at the service delivery level. 
Incentives to obtain broad stakeholder commitment to new ways of service 
delivery and to reduce paperwork, monitoring, and process controls should
 be designed.
<p>
<p> At the same time legitimate federal interests must be protected and 
compliance with broad cross-cutting regulations (equal employment opportunity, 
worker health and safety, for example) ensured. By focusing on what outcomes 
should be rather than precisely how to achieve them, both the flexibility 
needed of states and localities and the need to protect legitimate federal 
interests can be met.<p>
<p><H3>Reviewers of the bottom-up concept have raised a number of legitimate 
concerns and questions:</H3>
<p>
<p> --What funding streams will be included?
<p>
<p> --If states and localities are allowed to consolidate some smaller 
amounts and reconcile regulatory conflicts associated with them as a matter
 of right, how high or low should the threshold be?
<p>
<p> --How can accountability to Congress and federal departments be 
ensured?
<p>
<p> --How can yet another bureaucratic structure and more process to
 implement such a program be avoided?
<p>
<p> --How will these recommendations be affected by, or can they affect,
 administration initiatives in the area of health and welfare reform?
<p>
<p> --How would conflicting eligibility standards be reconciled and what
 are the potential consequences of letting states and localities choose 
the least restrictive rules?
<p>

<p> Each of these issues can be successfully addressed if federal, state,
 and local officials collaborate on drafting the necessary legislation and
 pursue its implementation in good faith. The following suggests how a 
bottom-up solution could work--it is intended to be illustrative rather
 than prescriptive.
<p>
<p><H3>How Consolidation Would Work</H3>
<p>
<p>
 After a grant award of federal funds has been made to a state, or local 
government agency, that recipient agency may elect to consolidate all or
 part of the grant program with another program serving the same customers.
[Endnote 3] To be eligible for consolidation, the following requirements 
must be met:
<p>
<p> 1. The integrated program must demonstrably address the national 
objectives set forth in the legislation authorizing the federal program
 to be consolidated.
<p>
<p> 2. The consolidating agency must define in writing, after appropriate
 consultation with stakeholder groups having an interest in the program, 
the measures of effectiveness that will be used to evaluate the success 
of the consolidated program.
<p>
<p> 3. If the federal program being consolidated is small (each individual 
grant under $10 million), the consolidation is triggered by written 
notification to the responsible federal awarding office (and state agency, 
if applicable) of the decision to consolidate. The awarding office may 
respond with comments within 30 days. The notification must:
<p>
<p> a. Describe the way in which the consolidation will
 provide effective integration of service delivery,
 including appropriate descriptive information about the integrated
 program, such as information about the customers served or area covered;
<p>
<p>
b. Explain how the consolidated program will demonstrably address the
 national objectives of the federal program so consolidated; and
<p>
<p>
c. Define the measures of effectiveness that will be used to judge 
the success of the program.
<p>
<p> 4. If the federal program being consolidated is large, i.e., any 
individual grant over $10 million, the federal awarding office(s) 
(and state, if applicable) must approve the proposal to consolidate.
 Procedurally, the consolidating agency will notify each responsible 
federal (and state) agency, providing the same information required 
for small bottom-up consolidations.
<p>
<p><H3>Other Features of the Bottom-up program</H3>
<p>
<p> To ensure consistency with federal priorities and interests and to
 minimize red tape:
<p>
<p> --The cross-cutting requirements with which grant recipients must 
comply (e.g., civil rights compliance) would be unaffected by this approach.
<p>
<p> --Regular reporting on progress or service delivery goals to both
 federal agencies and congressional committees is assumed.
<p>
<p> --One of the primary impediments to effective service delivery 
integration is the confusing array of often conflicting rules and 
regulations. Under the concept of bottom-up grant consolidation, 
the consolidating agency is authorized to resolve any conflict 
between the statutes or regulations of consolidated programs, by
 selecting which statute or regulation will be followed. The intent
 is to empower the integrating state or local agency to resolve such 
conflicts in favor of a customer-oriented program of service.
<p>
<p> --A state or local government that has successfully integrated, or 
which demonstrates plans to effectively integrate, a federal grant program 
with other services will be accorded preference in future discretionary 
funding of the consolidated program.
<p>
<p> --A federal program that is administered through states is eligible 
for consolidation at the point of service delivery. If the consolidating
 agency is a unit of local government, the state as well as the responsible
 federal agency must be notified of the consolidation, and on large 
consolidations should be included in the decisionmaking review.
<p>
<p> 2. Support proposals for Federal-State Flexibility Grants. (3)
<p>
<p> While NPR advocates a broadly based bottom-up grant consolidation 
option, it will not be suitable or desirable for many jurisdictions where 
current accounting standards, contradictory rules, etc. are not major
 problems. Even in these cases, however, improvement in the overall 
system of grants administration can reduce cost and improve administrative
 effectiveness. Complementary to the bottom-up approach, NPR also recommends
 support for consolidation proposals that provide increased flexibility to 
states and localities that complement federal programs.
<p>
<p> One such proposal, developed by the National Governors' Association 
(NGA) and National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), would 
consolidate ". . . approximately 55 existing programs, with a funding
 level of approximately $12.9 billion in fiscal 1993, into flexibility
 grants in six broad areas: education reform, workforce quality, air 
and land environmental management, water quality, defense conversion,
 and housing." The proposal is designed to respect the jurisdictional
 authority of congressional committees (see Appendix B).[Endnote 4]
<p>
<p> The NGA/NCSL proposal was intended to affect only funds going to 
state recipients, although local government advocates are concerned that some 
pass-
 through monies may be affected. NPR's support for flexibility grants 
is conditioned upon the fact that there be no increase in grant funds 
going to overhead costs, or a related diminution in program allocations
 at the point of service delivery--concerns held by local governments 
that now receive some of these funds directly from the federal government.
<p>
<p> 3. Establish a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new 
initiatives in community empowerment. (2)
<p>
<p> In order to improve the implementation of federal domestic service 
delivery, the President should establish a Cabinet-level Enterprise 
Board. The Board would lead the federal government in a new effort to 
improve the coordination and integration of major domestic program 
service delivery initiatives. This board will be committed to solutions
 based on "bottom-up" initiatives and will approve large, cross-agency 
bottom-up grant consolidation proposals generated by state and local 
agencies, as well as by federal agencies. The board will be responsible 
for coordinating the administration's community empowerment agenda, 
beginning with the nine zones and 95 enterprise communities that passed 
Congress as part of the President's economic plan.[Endnote 5] The board
 will empower innovative communities by reducing red tape and regulation 
of federal programs.
<p>
<p> The board should be chaired by the Vice President. The Assistant to 
the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for 
Economic Policy should serve as vice-chairs. The following cabinet-
 level officers should serve as members of the board:
<p>
<p> Secretary of Commerce
<p>
<p>Secretary of Labor
<p>Administrator of EPA
<p>
<p>Attorney General
<p>
<p>Secretary of HUD
<p>
<p>Secretary of Education
<p>
<p>Secretary of Agriculture
<p>
<p>Secretary of HHS
<p>
<p>Secretary of the Interior
<p>
<p>Director of OMB
<p>
<p>Administrator of SBA
<p>
<p>Secretary of Transportation
<p>
<p>Secretary of Treasury
<p>
<p>Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy<p>
<p>
Chair, Council of Economic Advisors
<p>
<p> It is recommended that the board include as regular, ex-officio members, 
representatives of state and local government and the private non-profit sector.
<p>
<p> NPR recommends additional flexibility to give federal agency heads more 
discretionary authority to improve service delivery by waiving rules and 
regulations. This new authority also will provide additional incentives for
 cabinet officers to collaborate on overall improvements in service delivery.
 In addition to the Cabinet-level Enterprise Board, agency heads should 
collaborate by bringing management teams together outside of Washington,
 closer to the point of service delivery, and by working with their 
intergovernmental partners, state and local governments, to improve 
the service delivery system.

<p>
 Reduce Red Tape Through Regulatory and Mandate Relief
<p>
 Background</H3>
<p>
<p> The number of new requirements imposed on state and local 
governments have increased dramatically during the last decade.
 As of December 1992, at least 172 separate pieces of federal 
legislation were in force that imposed mandates on states and 
localities--many of which were partially or wholly unfunded.
[Endnote 1] Facing a growing burden of complying with new 
unfunded requirements while experiencing severe budget 
constraints, state and local governments are demanding relief.
<p>
<p> There is no more constant complaint by states and localities 
about any federal practice than the imposition of unfunded mandates 
on lower levels of government. In Reviving the American Dream, 
Alice Rivlin notes that: "The federal government's own fiscal 
weakness has not made it any less eager to tell states and 
localities what to do. Indeed, when its ability to make grants 
declined, the federal government turned increasingly to mandates 
as a way of controlling state and local activity without having 
to pay the bill."[Endnote 2] She goes on to say: "Mandates add to 
citizen confusion about who is in charge. When the federal 
government makes rules for state and local officials to carry out 
[whether or not they have the resources to do so], it is not clear 
to voters who should be blamed, either when the regulations are 
laxly enforced or when the cost of compliance is high."[Endnote 3]
<p>
<p> The ability of federal departments and agencies to grant 
regulatory and mandate relief is more limited than many may 
appreciate. Authority to waive programmatic regulations is 
currently limited to research and demonstration projects under 
the auspices of the secretaries of Health and Human Services 
and Agriculture (and is statutorily granted in the Social Security 
and Food Stamps laws, respectively). While some latitude exists 
for other agency and department heads to modify, extend, and 
adjust executive regulations and compliance deadlines (e.g., in 
the Environmental Protection Agency), the majority of the most
 onerous federal mandates and regulations are statutorily imposed, 
affording little room for negotiation or flexibility.
<p>
<p><H3>Need For Change</H3>
<p>
<p> As in the case of categorical grant programs, while each 
individual mandate and regulation may seem justified and reasonable, 
in combination they impose burdens on states and localities that 
make it less likely, rather than more likely, that overall federal
 goals can be met. The cumulative impact may force states and 
localities to adopt cost-ineffective strategies simply to achieve 
simultaneous compliance, or forgo the ability to make real progress 
toward critical benchmarks because they lack sufficient resources 
to simultaneously achieve all the goals set by the statutorily or
 administratively required deadlines.
<p>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. Give cabinet secretaries and agency heads the flexibility 
to authorize selective relief from regulations or mandates. (3)
<p>
<p> Legislation should be enacted to allow federal management 
flexibility over domestic service delivery policies.[Endnote 4] 
The Government Performance and Results Act addresses this issue
 in part by encouraging "management and flexibility waivers."
 However, greater latitude is needed. The execution of domestic
 public policy requires that managers have the freedom to manage, 
to weigh the issues involved when program requirements are in
 conflict, and to make operational decisions to best realize
 policy objectives in the dynamic world of implementation.
 Legislation to authorize greater executive discretion toward 
these ends will markedly enhance the ability of administrators 
to achieve desired national policy outcomes, because they will
 be able to significantly improve the efficiency of the 
intergovernmental service delivery systems.
<p>
<p> It should be noted that special federal concern has been 
expressed about the extension of waivers to entitlement 
programs.[Endnote 5] These concerns should be given serious consideration.
<p>
<p> 2. Issue a regulatory executive order addressing the problems
 of unfunded federal mandates and regulatory relief. (2)
<p>
<p><H3>The new executive order should:</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. Establish that new federal policy will limit the use of 
unfunded mandates in legislative proposals and in regulations. 
An executive order that narrows the circumstances under which
 departments and agencies can impose new unfunded burdens on 
subordinate governments is required to set the tone for a new 
partnership and to signal the administration's commitment to 
reform in this area.
<p>
<p> 2. Direct federal agencies to review their existing regulations 
for the purpose of reducing the adverse impacts and removing barriers
 to effective service delivery.
<p>
<p> 3. Reemphasize that the Office of Management and Budget has
 the responsibility to assure that the adverse impact of major 
new regulations or legislation proposed by the executive branch
 be considered in advance of adoption.
<p>
<p> 4. Establish a collaborative process, including regular 
meetings with the director of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), involving federal, state, and local 
officials, to work together to evaluate the effects of major 
existing and proposed mandates and regulations, and to serve as 
a forum for developing solutions to identified problems (see 
FSL06: Strengthen the Intergovernmental Partnership).

<p>
 Simplify Reimbursement Procedures for Administrative Costs of 
Federal Grant Disbursement
<p>
 Background</H3>
<p>
<p> Approximately $19 billion of federal grant funds is used to 
reimburse states and localities for administrative costs. Administrative costs include:
<p>
<p> --the federal portion of expenses states incur to administer 
public assistance programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent
 Children (AFDC), Medicaid, and Food Stamps;
<p>
<p> --the direct and indirect administrative expenses associated 
with federal formula and block grants; and
<p>
<p> --the indirect costs of the various state departments that 
administer federal discretionary grants.
<p>
<p> State and local governments account for administrative costs 
under a system established 25 years ago through OMB Circular A-87, 
"Cost Principles for State and Local Governments," which sets forth
 principles, standards, and processes for determining charges to federal grants.
<p>
<p> Because states and localities incur costs that benefit both the 
particular jurisdiction and a wide variety of separate federal 
programs, a complex allocation process is used to determine the
 equitable distribution of these common costs between the states 
and federal government, and across multiple federal grant programs.
<p>
<p> OMB Circular A-87 requires states to develop a cost allocation 
plan that must be reviewed and approved by the federal Department
 of Health and Human Services (HHS), to determine:
<p>
<p> --the dollar amount of central services (e.g., purchasing, 
personnel management, and financial management) to be allocated 
to the various state departments; and
<p>
<p> --the methodology for determining the amount of charges for
 central services that are funded on a billed or fee-for-service basis.
<p>
<p> In addition, state agencies administering federal public 
assistance funds must receive prior HHS approval of plans for 
allocating administrative costs among the various programs that 
they administer.
<p>
<p> A number of large local governments must also receive advance
 approval of cost allocation plans. Other local governments 
receiving federal assistance are required to develop cost allocation
 plans and indirect cost proposals, and retain them for audit. 
Also, each state agency receiving federal funds negotiates an 
indirect cost rate with the federal department from which it 
receives the largest amount of funds.
<p>
<p><H3>Need for Change</H3>
<p>
<p> Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the system in
 controlling costs, as well as the accounting and allocation
 burdens the current system imposes, have been documented in
 the General Accounting Office (GAO) and HHS audit reports 
and expressed by federal, state, and local officials in interviews.
<p>
<p> Since 1980, administrative costs have often grown disproportionately 
compared to the growth in programs. Faced with their own fiscal pressures, 
many states and localities have explicitly pursued policies for administrative 
cost maximization, sometimes using consultants and firms specializing in 
federal cost reimbursement maximization strategies.
<p>
<p> A healthy debate exists about these strategies--with states and 
localities arguing that they are simply claiming their fair share after 
years of unintentional underreporting, and federal managers asserting that 
this is simply gaming the system. Either way, there is little question 
that uncontrolled growth in administrative costs could continue indefinitely 
in the face of severe federal deficit constraints.
<p>
<p> The HHS inspector general has also concluded that not enough is being 
done at federal and state levels to ensure that only allowable costs are
 being paid. The inspector general estimates that hundreds of millions of
 dollars in reimbursements have been paid historically for costs that would 
be disallowed if the federal government had the time or resources to conduct 
exhaustive and detailed audits. However, in the past several years, the staff
 resources available in HHS to audit as well as to review and approve cost 
allocation plans and negotiate indirect cost rates has decreased significantly,
 further diminishing the federal capacity to oversee the system.
<p>
<p> An HHS audit report states that the system for accounting for 
administrative costs has ". . . grown arcane and has slowly degenerated 
into a highly technical accounting and allocation maze."[Endnote 1] 
Clearly, the existing system is overly burdensome for both state and 
local governments. For example:
<p>
<p> --Huge disparities exist among and between jurisdictions.[Endnote 2]
<p>
<p> --States are often required to negotiate indirect cost rates with 
as many as 14 separate federal agencies.
<p>
<p> --Thousands of cost allocation plans are prepared annually for no
 purpose other than satisfaction of OMB Circular A-87 requirements
<p>
<p> --Significant costs are incurred at the state and local levels to 
administer the costing methods such as random moment time studies 
required by the plans.
<p>
<p> Various approaches to changing the system have been considered by 
members of Congress, OMB, HHS, the Congressional Budget Office, the 
National Association of State Budget Officers, and the National
 Governors' Association, among others. In the past, no single proposal
 has had sufficient support for adoption. Nevertheless, there remains
 broad consensus that change is badly needed.
<p>
<p><H3>Action</H3>
<p>
<p> Modify OMB Circular A-87 to provide a fee-for-service option in 
lieu of cost reimbursement. (2)
<p>
<p> OMB should modify Circular A-87 to give states and localities the
 option of electing a fixed fee for service in lieu of the current
 method of administrative and overhead cost reimbursement.
<p>
<p> This approach would fix the rate of administrative costs for 
individual states and localities based on each jurisdiction's experience,
 but allow total fees paid to increase or decrease in proportion to 
program expansion and contraction. The measure to which administrative
 costs are most sensitive (e.g., the number of clients, number of
 payments, program costs expended) would be determined for individual programs.
<p>
<p> The actual administrative costs would be ascertained for individual 
states and localities for a base period, and expressed as a percentage
 or unit cost of the measure identified.[Endnote 3] Administrative fees 
would be paid in the form of a lump sum from each program by applying this
 percentage or dollar amount to the selected program measure for each year.
[Endnote 4] Although states or localities would have to absorb any deficits 
in relation to actual costs, they would retain any savings that they could
 develop through efficient management practices. This would maximize 
incentives for cost containment and efficiency and provide an opportunity
 for gainsharing by more efficient jurisdictions.
<p>
<p> An administrative fixed fee system reduces expenses by eliminating 
costly preparation and submission of allocation plans and indirect cost 
proposals, as well as by eliminating the applicability of federal 
requirements for maintaining cost records and reporting, and federal 
audits of administrative costs. Further, the fixed fee approach ensures 
that future changes in administrative funding are proportionate to program 
growth, increasing the predictability of federal costs and concentrating 
precious resources on service delivery. The system would also provide new 
incentives for cost efficiencies in states and localities.
<p>
<p> We estimate half the governments will elect the fee for service option, 
leading to federal savings of $3.3 billion over five years.

 Eliminate Needless Paperwork by Simplifying the Compliance Certification 
Process
<p>
 Background</H3>
<p>
<p> States and localities are required to provide assurance of compliance 
with 18 cross-cutting federal requirements contained in the SF-424,
 "Application for Federal Assistance," every single time a grant application
 is submitted to an individual federal agency. In addition, there are other
 cross-cutting assurances not contained in the Standard Form. 
These assurances, which consist of two pages in the standard federal
 grant application for state and local governments, stipulate that the 
applicant will comply with statutes such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
 the Hatch Act and the Davis-Bacon Act (see Appendix C). States and 
localities submit thousands of grant applications each year and are 
currently required to recertify each time.
<p>
<p><H3>Need for Change</H3>
<p>
<p> Thousands of pages of duplicative certifications are being needlessly 
prepared, processed, and stored every year.
<p>
<p><H3>Action</H3>
<p>
<p> Simplify grant compliance certifications by modifying OMB's requirements. (2)
<p>
<p> OMB should modify Circular A-102, "Grants and Cooperative Agreements 
to State and Local Governments," to require that the common grants management
 rule provide that all cross-cutting certifications may be submitted by 
incorporating them by reference into grant applications. Further, OMB should
 modify the SF-424 to eliminate the assurances and to add the following 
statement: "By virtue of this signature, the applicant certifies that 
it: 1) incorporates into the application by reference the cross-cutting 
assurances contained in the common rule; and 2) will comply with the assurances."

 Simplify Administration by Modifying the Common Grant Rules on Small Purchases
<p>
 Background</H3>
<p>
<p> Currently, OMB Circular A-102, "Grants and Cooperative Agreements to
 State and Local Governments," sets a limit of $25,000 in the aggregate 
for the use of small purchase procedures by local governments to secure 
services, supplies, or other property.[Endnote 1] Small purchase procedures 
allow a grantee to use relatively simple and informal procurement methods 
(e.g., obtaining price or rate quotations over the phone from an adequate
 number of qualified vendors).
<p>
<p><H3>Need for Change</H3>
<p>
<p> Local governments have found the $25,000 limit to be overly 
restrictive, especially for the purchase of small vehicles that often 
exceed this amount. For example, to procure one small van with federal 
funds to satisfy Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, grantees
 must formally advertise and solicit sealed public bids. This requirement
 delays the procurement process and prevents grantees from acquiring 
rolling stock quickly.
<p>
<p><H3>Action</H3>
<p>
<p> Modify OMB Circular A-102 to require that the common grants management 
rules increase the dollar threshold for small purchases by local governments
 from $25,000 to $100,000. (2)

<p>
 Strengthen the Intergovernmental Partnership
<p>
 Background</H3>
<p>
<p> To develop a seamless and high quality system of public services 
for the 21st century, the federal, state, and local governments must 
work together in fundamentally more effective ways than has historically 
been the case.
<p>
<p> Even though the institutional support historically provided at the 
federal level for intergovernmental collaboration has been less than 
perfect, it has been even further eroded during the past decade. 
Intergovernmental offices in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
 and the General Accounting Office (GAO) were cut significantly. 
Funding and political support for the Advisory Commission on 
Intergovernmental Relations has been radically reduced, and its 
credibility and quality of objective analysis undermined. Congressional 
governmental operations committees have moved their focus away from 
complicated and often contentious intergovernmental issues, while the 
Executive Office of the President and departmental intergovernmental 
relations staff have, in recent years, increasingly turned their 
attention to constituent service issues, rather than substantive 
intergovernmental policy--let alone service delivery or problem-solving
 concerns.[Endnote 1]
<p>
<p><H3>Need for Change</H3>
<p>
<p> The decline of intergovernmental institutional support systems has
 resulted in a sense among state and local officials that the federal 
government is unconcerned about the intergovernmental effects of its 
decisions. This is reflected in the decreased communication and lack 
of effective input into federal decisionmaking in both the executive 
and legislative branches.
<p>
<p> Twenty years ago, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations (ACIR) was a prestigious and heavily used advisory institution,
 producing numerous analytical reports on the intergovernmental impact of
 federal policy. The intergovernmental forum that ACIR initiated was 
eventually strengthened with the establishment of intergovernmental 
offices in OMB and GAO.
<p>
<p> In recent years, ACIR has lost stature, influence, and resources. 
For example, in 1986, the House Appropriations Committee reduced ACIR's 
budget by 53 percent. And, in the past five years, ACIR has not had a 
quorum at more than one quarter of its meetings.
<p>
<p> Some have argued that ACIR should be allowed to die a peaceful death.
 Yet, when you examine the law originally creating ACIR, its mission and
 purpose seem directly relevant to today's critical issues of intergovernmental
 service delivery, problem solving, and effective performance. The original 
charter sought to:
<p>
<p> --bring together representatives of the federal, state, and local governments 
for consideration of common problems;
<UL>
</UL>
<p> --provide a forum for discussing the administration and coordination 
of federal grant and other programs requiring intergovernmental cooperation;
<p>
<p> --give critical attention to the conditions and controls in the 
administration of federal grant programs;
<p>
<p> --make available technical assistance to the executive and legislative
 branches of the federal government in the review of legislation to determine
 its overall impact on the federal system;
<p>
<p> --encourage discussion and study at an early stage of emerging public 
problems that are likely to require intergovernmental cooperation;
<p>
<p> --recommend the most desirable allocation of governmental functions,
 responsibilities, and revenues among the several levels; and
<p>
<p> --recommend methods of coordinating and simplifying tax laws and 
administrative practices to achieve a more orderly and less competitive
 fiscal relationship between the levels of government and to reduce the
 burden of compliance on taxpayers.
<p>
<p> Under the charter, ACIR's membership is bi-partisan, with elected 
and appointed officials from the federal, state, and local levels, as 
well as citizen members. The members are appointed by the President, 
Speaker of the House, or President of the Senate. While all of the 
vacancies for the current two-year membership have been nominated or 
filled, they have not been selected in a coordinated or focused process.
<p>
<p><H3>ACTIONS</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. Reinvent the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations (ACIR) and charge it with responsibility for continuous 
improvement in federal, state, and local partnership and 
intergovernmental service delivery. (2)
<p>
<p> ACIR has a relevant charter, a framework for true intergovernmental 
collaboration, and the potential for continuous improvement and performance
 measurement of the intergovernmental partnership. The institution does not
 need to be abandoned; it should be reinvented to provide an ongoing vehicle
 for bipartisan intergovernmental policy debate and research.
<p>
<p> Its mission needs to be more clearly focused on performance measurement, 
long-term improvements in intergovernmental grantmaking and regulation, and 
assessing intergovernmental fiscal impact. The President should work closely 
with the Speaker of the House, the Vice President, and representatives of the
 organizations that have traditionally nominated the membership (National
 Governors' Association, National League of Cities, etc.) to collaborate in
 identifying a slate of candidates for the next full-year term (FY 1994) who
 are unequivocally committed to service delivery improvement and management 
reform. Citizen members should be drawn from both the private and private 
non-profit sectors. Elected and appointed members should be officials with 
a demonstrated commitment to innovation and cost-effective delivery of public
 services. Congressional members should have a demonstrated interest in 
government performance and accountability, as well as a commitment to 
legislative reform and modernization.
<p>
<p> A strong staff with extensive federal and/or state and local experience
 should be recruited and should-- from inception--work very closely with the 
Cabinet-
 level Enterprise Board (discussed earlier) on issues of mutual interest. A 
reinvented ACIR could become the honest broker among and between competing 
and sometimes conflicting state and local interest, and competing or
 uncoordinated federal executive and legislative agencies. Its primary 
approach should be one of facilitation, supported by high caliber research
 and policy analysis as well as broad executive and legislative outreach.
<p>
<p> In the next five years, a reinvented ACIR should design broader
 solutions to the grant proliferation problem and--in cooperation with 
strong existing bodies like the National Academy of Public 
Administration--accumulate evidence of best practices in the public
 sector and ensure their dissemination to policymakers and managers alike.
<p>
<p> Finally, ACIR should be encouraged to establish task forces and
 provide opportunities for a wide range of federal, state, and local
 elected and appointed officials to offer policy advice, service
 delivery ideas, and participate directly in the activities of the Commission.
<p>
<p> 2. Develop appropriate benchmarks and performance measures to 
improve the understanding of public service delivery effectiveness. (2)
<p>
<p> The President should direct the Cabinet-level Enterprise Board
 and/or request ACIR to provide leadership in developing a systematic
 process to define and measure national benchmarks. States and 
localities that have not already done so should be encouraged to 
initiate such efforts. Such benchmarks, performance, and outcome 
measures should be incorporated into federal budget practices as 
a part of the effective implementation of the Government Performance
 and Results Act of 1993, recently signed into law by the President.
<p>
<p> Several actions can help move the nation in this direction. 
Development of national economic and social benchmarks can give 
all levels of government a clear framework for policy choice and 
priority setting. A focus on citizen-customers of federal programs 
can help government to rethink and redesign more effective 
intergovernmental program solutions. And better, more programmatic
 systems for budget planning and implementation can help to 
reinforce the outcome focus in intergovernmental collaboration.
<p>
<p> 3. Convene meetings which draw together leaders from federal, state, 
and local governments to review, refine, and advance the intergovernmental 
recommendations of the National Performance Review. (2)
<p>
<p> This report envisions a transformation of federal and intergovernmental
 service delivery. To implement the concepts outlined here will require 
concerted bipartisan effort over a decade or more. This effort won't happen
 easily. And it won't happen at all without an understanding and commitment
 to the reforms at all levels of government.
<p>
<p> In August 1993, the Vice President presented a preliminary version of 
these recommendations to state and local elected and appointed leadership 
attending the 1993 National Governors' Association Conference in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. There was great interest in, and support for, the general 
direction of these recommendations. Participants suggested that the 
President convene a meeting as soon as possible to review these concepts,
 to develop specific legislative recommendations, and to determine the 
steps necessary to move forward quickly.
<p>
<p> Meetings should include representation from Congress, the cabinet, 
other senior federal officials, and chief executives and legislative 
leaders from state, county, and local general and special purpose 
governments throughout the country.

<p> Proposal for Federal-State Flexibility Grants Developed by
 Governors and State Legislatures [Endnote 1]<UL>
</UL>
<p>
<PRE>
The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500


Dear Mr. President:
  In response to your vision for restructuring government, the 
National Governors' Association and the National Conference of 
State Legislatures are pleased to submit a "Proposal for Federal-State 
Flexibility Grants." These flexibility grants, which we are asking 
you to include in your fiscal 1994 budget request to Congress, would
provide states with more opportunities to innovate and to tailor 
responses to the unique needs of our citizens.

  These grants could be a first step toward broader, more ambitious
reforms. Flexibility grants would allow state legislators and governors 
to integrate funding from several different sources. They would encourage
state governments to design their own strategies for moving forward on a
range of domestic issues. They would relax stifling federal restrictions
and would allow state leaders to focus once again on solving problems 
rather than on processing stacks of federal paperwork.

   The enclosed proposal would combine approximately 55 existing programs,
with a funding level of approximately $12.9 billion in fiscal 1993, into
flexibility grants in six broad areas: education reform, workforce quality,
air and land environmental management, water quality, defense conversion,
and housing.

   We believe that there are many other programs that could be combined in 
this way. In developing this proposal, we have attempted to be pragmatic.
We have deliberately avoided possible flexibility grants that would cause
questions concerning jurisdiction of congressional committees. We have 
also eliminated grants that involve local governments.

   The flexibility grants would help reverse unfortunate trends toward 
centralized decisionmaking in our federal system, encumbering programs with 
unnecessary stipulations and regulations, and fragmented and inefficient 
spending for domestic programs. The nation's governors and state legislators 
look forward to working with you in refining this proposal and in moving it 
through Congress.
 
   Please feel free to contact either one of us or Ray Scheppach or Bill Pound, 
our organizations' executive directors, if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

Roy Romer
Governor of Colorado
Chairman, NGA

Minority Leader,

</PRE>
<H3>Federal-State Flexibility Grants</H3>
<p>
<p> The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National 
Governors Association have worked together over the past years to 
protect and improve the states' ability to innovate and to deliver 
services effectively and creatively. NCSL, for example, has promoted 
federal legislation that would limit unfunded federal mandates. NGA 
has campaigned for the Leahy-Pryor bill to ensure an expedited federal 
waiver process for states. Together, in 1990, the organizations developed 
comprehensive and detailed proposals for consolidating several existing 
federal aid programs to state governments.
<p>
<p> A common theme pervades these and other projects. Governing in the 
United States works best when it is shared appropriately among federal,
 state, and local governments. We believe that states must have the 
flexibility to innovate and to respond to the unique and diverse needs 
of their residents. We believe that programs and services are most effective 
when it is clear which level of government is accountable for them.
<p>
<p> The change currently taking place in Washington offers fresh
 opportunities to adopt remedies for problems affecting the state-federal
 partnership. Among the problems are:
<p>
<p> --the proliferation of relatively small categorical grants;
<p>
<p> --the burden of legislative and regulatory requirements attached to
 block grants;
<p>
<p> --the rigidity of current federal grant programs and the concomitant 
restrictions that hamper states' ability to respond to the unique needs of their residents;
<p>
<p> --federal statutes and regulations that prevent states from transferring
 funds among related programs;
<p>
<p> --shrinking federal financial support for domestic discretionary programs; 
and
<p>
<p> --the accelerating propensity of the federal government to mandate additional 
services and programs without adequate funding.
<p>
<p> In combination and alone, these problems stifle innovation, confuse 
accountability, and degrade public services.
<p>
<p> There are several ways to attack these problems. One, which has enjoyed
 varying degrees of bipartisan support over the past two decades, combines 
into a single grant two or more federal programs dealing with related problems.
<p>
<p> There are several current examples: the child care block grant, the 
community development block grant, and the social services block grant. 
In his 1990 State of the Union address, President Bush proposed combining
 more programs into $12 to $15 billion worth of consolidated grants. In 
Mandate for Change, David Osborne has advocated consolidating "more than 
400 categorical and block grants into broad Challenge Grants."
<p>
<p> This proposal, developed jointly by the National Conference of State 
Legislatures and the National Governors' Association, offers several 
specific, albeit modest, suggestions for beginning this process of 
consolidation. In addition, it proposes changes to other existing 
federal programs, such as streamlined and coherent waiver processes,
 that also would improve the effectiveness and accountability of programs.
<p>
<p> The proposal's six sections deal with education, workforce, environment,
 housing, defense conversion, and social services. The suggestions are 
consistent with criteria used in 1990 by NCSL and NGA to select programs
 for consolidation. In the interest of expediting consideration of these
 suggestions, we have also tried to respect, as much as possible, the 
jurisdictional authority of congressional subcommittees and committees.

<p> A. Financing the Implementation of Education Reforms
<p>
<p> Option 1: Education Reform Flexibility Grant
<p>
<p>Background
<p>
<p> The longest standing and largest block grant to states and localities
 for elementary and secondary education is provided under Chapter Two of
 the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This grant for 
improving elementary and secondary programs was expanded through both
 the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 and the 
Elementary and Secondary Schools Improvement Amendments of 1988. 
Using the Chapter Two program as a point of departure, this proposal
 combines into a single grant the programs aimed at education reform
 that are coordinated by the states.

<p>
<p> Option 2: Incentive Grants for State-Level Education Reform
<p>
<p>Background
<p>
 The longest standing and largest block grant to states and localities

<p>
Proposal.
<p>
 Permit states to treat funds allocated under several federal 
categorical programs as a single supplementing flexibility grant 
for elementary and secondary education. The grant serves as an incentive
 for states to initiate or continue existing systemic reform efforts 
directed toward achieving the National Education Goals. To merge funds
 from two or more programs, states would be required to submit to
 the Secretary of Education a plan identifying current and future 
statewide initiatives facilitating state-level education reform and
 the achievement of the goals. The state plan would include assurances
 that services currently provided to discrete populations under the 
separate programs would remain consistent with the level of 
appropriation provided for those programs. Specific programs
 would include the following:

<p>
<p> Option 3: General Waiver Authority
<p>
<p> Background
<p>
 Currently, the Secretary of Education has minimal waiver authority 
to provide states with the regulatory relief needed to permit state-level
 systemic reform in education.
<p>
<p> Elementary and Secondary Education.
<p>
 Provide the Secretary of Education with general authority to waive 
regulations in selected programs. States would be required to submit
 a plan outlining current and future systemic reform efforts along 
with a request to waive specific regulations. The Secretary could 
waive regulations in the following program areas: Chapter Two, Jacob
 Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act, Drug Free Schools and 
Communities Act, Head-Start Transition Act, Follow Through Act, 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Math and Science Act, Carl Perkins Vocational
 and Applied Technology Act, Job Training Partnership Act, Emergency
 Immigrant Education Act, National School Lunch Act, and the Child Nutrition Act.
<p>
<p> No limit would be placed on the number of states that could apply
 for waivers. A similar proposal was offered in the Neighborhood Schools 
Improvement Act.
<p>
<p> Postsecondary Education.
<p>
 Provide states with the authority to target State Student Incentive 
Grants by assisting students enrolled in teacher education programs 
that are training high quality teachers, both pre-service and 
in-service, consistent with the state's systemic reform effort. 
The SSIG program is the only direct funding source for states in 
the postsecondary education area. The remaining dollars are granted
 to students and institutions based on financial need. In fiscal 
1993, $72.5 million was appropriated.
<p>
<p> Justification.
<p>
 By providing such waiver authority, states can proceed with systemic 
reform efforts in the absence of federal barriers.
<p>
<p> B. Improving Workforce Quality
<p>
<p> Option 1: Workforce Improvement Flexibility Grant
<p>
<p> Background.
<p>
 Presently there are 125 different federal employment and training 
programs for adults and out-of-school youth administered by 14 different 
federal agencies. At a time when states and localities are attempting to
 offer comprehensive, customer-driven services, they are constrained by
 the differing eligibility, reporting, and program requirements of the 
myriad programs.
<p>
<p> Proposal.
<p>
 States with Human Resource Investment Councils could be permitted to 
access a Workforce Improvement Flexibility Grant, providing funds for 
a wide range of workforce development programs and sidestepping a 
multitude of conflicting program requirements. Governors in a number 
of states have established state Human Resource Investment Councils 
to coordinate adult and vocational education and job training programs. 
The state councils were authorized by federal law this fall, and a 
number of states are still in the process of creating them. States that
 have established Human Resource Investment Councils are, by definition,
 engaged in a great deal of coordination across existing systems. Instead 
of accessing job training and adult and vocational educational monies 
through existing program, if the Human Resource Investment Council so 
recommends, the state could take advantage of a Workforce Improvement 
Flexibility Grant. By giving sign-off to the Human Resource Investment
 Council, the key players will have bought into the flexibility grant.
<p>
<p> States opting for the Workforce Improvement Flexibility Grant could 
access a single source of funds to provide adult and vocational education 
and job training and placement services as long as the state satisfies 
certain accountability measures.
<p>
<p> In states where either there is no Human Resource Investment Council 
or where the council does not want to access the Workforce Improvement 
Flexibility Grant, monies would continue to flow through existing programs.

<p>
<p> A number of criteria could be adopted to ensure accountability, 
including the following:
<p>
<p> --Funds could be made available to the state only upon submission 
of a state plan that demonstrates how funds will be used to foster
 workforce quality.
<p>
<p> --States could be required to distribute to local communities the
 same proportion of funds that otherwise they would have been required
 to allocate.
<p>
<p> --States could be required to serve individuals with special needs
 to the same degree that they would have otherwise, for example, homeless 
individuals, disabled individuals, migrant workers, and veterans.
<p>
<p> --States could be required to file annual reports to provide sufficient 
data for the legislative oversight of the states' use of funds under the 
block grant.
<p>
<p> Option 2: Workforce Quality Waivers
<p>
<p> Background.
<p>
 Presently, there are a multitude of definitions, reporting requirements, 
performance standards and the like that inhibit the provisions of a 
coordinated system of workforce training services.
<p>
<p> Proposal.
<p>
 States that have established Human Resource Investment Councils should 
be permitted to apply for waivers from law and regulations of, for 
example, the Job Training Partnership Act, the Carl Perkins Vocational
 and Applied Technology Education Act, the JOBS Program authorized in 
the Family Support Act, the National and Community Service Act, the 
Adult Education Act, the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, the Stewart 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (which authorizes a job training 
program for the homeless), the Wagner-Peyser Act (the Employment Service), 
and the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program authorized in the Food
 Stamp Act. States should be eligible to apply for waivers that would 
facilitate improved services, specifically waivers from regulation or 
law that prevent the application of consistent practices across programs.
<UL>
</UL>
<p> The waiver authority should include protections relating to, for 
example, the distribution of funds and eligibility for services.
<p>
<p> To facilitate an interdepartmental approach to waivers, a federal
 council should be established that includes, for example, the 
Secretaries of Labor, Education, HHS, and Agriculture.
<p>
<p> Justification.
<p>
 Both the Workforce Improvement Flexibility Grant and the Workforce 
Quality Waivers will enable states to integrate more effectively a 
variety of state and federal programs designed to provide adults and 
youth with opportunities for education and training throughout their
 lifetimes.
<p>
<p> C. Target High-Priority Environmental Needs Through Flexible Funding
<p>
<p> Background
<p>
 The President's fiscal 1993 budget includes a total of more than $500
 million for 15 separate EPA grants to states for the management of 
environmental programs. These grants are for the administration of 
specific programs for clear air, clear water, and hazardous waste. 
Generally these categorical programs require funds to be spent on 
specified activities, regardless of the particular conditions or 
relative importance of those activities in a given state. For 
example, funds are available for hazardous waste management and 
only that purpose, even though in a particular state environmental 
and public health protection may be better served by investing in 
air pollution control instead of hazardous waste management.
<p>
<p> PROPOSAL.
<p>
 Two flexibility grants are proposed: air and land resources and 
water resources. In addition to water-
 related environmental management grants, the water flexibility 
grant includes the State Revolving Fund program for construction 
of sewage treatment plants.

<p>
 Justification.
<p>
<p> Consolidation of these categorical grants into two block grants, 
with flexibility for states to allocate available funds among the 
programs within each block, would enable states to better prioritize 
their efforts and reflect the specific environmental conditions and 
needs in the state. The block grants also would eliminate separate 
applications and allow better targeting of state programs on 
high-priority environmental problems. In particular, resources 
could be used more easily to address multifaceted, related aspects
 of environmental problems in a specific geographic area by focusing
 attention on the area to be protected (e.g., an urban area or an 
estuary) rather than on its individual components (e.g., its air 
or its wetlands).
<p>
 D. Increasing State Involvement in Defense Firm Conversion and Adjustment
<p>
<p> BACKGROUND.
<p>
 The fiscal 1993 Defense Authorization Act and Defense Appropriations 
Act together created over 25 programs, committees, or task forces devoted
 to assisting workers, businesses, and communities cope with reductions 
in federal defense spending. States play a role in assisting each of these
 affected groups. However, this proposal is directed only toward programs
 aimed at using federal funds to assist businesses adversely affected by 
the defense downsizing.
<p>
<p> PROPOSAL.
<p>
 Consolidate these newly created programs into a smaller number of more 
flexible programs. Specifically provide an opportunity for states to 
serve as partners in determining feasible projects, developing 
industry-university-government consortia and regional cooperative 
efforts, and locating affected firms. Existing state programs are 
accessible to small and medium-sized firms that could most effectively
 be assisted through these programs.

<p>
<p> Alternative: Administrative Action to Promote State-
 Federal Partnership
<p>
<p> Administrative action could be taken to direct the Department 
of Defense and other affected agencies to draft regulations that 
permit states to work in partnership with the federal government 
in implementing these programs. This might include language 
permitting states to apply for waivers from categorical program
 requirements to utilize these funds in implementing comprehensive
 defense conversion programs. Another option could be language
 making states key players in the awarding of competitive grants,
 especially where state matching funds are involved.
<p>
<p> JUSTIFICATION.
<p>
 Several states have already invested in programs to assist 
companies based in their states to convert from defense-related 
production to commercial production. Nearly all states have 
established public programs or public-private programs in some
 of these areas: promoting technology diffusion among companies;
 technology transfer from research laboratories into business
 applications; manufacturing extension services; and business
 modernization through adopting existing technologies and 
adopting modern business practices (just-in-time inventory, 
total quality management, etc.).
<p>
<p> Businesses seeking assistance in defense conversion could easily 
contact state programs that would work with the federal government to
 establish priorities and develop successful program models and 
strategies. As partners, states could assist in implementing national
 defense conversion/ adjustment programs by matching business needs
 with available expertise, by developing partnerships and consortia 
to carry out conversion projects, or by evaluating competing proposals.
 States could become effective managers of these efforts. The federal 
government would save time and money and ensure greater access to 
assistance for small- and medium-sized businesses by developing an 
effective state-federal partnership.
<p>
<p> E. Increasing Access to HOME Affordable Housing Program Funds
<p>
<p> BACKGROUND.
<p>
 The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was established by 
the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. Designed as a federal, 
state, and local partnership to ensure more housing for low-income 
persons and families, HOME was intended as an incentive for states 
and localities to take a stronger role in providing affordable housing.
 Currently 40 percent of HOME funds flow to states. However, statutory 
and regulatory requirements make this an expensive program to administer,
 especially for a relatively new program.
<p>
<p> PROPOSAL.
<p>
 By amending the HOME program, both through regulatory changes and statutory 
changes, the federal government could achieve its goal of more affordable 
housing, and states and localities could better use the funds to meet local
 needs. Simplifying the program, making the targeting consistent with other
 housing programs, reducing the paperwork requirements, and reestablishing
 states and localities as primary partners would increase state participation
 in the program. Onerous regulatory requirements for the comprehensive housing 
affordability strategies (CHAS), which must be filed each year for program 
eligibility, are only one example. Others include a controversial fund transfer
 and accounting scheme, a bias against new construction through stiffer 
matching requirements, and prohibitively expensive project oversight 
requirements. Partial improvements were achieved through legislation in 
1992. However, action at this time could ensure that HOME funds are utilized 
across the country.

<p>
<p><H3>Alternative: Regulatory Relief within the HOME Program</H3>
<p>
<p> BACKGROUND.
<p>
 By administrative action alone, the administration could improve 
the efficiency of the HOME program. Current CHAS regulations need to 
be simplified or waived for states to allow submission of state planning
 documents that address many of the same issues as the CHAS but in a 
much more efficient manner. HUD could work with states on sections of 
the plan that HUD found deficient and that related to the top priorities
 of both HUD and the state. Regulations for HOME also could be streamlined 
to encourage project development. By establishing simple and clear guidelines
 for project eligibility, states and local jurisdictions could readily
 determine the applicability of HOME funds to a given project. Efforts 
to attain consistency with other programs, such as the low-income housing
 tax credit or mortgage revenue bonds, would also help.
<p>
<p> JUSTIFICATION.
<p>
 The HOME program was established because more affordable housing is 
universally recognized as an important component to solving the problem 
of homelessness. However, complicated program restrictions have deterred
 many jurisdictions from applying for funds. For example, existing HOME 
restrictions were aimed at guaranteeing that funds not be directed only 
toward new construction; that state match be made only of general revenues;
 that state funds be included in each and every project where HOME funds
 were directed; that states establish five-year plans to meet housing needs
 and publicly state where their resources would be directed, even though 
federal funding levels remained uncertain; that a percentage of the funds 
be utilized by community organizations whether or not they existed in all 
communities; that states would collect data on homeless individuals 
including whether drugs, alcohol, mental illness, or family abuse contributed 
to their homelessness; that states develop more extensive inventories of
 existing housing to determine not only the location of housing in need of
 rehabilitation, but whether such housing is occupied by elderly citizens,
 families with children, racial minorities, etc. Many of these are good
 public policy goals, but together they create an unmanageable and 
unrealistic burden. Easing these requirements and promoting a genuine 
partnership would ensure more affordable housing and a more cost-effective 
use of scarce public funds.
<p>
<p> F. Consolidating Efforts Within the Motor Carrier Safety Program
<p>
<p> BACKGROUND.
 Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program funds are distributed by formula 
to states that have adopted compatible federal safety regulations. The state 
match is 20 percent. Under review this year, federal hazardous materials 
safety permit and registration programs have been slow to start. Flat fees 
are levied on shippers and carriers and are used to finance state emergency 
response grants. State and local governments also operate hazardous materials
 permit and registration programs. The scope of these programs is restricted 
by federal law which limits state and local governments to collecting fees 
that are "reasonable and used for transportation related purposes."
<p>
<p> PROPOSAL.
 Consolidate programs related to motor carrier safety enforcement, inspection,
 permitting, and registration requirements. Eliminate duplicative reporting 
requirements and unify state oversight of all motor carrier safety.

<p>
<p><HR>
<p>
<p> JUSTIFICATION.
 States presently perform the preponderance of motor carrier 
safety inspection and enforcement. This includes efforts related 
to hazardous materials transportation as well. The elimination of 
the dual registration and permit programs to enable state to 
administer programs under federal uniform standards would allow 
states to consolidate all enforcement efforts under one widely 
implemented program structure, the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program.
<p>
<p> The Programmatic, Financial, and Administrative Structure of the
 Flexibility Grant
<p>
<p> PROPOSAL
 Programmatic Structure. Flexibility grants are intended to increase 
the effectiveness of programs by allowing state government greater 
conformity in the design and delivery of services. To provide such 
conformity, flexibility grant authorizing legislation should:
<p>
<p> --Include a clear statement of purpose, including goals for the 
flexibility grant and a description of the measures that will be used 
to judge the effectiveness of the use of flexibility grant funds. 
(Such legislation should leave to states the specification of the 
services and programs to be used to accomplish those purposes.)
<p>
<p> --Clearly define any limits on financial eligibility for service
 under the flexibility grant. (Such legislation generally should not 
include categorical eligibility requirements, programmatic earmarks, 
or other nonfinancial eligibility criteria not directly related to the
 purpose of the flexibility grant.)
<p>
<p> --Authorize limited transfer of funds among or between flexibility
 grants to provide the conformity to accommodate differences in state 
priorities. For example, 15 percent of flexibility grant X could be used
 for flexibility grant Y.
<p>
<p> Financial Considerations. While flexibility grants increase state 
options and simplify administration, there is a continuing concern 
regarding the stability and responsiveness of future congressional 
appropriations. There is also a concern that uncertainty regarding 
federal audit standards may unnecessarily reduce flexibility and 
innovation. To address these concerns, flexibility grant legislation should:
<p>
<p> --Make initial allocations of funds based on the application of 
current formula.
<p>
<p> --Provide funding to allow for the upward adjustment in allocations 
based on the use of 1990 census data in the calculation of formula payments.
<p>
<p> --Provide funding to allow for the upward adjustment in allocations 
based on increases for at-risk or targeted populations included in current formula.
<p>
<p> --Guarantee at least level funding plus the rate of inflation for a 
period of five years. This could be done by enacting a permanent 
appropriation or an entitlement.
<p>
<p> --Should federal or state audits determine that flexibility grant
 funds are being spent in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the
 flexibility grant, allow the funds subject to an audit exception to remain
 available for acceptable purposes for a period of 12 months subsequent to 
the determination.
<p>
<p> --If flexibility grants contain matching requirements or
 maintenance-of-effort provisions, provide that such requirements an
d provisions be waived during severe economic downturns. Otherwise the 
inability of states to provide matching funds or maintain existing program
 funding levels would result in a reduction in federal support.
<p>
<p> Administrative Requirements. Flexibility grants are intended to 
improve government efficiency by reducing unnecessary and duplicative 
administrative expenses. To accomplish those ends, it is critical that 
new and existing flexibility grants address the following concerns:
<p>
<p> --Funds should be made available to the states upon submission of a 
state plan that demonstrates that funds will be used in a manner consistent
 with the authorizing legislation.
<p>
<p> --In general, federal mandates should be limited to those directly 
related to the flexibility grant itself. If other requirements are to be
 imposed, the states should be allowed to certify compliance without the 
submission of a detailed plan.
<p>
<p> --States should be given broad authority to determine the state agency
 or agencies to be held responsible for the administration of flexibility 
grant programs.
<p>
<p> --States should be authorized to use existing legislative or regulatory
 procedures and/or to establish alternative methods to ensure public input 
into the development of a state plan for the use of flexibility grant funds.
<p>
<p> --States should be authorized to use existing state procedures for 
financial management and auditing of flexibility grant funds.
<p>
<p> --States should have the authority to commingle flexibility grant 
funds with related programs as long as the overall purpose of the 
integrated program is consistent with the purpose of the flexibility grant.
<p>
<p> --States should be authorized to establish and/or waive confidentiality
 requirements as necessary to facilitate the integration of programs.
<p>
<p> --Flexibility grant funds may be used to fund their proportionate share 
of consolidated case management activities.
<p>
<p> --Authorizing legislation shall not include limitations on administrative
 costs.
<p>
<p> --Federal approval should not be required for the acquisition of data
processing systems.
<p>
<p> --States should be expected to file annual reports that will provide 
sufficient data for the legislative oversight of the states' use of funds 
under the flexibility grant. Such data should be relevant to the state plan, 
and should not be standardized except as necessary to provide information 
relative to the performance measures established by statute.
<p>
<p> These suggested provisions are based on the assumption that existing state
 law and procedures are sufficient to ensure that funds are expended in a manner
 consistent with legal and political accountability. While it is reasonable for 
the federal government to require assurances that funds are being expended for 
the purposes set forth in federal legislation, there is no need for federal 
intervention in state administrative or legislative processes. Existing state 
programs already manage the distribution of state tax revenues far in excess 
of the value of any federal flexibility grants.

<H3>ENDNOTES</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. This proposal, received from the NGA and the NCSL, is printed here to 
provide examples of Federal-State flexibility grants that meet the spirit of
 NPR's recommendation to consolidate grants in order to increase flexibilities
 to states and localities. NPR does not necessarily endorse all the specifics 
of this proposal, but does indicate support for the concept of grant consolidation.
<p>
<p> 2. This proposal is printed here as it was received from NGA and NCSL. The
 total for Workforce Improvement Grants should read $5,677.0

<Title>Transforming Organizational Structure</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Transforming Organizational Structure</H2>
<p>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p> 
 Management expert Tom Peters says that well-performing organizations 
 should operate with 25 to 75 workers for every one supervisor. Some 
 high-performance organizations have exceeded 100:1. Others, such as 
 General Motors' Saturn, have abolished management positions as we 
 traditionally know them. And the federal government? It has seven 
 workers for every supervisor.
<p>
 This 7:1 ratio reflects the outdated nature of federal management 
 practices as well as its organization of departments and agencies. 
 Other examples of outdated practices abound. Consider this: while the 
 needs of Americans have changed dramatically in the last half-
 century, the federal government's structure of 30,000 field, 
 district, and regional offices has changed little since its creation 
 during the New Deal.
<p>
 Within that structure, outdated practices and relationships remain. 
 In Washington and in the field, offices are burdened by many who are 
 far removed from delivering services to customers (e.g., oversized 
 head-quarters staffs, multiple layers of supervision, and many 
 specialists in the arcane rules of federal personnel, procurement, 
 budget, and finance). The Department of Housing and Urban Development 
 (HUD), for instance, has 13,000 employees--4,000 of them in 
 Washington. In addition, 10 regional offices supervise state and 
 local offices.
<p>
<p>
<b> Models from an Earlier Era.</B> 
 <p>
 In an earlier era, the federal government followed the example of 
 corporate America in building our public institutions. From the 
 1930's through the 1960's, we built large, top-down, centralized 
 bureaucracies patterned after that day's corporate structures. Within 
 these structures, tasks were broken into simple parts, each the 
 responsibility of a different unit of employees, each defined by 
 specific rules and regulations. As a result, government worked well. 
 But times have changed. Now, at a time of rapid change, high 
 technology, tough global competition, and demanding customers, we 
 must once again follow corporate America's lead. Top-down 
 bureaucracies no longer work very well in either the public or 
 private sectors. As cutting-edge businesses have done, we must 
 streamline our operations, cut management controls, and empower our 
 workers.
<p>
 "Organizational structure" refers to the formal and informal patterns 
 of relationships by which an institution organizes work and 
 distributes power. The federal government's organizational structure 
 is rigid, hierarchical, and segmented. It also dilutes individual 
 responsibility. The net effect is insufficient responsiveness to 
 citizen concerns and costly inefficiencies arising from excessive 
 controls that ultimately fail to provide accountability to the public 
 for achieving results. 
<p>
<p>
<b>Barriers to Change</B>
<p>
 Despite a clear need to change the structure within many agencies, 
 barriers exist. Individuals and institutions resist perceived threats 
 to job security and management authority. And internal and external 
 rules and regulations restrict structural changes. For example, the 
 personnel system compartmentalizes work through hundreds of job 
 classifications and discourages teamwork through the way it 
 constructs its individual performance management system. Furthermore, 
 legislation in some cases discourages effective cross-organizational 
 work by imposing constraints, such as not allowing agencies to share 
 the funding of joint efforts.
<p>
 A combination of institutional and legislative constraints often 
 prevents change. For example, while some agencies, such as the Social 
 Security Administration, have had limited success in reforming their 
 field structures, most have not. The Veterans Affairs Department has 
 tried and failed to close underused hospitals. The Agriculture 
 Department has had problems closing field offices in which the costs 
 of administration exceed those of services delivered.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Guiding Principles</b>. 
<p>
 From private and public sector case studies, we find common guiding 
 principles and strategies for implementing change in an 
 organization's structure. To succeed, the agents of change should:
<p>
 ---  organize work around results that customers consider valuable; 
<p>
 ---  shift accountability from the use of rigid, centralized 
 management control systems to a reliance on quasi-market techniques, 
 such as competition among providers, and concentrate on high-quality 
 results; 
<p>
 ---  create partnerships within and between agencies, and create 
 flexible relationships to increase the focus on serving customer 
 needs; and 
<p>
 ---  empower employees with the authority, skills, and information 
 required to do their jobs, and redefine managers' role to that of 
 team leader, coach, or facilitator.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Strategies for Change</b>. 
 <p>
 These four principles underpin, in turn, four strategies that 
 explicitly address organizational structure and have successfully 
 changed large private and public bureaucratic organizations:
<p>
 
 Streamline Structures 
<p>
 The first strategy is to delayer headquarters and streamline field 
 structures. This approach targets administrative costs and positions: 
 such as managers, personnel specialists, budget analysts, procurement 
 specialists, and other headquarters staff positions. These central 
 control positions cost about $35 billion a year in salaries and 
 benefits for the more than 660,000 people involved. Some positions, 
 such as inspectors general, personnel, and procurement specialists, 
 have grown in number while overall federal employment has remained 
 steady. In addition to central control structures in headquarters, 
 many agencies have outmoded field structures. While over 34,000 field 
 offices exist, their service delivery patterns differ by agency. 
 Therefore, careful study is needed to ensure closures contribute to 
 improved service delivery, not just cost savings. 
<p>
 Each agency must make its own administrative reduction decisions 
 based on its knowledge of mission and priorities. However, employees 
 affected by the streamlining, many of whom worked with dedication 
 over the years, should be given every opportunity to redirect their 
 careers, elect separation incentives, accept new assignments and 
 training, or receive quality outplacement services. 
<p>
 
 Reengineer Work Processes
<p>
 This strategy, which often is referred to as "starting over," calls 
 for beginning with a blank sheet of paper and then designing the 
 optimal way to perform a necessary process, regardless of the pre-
 existing system. The process often produces radical change, with 
 functions eliminated or redesigned. Private sector experience 
 indicates that reengineering can sharply reduce internal processes 
 and generate significant change. Federal experience, such as at the 
 Defense Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), suggests great 
 potential for improving performance and reducing costs.
<p>
 
 Create Boundary-Crossing Partnerships
<p>
 Real life needs do not always conform to the existing bureaucratic 
 design of a program. Citizens often need services from more than one 
 department at a time. Problems such as unemployment, crime, the 
 environment, workforce training, and natural disaster relief demand a 
 multi-department response. Cross-boundary partnerships are essential 
 to helping the government address complex problems in a comprehensive 
 fashion without adding programs or creating agencies.
<p>
 
 Create Self-Managing Work Teams
<p>
 In growing numbers of corporations, work teams have replaced 
 traditional management, often dramatically increasing productivity 
 and enhancing the quality of work life for employees. Not all teams 
 are alike in the responsibility and accountability they possess. But 
 highly developed teams control functions once reserved for 
 management: hiring, firing, and promoting; designing work processes; 
 establishing production schedules; setting goals and performance 
 measures; and maintaining quality control. The Agriculture 
 Department, IRS, and the Defense Logistics Agency have successfully 
 piloted work teams.
<p>
 
<p>
<b>Actions to be Taken</b>
<p>
 To transform itself, the federal government must do no less than 
 change its fundamental culture (i.e., values, beliefs, and 
 practices). Acting on these four strategies for organizational change 
 would serve as a strong foundation for cultural change. Accordingly, 
 NPR recommends the following actions:
<p>
 ---  Cut costs related to central management controls by half over 
 five years. Do this, in part, by increasing the supervisory span of 
 control from seven workers per supervisor to 15:1 over this period. 
 In the process, eliminate at least half of the more than 660,000 
 positions in personnel, budget, procurement, headquarters, and other 
 management control categories, and shift a portion of these savings 
 to line positions to increase service delivery. The net result will 
 be the elimination of at least 252,000 positions governmentwide, for 
 a total five-year savings of over $40 billion. The federal civilian 
 workforce would fall below two million by the year 2000, a 12 percent 
 reduction. 
<p>
 ---  Use multi-year performance agreements between the President and 
 agency heads to guide changes in the federal government through 
 streamlining, reengineering, partnering across established 
 boundaries, and empowering teams with authority, skills, and 
 accountability. 
<p>
 ---  Give Congress a list that identifies field offices to be closed 
 due to inadequate use, a need to balance workloads between offices, 
 program changes, or a better matching of resources to needs.
<p>
 ---  Reestablish the President's authority to reorganize agencies. 
 Presidents have had this power periodically since the 1930's. The 
 last authority was granted for one year in 1984 and has not been 
 renewed.
<p>
 ---  Establish high-impact, cross-agency partnerships to address 
 complex service delivery issues. 
<p>
 ---  Remove legislative barriers that inhibit cooperation between 
 agencies.

<Title>Transforming Organizational Structure</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Transforming Organizational Structure</H2>
<p>
<H2> Introduction</H2>
<p> 
 <b>The Existing System</b>
 <p> 
 The existing organizational structure of the federal government is 
 rooted earlier in this century, a time when massive, multilayered 
 bureaucracies were seen as the most effective and efficient approach 
 to managing large, complex organizations.(1) Constraints on 
 transportation, modest education levels within the workforce, and the 
 limited technical ability to collect, display, and transmit 
 information were but some of the factors that led to the creation of 
 a strong, centralized management system where managers did the 
 thinking and workers were expected to do the assigned work without 
 question.
<p>
 We have but to look around us to see that times have changed. Through 
 their participation in a transformed market place, today's citizens 
 have had their expectations heightened. They know good service when 
 they see it.
<p>
 Not surprisingly, each group judges government's performance by these 
 new standards and does not accept the rationalization that government 
 is somehow "different" and, thereby, exempt from a need to change. 
 Yet, neither the government's organizational structure nor its 
 companion management philosophy has kept pace. Work is still largely 
 accomplished through a byzantine system of rules and regulations and 
 a control-based management style.
<p>
 In recent years, a range of initiatives have dramatically transformed 
 many state and local governments, mirroring a similar metamorphosis 
 in the private sector. Yet the traditional cultural values held 
 within the federal government, with a few notable exceptions, resist 
 change and preserve a culture of mistrust and control, operating 
 within a rigid and hierarchical structure. This segmented system 
 separates staff within and between agencies who work on related 
 problems by creating artificial organizational boundaries. This 
 situation exists despite the best efforts of a long series of 
 prestigious commissions and blue ribbon panels tasked by one 
 political party or another to "fix" the government. The traditional 
 organizational values are also premised on improving efficiency by 
 creating internal monopolies--e.g., a single procurement or personnel 
 office to service an entire agency--for better control and economies 
 of scale. But in the private sector, the creation of monopolies is 
 seen as a form of built-in inefficiency.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Transformed Organizational Structure</B>
 <p>
 A transformed federal government needs a new set of principles to 
 shift its values and organizational structure to better focus on 
 customer service. Developing a new set of principles served as the 
 basis for the transformation of successful high-performing 
 organizations in both the private sector and state and local 
 governments. It is time a set of organizing principles be adopted by 
 the federal government. Four of the more important organizing 
 principles for the reinvention of federal agencies are:
<p>
 --Organize work around results that customers consider valuable. 
 Traditional divisions and program groupings within agencies and 
 departments must be dissolved. Work processes and streamlined 
 structures will be cross-functional and team focused. 
<p>
 --Shift accountability from the use of rigid, centralized management 
 control systems to a reliance on quasi-market techniques, such as 
 competition among providers, and concentrate resources on ensuring 
 high-quality results. The federal government needs to shift from its 
 overreliance on administrative controls of inputs to a greater 
 reliance on results. A key approach is to rely more on competition 
 and other quasi-market tools to ensure high-quality results. The 
 implication is that there then would be fewer layers of management 
 and staff review. The resulting control systems will be leaner and 
 flatter and will direct their resources primarily to supporting 
 front-line activities.
<p>
 --Create partnerships within and between agencies and encourage 
 crossing internal and external boundaries to integrate service 
 delivery and policy development. The government should operate much 
 like a "boundaryless company" where the primary loyalty of employees 
 is serving citizen needs and where cross-agency work is 
 commonplace.(2) All relevant contributors and stakeholders should be 
 included in planning and decisionmaking to ensure that approaches to 
 getting the work done are both effective and efficient.
<p>
 --Empower employees with the authority, skills, and information 
 required to do the job, and redefine the managers role to be coach 
 and facilitator. Relieved of many controls and encouraged by their 
 leaders, employees must be able to operate more effectively as 
 individuals and teams and genuinely serve their customers. Employees 
 should operate more in teams that share responsibility for producing 
 results. Managers should help employees maximize their capacities and 
 removing barriers that impede their effectiveness.
<p>
 <p>
<b> Overcoming Barriers to Change</b>
 <p>
 Despite the compelling case for dramatically changing the structure 
 of the Federal government, many barriers exist. People naturally 
 resist change since it disturbs their comfort levels and exposes them 
 to the unknown. Historically, attempts to reform government have 
 resulted in attacking a laundry list of problems without getting at 
 their root causes. Veteran bureaucrats can recall solving the same 
 problems many times before, only to have them become "unsolved" 
 again. Reform efforts, particularly during periods of austerity, 
 usually mean across-the-board cuts that leave organizations with the 
 same responsibilities but fewer resources. However, NPR's 
 streamlining recommendations are intended to change culture and 
 behavior by targeting central control structures that add little 
 value to achieving results.
<p>
 The existing segmented federal structure rewards dysfunctional 
 behavior. When surveyed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
 less than half of federal employees said that they had confidence and 
 trust in their second-level supervisor, although immediate 
 supervisors fared better. Forty-four percent of federal workers 
 surveyed expressed trust in their organization, but only 30 percent 
 thought their organization treated all employees fairly.(3) NPR 
 recommendations in this and other reports address outdated structure, 
 the resulting dysfunctional cultural behaviors, and the effects that 
 current structures and processes have on employees' attitudes toward 
 their organizations.
<p>
 
 Three Sets of Barriers. 
<p>
 The three most commonly cited barriers to change are existing 
 regulations, laws, and concern that "we haven't done it that way 
 before." 
<p>
 First, federal entities often quote their own regulations as reasons 
 not to try new ideas or "think outside the boxes." Agencies often 
 have discretion in how they implement laws, but are frequently 
 restrictive in their interpretations. Regulations are then developed 
 with an emphasis on reporting and policing, rather than 
 accountability. The Forest Service, in a pilot project, found that 70 
 percent of its regulatory "barriers" were self-imposed, and not 
 required by legislation. Other NPR reports (notably, Reinventing 
 Human Resource Management; Mission-Driven, Results-Oriented 
 Budgeting; and Reinventing Federal Procurement) have identified 
 specific ways in which agencies have historically interpreted 
 legislation in a more restrictive manner than necessary. As a result, 
 new ideas and innovation are difficult to implement within this rigid 
 framework and the regulations themselves become an excuse for 
 abandoning more innovative management styles. 
<p>
 Second, legislation is cited by both employees and management as a 
 justification for agencies not to cooperate across organizational 
 lines. However, legislation usually does not prohibit but rather 
 inhibits inter-organizational cooperation.
<p>
 The third barrier, a fear of the unknown, is significant. But most of 
 NPR's recommendations are modeled after successful experiences that 
 have occurred on a small scale in some agencies, or have been 
 implemented in states, localities, the private sector, or other 
 countries that have pursued culture changes analogous to those sought 
 by NPR. The strategies highlighted in this report were chosen because 
 they offer the most hope and best leverage for genuine change on a 
 large scale.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Strategies for Change</b>
 <p>
 Creating a new culture in the federal government will require massive 
 changes in the basic beliefs, values, and practices of federal 
 employees and managers, and, ultimately, American citizens.(4) This 
 new culture--serving customers, empowering employees to achieve 
 results, fostering excellence--must be embedded in all dimensions of 
 governmental operations. However, two fundamental arenas for change 
 will be the internal structure of individual agencies, and the 
 symbols of the old culture of hierarchy, central control, and 
 mistrust.
<p>
 For the most part, NPR has not pursued the traditional reorganization 
 strategy of "moving boxes" between or within agencies. The 
 traditional approach was intended to rationalize service delivery. 
 However, that approach has historically been difficult on a large 
 scale. As a result, NPR's objective has been to improve operations 
 within agencies as the primary vehicle for achieving culture change. 
 Experiences in some states and other countries suggest that this 
 internal culture change needs to precede any successful efforts to 
 "move boxes." One tangible arena for beginning culture change is to 
 change the symbols of the old culture--the "perks" of reserved 
 parking, larger offices, special dining rooms.
<p>
 While there are many approaches to promoting organizational culture 
 change, this report focuses on four strategies that explicitly 
 address organizational structure and have successfully changed large 
 bureaucratic organizations in the private and public sectors:
<p>
 ---  streamline headquarters and field structures,
<p>
 ---  reengineer work processes,
<p>
 ---  create boundary-crossing partnerships,
<p>
 ---  create self-managing work teams.
<p>
 These four strategies for transforming organizational structure and 
 culture are interrelated. Implementing one strategy successfully 
 usually involves using the rest. For example:
<p>
 ---  successful streamlining strategies are generally coupled with 
 reengineering work;
<p>
 ---  most redesigns of work flow lead to delayering and a greater 
 degree of self-management of workers;
<p>
 ---  genuine cross-boundary partnerships depend upon participants 
 with authority to make decisions across organizational boundaries; 
 and
<p>
 ---  establishing self-managing work teams involves the redesign of 
 work, often reduces layers of management, improves communications, 
 and adds to the quality of work life. 
<p>
 As a result, genuine reinvention will require the use of more than 
 one strategy. However, the focus on these four strategies in no way 
 discounts the value or the use of other approaches. In the final 
 analysis, it is principles, not solely strategies, that lie at the 
 heart of transforming the federal culture and organizational 
 structure. 
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Streamline Headquarters and Field Structures</b>
 <p>
 As the recommendations for the National Performance Review (NPR) are 
 put in place and the systems of over-control and micromanagement in 
 personnel, procurement, and financial management are pared back, we 
 must also pare down the organizational structures that go with these 
 systems. Employees and line managers must be empowered to focus more 
 on results than red tape and must authorize those closest to the 
 customer to make decisions. A key strategy for doing this is to 
 streamline agencies' central staff offices in Washington, D.C., and 
 in regional offices. The federal government spends an estimated $35 
 billion annually for salaries, benefits, and the administrative costs 
 of its management control functions. Roughly, one in three federal 
 employees is involved. The job of many of these people is to create 
 and enforce rules. Without dramatically reducing the influence of 
 these people on line managers and workers, reinvention and culture 
 change cannot succeed. As a result, streamlining headquarters and 
 regional offices where most of these control functions are located is 
 essential, and additionally will save money without cutting services.
<p>
 
 It's Not the People. 
<p>
 An aggressive attack on the management control structure must not 
 become an attack on the civil servants employed in these structures. 
 They have been doing the jobs they were asked to do. They deserve an 
 opportunity to redirect their careers, to be retrained and perhaps 
 relocated, and to directly provide services rather than controlling 
 the people who do. If an employee whose job is eliminated cannot 
 retire through an early retirement program, and does not elect to 
 take a cash incentive to leave government service, then every effort 
 will be made to find another job offer, either within the government 
 or in the private sector.(5)
<p>
 
 Headquarters. 
<p>
 The primary objective of streamlining central control structures is 
 to make an organization more effective and responsive. However, one 
 result will clearly be a reduction in the number of employees in 
 positions related to excessive central controls and layers of 
 bureaucracy, many of which are in the management ranks. For these 
 targeted reductions to work effectively, many of the other reforms 
 recommended by NPR will have to be implemented, including: 
 streamlining control systems in the areas of budget, procurement, and 
 personnel; making better use of technology; empowering employees; 
 expanding the use of self-managing work teams; and incorporating 
 market forces into the internal operations of the bureaucracy. 
<p>
 The structures of central management control include oversized 
 headquarters both in Washington, D.C., and in field offices, multiple 
 layers of supervision, and many specialists in the arcane rules of 
 federal personnel, procurement, budget and finance. For example, the 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development has about 13,000 
 employees, of which 4,000 are in its Washington, D.C., headquarters 
 office. In addition, it has 10 regional offices supervising its state 
 and local offices. 
<p>
 Streamlining central control structures should be directed toward 
 reducing the costs of doing business, not just reducing the number of 
 employees. Traditionally, attempts at streamlining based on staff 
 reductions resulted in the preservation of management and 
 administrative positions at the expense of line positions--either by 
 service reductions or by contracting out for line services. The 
 emphasis on reducing administrative costs and specific types of 
 positions provides incentives to reduce high-salaried positions 
 rather than low-salaried positions, and to reduce administrative 
 rather than line positions. 
<p>
 
 Reverse Trend of Growing Central Management Systems.
<p>
 An August 1993 study by the Merit Systems Protection Board indicates 
 that over the past decade personnel specialist positions have 
 continued to grow in number while federal employment has remained 
 relatively constant.(6) This is also true of specialized procurement 
 positions, which grew by 64 percent, from 19,428 to 31,794. At the 
 same time, procurement costs (in constant dollars) grew only 6.5 
 percent, from $188 billion to $200 billion, during the same time 
 period, 1980 to 1992.(7)
<p>
 The growth of management control systems must be reversed because:
<p>
 ---  Layers of control are very expensive. Not considering the 
 counter-productive effect on line managers and workers, the cost of 
 the central control structure is roughly $35 billion annually. About 
 one in three federal employees provides management control. Based on 
 private sector experiences and experiences in several other 
 countries, this could be reduced by half without adversely affecting 
 services to the public.(8) However, some of the potential savings 
 will have to be reinvested in new, quality management systems 
 involving goal setting and benchmarking, in measuring performance and 
 outcomes, and in training.
<p>
 ---  The structures of central control effectively resist cultural 
 change. As Tom Peters notes in Thriving on Chaos, "My co-authors and 
 I in In Search of Excellence and A Passion for Excellence . . . were 
 terribly mistaken . . . in downplaying the importance of structure. 
 Good intentions and brilliant proposals will be dead-ended, delayed, 
 sabotaged, massaged to death, or reversed beyond recognition or 
 usefulness by the overlayered structures. . . ."(9) As a result, the 
 actions NPR proposes are designed to produce their own momentum to 
 overcome bureaucratic resistance. As the red tape is cut, federal 
 workers will become more impatient with the red tape that remains and 
 they will resist reversals of the process.
<p>
 Although streamlining will focus on reducing headquarter and regional 
 staffs, line positions are not completely off limits. A portion of 
 line workers' time is consumed by responding to excessive rules and 
 regulations or by responding to headquarters demands. With fewer 
 rules, regulations, and requests, some line resources will be freed 
 up and available for reduction or more likely, reassignment. For 
 example, Forest Service staff involved in a test project reported 
 that they spent 45-60 days on budget tracking before they reformed 
 their system. They now spend one day a year to achieve the same 
 results.(10) 
<p>
 
 Avoid Monopolies. 
<p>
 Government reformers traditionally seek economies of scale by 
 consolidating and managing along functional lines--one procurement 
 office, one personnel office, one information management office--each 
 with its own hierarchy and chain of command. Abstract numerical 
 analysis can convince decisionmakers that such functional "stovepipe" 
 organizations will yield substantial savings.
<p>
 But in the real world--in or out of government--that organizational 
 strategy fails. Rather than economies of scale, it bears the 
 diseconomies of fragmented authority, and the customer suffers. The 
 local line manager--whose mission is to serve social security 
 recipients, protect the environment, or operate a military base--is 
 completely dependent on an array of monopolies that have different 
 imperatives. He or she cannot replace a leaking steam trap because 
 the procurement office is saving up steam trap requisitions to get a 
 volume discount. He or she cannot quickly hire or promote talented 
 people because the personnel office puts a premium on carefully 
 crafted, technically perfect position descriptions. He or she cannot 
 buy an easy-to-use personal computer because the information 
 management office is working on a state-of-the-art global computer 
 architecture that will be installed any year now. He or she cannot 
 assure local contractors they will get paid for their work because 
 all invoices are being centrally processed someplace in the Midwest.
<p>
 Rather than consolidating staff-level organizations into monopolies, 
 authority should be consolidated in the hands of the line manager. 
 Put the person who is on the scene and responsible for the mission in 
 control of all the functions that go into accomplishing that mission. 
 Giving control means, for example, allowing the line manager the 
 authority to choose among internal providers of service. For example, 
 if one personnel office is unresponsive and expensive, he or she 
 should be able to shift business to a competing personnel office. 
 These techniques are further discussed in other NPR accompanying 
 reports.(11) 
<p>
 
 Delayer. 
<p>
 A variety of indicators can help identify layers of bureaucracy that 
 could be cut. For example:
<p>
 ---  Operations are not readily tied to agency mission or service 
 delivery.
<p>
 ---  Work units have spans of control that are too narrow.
<p>
 ---  The organization has more than nine levels of responsibility 
 from top to bottom.
<p>
 ---  Line employees lack authority to provide responsive service to 
 customers.
<p>
 ---  Managers and their assistants duplicate responsibilities.
<p>
 ---  Headquarter, regional, and district offices perform the same 
 functions.
<p>
 ---  Functions are duplicated within or across agencies.
<p>
 ---  Managers act as "pass through" and not as decision makers.
<p>
 ---  Employees or customers believe service is bottlenecked.
<p>
 ---  Political appointees are stacked within a hierarchy.
<p>
 ---  High-level executives and policymakers micromanage operations.
<p>
 None of these situations mandate delayering. Rather, they signal 
 opportunities for streamlining and improving organizational 
 performance. Where possible, using criteria directly tied to agency 
 mission sends a strong message of intent, such as Postmaster General 
 Marvin Runyon's question: "Do they touch the mail?"
<p>
 
 Increase Span of Control. 
<p>
 A challenging goal of doubling the span of management control from 
 the current seven workers per supervisor to 15 workers per supervisor 
 will also support the goal to reduce structures of central management 
 control. Management expert Tom Peters recommends that well-performing 
 organizations should operate in a range of 25 to 75 workers for every 
 one supervisor. Some high-performance organizations have exceeded 100 
 to one.(12) Some companies, such as General Motors' Saturn, have 
 abolished management positions as we know them. 
<p>
 
 Implications for Streamlining. 
<p>
 Delayering, increasing the span of control, and reengineering work 
 process (discussed in the next section) often lead to reduced 
 workforces. As streamlining decisions are made, guidelines used in 
 the private sector may prove useful:
<p>
 ---  Cut to a plan, not to a number. Clarify the purpose, objectives, 
 and priorities for the streamlined organization. Then eliminate the 
 positions that do not support these priorities, or people who do not 
 have or cannot be taught the skills to meet the objectives.
<p>
 ---  Do it quickly, and do it once. Don't drag it out. It is too 
 painful and distracting.
<p>
 ---  Do it as deeply as necessary. Don't do the minimum. When 
 finished, there must be adequate resources to provide the remaining 
 employees with the necessary training, equipment, and facilities.
<p>
 ---  Redirect as many resources to the front line as possible. 
 Citizen services are a priority and should be protected.
<p>
 ---  Stay lean. 
<p>
 
 Field Office Structures. 
<p>
 There are over 34,000 federal field, district, and regional offices 
 spread throughout the United States. According to a 1992 OMB survey, 
 88 percent of these offices and installations are located in six 
 cabinet agencies (the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human 
 Services, Justice, Treasury, Transportation, and Interior). These and 
 other offices provide a diverse array of functions, including direct 
 service to customers, administrative support, and policymaking. 
 Several departments have multiple, independent sets of office 
 structures, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service and 
 the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Justice Department. Many 
 of the 30,000 federal offices have sound reasons for remaining at 
 their current size and location. However, some offices could be 
 located elsewhere, consolidated with other offices, collocated with 
 offices of another agency, or closed. 
<p>
 The current field office structure was for the most part developed in 
 the 1930's to facilitate popular acceptance of New Deal legislation. 
 Mostly unchanged since then, the field structure does not reflect 
 substantial changes in government services rendered, consumer 
 services demanded, and modern technology. Federal policy and U.S. 
 demographics have evolved more rapidly than the field office 
 structure, causing a mismatch between workload and staffing and a 
 surplus of unnecessary offices and layers of oversight. As consumers 
 demand new services, and agencies are given new missions, office 
 structures need to be rationalized and optimized within resource 
 constraints. This will require agencies to reexamine their missions 
 and reengineer their service and support structures.
<p>
 Periodically, since the 1950's, agencies have tried to reform their 
 field structures. Some, such as the Social Security Administration, 
 successfully transformed their field structures and trimmed staff 
 while enhancing service. But most have not been as successful. For 
 example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has tried and failed to 
 close underused hospitals. Likewise, the Department of Agriculture 
 has faced difficulties in closing offices where the administrative 
 costs to run the office exceed the costs of the services delivered. 
 In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has been 
 forced to maintain offices that it does not want. And the list goes 
 on. 
<p>
 The predominant barriers to change include: congressional concerns 
 about the adverse effects on local economies; agency concerns for 
 maintaining services while trying to fulfill multiple missions; and 
 the lack of a generally accepted process to identify offices for 
 closure. 
<p>
 Fortunately, federal models exist where these barriers have been 
 overcome. For example, the Department of Agriculture's recently 
 developed plan for closing selected field offices is well designed 
 and participative and used objective measures as a basis for 
 decisionmaking. The best federal models focus on both customer need 
 and the mission of the agency, assess future needs in relation to 
 existing structures, permit organizational boundaries within and 
 between agencies to be crossed, and maintain service levels.
<p>
 
 Agencies Must Lead the Effort Themselves. 
<p>
 A central office, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
 has little chance of meaningfully determining where cuts should be 
 made so the right culture changes occur and the wrong service cuts do 
 not occur. Supervisory and administrative positions are woven 
 throughout each agency in a variety of ways, using various job titles 
 and budget codes. Some use centralized staff with identifiable 
 budgets, while other offices disperse support staff and their related 
 costs throughout the agency. For this reason each agency must make 
 streamlining decisions based upon its unique knowledge of those 
 positions that most directly support agency missions and priorities.
<p>
 
 Separation Incentives. 
<p>
 Agencies must also be allowed to use separation incentives to permit 
 them to delayer and reduce positions in targeted areas and at the 
 same time make every effort to help affected employees find another 
 job. Some agencies may have a very high level of response to 
 separation incentives from employees in the targeted positions. These 
 agencies could meet their goals by only offering separation 
 incentives to their central management staffs. Other agencies may 
 have a low response to separation incentives and will need to offer 
 incentives to a much broader number of employees, including line 
 positions. For these agencies, as line managers and workers retire or 
 voluntarily separate from government service, the agencies should 
 provide necessary training to staff in central management control 
 positions and reassign them to line service positions. 
<p>
 
 Performance Agreements. 
<p>
 An agency's knowledge of its own organizational structure should be 
 translated into performance agreements with the President that 
 identify multi-year budget and staff reductions for central 
 management functions such as personnel, management, legal, audit, 
 procurement, financial services, and other administrative areas. 
 These agreements should identify the systemic changes that will be 
 implemented in order to make the reductions feasible. The reciprocal 
 side of the performance agreement should be assistance from the 
 Executive Office of the President in using its executive powers and 
 developing a legislative agenda to help agencies obtain needed 
 flexibility and minimize second-guessing and over-regulation. The 
 Office of the President can also help minimize overreactions to 
 isolated problems and mistakes that have traditionally led to new 
 governmentwide controls.
<p>
 
 Reorganization Authority. 
<p>
 While many of the changes proposed by NPR are targeted to internal 
 changes within agencies, there are some proposals that would require 
 major reorganizations. The Reorganization Act Amendment of 1984, 
 which has lapsed, provided for expedited review of presidential 
 reorganization plans. Congress had a limited period of time to 
 consider the President's plan and pass a joint resolution to approve 
 it, or else the plan died. Under that law, the President could move 
 agencies and/or functions within the existing framework of executive 
 departments. For example, the President could propose consolidating 
 an agency or function under the Department of Agriculture with a 
 similar agency or function under the Department of Commerce. Such 
 authority could expedite action on several recommendations.(13) 
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Reengineer Work Processes</b> 
 <p>
 Process reengineering is the fundamental redesign of work so that the 
 emphasis is on dramatic improvements in performance. Michael Hammer 
 and James Champy, leading proponents of this strategic approach to 
 organizational change, say "It isn't about making patchwork fixes . . 
 . it does mean abandoning long-established procedures and looking 
 afresh at the work . . . required to deliver value to the 
 customer."(14) 
<p>
 The traditional manner of organizing is to create functional 
 specialties, such as personnel and procurement, that segment work 
 across divisional lines. This typically creates destructive 
 competition, lack of effective integration of different functional 
 specialties, and ultimately customer disenchantment. Reengineering 
 shifts from a task orientation to a focus on process and results.
<p>
 The process reengineering methodology begins with a blank sheet of 
 paper and then designs the optimal way of performing the process 
 regardless of the pre-existing system. Process reengineering has been 
 defined as "starting over," as root assumptions underlying the 
 existing processes are challenged. Radical change of the fundamental 
 organizational framework is often the result as unnecessary functions 
 are eliminated and others are redesigned and automated.(15) It is not 
 incremental improvements in tasks; it is quantum leaps in 
 performance. And, according to Hammer and Champy, "the best 
 candidates for business-process reengineering are organizations in 
 crisis--whether about money, quality, or service."(16)
<p>
 The basics of reengineering include:
<p>
 ---  organizing around outcomes, not tasks;
<p>
 ---  having those who use the output of the process perform the 
 process; and
<p>
 ---  put the decision point where the work is performed, build 
 control into the process, and capture information once, at its 
 source.(17)
<p>
 Process reengineering often succeeds because it maximizes the use of 
 technology. Some business leaders assert that reengineering is 
 enabling American industry to finally realize the benefits of 
 technological investments of the past two decades.(18) While 
 technology is critical to process reengineering, it is not where 
 process reengineering begins. Rather, a key tenet is to redesign work 
 processes first and then automate the new processes, as 
 appropriate.(19) NPR's accompanying report on Reengineering Through 
 Information Technology provides more detail and examples of areas 
 ripe for action.
<p>
 While reengineering focuses on work processes, it also often requires 
 major changes in an organization's culture: eliminating unnecessary 
 functions, introducing multidisciplinary approaches, creating cross-
 boundary partnerships, and reducing the number of managerial layers. 
 One lesson learned by the Defense Department is that the biggest 
 barriers to culture change are centered in the accounting and 
 personnel systems and the perverse incentives these systems create 
 must be dealt with first before systemic culture change can occur in 
 other arenas. Organizations that initiate process reengineering but 
 do not undertake these supporting changes face a greater chance for 
 failure. Many of NPR's recommendations for fundamental change in 
 personnel, budget, procurement, and management tasks rely on the 
 potential of process reengineering for success. 
<p>
 
 Examples of Reengineering. 
<p>
 Examples of process reengineering in the federal sector show 
 tremendous promise. Federal agencies and departments have used 
 process reengineering for streamlining specific processes and to 
 facilitate broader cultural change. For example, examples of process 
 reengineering in the Internal Revenue Service demonstrate clear 
 productivity gains and how quickly such improvements can happen. 
<p>
 ---  The Hartford District's process reengineering efforts reduced 
 cycle time to process Form 53, "Currently Non-Collectible," from 14.6 
 days to 1.4 days and eventually reduced overall case processing time 
 from 40 weeks to 21.6 weeks. Hartford District then reengineered the 
 position of group manager by replacing case reviews with an automated 
 case management system, thereby redefining the managers' job. The 
 result was a 22 percent increase in delinquent tax dollars collected. 
 According to District officials, this increase in productivity has 
 explicitly led to discussions of "rightsizing." This included 
 decisions to not fill first-line manager positions that become vacant 
 and (as part of a demonstration project) to use a percentage of staff 
 position funding to purchase more technology. 
<p>
 ---  The Brooklyn District, in an ongoing effort to "reduce taxpayer 
 burden," used process reengineering to reduce the cycle time of 
 requests for tax-exempt organization status. It "flow charted" the 
 cycle time, eliminated non-value-added steps (especially excessive 
 reviews) and in five months increased productivity over 50 percent.
<p>
 Process reengineering can be implemented quickly with relatively 
 little training and can demonstrate immediate results when all levels 
 of management support the effort. 
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Create Cross-Boundary Partnerships</b>
 <p>
 The search for solutions to today's complex domestic problems must 
 cross organizational boundaries. Issues such as unemployment, crime, 
 the environment, workforce training needs, and natural disaster 
 relief require a multi-agency government response. Yet government 
 programs are often assigned to agencies in an illogical manner that 
 inhibits cooperation and fails to focus on the customer or achieving 
 results. Citizens such as farmers, veterans, and business people must 
 sometimes travel to multiple sites to fill out numerous forms to gain 
 access to government services. To provide citizens with integrated 
 service delivery--"one-stop shopping"--government must find ways to 
 coordinate, and in some cases completely reengineer, its service 
 delivery strategies across all levels of government. 
<p>
 Coordination is not just a service delivery issue. 
 The federal government also establishes and administers policies that 
 cut across agency jurisdictional boundaries. Environment, food 
 safety, and scientific research are all areas that can benefit from 
 cross-agency approaches to policy development. The challenge is to 
 find ways to integrate and coordinate policy development and service 
 delivery in the existing segmented federal organizational structure. 
 The traditional approach is to consolidate agencies. This has 
 intuitive appeal but is generally very difficult politically. An 
 increasingly viable alternative, however, is to use cross-boundary 
 partnerships. The power, speed, and flexibility provided by boundary-
 crossing teams can improve performance in a segmented structure and 
 provide higher quality services more effectively to more citizens--
 without the difficulties that major reorganizations often entail. 
<p>
 
 "Virtual" Organizations. 
<p>
 Experimentation in the private sector with a concept sometimes known 
 as "virtual corporations" uses boundary-crossing mechanisms to 
 replace mass production with mass customization. Products and 
 services are produced quickly and efficiently, through streamlined 
 processes and to the specifications of the customer. The hallmarks of 
 a virtual organization are the extensive use of flexible teams, 
 information technology, and customer feedback.(20) The basic premise 
 is to "let the task form the organization."(21)
<p>
 This same concept can be applied to the public sector by encouraging 
 cross-boundary work groups with a clear purpose, independent members, 
 multiple leaders, multiple communication links, and a focus on 
 integrated service delivery or policy development. A good example of 
 a virtual organization is "one-stop-shopping" career centers where an 
 unemployed person could simultaneously register for unemployment, 
 housing assistance, and job retraining.(22) 
<p>
 Some technicians, authors, and social scientists have extended the 
 "virtual" concept to the macro-level: What would a seamless, 
 electronic government look like? The infrastructure of electronic 
 government--as well as cross-boundary efforts--would rely on teams, 
 networks, electronic communication, and flexible administrative 
 systems. An important tool for cross-boundary work is computer 
 conferencing, which allows meetings at any time or any place. 
 Computer conferences are organized around specific topics, which may 
 have multiple agenda items. Participants can add or read public or 
 private messages, or access items through word searches, whenever and 
 wherever they log on. The main difference between computer 
 conferencing and electronic bulletin boards is the emphasis on 
 supporting participants as a group. Computer conferencing software 
 provides the "virtual space" where people meet, while the human 
 dynamics inside the virtual space are aided by an on-line group 
 facilitator.
<p>
 The link between cross-boundary success and maximum use of the new 
 technologies is well established in parts of the federal government. 
 Some agencies have put a variety of computer tools, sometimes called 
 "groupware," into computer-based decision rooms to support complex 
 decisionmaking and change management. The Decision Analysis Center at 
 the Department of Commerce and the Team Technology Center at the 
 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are two examples of 
 sophisticated, computer-supported resources for cross-boundary work. 
 FAA's systems engineering staff is currently examining ways to 
 incorporate "virtual databases" into communication vehicles across 
 the aviation community.
<p>
 With a vision of electronic government in place, the reality of 
 groupware and decision rooms encourages solutions to problems across 
 agency boundaries. For example, NPR initiated a nine-city computer 
 conference to discuss "virtual" organizations. Participants concluded 
 that in a true electronic government, whatever agency "doors" 
 citizens enter, they should find a federal employee who knows how to 
 match needs and services.
<p>
 To make cross-boundary work successful in the federal government, 
 organizational leaders must collaborate across traditional lines, 
 support cross-agency initiatives and use the new telecommunication 
 tools. A key strategy to foster this cross-organizational 
 collaboration is through the introduction of boundary-crossing 
 mechanisms, or partnerships. These partnerships may take different 
 forms, depending on the task at hand and the parties involved.(23)
<p>
 
 Existing Cross-Boundary Partnerships. 
<p>
 Cross-boundary partnerships are not a new concept in the federal 
 government. In fact, a number of them have a successful track record 
 and can serve as models for addressing complex problems. These models 
 include temporary, ad hoc groups that address specific issues and 
 then disband, and long-term partnerships that are charged with 
 integrating service delivery and solving problems of common interest. 
 For example:
<p>
 ---  The Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and 
 Technology (FCCSET) is a White House-managed boundary-crossing team 
 with representatives from many agencies, both defense and civilian, 
 who come together to set a broad agenda for technological 
 development. While FCCSET is a high-level group, it spawns numerous 
 lower-level working groups in areas such as biotechnology. It is at 
 the lower level that projects are identified and coordinated. FCCSET 
 has achieved major successes in developing governmentwide 
 approaches.(24)
<p>
 ---  In 1988, the National Governors Association urged the federal 
 government to develop structures to consolidate and increase the 
 flexibility of programs that serve rural America. The federal 
 government responded by creating State Rural Development Councils. 
 These were coordinated by USDA, but supported with resources and 
 leadership from several federal agencies, as well as state and local 
 governments. Federal, state, and local responsibilities and 
 relationships are now linked through a memorandum of understanding, 
 while the councils themselves represent stakeholders throughout the 
 states. Thirty-six states either have or are developing these 
 councils. The councils are seen as mechanisms to empower communities 
 and support the states' role in developing a rural agenda. 
<p>
 ---  In 1993, information technology leaders from a dozen federal 
 agencies created a "Service to the Citizen" alliance so they could 
 collaborate on identifying ways to use technology to improve 
 information and services to the government's customers. This informal 
 alliance identified specific technologies, such as electronic kiosks 
 and on-line services, that were proven and they exploited these 
 technologies to improve near-term service delivery.
<p>
 A series of NPR recommendations--on ecosystem management, increased 
 law enforcement cooperation, "bottom-up" grants to states and 
 localities, and improved services to people in poverty--all call for 
 cross-boundary partnerships to identify and act on solutions to 
 complex problems.(25)
<p>
 Encouraging government agencies to partner across organizational 
 boundaries is not merely a jurisdictional problem. There are major 
 cultural barriers that prevent full collaboration, even in areas of 
 mutual interest. There must be dedication and commitment on the part 
 of management, clear direction, and in most cases training in the use 
 of group management techniques to ensure success. With commitment and 
 clarity, the effectiveness of cross-boundary partnerships can be 
 greatly enhanced by new telecommunications tools such as electronic 
 bulletin boards, computer conferencing, teleconferencing, and 
 interactive information services.
<p>
 
 Introducing Cross-Boundary Partnerships. 
<p>
 Boundary-crossing partnerships are useful when one or more of the 
 following situations exists: service delivery is fragmented; service 
 quality is poor; cross-fertilization of ideas and expertise is 
 appropriate; service delivery or policy development will improve with 
 cross-boundary work; customer needs are naturally clustered (e.g. 
 welfare, job training, housing) and policy areas overlap. 
<p>
 Examples of the use of boundary-crossing partnerships in the federal 
 sector show a series of common elements among successful efforts and 
 common problems among efforts that were not considered successful. 
 These experiences and recent research findings suggest a set of 
 guidelines for success:(26) 
<p>
 ---  clarify the mission and desired results before establishing the 
 structure;
<p>
 ---  include relevant stakeholders;
<p>
 ---  establish links through a functional and efficient cross-
 boundary partner-ship structure suitable to the mission and desired 
 results;
<p>
 ---  commit adequate support and funding to the effort;
<p>
 ---  encourage others to become leaders in the endeavor; and 
<p>
 ---  build in mechanisms for accountability, sharing information, and 
 integrating levels of contact throughout the organization. 
<p>
 
 Overcoming Legislative Barriers.
<p>
 Restrictive legislation is sometimes cited by both employees and 
 management as an excuse for agencies and departments not to cooperate 
 across organizational boundaries. However, a closer examination often 
 shows that legislation does not prohibit collaboration. Nevertheless, 
 some provisions inhibit inter-organizational cooperation and customer 
 focus:
<p>
 ---  Appropriation Act Restrictions. The Treasury, Postal Service, 
 and General Appropriations Act of 1993 makes funding of interagency 
 entities very difficult. Sometimes referred to as the "anti-pass the 
 hat" provision, it states that "no part of any appropriation 
 contained in this or any other Act shall be available for interagency 
 financing of boards, commissions, councils, committees, or similar 
 groups . . . which do not have a prior and specific statutory 
 approval to receive financial support from more than one agency or 
 instrumentality." Although this is an annual provision, this language 
 has appeared for several years.
<p>
 ---  Title 31 of the U.S. Code. This provision restricts cross-agency 
 activity and joint funding of such activity. Chapter 63, section 
 6305, only allows the head of an agency to enter into a cooperative 
 agreement with other government agencies (federal, state, or local) 
 when the relationship is not solely for cash assistance to an 
 individual, a subsidy, a loan, a loan guarantee, or for insurance 
 purposes. It would be much more practical if it allowed agency heads 
 to be delegated the authority to enter into cooperative agreements 
 and to sub-delegate their authority to the level where the 
 cooperative agreements are actually executed. Chapter 13, section 
 1346, limits the use of federal monies to fund expenses, salaries, or 
 related costs in support of an interagency group not mandated by law. 
 This language is similar to funding prohibitions in the 
 appropriations act, but does not expire annually.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Self-Managing Work Teams</B> 
 <p>
 In recent years, a major trend in corporate restructuring and 
 streamlining has been the shift from traditional supervision to 
 reliance on self-managing work teams.(27) Self-managing teams are 
 groups of workers who are collectively charged with accomplishing a 
 whole task as well as collectively managing the team. The group is 
 accountable to management; however, the management role has changed 
 from traditional supervisor to more of a "coach." The span of control 
 generally increases significantly. While a traditional supervisor may 
 be responsible for five to 10 employees, the "supervisor" of a self-
 managing team may be responsible for 25 or more employees. 
<p>
 Clearly, self-managing teams produce leaner management. They also 
 tend to increase motivation and productivity by increasing the 
 responsibility and participation of workers. They enhance work 
 effectiveness by giving employees greater ownership of their product. 
 Self-managing teams are initiated by: delegating tasks and authority 
 to whole teams; equipping team members with the skills needed to 
 function in a team environment; and modifying or providing systems 
 and tools to assist in team decisionmaking and ensuring 
 accountability. 
<p>
 There is a great variety of self-managing work teams. In some, all 
 members of the team can perform each other's job. These teams are 
 often found in production facilities in the private sector; for 
 example, in automobile factories. However, there are effective teams 
 in office environments where there is not a high degree of 
 interdependence and where employees are not expected to perform one 
 another's job. 
<p>
 Teams also vary in their levels of responsibility and authority. 
 Fully empowered teams tend to exist when an organization's culture 
 supports participation. Such teams have "coaches," not traditional 
 managers, and the team is responsible for quality control, production 
 scheduling, hiring and firing, continuous improvement, and training 
 programs. In other organizations, teams may have less authority and 
 will evolve and mature over time as they increase skills, learn to 
 balance authority and accountability, and gain management trust.
<p>
 
 Perks and Symbols. 
<p>
 The use of teams tends to increase the quality of work life as team 
 members increasingly participate in and are responsible for an 
 important part of their life--their jobs. Also, "perks" that tend to 
 differentiate workers from managers are generally reduced. For 
 example, the federal government officially permits and defines 
 supervisory perks such as the amount of square feet of workspace, the 
 quality of the carpets, the expense of the furniture, and the type of 
 parking space in relation to the grade level of the supervisor. 
 Compare this to a team-based manufacturing company, Saturn, whose 
 policy on "symbols" states: 
<p>
 Saturn believes that symbols should be positive to promote our 
 philosophy and culture . . . and will strive to minimize the 
 differentiation between people in the elements of successful 
 organizations such as pay, purchase of GM products, common 
 cafeterias, parking, identification, entrances, etc.(28)
<p>
 Transforming the culture of central control and mistrust entails 
 changing the symbols of that culture, too. The Administration has 
 already saved millions of dollars by reducing the use of limousines 
 and executive aircraft. But the symbols of the old hierarchical 
 control culture are far more pervasive and costly than just the perks 
 frequently associated with high-level Washington positions. Special 
 dining rooms, reserved parking spaces near the door, higher quality 
 furniture and carpet for managers and supervisors (the higher the 
 rank, the better the furniture) all convey to front-line employees 
 that they are less important members of the team--that management is 
 on top and labor is on the bottom. Self-managing teams are an 
 important step toward eliminating the symbols of hierarchy, control, 
 and mistrust. They create positive symbols that convey to federal 
 workers the new partnership that comes from a culture of shared goals 
 and trust.
<p>
 <p>
 <b>Establishing Self-Managing Work Teams.</B>
<p>
 Self-managing teams produce impressive results, but they come with a 
 set of conditions necessary for their success:
<p>
 ---  higher-level management must be a positive model of teamwork, 
 practicing techniques such as participative management, consensus 
 decisionmaking, and empowerment of employees;
<p>
 ---  top management must be committed to a long-term implementation 
 plan to ensure that self-management becomes part of the 
 organizational culture;
<p>
 ---  resources must be dedicated to ensure sufficient training and 
 technical assistance; and
<p>
 ---  personnel and other systems must be adapted to encourage team-
 based awards and peer input into performance appraisals.
<p>
 Organizations should consider using self-managing teams in work 
 environments that seem to be smothered in excessive layers of 
 control; those where success can best be achieved through a 
 coordinated effort (rather than those where work is highly 
 differentiated); those where customers require greater responsiveness 
 from the organization; and those where the specific tasks are 
 conducive to a team approach. Self-managing teams are a very 
 effective method for making the best use of employees' intellectual 
 talents while at the same time improving their quality of work 
 life.(29)
<p>
 The self-managing work team concept is not incompatible with the 
 federal civil service system. There are notable examples of 
 successful teams in the federal government:
<p>
 ---  A USDA office that processes personnel actions has converted to 
 a fully self-managed operation in order to better utilize employees 
 and reorganize so as to make services more accessible and accountable 
 to customers. The supervisory span of control increased from 1:7 to 
 1:23 by creating specialized teams, each serving a different unit of 
 the organization. Within the teams, members share responsibility for 
 the various functions, filling in for one another as needed. 
 Customers report a high level of satisfaction with the services they 
 are now receiving.
<p>
 ---  Also in USDA, the self-managing concept is being tested in a 
 pilot project for agricultural inspectors who check for the presence 
 of plant and animal pests or diseases in baggage arriving in the 
 country from international destinations. In this project, teams 
 collectively manage the baggage inspection process. This includes 
 scheduling, rotation of job responsibilities, and reengineering of 
 work processes. In its initial stages, the project resulted in over 
 50 enhancements to the work process. Due to employees' overall 
 endorsement, the concept is being prepared for nationwide 
 implementation.
<p>
 ---  At the Internal Revenue Service in San Francisco, the creation 
 of a self-managing work team resulted in a 22 percent increase in the 
 number of cases processed by the self-managing team. This translated 
 to an annual increase of $6 million in the collection of delinquent 
 taxes compared to a traditionally managed team.
<p>
 ---  The Defense Logistics Agency eliminated an entire level of 
 management by creating self-managing teams in its Defense 
 Distribution Region Central Office. This reduced staff and created 
 savings of over $2.5 million per year.

Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<p>
<H2> ORG01:  Reduce the Costs and Numbers of Positions Associated with 
 Management Control Structures by Half</h2>
<p>
<b> Action</b>
 <p> 
 Reduce the costs associated with management control structures by one 
 half over a five-year period.
<p>
 The costs of management control structures should be cut roughly in 
 half as a consequence of the implementation of decentralization, 
 empowerment, reduced regulation, and other NPR recommendations over 
 the next five years. Roughly 650,000 to 700,000 individuals work in 
 management control positions at an estimated annual cost of $35 
 billion to $40 billion annually (see Appendix B for an illustrative 
 breakout by major agency). A portion of the savings should be 
 reinvested in quality management initiatives, improved technology, 
 training of administrative staff reassigned to line positions, and 
 methods to continuously reduce control structures. Significant 
 savings, however, are not expected in the first few years due to 
 early outs, buyouts, severance pay, training, relocation, and 
 guaranteed outplacement services, which will be provided to the 
 affected staff.(1)
<p>
 As part of the initiative to streamline management control 
 structures, the President should
<p>
 ---  reduce the executive branch workforce by at least 12 percent--or 
 a total of 252,000;(2)
<p>
 ---  establish a challenging, governmentwide goal of increasing the 
 span of control from 1-to-7 to 1-to-15 over the next five years; 
<p>
 ---  encourage the use of employee empowerment, self-managed teams, 
 simplified control structures, and better use of information and 
 communications technology; and 
<p>
 ---  direct agencies to reengineer work processes to shift emphases 
 to service delivery. 
<p>
 Reengineering work processes will require legislative changes in some 
 cases, but this strategy will also play a major role in streamlining 
 management control structures.
<p>
 The preferred method for both reducing the costs of the central 
 control positions and increasing the span of control is through a 
 broad offering of separation incentives-- not just to the estimated 
 650,000 to 700,000 employees in positions related to the control 
 structures. In this way, employees in the targeted positions, who are 
 not eligible for early outs or do not elect a buyout, can be 
 transferred to line positions as they become vacant. With a broad 
 offering of incentives coupled with a commitment to train and 
 reassign staff, a reduction-in-force--the least desirable method of 
 streamlining--might be minimized. 
<p>
 The President's Management Council (PMC) will oversee and coordinate 
 the strategic plans for reductions in costs of central control 
 structures and in increasing the management span of control. The PMC 
 consists of chief operating officers--the senior leaders of cabinet-
 level departments as well as large agencies--who are in a position to 
 know the best way to cut administrative costs while improving 
 performance. 
<p>
 Traditionally, streamlining efforts directed by central management 
 agencies have been across-the-board cuts. While these efforts led 
 successfully to temporary cuts in staffing, they did not result in 
 improved performance and left behind many of the same problems 
 without changing the culture. The PMC is charged with a very 
 different streamlining initiative that is driven by a reduction in 
 costs--not just people--and is specifically directed toward better 
 government at less cost. PMC will need operational assistance in this 
 effort and should identify the type of assistance needed from the 
 Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel 
 Management (OPM), and the Federal Quality Institute, as required. 
<p>
 NPR's estimates in the magnitude of existing management controls and 
 their associated costs are hampered by a lack of a clear measure of 
 their scope. Therefore, an early charge to the PMC from the President 
 should be to define baseline costs and expected savings in a 
 standardized way that is acceptable to and understandable by most 
 people. For much the same reason, PMC--supported operationally by OMB 
 and OPM--should define and track progress toward increasing the ratio 
 of workers in relation to managers in the federal government.(3)

 authority, skill, and accountability. (2)
<p>
 Performance agreements should be used to identify methods for 
 measuring progress toward agreed-upon results and systemic changes 
 that will allow major reductions in the costs and number of staff 
 dedicated to central control structures.(1) In exchange for these 
 commitments, the Executive Office of the President should support 
 agencies with increased flexibility through regulatory relief, 
 executive orders, or legislative initiatives. Service reductions 
 should not be accepted if they are across-the-board or if substantial 
 administrative costs and staff remain in headquarters or regional 
 offices. Where possible a criteria like the Postal Service's "Do they 
 touch the mail?" should be developed by each agency.

<p>
<b> Action</b>
 <p>
 Within 18 months, establish a list of specific field offices to be 
 closed and submit this list to Congress for approval. (2)
<p>
  The President should charge the President's Management Council (PMC) 
 with coordinating an 18-month government-wide review culminating in 
 the submission to Congress of a list of civilian field offices that 
 should be closed. This should be a participative process between the 
 agencies, the Executive Office of the President, and congressional 
 leaders using objective criteria and review processes to establish 
 the closure lists. 
<p>
  Agencies with existing plans for restructuring field offices should 
 remain on schedule and not await the PMC submission.

 <p>
<b> Action</B>
 <p>
  Legislation should be enacted to grant the President reorganization 
 authority. (3) 
<p>
  Congress should reinstate the President's authority to restructure 
 agencies in the executive branch. Congress has given the President 
 statutory reorganization authority several times (for limited 
 periods) since the 1930's. The last authority was granted through the 
 Reorganization Act Amendments of 1984, which expired at the end of 
 1984. In the absence of such authority, the President can only 
 reorganize through the standard, time-consuming legislative process.

 <p>
<b> Action</b>
 <p>
 Initiate three or more cross-agency efforts to improve service 
 delivery or policies addressing common issues or customers. (2) 
<p>
 To establish cooperative efforts between agencies on issues such as 
 illegal immigration, food safety, debt collection, welfare reform, 
 and homelessness, the President's Management Council (PMC) should 
 initiate three or more initiatives, starting in fiscal year 1995. The 
 PMC should identify lead officials, clearly define the mission, and 
 help establish performance agreements between the participating 
 agencies. The PMC and the participating agencies should establish 
 reporting schedules and use the results to foster and better 
 implement other cooperative efforts.

<H2> ORG06:  Identify and Change Legislative Barriers to Cross-

<p>
<b> Action</b>
<p> 
 Identify restrictive regulations and laws that are barriers to cross-
 organizational cooperation and develop legislative proposals to 
 eliminate them. (3)
<p>
 Restrictive legislative provisions such as those contained in the 
 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Appropriations Act of 1993 
 (P.L. 102-393), the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, and Title 31 of 
 the U.S. Code, should be modified to make funding of cross-agency 
 activities easier when it is in the public's best interest. 
<p>
 Eliminate phrases such as "no part of any appropriation contained in 
 this or any other Act shall be available for interagency financing of 
 boards, commissions, councils, committees, or similar groups" and 
 "which do not have a prior and specific statutory approval to receive 
 financial support from more than one agency or instrumentality."

 <p> 
 <b>Sources Used to Make Estimate</b>
 <p>
<p> 
 The following sources were used to develop estimates of the types of 
 categories of staff that should be considered in the development of 
 agency streamlining efforts. Because agencies use different Education 
 approaches to the use of personnel classification categories, these 
 numbers are not definitive sources on which to base staffing 
 reductions. Also, because of differences in definitions, the numbers 
 included in defining management control and headquarters can vary 
 substantially. For example, some agencies would include certain types 
 of contractors; others would not.
 <p>
 <b> Supervisors, Managers, and Senior Executives</b>
 <p>
  These figures were taken from Office of Personnel Management reports. 
 They are the sum of supervisors and managers as of March 1993 and 
 allocations of Senior Executives as of September 1990.
 <p>
<p>
<b> Personnel Administrators</b> 
 <p>
  This refers to the number of personnel by agency in the 200 series 
 less military personnel specialists (series 204 and 205). The data 
 were published in OPM publication MW-56-22 dated September 30, 1991. 
 The numbers were adjusted to exclude supervisors based on each 
 agency's supervisor to nonsupervisor ratio (derived from OPM 
 reports).
 <p>
<p>
<b> Budget Staff</b>
 <p>
<p>
  These figures represent the number of personnel by agency in the 560 
 and 561 series published in OPM publication MW-56-22 dated September 
 30, 1991. The numbers were adjusted to exclude supervisors based on 
 each agency's supervisor to nonsupervisor ratio. For this reason, 
 these numbers are lower than the 17,550 reported in the Mission-
 Driven, Results-Oriented Budgeting report.
 <p>
<p>
 <b> Financial Management, Accountants, and Auditors</b>
 <p>
  This includes the number of personnel by agency in the 500 series 
 less budget staff (560s and 561s) and tax personnel (512s, 526s, 
 545s, 570s, 592s,and 593s) published in OPM publication MW-56-22 
 dated September 30, 1991. The numbers were adjusted to exclude 
 supervisors based on each agency's supervisor to nonsupervisor ratio. 
 This estimate is lower than the figure of 120,000 reported in the 
 Improving Financial Management report because that report includes 
 budget specialists, supervisors, and some management and budget 
 analysts' staff in series 343.
 <p>
<p>
<b> Acquisition Specialists</b>
<p> 
 This refers to the number of personnel in the 1101, 1102, 1103, 1105, 
 1106, 1150, and 1910 series from OPM publication MW-56-22 dated 
 September 30, 1991. The numbers were adjusted to exclude supervisors 
 based on each agency's supervisor to nonsupervisor ratio. This 
 estimate is lower than the figure of 142,000 reported in the 
 Reinventing Federal Procurement report because that report includes 
 other logistics functions as well as supervisors.
 <p>
<p>
<b> Headquarters Personnel</b>
 <p>
 Headquarters personnel are the personnel constituting headquarters 
 staff as reported to the National Performance Review by the agencies; 
 a proxy was used for Department of the Treasury and "Other." The 
 proxy is the number of personnel by agency in the Washington, D.C., 
 area. The numbers were reduced by 28.5 percent to account for 
 duplication of headquarters personnel who might also be supervisors 
 or specialists. The 28.5 percent factor is the ratio of supervisors 
 and specialists to total civilians in the Washington, D.C., area.
<p> 
 <p>
 <b>Total Management Control Staff</b> 
 <p> 
 This figure represents the number of management control personnel, by 
 agency. It is the sum of all previous columns, and should be the 
 primary target for streamlining reductions.

<H2>Agency for International Development</H2>
<p>Executive Summary
 <HR>
<p> 
 During the Cold War, the struggle between the East and West framed 
 international politics and U.S. foreign assistance programs. Now that 
 this period has ended, a new set of profound challenges to U.S. 
 national interests has replaced the Cold War prism through which this 
 nation viewed international events. 
<p>
 The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) was created in 
 1961 to carry out this country's development assistance programs 
 abroad. The astonishing scope and speed of global change has 
 accelerated an urgent need for a reassessment of AID's ability to 
 play an effective role in U.S. foreign affairs and in the field of 
 international development.
<p>
 AID currently employs about 4,000 people who support the work of 
 missions in over 100 countries. The agency used an estimated 4,500 
 personal service contractors to design and implement more than 2,000 
 projects in fiscal year 1993. The agency administered a fiscal year 
 1993 budget of approximately $7 billion.
<p>
 The National Performance Review (NPR) considered the threshold 
 question of AID's future existence. Reasonable arguments have been 
 made for AID's absorption into the State Department, or for its 
 abolishment. The NPR has concluded that the problem driving all AID's 
 other problems is the lack of a clear and coherent mission and 
 manageable set of priorities in legislation governing its programs 
 and operations. AID's abolishment or absorption would not cure this 
 central fact about the laws now covering its bilateral assistance 
 programs. With a simplified mission, clearer priorities, strong 
 leadership, innovative thinking, and fundamental reform of its 
 programs and operations, AID could reclaim its potential to be an 
 effective provider of U.S. development assistance.
<p>
 AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood assumed his post in May 1993 and 
 designated the entire agency as a reinvention laboratory, the first 
 agency to do so. By doing this, AID has committed itself to 
 fundamental reform, with the goal of transforming the agency into a 
 high-performance, results-driven organization that can respond 
 effectively to global challenges. Under its new administrator, AID 
 will focus its development activities on sustainable development 
 targeted toward four critical areas: the environment, population and 
 health, economic growth, and democracy.
<p>
 The NPR has isolated seven issues for discussion in this report and 
 made recommendations for further action on fundamental problems 
 facing the agency.
<p>
 The agency's core problem is that it is burdened by too many 
 responsibilities and expected to accomplish too many objectives. AID 
 does not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic 
 mission. External and internal control mechanisms have combined to 
 deprive it of needed flexibility to make good decisions, and weigh it 
 down with time-consuming and outdated reporting requirements. It is, 
 in short, wrapped in red tape.
<p>
 AID's U.S. and Foreign Service National employees are among its most 
 important resources. As the agency adapts to the challenges of 
 transforming itself to meet post-Cold War obligations with diminished 
 resources, it must reassess its basic workforce management and 
 contracting policies.
<p>
 AID must also expedite critically needed reinvention of key business 
 processes by creating an innovation fund to finance investment in 
 new, integrated management information and financial management 
 systems. AID's project and program management system, a core business 
 function of the agency, needs to better reflect basic principles of 
 customer service, focus on results, decentralize management 
 authority, link results to planning and budgeting, and eliminate 
 rules and procedures that hinder the accomplishment of results and 
 accountability. 
<p>
 AID also needs to eliminate duplication of effort and function and 
 target resources toward areas and activities most likely to produce 
 successful results. At issue is whether the agency needs to maintain 
 a field presence in more than 100 countries, whether assistance 
 programs contain adequate incentives for recipients to succeed and 
 graduate from those programs, and whether resources that support AID 
 missions can be put to more effective use through leveraging of 
 services provided by other agencies. 
<p>
 Coincident with the administrator's designation of the entire agency 
 as a reinvention laboratory, AID created a Quality Council to 
 coordinate and initiate reinvention initiatives. Actions taken and 
 planned by AID, and proposed in this report, will transform AID and 
 make it more relevant to this country's post-Cold War foreign policy.

<H2>Agency for International Development</H2>
<p>
 Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
 <h2>AID01:  Redefine and Focus AID's Mission and Priorities</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
 Few would argue that public organizations work best when they have 
 one clear mission. Clarity of mission may be a government 
 organization's single most important asset.(1) The Agency for 
 International Development (AID) has been cited as a prime example of 
 a failed exercise in mission-driven government, burdened as the 
 agency has been by several different and sometimes conflicting 
 missions.(2)
<p>
 Reviewers inside and outside AID have documented serious problems in 
 major agency programs and operations for more than a decade.(3) In 
 1992, a presidential commission recommended that the agency be merged 
 into the State Department; a recent congressional task force and 
 others have called for the agency to be abolished and to be replaced 
 by other public or quasi-public entities.(4) While others have 
 stopped short of recommending the agency's outright abolishment, the 
 consensus of reviewers and informed commentators is that AID cannot 
 continue to function as it has in the past.
<p>
 Reinvention is not simply an option or a challenge for AID; it is an 
 imperative. For reasons discussed in this and other sections of this 
 report, the agency cannot succeed in reinvention without help from 
 Congress and other agencies.(5)
<p>
 The new administrator of AID, J. Brian Atwood, acknowledged the 
 dimensions of the problem in testimony at his Senate confirmation 
 hearing in April 1993:
<p>
 
 We have confirmed what other studies have concluded: AID is burdened 
 by a surfeit of goals and objectives, encumbered by excessive red 
 tape, and beaten down by poor morale.
<p>
 [I]t will not be business as usual at AID if I am confirmed for this 
 position. The changes I will be proposing will be radical departures 
 from past practices.     [R]adical changes are the only way to regain 
 the faith of the Congress and the country in an enterprise which is 
 central to our nation's international agenda. We cannot afford to 
 fail . . .(6)
<p>
 
 The problem at the heart of all of AID's other problems, observers 
 and employees agree, is that it is burdened by too many 
 responsibilities and expected to accomplish too many objectives, 
 particularly for an agency of its limited size and resources. In 
 short, AID does not have a single, clearly defined and articulated 
 strategic mission.
<p>
 The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, amendments to the act over a 
 period of 30 years, and other laws affecting AID define nearly 40 
 different responsibilities to be carried out by the agency in the 
 field of international development.(7)
<p>
 Included among AID's statutory responsibilities are agriculture, 
 rural development and nutrition; population and health; education and 
 human resource development; energy; private sector development; 
 integration of women into national economies; human rights; and 
 environment and natural resources.(8) And the list grows. Recent 
 legislation gave the agency responsibilities for aid to the former 
 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and authorized the use of development 
 assistance funds for capital projects (including investment 
 promotion).(9)
<p>
 Varied policy directions and emphases promoted by successive 
 administrations, AID administrators, Congress, and outside interest 
 groups pressing their own concerns have compounded the problem of too 
 many statutory objectives. By 1989, one agency document identified 75 
 different mission priorities.(10)
<p>
 This accumulation has led to what the U.S. General Accounting Office 
 (GAO) has described as "a complicated and incoherent set of 
 objectives with no clear priorities."(11) The only consistent but 
 widely criticized assignment of priorities has been accomplished 
 through the use of spending earmarks imposed by successive 
 Congresses.(12)
<p>
 Commentators, including AID employees, also assert that the 
 proliferation of responsibilities contributes to confused or 
 conflicting messages about the agency's basic mission. GAO has 
 concurred in that critique, stating that while each of the many 
 statutory responsibilities has merit, the multiple objectives in laws 
 implemented by AID create confusion as to Congress' intent for the 
 direction of the foreign assistance program, add to the tension 
 between the executive and legislative branches on program priorities, 
 and make it difficult to hold the agency accountable for reaching any 
 particular objective.(13) Among examples cited of AID activities at 
 cross-purposes with long-term international development are the 
 agency's direct promotion of U.S private sector interests and its 
 implementation of Economic Support Fund programs focused on short-
 term geo-political objectives.(14)
<p>
 Critics are virtually unanimous that so long as AID continues to 
 exist, there is an urgent need for its basic mission to be clearly 
 defined and its priorities and objectives to be simplified. It should 
 be noted that in interviews and research on this topic, the terms 
 mission, principles, objectives, strategy, and related concepts are 
 frequently used interchangeably, suggesting a lack of agreement as to 
 what these terms signify. The clear consensus in the past five years, 
 however, is that AID cannot continue to do so many things and do them 
 all well.
<p>
 Comprehensive new authorizing legislation has not been enacted by 
 Congress since 1985. The world has changed fundamentally in the 
 intervening years. Numerous efforts to enact new legislation during 
 that time have met with failure.(15) The result has been that annual 
 appropriations acts have added responsibilities to AID piecemeal and 
 assigned priorities at will through the earmarking process.
<p>
 Discussions about AID's mission have intensified in recent years. 
 They are occurring in several broader contexts. First and foremost 
 are the changed geo-political circumstances of the post-Cold War 
 period. Second, a high-level Clinton administration task force is 
 reviewing the entire U.S. government foreign assistance structure, 
 including AID, in light of current and emerging global 
 conditions.(16) This study is expected to analyze the United States' 
 post-Cold War foreign assistance policy, the roles and 
 responsibilities of the agencies and organizations implementing that 
 policy, the dispersion of U.S. programs overseas (including trade and 
 export promotion activities), possible consolidation or elimination 
 of overlapping and duplicative functions, improved interagency 
 coordination of foreign assistance activities, and related issues.
<p>
 As part of that review, Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher 
 directed Deputy Secretary of State Clifton R. Wharton, Jr., to review 
 AID's goals and objectives. Deputy Secretary Wharton and 
 Administrator Atwood testified about the status of that report (known 
 as the Wharton report) and the Clinton administration's review of all 
 U.S. foreign assistance programs before a subcommittee of the Senate 
 Foreign Affairs Committee in July 1993.(17) 
<p>
 The subcommittee chairman, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, expressed a 
 desire for expeditious completion of these reports to provide a basis 
 for enacting new authorizing legislation.(18) Proposed congressional 
 measures to authorize AID operations for fiscal year 1994 would 
 require the President to submit a plan for reform of U.S. foreign 
 assistance programs and AID to Congress within 60 days of the 
 legislation's enactment into law.(19)
<p>
 Secretary Christopher presented a fiscal year 1994 transition foreign 
 assistance budget that he said would begin the process of redirecting 
 U.S. foreign policy, establishing new priorities, and restructuring 
 foreign policy institutions. U.S. foreign policy will emphasize three 
 themes, implemented initially by a fiscal year 1994 budget submission 
 organized around five objectives.(20) This focus on objectives, not 
 just funding inputs, is a major departure from previous budget 
 submissions.(21)
<p>
 Administrator Atwood has publicly stated that his agency's primary 
 mission should be long-term sustainable development with four 
 strategic components:
<p>
 --- aiding the environment,
<p>
 --- addressing population and health,
<p>
 --- building democracy, and
<p>
 --- encouraging economic growth.(22)
<p>
 He has spoken of the need for AID to carry out these responsibilities 
 in partnerships with other government, non-government, and private 
 voluntary organizations.(23) His redefinition of AID's mission 
 corresponds in several important respects to recent congressional 
 proposals for a new foreign policy framework, and provides a basis 
 for productive dialogue with Congress on a new statutory foundation 
 for AID operations.(24)
<p>
 It bears noting, however, that challenges remain in implementing the 
 administrator's redefined mission. He has expressed the view that AID 
 cannot be all things to all people. He has also acknowledged the 
 risks inherent in efforts to define a simpler mission based on 
 sustainable development, a term that he recognizes "has taken on 
 myriad meanings and has been invoked in many contexts."(25) Despite 
 the comparatively small portion of the federal budget devoted to 
 foreign aid, U.S. foreign assistance programs suffer from a lack of 
 widespread public support.(26) In AID's case, this difficulty is 
 compounded by its history of troubled programs and operations--
 problems aggravated by the lack of a clear and coherent mission and a 
 manageable set of priorities.
<p>
 These factors underline the importance of explaining how the focus on 
 sustainable development helps to simplify AID's mission, rather than 
 to merely rebundle its current plethora of programs and objectives. A 
 clear definition of this concept is important to develop the 
 operational strategies needed to identify unrelated or non-essential 
 programs and operations, and to conduct strategic planning. 
<p>
 Even assuming that AID does move in new directions, the agency is 
 likely to be subject to external pressures from public and private 
 sector groups and organizations that have benefited from AID support 
 in the past. While there is broad support for simplifying AID's 
 mission in theory, practical implementation will not be easy.
<p>
 Due to budget cuts and adjustments to changed post-Cold War 
 circumstances, AID's administrator has committed the agency to 
 reductions in the number of programs, projects, and field missions 
 currently operating in different countries.(27) It may be that this 
 measure will be enough to make the agency's current roster of 
 programs and operations more manageable. The administrator has also 
 launched a review of agency programs and operational procedures. 
<p>
 An early result of this review has been to examine existing programs 
 that facilitated movement of U.S. jobs overseas, and to put 
 safeguards in place to prevent such programs from going forward in 
 the future. It is not clear whether these steps, and the increased 
 partnerships the administrator has described, will entail significant 
 reductions in the overall number of agency programs and activities.
<p>
 This question needs to be clearly addressed and resolved. It warrants 
 serious scrutiny in view of several factors, including the agency's 
 amply documented problems in managing its current array of programs, 
 a shrinking personnel and budget resource base, and the availability 
 of many other U.S. and international development organizations 
 equally or better positioned to provide assistance to developing 
 nations.(28)
<p>
 In any event, without concerted and cooperative efforts by the 
 executive and legislative branches to embody a clearer, more 
 manageable AID mandate in law, and restraint in adding new 
 legislative mandates beyond the agency's capacity to handle them, 
 AID's future ability to effectively manage foreign assistance 
 programs and its own operations cannot be ensured. The agency will 
 continue to strain beyond its capacity to respond to challenges too 
 numerous to be met. It will struggle to improve its serious internal 
 management deficiencies while continued budgetary pressures threaten 
 its funding base, and already-low levels of public support for 
 foreign assistance erode further.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. The AID administrator should conduct a zero-based, bottom-up 
 review of all AID programs and operations, identifying programs and 
 operations that (a) do not directly support a clearly defined mission 
 of sustainable development, and (b) can be undertaken by other 
 assistance providers with a comparative advantage over AID. 
 Nonessential and redundant programs should be eliminated.
<p>
 Past evaluations of AID programs and operations show that the agency 
 cannot do all that it is trying to do now and do it well. It is not 
 yet clear that doing the same number of things, but in fewer 
 countries, will make AID programs more effective and produce better 
 results. 
<p>
 In any case, AID needs a redefined mission and reduced and simplified 
 operations. It also needs to make its limited resources go further 
 through partnerships with other government and non-government 
 assistance providers. An assessment of all AID programs and 
 operations based on these goals, with clear operational strategies 
 for accomplishing the mission and priorities defined by the 
 administrator, should assist in identifying programs and operations 
 that can be reduced, eliminated, or transferred to other agencies 
 (consistent with the current governmentwide review of foreign 
 assistance activities).
<p>
 
 2. The administration should seek comprehensive new authorizing 
 legislation to replace the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
 amended.
<p>
 While some redirection of AID programs and operations can begin 
 administratively, the agency's reinvention can only succeed if it 
 starts with a clear redefinition in law of a more focused, 
 consistent, and manageable agency mission. The AID administrator's 
 concept, subject to clear definitions of sustainable development and 
 other critical terms, appears to be a formulation around which a 
 consensus could emerge. 
<p>
 This reinvention process should also include the identification--for 
 congressional elimination or transfer to other agencies--of any 
 activities that do not relate to and directly advance AID's principal 
 mission.(29) Such legislative action is urgently needed to permit AID 
 to succeed with other reform initiatives and to engage in more 
 effective long-term planning and resource allocation.
<p>
 
 3. The AID administrator should develop a strategic vision of what 
 the agency should look like as it enters the 21st century.
<p>
 Private sector companies that have achieved the most success in 
 managing organizational change are those that have developed the 
 clearest messages about the need for change. These messages often 
 appear in the form of vision statements that express the reasons for 
 change and define a strategic vision of what kind of organization the 
 company needs to become. 
<p>
 Vision statements describe how an organization must operate and the 
 type of results that it needs to achieve. They operate to remind 
 people of the organization's objectives, act as a gauge for measuring 
 progress, and serve to motivate people on a continuing basis during 
 efforts to accomplish major change.(30)
<p>
 NPR agrees with AID's administrator that the agency must make radical 
 departures from past practices if it is to succeed in the volatile 
 and complex international arena of the future. As part of the task of 
 recharting the agency's course, he should lead the process of 
 developing a vision statement to guide the agency's strategic 
 planning of the fundamental changes needed to accomplish that goal. 
 Each agency component can then develop a vision statement proceeding 
 directly from and supporting the larger agency vision.
<p>
 
 4. The AID administrator should conduct a comprehensive review of all 
 agency directives and other internal and public issuances to ensure 
 that they clearly express the agency's mission, priorities, and 
 objectives in clear, consistent, and accurate terms.
<p>
 A process should be established to ensure that all internal and 
 external agency publications express the agency's mission, 
 priorities, and objectives. Reported findings of as many as 75 
 different priorities in agency guidance indicate that the agency has 
 compounded its problems in the past by defining too many objectives 
 for an agency of its size and resources to manage.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 The efficacy of the new administrator's efforts to articulate a 
 simpler, clearer mission depends in part on the completion of the 
 Clinton administration review of foreign assistance policy and 
 programs across the government. The administrator can implement his 
 goals and priorities (i.e., to clarify AID's mission and streamline 
 its priorities) to a limited extent without legislative reform--e.g., 
 through clear and consistent policy guidance, resource reallocations, 
 partnerships with other assistance providers, and other measures. 
 Legislative reform, however, is critical to relieve the political and 
 other pressures on AID to implement all the responsibilities and 
 priorities found in current law.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The focus of the recommendations in this part of the report is on 
 improving results. Cost savings may result from congressional action 
 limiting the scope of AID's responsibilities, but no projections can 
 be made at this time as to the likelihood or amounts of any such 
 savings. Implementation of these recommendations should produce 
 increased efficiency in agency operations. The actual fiscal impact 
 of resulting changes depends on the nature and timing of their 
 implementation, and cannot be estimated.

 25. U.S. Congress, Senate, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee 
 on Foreign Operations, prepared statement, May 26, 1993. Sustainable 
 development is generally acknowledged to have become a leading 
 principle in international development policy after the World 
 Commission on Environment and Development chaired by Norwegian Prime 
 Minister Gro Harlan Brundtland (known as the Brundtland Commission) 
 featured it as a central theme of its 1987 report. The Commission 
 defined sustainable development as a form of development that "meets 
 the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
 generations to meet their own needs." The World Commission on 
 Environment and Development, Our Common Future (Oxford and New York: 
 Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 89, 43-66, 75-89. Considerable 
 effort has gone into translating that definition into practical terms 
 for action in various settings. See, for example, Toman, Michael A., 
 "The Difficulty in Defining Sustainability," in Joel Darmstadter, 
 ed., Global Development and the Environment: Perspectives on 
 Sustainability (Washington, D.C.: Resources for the Future, 1992),

<p>
 26. While the U.S. maintains the world's largest program of 
 international development assistance, this country ranks next to last 
 among developed countries in foreign assistance as a percentage of 
 gross national product. The foreign assistance budget request for 
 fiscal year 1994 represents only about 1.3 percent of the entire 
 federal budget. On levels of public support, see, for example, a 
 survey conducted for the Americans Talk Issues Foundation in December 
 1991, finding that 38 percent more people of those polled wanted to 
 decrease spending for U.S. economic and humanitarian foreign aid than 
 wanted to increase it. Kay, Alan F., Frederick T. Steeper, Hazel 
 Henderson, Celinda Lake, and David J. Hansen, What the American 
 People Want in the Federal Budget, Survey No. 18 (Washington, D.C., 
 November 1992), p. 27; see also a poll conducted for the Rockefeller 
 Foundation in December 1992, finding that support for U.S. foreign 
 assistance has declined since 1986; Belden and Russonello, Americans

 <h2>AID02:  Reduce Funding, Spending, and Reporting Micromanagement
</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
  Major reviews of the Agency for International Development (AID) in 
 the past five years, as well as interviews with AID employees, point 
 to several financial, reporting, and notification mechanisms as 
 impediments to the agency's efficiency and effectiveness. Chief among 
 these are: (1) restrictions on funding by appropriations of program 
 funds in one-year increments and multiple accounts, (2) earmarking of 
 funds, and (3) external and internal reporting and notification 
 requirements.(1)
<p>
 No one disputes the need for oversight of AID to ensure that it is 
 achieving results that advance U.S. foreign policy objectives. The 
 tension between the executive and legislative branches inherent in 
 our constitutional system, however, was exacerbated in the 1980s 
 because of friction created by divided government and policy 
 differences between the legislative and executive branches. This 
 friction contributed to a proliferation of financial and reporting 
 mechanisms to control and monitor agency action.(2) Changes are 
 needed to transform executive and legislative branch control 
 mechanisms into incentives for improved performance and 
 accomplishment of results at AID.
<p>
 Appropriations. With few exceptions, Congress appropriates AID's 
 development assistance for a one-year period.(3) This appropriations 
 funding cycle inhibits the kind of results-driven budget system 
 envisioned by the National Performance Review (NPR) effort. AID 
 employees indicate that the one-year cycle encourages obligating 
 funds without adequate planning, disrupts project continuity due to 
 uncertainties about funding availability from year to year, and 
 reduces the agency's leverage in negotiating contracts and other 
 agreements.(4) While Congress moved in fiscal year 1993 to 
 consolidate most AID development assistance funding from multiple 
 accounts into just two accounts, the consolidation of all development 
 assistance into a single fund would improve the agency's flexibility 
 and effectiveness by allowing it to transfer funding more quickly and 
 efficiently to priority, high-performing projects and programs.
<p>
 Earmarking. This practice consists of legislative restrictions on how 
 AID can spend its appropriated funds. Funds are earmarked in 
 different ways. These include limitations on the maximum amount of 
 money that can be spent, specifications of minimum amounts to be 
 spent, specific instructions on how money will be spent, and 
 establishment of required staffing levels. Funds are also earmarked 
 by targeting expenditures toward specific countries, projects, 
 entities to carry out those projects, and functional accounts (e.g., 
 environment and energy, education, microenterprise activities, and 
 capital projects).
<p>
 Funding earmarks grew markedly in AID appropriations bills during the 
 1980s. Earmarks have not been confined to legislation, however. 
 Several appropriations bills were accompanied by lengthy conference 
 reports by congressional committees, requesting or directing the 
 expenditure of funds in particular ways.(5) AID officials recognize 
 that such reports do not have the force of law. Nevertheless, they 
 feel constrained to implement requests or directions on funding 
 allocations to try to meet Congress' goals and to avoid problems.
<p>
 The most heavily earmarked account is the Economic Support Fund (ESF) 
 category, representing approximately 25 percent of AID's program 
 assistance budget.(6) In recent years, approximately 85 percent of 
 ESF funding has been legislatively allocated for economic assistance 
 to Israel and Egypt, known as the Camp David countries. In fiscal 
 year 1991, earmarks accounted for 60 percent of AID's overall program 
 assistance budget. While that percentage has declined somewhat in the 
 past two fiscal years, earmarks still apply to more than 50 percent 
 of appropriated funds for AID programs.
<p>
 AID officials and outside analysts generally agree that the 
 earmarking of funds significantly curtails the flexibility needed by 
 the agency to accomplish its mission efficiently and effectively.(7) 
 Earmarks direct funds to certain countries, projects, or recipients 
 at the expense of others that may be needier or likelier to succeed. 
 In addition, it is more difficult to exert leverage on, and enforce 
 reasonable and prudent controls over, designated recipients of 
 earmarked funds when they know that their funding levels are assured.
<p>
 The elimination or substantial reduction of earmarks is consistent 
 with, and would advance, an important goal of government reinvention 
 efforts. A recent congressional task force concluded: "Removing 
 earmarks would enable more effective Congressional oversight, because 
 Congress could focus on program results rather than relying on 
 earmarks and associated prohibitions, conditions and reporting 
 requirements."(8) If enacted, the current fiscal year 1994 AID 
 appropriations bill pending in the House of Representatives would 
 eliminate program funding earmarks.(9)
<p>
 Reports and Notifications. A third burden on AID operations 
 consistently identified by agency officials and outside reviewers is 
 the number and volume of reporting requirements imposed in foreign 
 assistance-related legislation and legislative reports.(10) These 
 reporting and notification requirements fall into three general 
 categories: (1) notifications, advising Congress of actions, 
 determinations, or other events as they occur; (2) periodic reports; 
 and (3) one-time reports. 
<p>
 These directives are found in authorizing and appropriations 
 legislation, and in the accompanying and often voluminous committee 
 reports. While some of these reporting requirements are not legally 
 binding, the agency feels that such directions cannot be ignored and 
 that it must comply.
<p>
 Clearly, some reports are important and necessary for congressional 
 oversight. In the interest of reducing undue constraints on mission 
 accomplishment, however, it should be asked: (1) whether reporting 
 and notification requirements imposed on AID at every stage of 
 program operations reflect an undue focus on inputs and processes, 
 rather than on the results of agency programs and operations; and (2) 
 whether the number of required reports, their frequency, and the 
 resources expended in their preparation divert already-limited staff 
 and budget resources from more productive, mission-oriented 
 activities.
<p>
 AID must submit approximately 60 reports to Congress in fiscal year 
 1993, divided nearly evenly between one-time and periodic 
 reports.(11) At least 10 reports can be identified for possible 
 elimination, based on a lack of continued utility.(12)
<p>
 A larger reporting burden is imposed in connection with congressional 
 notifications, including what are known as country notifications and 
 technical notifications. AID sources report that the agency prepares 
 and submits an average of 1,000 congressional notifications per year. 
 These include notifications to congressional committees made in 
 advance of specified funding decisions, project changes, 
 reprogramming decisions, and other program activities.
<p>
 By law, AID must notify Congress of every proposed project obligation 
 in excess of amounts previously justified in AID budget documents 
 before obligating funds for these activities.(13) Notifications are 
 sent to at least four congressional committees and must precede the 
 obligations involved by at least 15 days. During this period, members 
 may place holds on the proposed obligations for varying lengths of 
 time.(14) Reasons for the holds vary and can occur as a result of 
 factors unrelated to AID's proposed project (for example, concerns 
 over controversial events in, or activities or policies of, the 
 country in which the project is to occur).(15)
<p>
 An estimated 35 to 50 holds are placed on obligations in any given 
 year. The notification process costs an estimated $185,000 and four 
 work years of staff time each year. The office responsible for 
 coordinating and sending reports to Congress estimates that from 1 to 
 11 people (and possibly more) review and clear each notification.(16) 
 Reducing the levels of review on these reports, however, would not 
 resolve the threshold issues of the need for the number and frequency 
 of these notifications, and the length of the waiting period before 
 AID can proceed to implement funding and other decisions.
<p>
 A 1988 congressional study of foreign assistance reporting 
 requirements concluded that the number of foreign aid reporting 
 requirements could be reduced by as much as one-half through 
 consolidation or repeal of unnecessary and obsolete requirements. The 
 agency's Congressional Presentation (CP) report received special 
 mention. AID reported that it spent approximately 120 work years and 
 more than $9 million to assemble this single report. 
<p>
 A consensus was found to exist among numerous legislative and 
 executive branch officials interviewed that substantial portions of 
 the CP could be eliminated.(17) AID has made progress since then in 
 reducing the size and expense of the CP, but the problem is 
 illustrative of the overall nature of the concern in this area.
<p>
 In addition to the reports required to be submitted to Congress, AID 
 officials and employees have also identified a proliferation of 
 administrative reporting requirements and procedural directive 
 systems as impediments to organizational efficiency and 
 effectiveness. A mission in Africa, for example, recently compiled a 
 list of approximately 46 reports that African field posts submit to 
 headquarters in Washington at different reporting intervals each 
 year.(18) Some of these reports, it should be noted, implement 
 statutory or regulatory requirements. AID administrator J. Brian 
 Atwood summarized the nature of the problem:
<p>
 
 [O]ur failures in the past have produced overregulation in the 
 present. We have spent more time on paperwork than people work. AID 
 personnel have become more concerned with process than development. 
 The first thought that should come to the mind of an AID project 
 officer should not be "[H]ave I filled the forms out right?" It 
 should be "[W]hat will this project achieve?" After that question is 
 answered, we should then turn to accountability--and we should be 
 accountable.(19)
<p>
 
 The agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) agrees that at least 
 some of the agency's internal directives and reporting requirements 
 have outlived their usefulness, impose costs in excess of the 
 benefits derived, or otherwise impede the agency's effectiveness and 
 efficiency.(20) A new AID Quality Council is coordinating an 
 agencywide review of recurring reporting requirements, with a view 
 toward consolidation or elimination of reports. The agency's Policy 
 Directorate has recently undertaken a comprehensive revision of the 
 agency's 33-volume handbook system, which has not been substantially 
 updated for nearly a decade.(21)
<p>
 Other administrative reporting mechanisms examined by the National 
 Performance Review include several associated with what is known as 
 the apportionment process administered by the Office of Management 
 and Budget (OMB). Following enactment of congressional 
 appropriations, apportionments of funds must be made by OMB before 
 they can be obligated by an agency. Except for ESF monies, 
 apportionments of funds to AID are made by OMB in consultation with 
 the agency. By law, ESF funds are allocated on a country-by-country 
 basis by the State Department, in consultation with AID; OMB then 
 apportions funds for obligation by AID.(22)
<p>
 AID's history of substantial management problems led to the formation 
 in 1991 of what became known as the Joint OMB-AID SWAT Team, which 
 was tasked with a comprehensive review of the agency's operations. 
 The resulting report by the reviewers from both agencies led to 30 
 recommendations covering virtually every aspect of the agency's 
 operations.(23)
<p>
 The apportionment process provides OMB with an opportunity to 
 evaluate AID's progress toward the management reforms it committed to 
 make after the joint review. History suggests that OMB's diligence in 
 apportioning AID appropriations has not been misplaced. Nevertheless, 
 progress by AID in implementing SWAT Team recommendations and other 
 reforms (e.g., improved program planning and evaluation, information 
 and financial management, portfolio and contract management, and a 
 more timely obligation of funds) could enable some reduction in 
 reporting, documentation, and attendant delays currently associated 
 with the apportionment process.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. Funding for AID development assistance programs should be 
 appropriated on a two-year or multiyear basis determined by reference 
 to specific assistance needs.
<p>
 This recommendation does not imply the creation of open-ended 
 spending authority, but rather the setting of multiyear commitments 
 corresponding to the reality of AID's development assistance program 
 funding and project cycles. Appropriation periods can be adjusted by 
 Congress as those circumstances change.(24)
<p>
 
 2. AID development assistance funds should be appropriated as part of 
 a single account.
<p>
 Implementation of this recommendation could be accomplished with the 
 submission of an AID development assistance funding request in a 
 unified account, followed by congressional appropriation of funds in 
 that single account category.
<p>
 
 3. Earmarks on AID development assistance appropriations should be 
 eliminated or reduced to allow the agency greater flexibility in 
 responding to changing assistance needs. 
<p>
 The elimination or reduction of earmarks, along with establishment of 
 a single budget category for all appropriated development assistance 
 funds, would significantly reduce AID's management load in tracking 
 all obligations by separate category and account, and could result in 
 a significant reduction of in-house staff devoted to such activities. 
 The proposed elimination of earmarks on AID appropriations for fiscal 
 year 1994 in H.R. 2295 represents significant progress on this 
 issue.(25)
<p>
 
 4. Statutory reporting and notification requirements should be 
 reduced. 
<p>
 Congress should reduce, consolidate, or eliminate unduly costly, 
 burdensome, and obsolete reporting and notification requirements, 
 with particular emphasis on the Congressional Presentation report and 
 one-time notifications. This recommendation could be accomplished by 
 one or more of the following measures: (1) amendment of the pertinent 
 reporting and notification provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act 
 of 1961, as amended, and other statutes affecting AID operations to 
 eliminate unnecessary and outdated requirements, and to consolidate 
 remaining requirements in a single report; (2) deletion of affected 
 reports and notifications in new legislation recommended elsewhere in 
 this report; (3) limitation of new reporting requirements in future 
 authorization and appropriations acts, and in committee reports 
 accompanying such legislation; or (4) use of computer technology to 
 simplify the report preparation and transmittal process.(26) 
 Reporting requirements identified for elimination in one current 
 Senate foreign assistance reauthorization proposal should be 
 considered as a starting point.(27)
<p>
 
 5. The AID administrator should assure the completion of a zero-based 
 review of all internal agency reporting requirements and procedural 
 directives; elimination of outdated, unduly burdensome, non-cost-
 effective requirements; and establishment of controls over the 
 initiation of new requirements. 
<p>
 AID's Policy Directorate and its new Quality Council are already 
 making progress on this initiative. In the process, directorate 
 officials are attempting to strengthen channels of communication with 
 the agency OIG, which has expressed a willingness to assist AID 
 employees in the identification of procedural impediments to the most 
 effective and efficient accomplishment of the agency's mission.
<p>
 
 6. AID should develop a results-driven performance measurement system 
 capable of documenting expenditures of development assistance funds 
 against feasible and measurable performance goals. 
<p>
 Reductions in earmarking, one-year appropriations, reporting 
 requirements, and other control mechanisms should be accompanied by 
 development of reliable and effective performance measurement 
 indicators. Such indicators are needed to ensure the agency's 
 accountability for its allocations of program and other funds, and to 
 provide assurances to the President, OMB, Congress, and the public 
 that AID programs are achieving results.(28)
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 Implementation of the recommended measures will provide AID with 
 much-needed flexibility and increase accountability as it moves 
 toward the goal of becoming a more effectively and efficiently 
 managed mission-driven, results-oriented agency. 
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The primary impact of these recommendations is expected to be more 
 efficient allocation of budgetary and human resources. The fiscal 
 impact of these recommendations cannot be estimated.

 <h2> AID03:  Overhaul the AID Personnel System</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
 Personnel management issues are consistently reported as problems in 
 studies about the Agency for International Development (AID) and in 
 interviews with AID staff. Complaints reflected in this NPR report 
 concern the conflicts between the Foreign and Civil Service systems, 
 workforce diversity, recruitment, assignment, training, evaluation, 
 and overseas support.
<p>
 AID currently maintains three distinct personnel systems to manage 
 its direct-hire employees. These are the Foreign Service (FS), the 
 Civil Service General Schedule (GS), and the Foreign Service National 
 (FSN) systems. Fully incorporated into AID in 1980, the Foreign 
 Service principally manages staff at overseas posts and senior 
 management positions in Washington.(1) In 1980, every position in 
 Washington was designated as either a GS or FS position. The Civil 
 Service is used for support staff, technical experts, and some senior 
 management positions in Washington. Except in limited circumstances, 
 GS employees are not assigned abroad, although they can travel 
 overseas. FSN employees are non-U.S. citizens working at overseas 
 posts.
<p>
 AID has approximately 1,700 FS employees--about 1,100 located 
 overseas and 600 in Washington. All of AID's nearly 1,000 direct-hire 
 FSNs serve overseas. All of AID's more than 1,500 GS employees serve in 
 the United States. Besides its direct-hire employees in the three 
 personnel systems, AID will employ about 4,500 personal 
 service contractors (PSCs) in fiscal year 1993 to perform a wide 
 range of duties, primarily overseas. These include project 
 implementation, evaluation, monitoring, and other tasks that do not 
 statutorily require performance by a direct-hire employee. About 10 
 percent of the PSC workforce consists of U.S. citizens.
<p>
 Workforce management has been raised as a problem at AID in most of 
 the major studies of the agency. The AID personnel system has been 
 criticized as complex, costly, and unsuited to accomplishing the 
 mission of the agency.(2) The 1992 President's Commission on the 
 Management of AID Programs (the Ferris Commission report) summed up 
 the situation by stating: "AID needs to change the ways it recruits, 
 assigns, trains and develops its staff."(3)
<p>
 Recent responses to a worldwide information cable sent by AID 
 management suggest strong dissatisfaction with AID's personnel 
 system.(4) According to one response, "The personnel system is 
 hopelessly antiquated, slow, perverse, and unproductive." The FS 
 evaluation system came in for special criticism, with the response 
 from one overseas post suggesting that it needed revision to improve 
 morale, and that "missions are almost put out of business in 
 April/May each year in order to complete the requirements." Another 
 post criticized the evaluation process because it is "time consuming, 
 expensive and--most importantly--does not work." One employee 
 suggested that staff should evaluate managers. Another post noted the 
 lack of minorities in decision making roles.
<p>
 Dual Foreign Service/Civil Service General Schedule System. Operation 
 of the dual FS/GS system was cited often in recent analyses of the 
 agency and in interviews (both inside and outside AID) as a source of 
 morale problems, management difficulties, rigidity, and wasteful 
 bureaucracy. Important differences exist between the two systems 
 because they are designed to fill different needs. The Foreign 
 Service is largely an up-or-out system. Employees typically come in 
 through the bottom, as in the military, and advance upward through 
 the grades in an established schedule. If they remain in one class 
 for longer than a certain period without promotion, they come up 
 against FS time-in-class rules and are subject to separation. In the 
 past, however, limited career extensions (LCEs) have been granted 
 almost routinely, extending many senior employees beyond their time-
 in-class, further contributing to a personnel structure already 
 criticized as top-heavy. In contrast, the Civil Service can be 
 entered at any level through open competition, but advancement is 
 only possible if a position at the next grade is available.
<p>
 The compensation structures of the two systems differ in ways that 
 bring them into conflict. FS employees are compensated on a rank-in-
 person basis rather than rank-in-job as in the Civil Service. The 
 rank-in-person system was designed to accommodate rotational 
 assignments. The GS system, on the other hand, is designed to focus 
 greater levels of specialization in the workforce. The GS salary 
 structure is based on traditional measures, like specialist skills, 
 breadth of responsibility, and number and type of employees 
 supervised. FS employees are promoted based on the results of an 
 annual performance review.
<p>
  These two systems often collide, especially where they coexist in 
 the same unit. For instance, GS employees serving side-by-side with 
 headquarters FS staff have more difficulty receiving promotions for 
 similar work if they do not have supervisory responsibilities. They 
 are reviewed based on different standards and systems. Conflicts have 
 also arisen over the numbers and types of positions reserved for FS 
 staff.(5)
<p>
 The two systems have different types of probationary periods. AID 
 career FS staff are tenured. To achieve tenure the employee must 
 complete at least three fully successful years (of which two must be 
 overseas) within five years, receive satisfactory proficiency in a 
 relevant language, and be reviewed by a tenure board. Tenure boards 
 meet twice a year. During the most recent board deliberations, 21 
 employees were recommended for separation and five were deferred for 
 additional evaluation.
<p>
 The Civil Service has a three-year career-conditional period, after 
 which career status is conferred. It should be noted that AID has 
 authority to grant non-tenured FS appointments of up to five years. 
 The FS tenure system has been criticized for impeding the agency's 
 ability to respond to the changing development priorities of the 
 1990s by protecting the interests of staff with skills less suited to 
 new challenges.
<p>
 A workable example of a unified foreign affairs personnel system 
 exists. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) maintains a Civil 
 Service-based unitary personnel system that is highly responsive to 
 the need for flexibility in overseas assignments. The CIA assigns 
 staff both in the United States and abroad, often in situations of 
 extreme hardship. There are no restrictions as to geographic 
 assignment, employees carry rank-in-person, and retirement 
 compensation relates to months of actual field or hardship 
 service.(6) In the Foreign Service, on the other hand, once tenure 
 has been granted, waivers may permit the FS employee to serve 
 exclusively in Washington and still be eligible for retirement after 
 only 20 years of service.
<p>
 Length of Overseas Assignment. Concerns were raised during interviews 
 that overseas tours at AID are too short. FS employees serve two- and 
 four-year tours, depending on the post. This assignment structure is 
 seen as having a major negative impact on staff effectiveness, 
 program continuity, and transfer and training costs. The current 
 system does not realize a full return on the overhead investments 
 (e.g., training and relocation) the agency makes in its employees.
<p>
 Foreign Service Assignment Process. The FS assignment process was 
 criticized as unresponsive to the needs of the agency and unfair to 
 the employees who are subject to it. The Ferris Commission report 
 described the informal assignment process that has developed, noting 
 that the bulk of the assignments are negotiated without the 
 participation of the personnel office. Critics contend that only the 
 less desirable assignments are made according to the established 
 guidelines.(7)
<p>
 International Development Intern Program. AID's International 
 Development Intern (IDI) program is a proven success. The number of 
 positions funded each year, however, has fluctuated in response to 
 the rise and fall of AID staffing funds. The graduates of the IDI 
 program are a "Who's Who" of successful AID managers. Given the 
 nationwide trend to reduce middle management positions, the 
 historical pathway for advancement is being closed off to many 
 employees. The IDI program is an effective vehicle for improving 
 workplace diversity and is a reliable source of managerial talent. 
 This program is an effective way for AID to enrich its workforce.
<p>
 Interdisciplinary Rotations. Mandatory, interdisciplinary rotation 
 (e.g., program operations to administration, implementa-tion to 
 evaluation, or headquarters to field) of junior officers is common in 
 the foreign affairs and military communities. AID is a notable 
 exception, partly because many AID officers come in at mid-career 
 level. Because of a new agency emphasis on results-based performance 
 measurements and recent congressional legislative initiatives in the 
 area of mandatory performance standards and strategic planning, 
 cross-training in evaluation methodology, resource allocation, and 
 management is an essential element in future career development. 
 Rotations offering training in these areas should be mandatory for 
 promotion purposes and seen as a normal part of career development.
<p>
 Use of Tandem Couples. Overcoming historical problems with dual 
 assignments (assignments where married FS officers serve at the same 
 post) will become more important in the deficit reduction environment 
 of the 1990s. Overhead savings (e.g., storage of household effects, 
 housing expenses, transportation of things, travel and education for 
 dependents, family medical care) can be substantial by hiring 
 couples. Liberalizing hiring of spouses at post is an important step 
 forward in attracting professional couples and supporting the 
 professional and personal interests of FS families. 
<p>
 Federal law and regulation are quite stringent about nepotism. 
 Assignments must be made carefully so that spouses are not 
 operationally accountable to each other, or serve in positions where 
 normal separation of duties is called for because of potential for 
 financial or other conflicts of interest. Experience has shown that 
 smaller country programs tend not to allow the required separation.
<p>
 Overseas Compensation. Overseas compensation, tied largely to the 
 Foreign Service Act, has been criticized as too generous. FS staff 
 and U.S. contractors are eligible for U.S. holidays, local holidays, 
 annual leave, home leave, and compensation for rest and recuperation 
 (R&R) trips in selected posts (staff assigned in both Barbados and 
 Bangkok are, for example, eligible for R&R away from these posts). In 
 addition, staff are eligible for up to 25 percent pay differential 
 based on hardship and cost of living. In some countries, they receive 
 commissary privileges or shipment of consumables--goods purchased in 
 the United States and shipped at government expense to post for the 
 employee's use.
<p>
 In 1989, GAO reviewed State Department plans to augment housing 
 standards for FS officers. The study concluded that for State 
 Department employees alone housing costs would increase by at least 
 $10.9 million--much more if other foreign affairs agencies followed 
 suit. The study noted that many government employees were living in 
 housing that exceeded current standards.(8)
<p>
 Training. Deficiencies in training are mentioned in interviews and 
 recent management studies of AID. The 1992 Joint OMB-AID SWAT Team 
 report on AID operations suggested that project management was the 
 greatest weakness in training.(9) The Ferris Commission noted the ad 
 hoc nature of training at AID and the low commitment of 
 resources.(10) The agency has begun pilot training programs in 
 project and contract management, with a view toward certifying 
 project officers beginning in fiscal year 1995. The agency also has a 
 vigorous language training program and should continue to emphasize 
 language proficiency.
<p>
 Performance Evaluation. In 1992, the Ferris Commission criticized the 
 use of both the FS and the GS evaluation systems.(11) The Ferris 
 Commission report indicated serious problems with the functioning of 
 the personnel evaluation system, particularly in the Foreign Service, 
 stating: "Because of AID's collegial culture, a system has evolved 
 over time where each individual employee manages his/her assignments, 
 training, career, and frequently even drafts input into annual 
 performance ratings. GS employees tend to be ignored or little 
 involved in career development and training."(12) The FS appraisal 
 system is also criticized for not being linked to accomplishment of 
 the goals of the agency. 
<p>
 Awards are given liberally at AID. The Joint OMB-AID SWAT Team 
 reported that:
<p>
 
 In fiscal year 1991, the agency (AID) paid $2.4 million in 
 performance based incentive awards to about 1,700 employees. In that 
 year, 43 percent of the Foreign Service staff received awards and 59 
 percent of the Civil Service employees received awards. In the same 
 year, AID separated only five people for substandard performance.(13) 
<p>
 AID personnel office staff recently said that 95 percent of AID 
 Foreign Service employees received either outstanding or superior 
 performance ratings in fiscal year 1992.
<p>
 Performance Incentives. Although not unique in this regard among 
 federal agencies, AID employees do not have routine, predictable 
 jobs. Rather, many employees are problem solvers, confronting new and 
 complex development problems and then, by applying a mix of 
 information and financial resources, solve, or at least ameliorate 
 them. Risk taking is inherent in this type of work, and because of 
 that fact, failures are to be anticipated. Conducting meaningful 
 performance appraisals of AID employees means acknowledging the 
 tension between process and product. Measuring only process, however, 
 means that performance appraisal focus is only on inputs, not on 
 outcomes.
<p>
 The AID Agency Incentives Project (conducted between July and 
 December 1991) represented a positive effort by the agency to 
 revitalize its employee incentives systems by acknowledging the high 
 level of service motivation in most AID employees, shifting 
 evaluation focus to project results, giving managers greater autonomy 
 over incentive resources, and supporting employees with a refined 
 statement of agency mission. 
<p>
 According to the project report, many employees are "frustrated by 
 obstacles such as a lack of clear direction, cumbersome procedures, 
 outmoded systems and facilities, and a poorly defined career path 
 that fails to provide opportunities and rewards in a transparent, 
 predictable and equitable manner."(14) The report criticized the 
 awards process because the awards systems are "overly centralized, 
 the process is less than transparent, and rewards are not made in a 
 timely manner and are not adequately tied to performance."(15) The 
 suggestion was made that "to be effective, the process must be 
 decentralized, timely, equitable, and based to an increased extent on 
 peer and subordinate input."(16) All of these steps are consistent 
 with the basic principles of reinvention.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 AID needs to determine the optimal personnel system that will 
 contribute to the achievement of the agency's basic mission and clear 
 priorities. The new system should ensure improvements of the current 
 mixed systems in the following areas:
<p>
 1. AID should operationally integrate all its human resource 
 management systems, including FSN and PSC staffs, as well as FS and 
 GS employees.
<p>
 The AID Administrator should select the approach that is most 
 consistent with the requirements of the agency.(17)
<p>
 
 2. AID should reinvigorate the International Development Intern (IDI) 
 Program.
<p>
 AID should support this source of managerial talent and workplace 
 diversity by ensuring stable funding for the program and including 
 IDI rotations in agency workforce planning.
<p>
 
 3. AID should ensure that the lengths of overseas assignments are 
 logically related to the nature of the work performed by AID 
 personnel.
<p>
 In many cases, this will involve lengthening tours beyond the current 
 two- to four-year period. Its net effect should be to better leverage 
 experience gained in individual countries.
<p>
 
 4. AID should ensure that junior officers develop management and 
 administrative skills as part of their career development.
<p>
 
 5. AID should invest in more training in project implementation, 
 contract administration, financial management, and foreign language 
 proficiency.
<p>
 
 6. AID should encourage rotational assignments in and out of the 
 Office of the Inspector General (OIG).
<p>
 Staff from the OIG should be allowed to take assignments as project 
 managers. Also, the agency should facilitate rotational assignments 
 for program staff through the OIG. AID management should take 
 measures to improve the relationship between agency managers and the 
 OIG.
<p>
 
 7. AID should restructure the performance review and employee 
 incentive programs to link individual performance to organizational 
 performance.
<p>
 
 8. The AID Administrator should enforce the terms of the up-or-out 
 regulations and begin reducing the excess senior management at the 
 agency.
<p>
 The Administrator should curtail the routine granting of LCE waivers 
 to the up-or-out regulations.
<p>
 
 9. AID should integrate qualified spouses of overseas couples into 
 the assignment process and cultivate them as part of the overseas 
 workforce.(18)
<p>
 Assignments should be made carefully so as not to violate federal law 
 and regulations regarding nepotism.
<p>
 
 10. AID should initiate an interagency review of FS benefit policies 
 among the various agencies using FS employees.
<p>
 Areas for scrutiny should include but not be limited to leave 
 policies, pay differentials, rest and recuperation policies, and 
 housing standards.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 An operationally unified personnel system will increase the 
 effectiveness and the flexibility of the organization. It will allow 
 selection of technically trained staff available for field service 
 based on immediate competence, thereby reducing the time and cost of 
 recruitment and training. Headquarters and field staff can be rotated 
 at will, increasing opportunities to target skills at appropriate 
 country missions.
<p>
 A unified system will be more efficient to administer than the 
 current system. Review of the overseas compensation package will show 
 possible cost savings in areas like housing standards and 
 differential pay. Enforcing the terms of the up-or-out regulations 
 will make room for younger staff, facilitate improvements in 
 workplace diversity, and allow expansion of the IDI program.
<p>
 Increasing the tour length will enhance the effectiveness of the 
 program staff at post by giving them a longer opportunity to learn 
 about and focus on the specific problems of a country. A longer 
 commitment to a particular country will improve project continuity 
 and create an incentive to more carefully consider overseas 
 assignments. Encouraging a more family-friendly overseas work 
 environment will make more cost-effective tandem couple assignments 
 possible.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The estimated costs (including overhead) to place one AID staff 
 person in the field range from $150,000 to $300,000 per year 
 exclusive of salary. (The direct costs are estimated at $60,000 to 
 $105,000 per year.) AID personnel are paid up to 25 percent pay 
 differential for overseas assignments in hardship posts. Training 
 costs will be reduced by rotating formerly GS employees or previously 
 language-trained professionals out into the field. Increasing normal 
 tour length will reduce the costs associated with relocating staff. 
 Reducing the number of highly graded employees on limited career 
 extensions will lower salary expenses. The actual fiscal savings 
 associated with these changes, however, depend on their timing and 
 nature and cannot be estimated at this time.
<p>
 
<b> Endnotes</b>
<p>
 1. The formal designation of AID positions as Foreign Service or 
 Civil Service took place in 1979, in response to an amendment of 
 Section 401 of the International Development and Food Assistance Act 
 of 1978. This act required the President to submit to Congress 
 regulations establishing a unified personnel system. A task force was 
 assembled and charged with the responsibility of determining the 
 correct category for each position. The determinations were to be 
 made based primarily on the requirement of specific knowledge or 
 experience related to the overseas development process. On May 1, 
 1979, President Carter submitted regulations to Congress; those 
 regulations became effective on October 1, 1979. The regulations 
 provide that a position in AID-Washington may be designated as a GS 
 position, rather than a Foreign Service position, only if (1) the 
 position is primarily of a clerical, administrative, or program 
 support character and can be performed without significant overseas 
 experience or understanding of the overseas development process; or 
 (2) it requires such continuity and specialized knowledge as to make 
 it impractical to assign the incumbent overseas. 
<p>

 Ferris Commission), Action Plan--Working Draft #1 (Washington, D.C., 
 March 2, 1992), p. 10. This theme is elaborated in The President's 
 Commission on the Management of AID Programs, A Progress Report 
 (Washington, D.C., September 30, 1992). 
<p>
 4. AID cable 143458 requested field perspectives on AID's goals and 
 priorities. 
<p>
 5. The process of identifying FS and GS positions was contested by 
 the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). The union pressed 
 for greater representation in offices originally designated as having 
 primarily GS employees. AFSA objected, for example, in an open letter 
 to Congressman David Obey dated December 10, 1979, about a 10 percent 
 loophole that would allow the administrator to assign GS employees 
 into FS slots. The letter said: "AFSA never liked the ten percent 
 exception, which by definition allows not fully qualified personnel 
 to be assigned to Foreign Service-designated positions and naturally 
 reduces assignment opportunities for Foreign Service personnel." 
<p>
 6. The Peace Corps compensation structure for overseas professional 
 staff is worthy of note. Peace Corps staff interact with ministry 
 officials like their AID colleagues, and are represented on the 
 country team. They receive no hardship pay differentials, do not live 
 in diplomatic-style representational housing, and receive no rest 
 recuperation allowances.

 17. Two potential approaches are to: (1) create a unified personnel 
 system based on best practices from other agencies (the Central 
 Intelligence Agency personnel system is a useful model); or (2) break 
 down barriers wherever possible between the two systems. With respect 
 to the second option, AID management can make better use of 
 noncareer, time-limited FS appointments and excursion tours for GS 
 employees wanting to serve abroad. The agency can reevaluate the 
 current mix of designated FS and GS positions and identify positions 
 in headquarters as open for both FS and GS employees unless there is 
 a clear reason for them to be reserved for employees of one service. 
 Grade banding (reducing the number of grades to three or four with 
 greater ranges of salaries) for GS jobs would help bring compensation 
 in line with FS compensation. 
<p>
 18. Two options for AID are: (1) to secure authority to waive full-
 time equivalent (FTE) limits for accompanying spouses; or (2) in lieu 
 of the first option, AID should secure authority to count as service 
 toward retirement the time spent accompanying (in leave without pay 
 [LWOP] status) the AID-employed. This time could be counted as either 
 equal to time gained from regular service or, more likely, as a 
 fraction of the time gained from regular employment.

 Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
 <h2> AID04:  Manage AID Employees and Consultants as a Unified Workforce
</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
 The Agency for International Development (AID) has increasingly 
 relied on personal service contractors (PSCs) to manage its 
 assistance activities. Restricting staffing resources has contributed 
 to deterioration of AID's ability to manage itself and its programs 
 by shifting the duties of AID project officers away from hands-on 
 project management into process management (e.g., preparing proposals 
 and managing contracts). 
<p>
 The agency is being forced to shed, through attrition, much of its 
 program implementation expertise, with a resultant lack of continuity 
 in program administration. In a downward spiral, AID managers are 
 increasingly preoccupied with contract management and lose touch with 
 the reality of field work, further diminishing their effectiveness in 
 overseeing the performance of contractors. Although the direct-hire 
 workforce has declined, the increase in PSC levels has more than made 
 up for the direct-hire decrease.
<p>
 AID has about 1,700 Foreign Service employees, approximately 1,100 
 overseas and 600 in Washington; nearly 1,000 direct-hire Foreign 
 Service Nationals overseas; and about 1,500 Civil Service employees in 
 Washington. Besides its direct-hire employees, AID will employ about 
4,500 personal service contractors (PSCs) in fiscal year 1993. 
 About one percent of PSCs served in Washington in 1992 to support 
 central programs and the rapid expansion of AID program activities 
 into the former Soviet Union; the balance served abroad. Normally, 
 authority to employ PSCs is granted only for contractors working 
 overseas. About 10 percent of the PSCs are U.S. citizens.
<p>
 The President's Commission on the Management of AID Programs (the 
 Ferris Commission) noted AID's heavy reliance on contractors to carry 
 out increasing amounts of project design and service delivery. The 
 commission concluded that "a major factor which makes human resource 
 management most difficult in AID is that external parties determine 
 the annual operating expense funds and career personnel ceilings AID 
 must adhere to without reference to the program to be carried 
 out."(1) This refers to the separate operating expense appropriation 
 from Congress and the full-time equivalent (FTE) ceilings imposed on 
 agencies by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).(2) Conflicts 
 have existed between AID management's vision of the agency's overseas 
 structure and the visions of Congress and OMB.
<p>
 Declining levels of operating expense funds and FTEs have changed the 
 role and makeup of AID's overseas workforce. In a constrained 
 resource environment, the decision to turn to PSCs is a logical one 
 for program managers. PSCs provide a flexible alternative to direct-
 hire employees, and are especially useful for quickly changing the 
 workforce skill balance to react to evolving requirements. PSCs, 
 doing much the same work that a direct-hire employee does, can be 
 charged to program funds, rather than more tightly controlled 
 operating expense funds. Direct-hire employees cannot have their 
 salaries charged to program accounts. Consequently, among program 
 managers, there is a movement away from the implementation of 
 development activities to the management and monitoring of contracts. 
<p>
 According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), "Although overseas 
 U.S. direct-hire employees spent 32 percent of their work years on 
 project management, their responsibilities increasingly involved 
 managing and monitoring contractors, rather than the technical 
 aspects of project implementation. Accordingly, missions and overseas 
 offices place great reliance on foreign national direct-hires and PSC 
 to manage day-to-day project implementation."(3)
<p>
 In fiscal year 1990, more than two-thirds of AID's overseas work 
 years (totaling approximately 8,000 years) were expended by American 
 and foreign national PSCs, who are not separately identified and 
 reported to Congress. Foreign national PSCs made up 60 percent of the 
 overseas workforce in 1990, followed by 15 percent for American 
 direct hires, 12 percent for foreign national direct hires, and 13 
 percent for American PSCs.(4)
<p>
 The reductions in direct-hire employee staffing have not been evenly 
 distributed. According to the Ferris Commission report:
<p>
 The continuing reductions in direct-hire levels required by [OMB] 
 have hit the field missions the hardest. During the period FY '85-FY 
 '89, U.S. direct-hire staff decreased by 2.6 percent while direct-
 hire staff overseas decreased by 14.5 percent. This occurred in the 
 face of [Inspector General and General Accounting Office] criticisms 
 that AID did not have sufficient project management in the field.(5)
<p>
 AID determined those specific staffing reductions according to its 
 own internal priorities.
<p>
 The personnel system has not responded to the need for staff with 
 training or experience in contract management.(6) GAO indicated that 
 AID has not adjusted its culture, training, and personnel practices 
 to the increased use of contractors to deliver services, noting that 
 large numbers of AID employees consider contract management to be a 
 low priority, despite the fact that the bulk of project officers' 
 responsibilities increasingly revolve around contract development and 
 management. GAO also noted problems with supervision of overseas 
 contractors and data collection concerning the number and nature of 
 personal service contracts.(7)
<p>
 Currently, AID budgets salaries for direct-hire staff out of a 
 central agency pool and assigns FTE levels to each operational unit. 
 Budgeting salaries out of a central fund does not create incentives 
 for managers to factor payroll costs into their planning or to 
 consider potential savings when hiring. Giving line managers 
 increased control over staffing resources is an important reinvention 
 principle.(8) Managing the total AID workforce--direct hires as well 
 as PSCs--through the budgets of line managers is the only way to 
 effectively control the size of the workforce.
<p>
 Relaxing FTE restrictions may not be the only action required to 
 realign the AID workforce. A critical related issue is that Congress 
 appropriates funds separately for operating expenses, the account 
 from which direct-hire employees are paid. Reductions in AID's 
 operating expense budget have recently kept the agency from using its 
 full allocation of FTEs. Contractors can be paid out of program money 
 because their work is generally tied directly to project 
 implementation.
<p>
 The proposal to grant line managers more direct control over staffing 
 resources is written with the presumption that AID is already 
 concentrating its overseas staffing resources by phasing out some 
 programs and consolidating some services in regional offices. If 
 these changes were not already underway, a further recommendation 
 would involve using program money to fund direct-hire positions where 
 legitimate direct program oversight responsibility exists.
<p>
 The following actions should not be initiated until AID has produced 
 a thorough budget and policy analysis and has put in place the 
 reporting and monitoring systems to ensure accomplishment of its 
 mission.
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. AID should vigorously explore opportunities to remove staffing 
 restrictions and allocate operating expense salary resources to 
 individual managers, rather than budgeting and managing funds 
 centrally.
<p>
 This should include (to the extent feasible given governmentwide 
 classification constraints) the salary and benefits portions of the 
 operating expenses. Both actions must be taken concurrently to fully 
 implement the proposal. To the extent possible, pilot efforts should 
 be initiated to enable line managers to manage staffing tied to 
 resources rather than to work years. Managers should be rewarded for 
 using staff more creatively to reduce costs.
<p>
 
 2. AID should put systems in place to accurately monitor employee 
 work years for both direct-hire employees and PSCs.
<p>
 Staffing analysis should include the total AID workforce, not just 
 direct-hire employees. AID should thoroughly understand the real 
 number of work years required to carry out its programs and be 
 prepared to report that information to OMB and Congress.
<p>
 
 3. AID should undertake a full review of the impact of its policies 
 and practices concerning use of PSCs.
<p>
 Such a review should address the trade-offs between accountability 
 and the need for staffing flexibility, and whether it is not more 
 beneficial to define accountability as assessment of project and 
 program impact rather than contract micromanagement.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 Providing line managers more control over their total budget 
 resources will create incentives for more efficient operation. 
 Because of the administration's commitment to reduce the federal 
 workforce, the combined totals of PSCs and direct-hire staff must be 
 monitored carefully. Also, the multiple pay plans and retirement 
 systems, as well as the high proportion of total operating expenses 
 represented by salaries and benefits, require very close monitoring 
 to avoid exceeding the amount budgeted.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The fiscal implications cannot be determined. Experience has shown, 
 however, that giving line managers control of personnel resources 
 often yields opportunities to reprogram salary money into staff 
 development or other administrative support areas. By considering 
 both the direct-hire and PSC workforce, reductions should be made in 
 the total workforce size. The precise fiscal impact of the 
 recommendation, however, cannot be estimated.

 <h2>  AID05:  Establish an AID Innovation Capital Fund
</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
 The Agency for International Development (AID) must significantly 
 improve its information management capability to adjust to reduced 
 funding levels and a field presence restructured in response to the 
 end of the Cold War. Reductions in the level of operating expense 
 funds between fiscal years 1993 and 1994 make it difficult, however, 
 for AID to reengineer its processes. Without capital funding for 
 information systems development, AID will be hindered in meeting its 
 reporting requirements and empowering managers with useful project 
 information. AID must invest in order to build its capacity to 
 accomplish its mission.
<p>
 Information Management Deficiencies. AID has been widely criticized 
 for deficiencies in its information management. The agency's systems 
 are considered antiquated and unintegrated and consequently do not 
 support management decision making. The accounting system cannot 
 comply with some federal accounting standards. Layers of redundancy 
 exist in the current system structures. Management improvements 
 proposed by various studies conducted over the last several years 
 regularly involve the application of new information technology as 
 integral parts of the corrective actions.
<p>
 Deficiencies in both financial accounting and program information 
 processing have combined to exacerbate AID's resource management 
 problems. Financial management systems and operations in the agency 
 have been reported by AID as high-risk material weaknesses under the 
 Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act since 1988.(1) The General 
 Accounting Office (GAO) has criticized AID for its lack of effective 
 funds control. GAO noted the proliferation of unintegrated systems, 
 identifying more than 100. One core criticism has been that the 
 financial accounting and control system and the mission accounting 
 and control systems are not in conformance with government-wide 
 accounting standards.(2) GAO recommended that AID develop a 
 comprehensive business plan, centralize information resources 
 management (IRM) leadership, incorporate IRM planning into agency 
 strategic planning and resource allocation processes, develop system 
 standards, educate agency decision makers on information initiatives, 
 and complete initiatives to identify information management 
 requirements.(3)
<p>
 Unintegrated Reporting. The Joint OMB-AID SWAT Team, which comprised 
 analysts from both agencies, reported that:
<p>
 AID cannot assemble an "official" portrait of AID's large, diverse 
 field activity portfolio because the agency's information systems 
 lack essential data, are not coordinated, and do not collect 
 information in a consistent manner. 
<p>
 
 The report continued: 
<p>
 AID uses many automated and manual systems to monitor field activity. 
 AID's systems are not integrated, operate on older proprietary 
 computer technologies, and are often duplicate and overlapping. This 
 leads to inconsistent, inaccurate and incomplete reporting that 
 managers frequently do not trust.(4) 
<p>
 During the National Performance Review (NPR) interview process, 
 criticism was frequently expressed regarding the decentralized 
 management structure that had developed at AID and an apparent 
 failure by senior management to exert centralized policy control over 
 automation initiatives. Recent responses to a worldwide AID request 
 for comments indicated a strong field concern about the number and 
 obvious duplication of headquarters reporting requirements.(5)
<p>
 Consolidating Data. Corporate data sharing (centralized data shared 
 by the entire agency) would serve to consolidate reporting and make 
 higher quality and more comprehensive information available faster to 
 both headquarters and field staff. Until AID has the 
 telecommunications capability to provide connectivity with all of the 
 field missions, the agency automation systems will be operating in a 
 mixed mode, with some information coming in electronically and some 
 by incompatible diskette requiring re-entry in Washington--a process 
 that substantially increases the likelihood for data error.(6)
<p>
 AID Information Systems Plan. AID has begun to respond to the 
 criticisms. The agency has completed a comprehensive information 
 systems plan (ISP) geared toward integrating the basic financial, 
 procurement, personnel, and program management functions of the 
 agency by sharing data electronically across office boundaries 
 throughout the agency. A comprehensive business process reengineering 
 initiative is under way as part of the ISP process. This ISP has been 
 favorably reviewed by General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA 
 team briefed AID officials, OMB financial and technical analysts, and 
 NPR staff in June 1993 regarding the outcome of its review. The ISP 
 was seen as technically sound but ambitious, given the lack of 
 resources available to carry it out.
<p>
 AID has actively pursued implementation of the Army Corps of 
 Engineers Financial Management System (CEFMS) to replace AID's 
 current accounting system. CEFMS was selected by AID over off-the-
 shelf software because AID personnel believed it was: (1) from an 
 agency with project management requirements similar to AID, and hence 
 about 70 percent compatible without modification; and (2) available 
 without licensing fees. AID will have to modify either type of 
 software to suit its specialized requirements. AID contends that 
 commercial software will require much higher levels of costly 
 modification for full implementation. The system is currently 
 undergoing extensive testing at AID. The new system is based on 
 establishing centralized corporate data sharing and relating 
 resources to program measures. AID has provided briefings on its 
 findings to the departments of State, Agriculture, and Commerce, and 
 the United States Information Agency.
<p>
 Financial Constraints. Upgrading information management (along with 
 other capital-intensive innovations) at AID has been seriously 
 impeded by rapid expansion of the agency into the countries of the 
 former Soviet Union without program reductions elsewhere. It has also 
 been affected by constraints on the operational expenses account. 
 These two situations have strained AID's ability to put its 
 automation infrastructure in place. AID has requested funding for 
 automation initiatives every year for three years and has received 
 only partial funding. AID has limited authority, with OMB approval, 
 to reprogram some project money into the operational expenses 
 account. Such a transfer has been authorized by OMB and could be 
 expanded with cost analysis by AID.
<p>
 Funding Structures. Increasingly common in state and local 
 governments, innovation funds allow organizations to invest in 
 capital intensive information management hardware, training, or other 
 infrastructure required to fundamentally reengineer work processes. 
 As in the private sector, reengineering business processes depends on 
 both the application of the right amount of capital investment at the 
 right time and a measurable return on investment. A good example for 
 AID would be development of a paperless travel management system, 
 which would cost money to implement but would yield substantial 
 savings in reduced staff-time requirements. Opportunities like this 
 exist throughout the agency. One or more of the following approaches 
 could provide a source of innovation funds for AID, if legislative 
 and funding issues can be resolved:
<p>
 --- Cost savings could be retained in an innovation fund account and 
 allocated by the agency for individual projects.(7) This has the 
 advantage of creating an incentive for managers to save resources for 
 innovation purchases. It has the disadvantages of legal restrictions 
 (e.g., the ability to carry savings across fiscal years) and the long 
 wait for enough cash to accumulate so that the innovation would have 
 a substantial impact. AID will have difficulty meeting fiscal year 
 1994 needs given the operating expenses reduction from fiscal year 
 1993 that the agency will be absorbing. The likelihood of operating 
 expense funds becoming available is slim.
<p>
 --- An innovation fund could be established within normal budget 
 authority by making across-the-board cuts and replenishing depleted 
 funds with savings realized by the new IRM efficiencies.(8) This 
 model has the advantages of speed and simplicity, plus the incentive 
 of reinvesting savings. In AID's case, this approach may be 
 difficult, however, because across-the-board cuts have already been 
 made, and the scale of funding needed to accomplish reengineering 
 would require more capital than might be available.
<p>
  --- Funds could be borrowed from program account(s) and paid back 
 with interest. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and 
 provides an incentive to create savings. It also offers the 
 additional benefit of reversing the normal flow of funds from the 
 program accounts into the administrative accounts. This action, 
 however, would require a presidential determination and congressional 
 consultations. Absent legislation, such funds would remain available 
 only for a single year. AID has limited authority to shift program 
 funds to cover operating expenses.
<p>
  --- Funds could be requested in a separate appropriation or an 
 emergency supplemental to provide seed money for a capital fund. The 
 appropriation should preferably be for more than one year. This type 
 of fund would be replenished with interest through payments from the 
 end users of the innovation. If funded from the foreign operations 
 account, the Budget Act would require off-setting reductions in other 
 AID accounts. This suggests the need for a governmentwide innovation 
 account that is not credited only against the foreign operations 
 account.
<p>
 Repayment to the Fund. Money advanced to pay for an innovation should 
 be considered as a capital investment loan that must be repaid. A 
 request should be accompanied by a comprehensive rate of return 
 analysis that demonstrates whether investment in capital information 
 technology will reduce future operating costs and yield a positive 
 return. 
<p>
 The lenders, in this case Congress and OMB, need to have assurance 
 that the resources will not simply fall into the general operating 
 account and dissipate. Funds made available for capital projects must 
 not be diluted. Objectives must be clear and progress measurable. A 
 clear repayment structure must be agreed upon at the beginning, 
 reflecting the useful life of the innovation, and any policy-related 
 conditions must be laid out unambiguously. Ideally, the repayment 
 should originate with the end users themselves based on actual use of 
 the innovation.
<p>
 
 <b>Actions</b>
<p>
 1. AID should work with OMB and Congress to establish a revolving 
 capital investment fund.
<p>
 In AID's case, given the current financial constraints under which 
 the agency is operating, a separate appropriation or an emergency 
 supplemental seems best. The specifics of any funding arrangement 
 must be agreed upon by the parties, but several general principles 
 apply. To begin realizing savings, sufficient funding authority must 
 be established to substantially implement the innovation or capital 
 project. The investment capital fund should be established in a 
 separate appropriation, which would be offset against some portion of 
 AID's current information management funding levels and would be 
 accounted for over several fiscal years. AID should request authority 
 from OMB and Congress to replenish the fund from savings in operating 
 expenses and program accounts achieved by eliminating obsolete 
 systems and other management improvements. Payments against the 
 innovation loan should be subtracted directly from AID's 
 appropriation. Savings realized by the innovation should be available 
 for reprogramming by the AID administrator.
<p>
 
 2. AID should target sound projects from the Information Systems Plan 
 for funding.
<p>
 The agency's focus should be on: (1) agencywide data sharing through 
 improved connectivity, (2) the financial management system, and (3) 
 the automated program management system. These are the areas that 
 have either been subjected to the majority of the criticisms or have 
 the greatest likelihood of success. This would demonstrate the 
 utility of the new technology, build faith in outside observers 
 regarding the agency's ability to correct internal problems, and 
 improve the management of the agency.
<p>
 
 3. AID should conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of any 
 proposed capital expenditure.
<p>
 Congress and OMB must be satisfied that a proposed capital 
 expenditure will produce a positive benefit justifying its cost. 
 Accomplishing a fundamental change in the way that an agency does 
 business, using unproven technology with borrowed funds, is a 
 proposition that requires a high level of confidence from the 
 participants.
<p>
 
 4. AID should obtain customer input during business process 
 reengineering.
<p>
 AID has a good but tenuous start on analyzing its business processes. 
 Key to the success of this endeavor is the need to bring those who 
 will be using the systems into the design process. In AID's case 
 these customers are all over the globe. This critical process cannot 
 be cut short, and will require a commitment of resources from the 
 innovation fund to ensure adequate participation of all customers, 
 particularly overseas missions. The systems implemented should serve 
 both the user at the country mission level and the managers in 
 Washington. There must be incentives for each user to support the 
 system. Focus should be on the three areas outlined in the second 
 recommendation.
<p>
 
 5. Implementation of the Army Corps of Engineers Financial Management 
 System (CEFMS) should be expedited.
<p>
 This system has been made available to AID as a solution to its 
 project-oriented financial management systems requirements. It is 
 viewed as an alternative to more costly private sector off-the-shelf 
 systems. Tests are underway to determine modifications necessary to 
 meet AID and core financial system requirements. OMB has recommended 
 to GSA that a waiver under OMB circular A-127 be granted, to permit 
 AID to acquire CEFMS, if AID meets several specific OMB-imposed 
 conditions.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 The recently completed information systems plan is a large step 
 forward for AID, but more than a good plan will be required to gain 
 the confidence of the agency's critics. The recommendations will 
 result in quicker and more comprehensive implementation of AID's 
 information systems. The financial decision making on these 
 substantial capital expenditures will be made more transparent, and 
 the return on these investments will be better understood and 
 documented. With competent business process reengineering, work will 
 be performed more efficiently and be better understood by both 
 management and those at the implementation level.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</B>
<p>
 A thorough reengineering of management systems has the potential for 
 creating substantial operational savings; however, these savings 
 cannot be estimated at this time.

 <h2>AID06:  Reengineer Management of AID Projects and Programs</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
 The President's fiscal year 1994 international affairs budget totals 
 about $21.9 billion, of which $6.8 billion is requested for the 
 Agency for International Development (AID).(1) Much of AID's budget 
 is spent on programs and projects that range in complexity from a 
 single training workshop to developing financial systems in a foreign 
 country's government. AID funds approximately 2,000 projects annually 
 in more than 100 countries.
<p>
 Through the years, AID has shifted its focus from the funding of 
 discrete projects to an emphasis on comprehensive programs and 
 increased use of what AID calls non-project assistance, which 
 promotes broad-based economic and policy reforms in developing 
 countries. This portion of the report will focus on what AID 
 traditionally has called the project management system. However, it 
 also has wide application to AID's programs and non-project 
 activities.
<p>
 Although AID headquarters in Washington, D.C., plays an active role 
 in project management, AID's field offices or missions have primary 
 responsibility. A mission is based in the foreign country that 
 receives AID assistance. AID refers to these foreign countries as 
 host countries. Generally, an AID mission funds a development project 
 to respond to a specific problem within the host country, although 
 funds sometimes are earmarked by Congress for a particular country, 
 sector, or activity.
<p>
 Since a major portion of the U.S. foreign assistance budget is 
 specifically targeted to the goal of alleviating poverty in 
 developing countries, the participation of the poor in these 
 countries in AID projects is critical for project success. A 
 successful project is defined as a sustainable one that not only 
 achieves its objectives, but also is continued by the intended 
 beneficiary after AID funding terminates. Therefore, project 
 sustainability is largely contingent on beneficiary support.
<p>
 Congress also recognized the important role that project 
 beneficiaries play in the development process. In 1966, Congress 
 mandated through Title IX of the Foreign Assistance Act that priority 
 "be placed on assuring maximum participation in the task of economic 
 development by the people of the developing countries."(2) The 
 Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 advocated "self-help efforts . . . and 
 the involvement of the people in the development process through 
 democratic participation."(3) In 1975, subsequent legislation 
 provided that "greatest emphasis . . . be placed on countries and 
 activities that effectively involve the poor in development."(4)
<p>
 Although AID understands the linkage between customer involvement and 
 project sustainability, the current project management system can 
 prevent AID from fulfilling its congressional mandate in this 
 area.(5) As a result, many AID projects are developed that either do 
 not adequately serve AID's customers or lack the necessary customer 
 commitment. Therefore, such projects may not continue once AID 
 funding terminates. Based on an extensive review of the literature 
 and interviews with AID staff and other development specialists, 
 several problems in the way that AID's project management process is 
 structured have been identified. These problems seriously constrain 
 the ability of AID to respond to the needs of the poor in developing 
 countries.
<p>
 Recent reports have highlighted numerous problems with AID structures 
 and procedures that hinder the agency's ability to achieve results. 
 The project management cycle generally involves seven phases: problem 
 identification, project design and negotiation, obligation of funds, 
 implementation, evaluation, project redesign, and closure. Each phase 
 requires an array of internal reviews, streams of paperwork, and 
 complicated procedures, resulting in a rigidly crafted blueprint 
 design of the development project.
<p>
 The detailed blueprint of the project and the requirements of the 
 system do not allow for the necessary flexibility and may inhibit the 
 beneficiary input required for project sustainability. A 1988 
 internal evaluation of 62 AID health projects indicated that more 
 than half either failed before the project ended or were unlikely to 
 be continued after U.S. funds ceased.(6) 
<p>
 This high failure rate has been attributed to AID's top-down, 
 blueprint project design and management approach, which impedes the 
 ability of project field staff to make the necessary mid-course 
 corrections during project implementation.(7) It also has fostered an 
 environment that discourages risk-taking and the use of creative 
 problem-solving strategies that may deviate from the project design. 
<p>
 Although changes may be warranted to respond to the uncertainties 
 inherent in all phases of the project cycle, the standardized, rigid 
 structure of the project cycle specified in AID's operational project 
 handbooks does not allow sufficient flexibility. AID has streamlined 
 some of its project requirements to allow for greater flexibility in 
 certain regions of the world and plans to adapt these simplified 
 procedures agencywide in early fiscal 1994.
<p>
 The number of distinct steps necessary for project approval involving 
 field, headquarters, and Congress results in a burdensome, 
 duplicative, and time-consuming system. Frequently, a project can 
 take up to three years before it begins. By the time a project gets 
 off the ground, the assumptions built into the project design and the 
 initial project participants may have changed. Continuity is lost. 
 The implementation team attempts to carry out a project that was 
 sometimes planned by another team three years earlier. Adding to the 
 problem is AID's overseas contracting and procurement system, which 
 often impedes project results by contributing to logistical delays, 
 higher costs, and customer dissatisfaction.(8)
<p>
 The incentives at AID tend to reward work in one part of the project 
 management cycle (design and obligation of funds) at the expense of 
 others (e.g., start-up, implementation, evaluation, results). People 
 are rewarded for designing new projects, not necessarily for 
 implementing them. 
<p>
 The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently suggested in a draft 
 report that the push to obligate earmarked funds drives AID to fund 
 million-dollar projects to which the host country is indifferent, as 
 in the case of judicial reform initiatives in Central America.(9) In 
 the area of implementation, more focus has been placed on audit 
 trails, processes, and resource accounting than on how or if the 
 project is achieving results. Evaluations focus greater attention on 
 inputs (number of activities) than outputs (project impact).(10)
<p>
 The mission director in each host country has ultimate responsibility 
 and accountability for a specific AID project in his or her 
 jurisdiction. Ensuring that the project works on a day-to-day basis, 
 however, involves many people working on separate pieces. The AID 
 project officer often is assigned to a project that was designed, 
 budgeted, and authorized by others and is rarely present throughout 
 the entire life cycle. 
<p>
 One reason for this is that AID projects are generally long-term, 
 while Foreign Service personnel have shorter rotation assignments. It 
 should be noted that this is addressed under a separate AID 
 recommendation which allows for longer stays in host countries. The 
 current structure fragments accountability. Project development 
 involves the whole range of mission staff, from legal advisors to 
 contracting officers, to ensure compliance with AID's rules and 
 regulations. It appears that everyone is involved, yet nobody is 
 really in charge to ensure overall project results. Noted management 
 specialist Michael Hammer summarized the problem:
<p>
 Classical business structures that specialize work and fragment 
 processes are self-perpetuating because they stifle innovation and 
 creativity in an organization . . . are unresponsive to large 
 changes. . . . [I]nflexibility, unresponsiveness, the absence of 
 customer focus, an obsession with activity rather than result, 
 bureaucratic paralysis, lack of innovation, high overhead--these are 
 the legacies of one hundred years of American industrial 
 leadership.(11)
<p>
 Compounding the problem, AID relies heavily on different outside 
 contractors to handle separate phases of the same project. A project 
 could be designed by one contractor, implemented by another, and 
 redesigned by still another contractor. Contractors are evidently 
 relied upon to provide skills not available within AID and to 
 compensate for reduced staffing levels. Many staff do not have the 
 training required for AID's new program directions of environment and 
 democracy, including management of judicial reform projects in Latin 
 America.(12)
<p>
 As a result, AID sometimes pays contractors at U.S. rates for work 
 that indigenous organizations might be able to do at the local rate 
 for a fraction of the cost. Indigenous organizations are those that 
 have been formed by the local population within the host country. 
 Although U.S. contractors are needed in countries where technical 
 expertise is lacking, there is a definite advantage in using the 
 growing reservoir of host country professionals and indigenous 
 organizations to assist with development projects. AID's existing 
 policies, which create incentives that encourage U.S. contractors to 
 form partnerships with indigenous organizations, are among the steps 
 that AID has taken to help indigenous organizations strengthen their 
 institutional capabilities.
<p>
 Many procedures and incentives, however, preclude the full 
 involvement of intended beneficiaries such as indigenous 
 organizations in developing countries. Even though many AID staff 
 expressed interest in working directly with indigenous organizations, 
 they cited a number of requirements in AID's operational project 
 handbooks that are confusing and onerous and act as barriers to 
 beneficiary participation. Some of the requirements include audit, 
 financial statements, personnel systems, and an existing track 
 record. Many indigenous organizations may not have access to such 
 basics as typewriters and accountants that are standard for U.S. 
 organizations but are luxuries in developing countries.
<p>
 Experience has shown that projects that support and do not supplant 
 community efforts within developing countries are more likely to 
 achieve results. Many innovative and successful models have been 
 structured to build upon the efforts of people within developing 
 countries. The following four projects have been included in this 
 report to illustrate how their processes, incentives, and structures 
 have been designed to foster an environment that focuses the 
 organization on results and the customer. AID continues to rethink 
 traditional approaches and processes to further its reinvention 
 endeavors and has incorporated some of these innovations into 
 existing projects. It should be noted that the following four 
 projects represent only a few of the many innovations occurring 
 within the development field.(13)
<p>
 The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank is an example of a 
 development model in which credit has been used as an entry point for 
 the poor and now serves as a catalyst for change.(14) It is not 
 directly funded by AID, although AID has recently provided $2 million 
 to the Grameen Trust, which provides services and technical 
 assistance to other microenterprise programs around the world. 
 Basically, the Grameen Bank provides small loans to poor people who 
 own less than half an acre of cultivable land or assets not exceeding 
 the value of an acre of land. Loan repayment has been excellent. 
 Grameen has helped its borrowers accumulate capital and generate 
 employment opportunities.
<p>
 The Grameen Bank was developed using careful experimentation to 
 determine what did and did not work. It continues to evolve using 
 this method. Grameen recognized early that there was no prescribed 
 formula for development. Had the Grameen been designed under a rigid, 
 blueprint approach, it no doubt would have failed in the project 
 design phase. It needed the experimentation of a social learning 
 process in the implementation phase for innovation, risk-taking, and 
 flexibility to adjust to local conditions. It continues to learn from 
 its mistakes and to respond to feedback drawn from all levels of the 
 organization. People are encouraged to bring up problems and are 
 rewarded for developing creative solutions for solving them. It has 
 been very effective at balancing the administrative demands of the 
 organization with the participatory demands of the local community.
<p>
 Grameen's success is also attributed to its incentive structure. 
 Borrowers organize themselves into small groups. The members support 
 each other and apply pressure when needed to repay loans. This 
 pressure substitutes for collateral. Incentives are organized in a 
 way that creates an interdependency between bank workers and bank 
 beneficiaries. Within the group, mutual accountability ensures 
 repayment and project sustainability.
<p>
 Grameen has received worldwide attention for being a development 
 project that works very well. It has been successfully replicated in 
 other countries when it has been adapted to fit their unique cultural 
 and economic conditions. It is important to note that there is no 
 Grameen blueprint. The Grameen Bank has worked in Bangladesh only 
 after many years of experimentation.
<p>
 Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The IDRC's 
 mission revolves around the belief that the problems of developing 
 countries cannot be solved by importing outside solutions. The IDRC 
 promotes development by providing funds to developing country 
 researchers who are working within their own country on solutions to 
 their nation's problems. It also helps in the dissemination of 
 research results so that the research findings can be widely applied. 
 This approach offers research opportunities that build up scientific 
 capacity and thereby reduces the scientific brain drain in developing 
 countries. It relies on a board of directors who are all from 
 developing countries. The Canadian government has given the IDRC 
 complete latitude to accomplish its mission by keeping it free from 
 micromanagement restrictions and structuring it in a way that 
 insulates it from Canadian politics. This project offers a variety of 
 lessons for development organizations on how people within developing 
 countries can be supported to solve their problems.
<p>
 The Philippine National Irrigation Administration (NIA). Local 
 participatory approaches to development are often viewed as not 
 particularly relevant to organizations such as AID, which mainly work 
 with host country governments at the ministry level and rarely with 
 rural villagers. NIA, however, is an example of a large government 
 agency in the developing world that implemented programs in ways that 
 empowered local communities to take an active role in development 
 activities. In fact, AID has promoted water users associations 
 throughout Asia, based on NIA experience. AID has also worked with 
 other donors to establish an international irrigation institute based 
 on this model. It also provided funds in 1987 to NIA to support 
 participatory approaches to irrigation systems.(15)
<p>
 The NIA sponsored small-scale communal irrigation systems throughout 
 the Philippines that involved local farmers from project initiation 
 through implementation and evaluation phases. The NIA's program is 
 one innovative approach to development that transformed itself from 
 the conventional non-participatory approach where agency personnel 
 viewed themselves as the implementors while the local farmers were 
 considered passive beneficiaries, to a highly participatory one where 
 farmers eventually took over the operations of the project and 
 continued to sustain it through local fees. 
<p>
 Restructured incentives--such as partial recovery of collection fees 
 and investment costs, amortization payments, clear points of 
 responsibility for the results, and new performance measures based on 
 financial viability where income exceeds expenses--encouraged greater 
 participation and helped to curtail unnecessary spending, while 
 promoting a sense of collective responsibility and ownership of the 
 irrigation facilities.(16)
<p>
 Since much of the AID funding is channeled through government 
 agencies, this project offers a variety of relevant lessons about 
 field approaches, organizational design, and management processes 
 needed to transform the agency's role in developing countries from 
 rowing to steering.(17) Although AID has incorporated many of these 
 approaches in Asia, where AID sponsors irrigation and natural 
 resource management, these methods could be expanded to other sectors 
 and countries.
<p>
 Inter-American Foundation (IAF). The IAF exists to support the 
 efforts of indigenous organizations working on behalf of the poor in 
 Latin America. Unlike AID, the IAF has no field presence. It 
 accomplishes its mission through grants awarded directly to 
 indigenous organizations. The IAF provides grants for projects that 
 are initiated, designed, and implemented by indigenous people within 
 host countries, and not by IAF staff. In-country support teams made 
 up of indigenous people are responsible for monitoring and evaluating 
 project performance. Although the IAF has been criticized for 
 becoming too bogged down with regulations perceived as hampering 
 innovation, its strength has traditionally been attributed to its 
 unbureaucratic internal structure and decentralized decision making 
 processes, which have helped the organization foster risk-taking and 
 beneficiary participation and the freedom to experiment and learn 
 from mistakes.
<p>
 The importance of timely, accurate, and relevant information moving 
 vertically and horizontally throughout an entire organization in all 
 phases of the project process cannot be overestimated. One way that 
 AID obtains feedback on its projects is through the evaluation 
 process. It appears, however, that evaluation findings are not always 
 acted upon or taken into account in the planning and budget 
 allocation processes. Sometimes funding continues even after 
 evaluations conclude that projects are producing no benefits and the 
 host country has not demonstrated a commitment to the project.
<p>
 Several external barriers prevent AID from withdrawing funds from 
 unsuccessful projects. These include:
<p>
 --- congressional earmarking of funds in statutes and related 
 reports,
<p>
 --- contract commitments and concerns about possible litigation,
<p>
 --- the political difficulty of reallocating committed funds,
<p>
 --- rigid and complicated planning systems, and
<p>
 --- consideration of the views and commitments of contractors and 
 grantees such as U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and U.S. 
 private voluntary organizations (PVOs).
<p>
 AID's 1992 In-Country Presence Report concludes that because the 
 programs are broad and staff is increasingly stretched thin, AID 
 missions may be working in isolation from other donors, with the 
 result that missions can be unaware of donor activities within the 
 same sector or country.(18) This could result in a very skewed 
 approach to development, with some regions inundated with too much 
 funding, while others are totally ignored.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. AID should reengineer the project and program management processes 
 to emphasize innovation, flexibility, and beneficiary participation.
<p>
 Efforts should focus on:
<p>
 --- organizing around project outcomes;
<p>
 --- identifying and removing steps, procedures, and requirements, 
 both internally and externally imposed, that do not add value to the 
 process and create impediments to accomplishing project results;
<p>
 --- redesigning jobs, functions, structures, and other processes 
 (e.g., contract and procurement systems), that support project 
 results;
<p>
 --- putting the decision point where the work is performed and 
 building control into the process;
<p>
 --- improving continuity and accountability for projects by timing 
 rotation assignments so they encompass to the extent possible the 
 project life from design through closure; and
<p>
 --- identifying and removing barriers that impede the full 
 participation of indigenous populations and creating incentives for 
 their inclusion in all phases of the project management cycle.
<p>
 
 2. The AID administrator should designate selected AID missions as 
 pilots to experiment with innovative approaches to programming and 
 delivery of AID assistance.
<p>
 These missions should be given waivers on rules and regulations that 
 are deemed impediments to achieving project results. The four models 
 presented in this report provide a number of innovative approaches 
 that could be adapted for AID projects.
<p>
 
 3. AID should structure the reward and incentive system in project 
 and program management to ensure that performance and accountability 
 are linked to accomplishing project results and that innovation is 
 encouraged.
<p>
 Project success should be the primary factor in evaluation. Rewards 
 and incentives should be designed to create project success based on 
 interdependency between key players. AID staff and project 
 beneficiaries should be rewarded on project success based on clear 
 performance indicators including mutual accountability, cooperation, 
 and results. For example, performance appraisal systems should 
 include beneficiary satisfaction and quality of beneficiary 
 participation as performance indicators to measure AID's staff and 
 contractor performance at the field level. 
<p>
 Likewise, host countries should be required to demonstrate sufficient 
 commitment toward a project before it begins. Future project funding 
 should take into account host country performance on existing 
 projects. Where appropriate, future contract and grant awards should 
 take into account a contractor's past performance and its ability to 
 establish collaborative linkages to indigenous organizations. 
<p>
 Incentives should also be included that reward innovative approaches 
 to development at the field level. The projects listed in this report 
 provide a number of ways that organizations can encourage innovation. 
 These models should be analyzed and adapted for AID use in the field 
 and headquarters where appropriate.
<p>
 
 4. AID should establish systems for continuing critical review of all 
 existing projects to ensure that they are achieving desired outcomes.
<p>
 As part of this review, each mission should address the following:
<p>
 --- How does the project relate to new priorities described by the 
 AID administrator?
<p>
 --- Are local conditions in place to ensure project success?
<p>
 --- Are results on track?
<p>
 --- If not, can the project be salvaged in an appropriate period of 
 time (e.g., 6 to 12 months)?
<p>
 Reviews should determine whether projects need to be terminated or 
 provided additional funding. AID should identify and remove existing 
 internal and external barriers that have prevented the agency from 
 terminating unsuccessful projects. Mechanisms are needed to ensure 
 that resources continue to flow to those activities that achieve 
 results.
<p>
 
 5. AID should strengthen the project and program evaluation process 
 and integrate it into the planning, budget, and project allocation 
 processes.
<p>
 AID should develop mechanisms that incorporate evaluation findings 
 into all stages of the decision making process. Evaluations should be 
 used to help guide managers with planning, budget, and project 
 allocation decisions. Evaluations should focus on results. Funding 
 for projects that are not producing any benefits should be 
 discontinued. 
<p>
 Impact evaluations should be more than lessons learned. They need to 
 be taken seriously and their recommendations should be acted upon. It 
 needs to be recognized that this may require strengthened analytical 
 capabilities at AID. Increased focus on results in other assessment 
 and accountability mechanisms, such as audits, inspections, and other 
 reviews, would assist managers in planning, budgeting, and project 
 allocations.(19)
<p>
 
 6. AID should improve donor coordination, both at headquarters and in 
 the field.
<p>
 AID mission directors should designate an officer responsible for 
 coordinating the efforts of the AID mission and other donors. Where 
 appropriate, all AID mission staff should be encouraged to coordinate 
 policies and leverage resources through such means as extensive 
 consultations, joint ventures, and partnerships with other donors.
<p>
 
 <b>Implications</b>
<p>
 These recommendations support the reinvention efforts outlined by the 
 AID administrator. Overall, they are intended to create a high-
 performance, results-driven agency. At AID, the internal structures, 
 external barriers, and burdensome procedures that have accumulated 
 over the years make it more difficult to achieve program results. 
<p>
 Reengineering the project management system under a Grameen-type 
 social learning model of development could provide a more effective 
 process, supporting creativity and flexibility while focusing on the 
 customer to achieve project results. Incentives that tie performance 
 to results will increase productivity and ensure accountability to 
 beneficiaries.
<p>
 The system and processes will be adapted to bring in the customer at 
 each stage of the development process. By focusing on the customers 
 (in this case the project beneficiaries), projects will be designed 
 to adapt to local conditions. Bringing indigenous groups more 
 directly into the project cycle will ensure that projects better 
 reflect their needs. As a result, greater beneficiary ownership will 
 be achieved to ensure sustainability and accountability. AID will 
 leverage resources in collaboration with other donors and NGOs to 
 support host country activities.
<p>
 Projects deemed unsuccessful in the evaluation process should be 
 phased out. Reallocated resources will flow to projects that are tied 
 to new priorities and are actually achieving results. Although these 
 recommendations target the project cycle, they can also be applied to 
 AID programs and non-project activities that may encounter the same 
 types of problems experienced in the project cycle.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The specific savings associated with reengineering the project and 
 program management system cannot be determined. Reduction of overhead 
 administrative costs, increased reliance on indigenous populations, 
 stringent reviews, and termination of unsuccessful projects could 
 result in substantial savings. The process of reengineering is long 
 and arduous, and an increased focus on strategic planning and 
 evaluation may result in up-front costs. This is not expected, 
 however, to create new spending demands. On the contrary, the removal 
 of existing internal and external barriers should reduce costly 
 administrative overhead. This should offset any added costs incurred 
 as the agency reengineers its management of projects and programs.

<h2> Agency Reinvention Activities </h2>
<p>

<b> Introduction</b> 
<P> 
 In his confirmation hearing on April 29th, the administrator of the 
 Agency for International Development (AID), J. Brian Atwood, declared 
 that he did not want reinvention efforts to be limited to a few pilot 
 projects. Instead, he announced that the entire agency would be 
 offered up as a reinvention laboratory. Since then, Administrator 
 Atwood has taken a number of steps to turn rhetoric into reality. 
 Comprehensive plans are underway to transform AID into a high 
 performance, results-driven organization that can respond effectively 
 and efficiently to global challenges.
<P> 
 There is widespread recognition that AID must change profoundly if it 
 is to be relevant in the post-Cold War era. This agreement on the 
 need for fundamental change encompasses AID career staff, other U.S. 
 government agencies, Congress, and the public. It is an important 
 asset that supports AID reinvention efforts. But it also presents a 
 complicated challenge because there are diverse views on what kind of 
 change is appropriate. The recently completed report by the Deputy 
 Secretary of State has started to resolve this debate. That report 
 will be the basis for establishing a broad consensus on the 
 appropriate role and function of AID.
<P> 
 AID reinvention efforts encompass a wide number of activities. A 
 Quality Council representing a cross-section of AID employees has 
 been established to coordinate the reinvention plans. This Council 
 meets weekly to review reinvention efforts and to the greatest extent 
 possible ensure that all AID employees are given the opportunity to 
 get involved in the reinvention process. To date, reinvention efforts 
 include:
<P><UL> 
 <P><LI>New mission and vision statements. Working with AID political 
 leadership, the Quality Council has developed new draft vision and 
 mission statements for review, revision, and dissemination within the 
 agency.
 
 <P><LI>Reorganization. A new organizational structure has been proposed 
 to emphasize managing for results, creating incentives for 
 individuals, accountability for results, reducing unnecessary 
 bureaucratic layers, and streamlining procedures.
 
 <P><LI>Strategy statements. Agency leadership has identified four 
 priority areas for AID (population and health, the environment, 
 democracy, and economic growth). Strategies have been developed to 
 provide coherence and direction to AID programs.
 
 <P><LI> Reengineering the programming system. AID is dramatically 
 simplifying and reducing the four bulky handbooks governing the way 
 the agency programs its funds, and is actively exploring new ways to 
 ensure that the programming process will emphasize results, rather 
 than inputs. Pilot efforts are being initiated in selected field 
 programs.
 
 <P><LI> Rightsizing the field presence. AID has reviewed all countries 
 where it presently has activities and has identified specific steps 
 to phase out some programs, reduce the size of other field offices, 
 and achieve economies by consolidating some services.
 
 <P><LI> Simplifying the information flow. AID has adopted an agencywide 
 information systems plan that is a model for other agencies. This 
 will involve analyzing and reengineering core business areas. 
 Unnecessary reporting requirements are being identified and (where 
 these are entirely within the authority of the agency) will be 
 eliminated; consultations are underway with Congress on reducing 
 congressionally mandated reports; an integrated financial system is 
 being developed; and electronic processing of routine transactions 
 (such as travel vouchers) is being initiated.
</UL><P> 
<B> Vision for the Future</B>
<P> 
 Within the next five years, AID will become a leaner, more focused 
 organization with a clearly defined mission. To a significant extent, 
 the success of AID's reinvention efforts will depend on its ability 
 to secure cooperation and support from other key executive branch 
 agencies (such as the State Department and the Office of Management 
 and Budget) and Congress. In addition, a focus on results will mean 
 that the current programming, monitoring, and auditing systems 
 overwhelmingly geared to tracking inputs will have to be reexamined.

<P>
<h2> Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the fourth largest 
 agency in the federal government. As a private enterprise, the 
 department would rank ahead of IBM and just behind Ford Motor 
 Company. 
<p>
 Most of the department's 110,000 employees work outside Washington, 
 D.C., in regional, state, or county offices. However, the USDA 
 "family" extends beyond its federal work force and includes 31,000 
 county extension agents in 3,500 offices, supported in part with 
 federal funds, as well as 273,000 volunteers and 21,900 additional 
 state and county employees.
<p>
 In 1862, President Lincoln created USDA to develop the best seeds and 
 send information to farmers. While the number of farms and farmers 
 has declined in this century, USDA's mission has grown and become 
 more complex. During the Great Depression, USDA's responsibilities 
 were expanded to stabilize farm income; to conserve soil, water, and 
 other natural resources; and to ensure the availability and quality 
 of food and fiber products. During the 1960s, USDA was assigned 
 responsibility for food and nutrition programs to ensure that the 
 most needy would not go hungry. These additional responsibilities 
 spawned new agencies, which were often added to the existing 
 structure, rather than integrated with it. Today, USDA continues to 
 be organized along the lines established in the 1930s--a localized 
 presence for addressing a range of national problems and for 
 delivering services to farmers and other rural citizens.
<p>
 The National Performance Review's (NPR) recommendations for USDA 
 reflect the four reinvention principles. USDA can do much to improve 
 its services at less cost to the taxpayer, by eliminating obsolete 
 programs and restructuring others. 
<p>
 NPR also supports the department's effort to streamline its field 
 operations, especially county level offices. By defining and 
 articulating its broader mission, especially its roles in rural 
 economic development, natural resource conservation, and food safety 
 and nutrition, and by organizing its program agencies, USDA will 
 serve all its customers better, including America's farmers.
<p>
 USDA has an opportunity to simplify environmental regulations for 
 farm land management, and NPR recommends consolidating competing 
 requirements into a single comprehensive plan for each farm. 
 Additionally, NPR recommends redirecting funds from an ineffective 
 training program for food stamp recipients and empowering recipients 
 to participate in programs with proven results.
<p>
 USDA can replace cumbersome administrative procedures with more 
 efficient market incentives. The Special Supplemental Food Program 
 for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) can be harnessed to the 
 marketplace to stretch the taxpayer's dollar by increasing 
 competition among infant formula vendors and manufacturers of other 
 items in the WIC food package. Finally, NPR recommends that USDA use 
 Electronic Benefits Transfer technology as the primary means of 
 distributing food stamp benefits.
<p>
 A report on the status of USDA internal reinvention efforts is also 
 provided, including a summary of future steps to be taken. If 
 accepted, the recommendations would reduce the deficit by over $2.6 
 billion in six years, improve the structure of the department and the 
 ability of its workforce to meet contemporary requirements, and 
 improve services to the primary recipients of USDA programs.

<h2> USDA01:  End the Wool and Mohair Subsidy</h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
  During World War II and the Korean conflict, the United States 
 imported half the wool required for military uniforms. Determined to 
 reduce dependence on foreign fibers and to insulate American 
 producers from foreign competition, Congress declared wool a 
 strategic material and enacted the National Wool Act in 1954. The Act 
 was designed to increase domestic production of wool by providing 
 direct payments to farmers based on a percentage of their market 
 sales. In other words, the more wool farmers produced, the more 
 federal funding they received.
<p>
 Wool was removed from the Pentagon's strategic materials list in 
 1960. However, the Act remains in effect today, and wool program 
 subsidies will cost an estimated $923 million over the 1994-98 
 period.1 About one-third of the payments will go to ranchers who 
 raise Angora goats for mohair.(2) Although mohair never had strategic 
 value, it was included in the 1954 Act as an offshoot of the wool 
 industry. About 80 percent of domestic mohair is now produced for 
 export markets.
<p>
 In addition to mohair and shorn wool, the program also subsidizes 
 live lambs on the assumption that their pelts will be processed after 
 slaughter. The product is called "pulled wool" and will reap an 
 estimated $132 million in federal benefits in 1994-98, absent action 
 to eliminate or phase out the program.(3) The market for pulled wool, 
 however, is so slight that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
 no longer keeps statistics on it. As a result, federal payments for 
 live lambs tend to subsidize their value as meat, not wool. In fact, 
 for the 1990 marketing year, recipients of wool subsidies earned 
 slightly over 60 percent of their income from meat. Shorn wool sales 
 contributed only around 15 percent, with the rest (25 percent) coming 
 from federal payments.(4)
<p>
 About half the wool program's recipients receive payments of $100 or 
 less (the average payment for this group is $44).(5) Most are 
 hobbyists and do not rely on sheep for their livelihoods. The 
 principal exceptions are several thousand Native American families 
 who tend small flocks, averaging about 20 animals, and for whom 
 payments of even less than $100 make up a significant portion of 
 their overall income.(6)
<p>
 At the other end of the payment spectrum are the top 1 percent of 
 producers who capture almost half the wool subsidy. In fact, the top 
 0.3 percent of producers garner about one-fourth of the program's 
 funds with payments that average $98,000.(7) The Omnibus Budget 
 Reconciliation Act of 1993 will gradually reduce the maximum payments 
 a person can receive under each of the wool and mohair provisions 
 from the current 1993 level of $150,000 to $100,000 in 1995.
<p>
 Although the program adds handsomely to large producers' incomes, its 
 appeal has not been strong enough to prevent a dramatic decline in 
 domestic wool production. According to the General Accounting Office, 
 the amount of wool sheared has plummeted from 283 million pounds in 
 1955 to 89 million in 1988. The wool program has outlived its 
 usefulness, and its continued implementation only exacerbates 
 inequities in levels of public support between wealthy and marginal 
 producers. In addition, it has failed to stimulate domestic 
 production and acts as a lightning rod for public criticism of 
 government spending.
<p>
 
<b> Action</B>
<p>
 Legislation should be enacted to eliminate federal support payments 
 for wool and mohair.
<p>
 The program has failed to spur domestic production of wool, but 
 continues disproportionately to benefit the few largest producers. 
 Furthermore, wool is no longer a strategic material as it was 
 considered when the program was implemented.
<p>
 
 <b>Implications</b>
<p>
 Eliminating wool and mohair subsidies may result in restoring some 
 public confidence in the federal government's ability to eliminate 
 outdated, ineffective programs. Although there is strong support for 
 the program, Congress made some limited changes to it in the Budget 
 Reconciliation Act of 1993. Nonetheless, the program should be phased 
 out.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 Eliminating the program would save $923 million in budget outlays 
 during the 1995-1999 period.

<h2> USDA02:  Eliminate Federal Support for Honey</h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
 The federal government has supported honey production since 1950. The 
 program was enacted after honey prices dropped following World War II 
 because of reduced demand and excess inventories. During the war, the 
 government declared beekeeping war-essential and encouraged heavy 
 production.(1) Beeswax was used in place of petroleum to waterproof 
 ammunition and other equipment, and honey replaced tightly rationed 
 sugar.
<p>
 When demand decreased after the war, beekeepers and honey packers 
 found it difficult to cover costs, and the number of honeybee 
 colonies began to decline.(2) Congress reacted by introducing price 
 supports for honey in the Agricultural Act of 1949. The basic purpose 
 of the legislation was to ensure that enough honeybees would be 
 available for crop pollination. However, since receipts from honey 
 and beeswax far exceeded revenue from pollination, Congress 
 subsidized honey production at prices that would allow beekeepers to 
 maintain viable operations. The program was to be in effect only 
 until beekeepers could receive adequate pay for pollination 
 services.(3)
<p>
 The honey program allows beekeepers to obtain a federal loan using 
 the honey they produce as collateral. The minimum support price is 
 set in the statute but can be increased by the Secretary of 
 Agriculture. Borrowers can repay the loan and redeem their collateral 
 at either the support price or at a loan repayment rate determined by 
 the Secretary using legislatively established guidelines, whichever 
 is lower. They also may default on the loan and forfeit the honey 
 used as collateral.
<p>
 There are about 212,000 beekeepers in the United States, all of whom 
 are eligible to participate in the program.(4) The U.S. Department of 
 Agriculture (USDA) describes 200,000 of them as hobbyists, and 
 another 10,000 as "sideliners," or part-time beekeepers. Commercial 
 producers, those owning 300 or more colonies, number about 2,000 and 
 produce about 60 percent of the honey extracted annually in the 
 United States.
<p>
 Only about 3,000 to 5,000 beekeepers participate in the USDA program, 
 with just over three million colonies of bees. As with other 
 agricultural commodity programs that base benefits on production, the 
 largest beekeeping operations tend to receive the most federal 
 support. About 10 percent of program participants receive over 50 
 percent of payments. Sideliners and hobbyists make little use of the 
 program.
<p>
 Critics of the honey program, including the General Accounting Office 
 (GAO), claim price supports are no longer necessary to provide crop 
 pollination services. According to GAO, producers of seed and fruit 
 crops to which bee pollination is critical either pay beekeepers to 
 place bee colonies near their crops or operate their own beekeeping 
 enterprises. Unofficial estimates of beekeepers who do not 
 participate in the honey program, but instead use their bees 
 exclusively for pollination services, rival the number within the 
 program. Crop producers indicate they believe honeybee pollination 
 would still be cost-effective, even if the service price rose as a 
 result of eliminating honey price supports.(5)
<p>
 Critics also point out that commercial beekeepers who benefit most 
 from the program emphasize honey production instead of pollination 
 services. Since the program began, honey production has increased 
 significantly in those states, such as North Dakota and South Dakota, 
 where crops with abundant flowers are grown. These crops produce 
 large amounts of nectar needed for honey production; however, they do 
 not require pollination. At the same time, states in which honey 
 production has declined, such as New York and Michigan, are 
 significant producers of apples, cherries, and other fruits that need 
 honeybee pollinators.(6)
<p>
 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 will reduce federal 
 subsidies for honey by reducing the support price and by tightening 
 the limit on the payments which any one producer can receive. The 
 payment limit will decline from $150,000 in 1993 to $50,000 in 1997.
<p>
 
<b> Action</b>
<p>
 Legislation should be enacted to eliminate federal support for honey.
<p>
 Market forces have overcome the original need for the program. 
 Instead, a small number of commercial honey producers benefit from an 
 unnecessary government subsidy for their product.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 According to USDA, if the honey price support program is terminated, 
 there will be a decline in the number of honeybee colonies available 
 to provide pollination services, at higher cost, to fruit and 
 vegetable producers. Production of these crops is generally 
 concentrated in a few geographic areas, such as Florida and 
 California, and USDA believes it is unlikely these areas contain a 
 sufficient number of wild bees or honeybees managed by local 
 beekeepers to provide adequate pollination.(7) However, there does 
 not seem to be a clear connection between federal subsidies for 
 beekeepers and effective pollination services. Commercial beekeeping 
 is already heavily concentrated on honey production, and there are 
 about as many beekeepers performing pollination activities outside 
 the program as there are program participants (about three million 
 colonies each). Eliminating the honey program is unlikely to 
 radically alter either trend.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 Eliminating the program will save about $15 million over the 1994-
 1999 period.

<h2>USDA03:  Reorganize the Department of Agriculture to Better
 Accomplish its Mission, Streamline its Field Structure, and
 Improve Service to its Customers </h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for the 
 operation of 250 programs meeting important national needs in areas 
 such as farm income, nutrition, food safety, and conservation. In 
 recent years, significant criticism of USDA has appeared in the 
 popular media. This criticism has focused on the fragmentation of the 
 department's headquarters and field organizations, as well as the 
 size of the department and its budget relative to farmers. Although 
 some of the criticism is justified, it represents an 
 oversimplification of the issues. The focus of USDA has shifted 
 dramatically since the 1930s. Nutrition programs now account for 60 
 percent of USDA's budget outlays, forestry programs are managed by 35 
 percent of the USDA staff, and rural economic development programs 
 involve large investments in rural enterprises that extend well 
 beyond farming. Less than 30 percent of the department's annual 
 outlays fall within the agriculture function of the federal budget.
<p>
 The headquarters of the department is not effectively organized at 
 either the subcabinet or agency levels to carry out the diverse 
 mission of USDA. The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for 43 
 agencies managing 250 programs. There is duplication of authority and 
 responsibility among subcabinet officers and agencies. These problems 
 are most severe in areas such as farm services, environmental 
 programs, and rural development. The challenge to the Secretary of 
 Agriculture is to articulate a comprehensive mission structure that 
 encompasses the various interests of the department and to reorganize 
 the agencies to provide cohesive direction for the department's 
 programs.
<p>
 Secretary Espy has moved aggressively to address these problems and 
 coordinated his efforts with those of the National Performance Review 
 (NPR). This paper presents a set of joint recommendations on behalf 
 of the Secretary and NPR.
<p>
 At the field level, USDA's county structure is symptomatic of its 
 organizational problems and is in need of major overhaul.(1) USDA 
 county-based agencies operate over 12,000 offices serving 3,158 
 counties in the nation, either directly with federal employees or 
 indirectly through financial support for nonfederal employees. The 
 General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that closing the least 
 efficient county offices would generate significant savings. GAO also 
 recommended that additional criteria be developed to determine if a 
 larger problem exists.(2)
<p>
 USDA has undertaken a comprehensive approach to evaluate information 
 regarding the various field installations of all its agencies.(3) The 
 department reviewed county-based agencies--the Agricultural 
 Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the Soil Conservation 
 Service (SCS), and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)--as well as 
 the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) against six criteria. 
 This analysis was used to identify approximately 1,200 field offices 
 as candidates for consolidation. Secretary Espy will make the 
 department's state agency leadership responsible for ensuring that 
 implementation of this analysis improves efficiency of offices and 
 enhances customer service.
<p>
 In addition to the county office structure there is an intermediate 
 structure--state and area offices--that was established to provide 
 direction and communication between the policy levels at headquarters 
 and the service delivery units in the counties. This has evolved into 
 an additional bureaucratic layer between policymakers and service 
 providers. Non-county based agencies also have a wide variety of 
 regional structures that add administrative layers. Current 
 communication technologies obviate the need for many of these 
 intermediate offices, and data exist to support consolidation of the 
 field structures of agencies not based in counties.
<p>
 Reducing the size of the field structure need not equate to a 
 reduction in level of field service. USDA has been a leader in many 
 applications of scientific advances and its research capacity is 
 considered among the very best. The department will accelerate the 
 development of technological applications to provide increased 
 service to its customers.
<p>
 The department's "Infoshare" project will bring fully integrated 
 modern computer services to its county offices. The department's Food 
 and Nutrition Service has been at the forefront of Electronic Benefit 
 Transfer (EBT) technology since its inception and pioneered the 
 current EBT pilot projects to provide food stamp benefits. Similar 
 initiatives can be identified elsewhere within USDA. Additionally, 
 ASCS has pilot tested automatic teller machines to allow producers to 
 enter information and examine their records.
<p>
 The department also has made significant advances in the adaptation 
 of new technology (Global Positioning Systems and Geographic 
 Information Systems) into its ongoing programs in land and resource 
 management.(4) These advances should allow more effective program 
 delivery while reducing the number of staff that would otherwise be 
 required to map and monitor farmland and the national forests.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. USDA should begin immediately a multi-year approach to revising 
 the department's structure to reflect its program responsibilities.
<p>
 The overall effort should build on activities already underway and 
 provide time to identify, pilot, and implement additional 
 improvements. 
<p>
 
 2. The Secretary of Agriculture should submit legislation to 
 implement the new organizational structure to enhance the delivery of 
 USDA services.
<p>
 At the headquarters level, the Secretary should propose a new 
 mission-oriented structure designed to provide needed services in a 
 more efficient and effective manner. The proposed structure would 
 maintain the current number of under and assistant secretaries. 
 However, the areas of responsibility would be modified to recognize 
 changing needs in the department.
<p>
 At headquarters, the new structure would recognize the farm income, 
 exports, rural economic development, nutrition, food safety, and 
 conservation mission areas of the department. The department would be 
 divided into six key areas: Commodity Programs and Trade; Rural 
 Development; Nutrition Programs; Conservation; Food Quality; and 
 Research, Education, and Economics. As part of this process, the 
 number of individual USDA agencies will be reduced from 43 to 30. 
 Administrative services will be consolidated from 14 administrative 
 support staffs to six administrative units.
<p>
 At the field level, the new USDA plan would restructure and 
 streamline the field level offices beginning with those currently 
 operated by ASCS, FmHA, and SCS, to improve services to customers and 
 reduce government expenditures. The new field structure would focus 
 on service delivery through collocated USDA Service Centers. USDA 
 customers and agencies would benefit from the consolidation of 
 separate USDA agencies under one roof. This type of consolidation, 
 referred to as "one-stop shopping," has proven to be a very effective 
 way to deliver programs, as evidenced by the recent USDA response to 
 the floods in the Midwest. Additionally, other USDA field structures 
 should be reorganized consistent with the agency headquarters 
 reorganization. This initial implementation would begin in fiscal 
 year 1994 and lead to a fundamental restructuring of the department's 
 headquarters and field programs and offices.
<p>
 
 3. The USDA should review its regional, state, and area office 
 structure; eliminate those elements no longer appropriate; and extend 
 the restructuring to the "non-county based" agencies of the 
 department.
<p>
 For the U.S. Forest Service, this could mean reducing the number of 
 regional offices and restructuring or combining national forests and 
 ranger districts. In addition, the department should invest in the 
 acquisition of new technology to replace the labor-intensive 
 practices of the past. This should include broad-scale implementation 
 of Geographic Information System and Global Positioning System 
 technology to include acquisition of required data and systems for 
 data sharing among the department's various agencies.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 The primary purpose of these reorganization actions is to equip the 
 USDA to serve the public better. Additionally, when fully 
 implemented, these actions will produce significant budget savings.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 After the reorganization is fully implemented, total headquarters 
 staffing will be reduced by about 8 percent, producing annual savings 
 of $73 million. Additional headquarter economies include 
 communications, publications, travel, and office space, which are 
 expected to yield annual savings in the range of $40 million. Greater 
 savings will also result from reorganizing field, area, and state 
 offices.

<h2> USDA04:  Implement a Consolidated Farm Management Plan</h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
 A bewildering array of laws, regulations, and interagency 
 jurisdictions frustrates farmers' efforts to comply with existing 
 environmental and conservation laws and regulations. In pesticide 
 application alone, three federal agencies--Department of Agriculture 
 (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug 
 Administration--exercise jurisdiction.
<p>
 The difficulties are compounded for farmers participating in USDA's 
 commodity support and conservation programs. As the price of 
 admission, participants are required to carry out specific 
 environmental and conservation activities planned by USDA. However, 
 as they attempt to comply with various federal programs and some 
 state programs as well, farmers are often confronted with a number of 
 different plans, some of which contain conflicting methods and 
 goals.(1) Successful implementation of each USDA plan does not 
 necessarily satisfy all federal interests. In one case, a farmer won 
 approval from USDA to build a levee. Later he was told by the Army 
 Corps of Engineers, EPA, and the Fish and Wildlife Service to stop 
 construction due to potential destruction to wetlands.(2)
<p>
 On August 24, 1993, the White House announced comprehensive wetlands 
 policy reforms to simplify the process of identifying wetlands and to 
 provide farmers a simpler method for following federal requirements 
 for wetland conservation. The plan will establish a new, efficient, 
 money- and time-saving administrative appeal process so that farmers 
 and other landowners can seek review of permit decisions without 
 going to court. It will also continue use by all agencies of the 1987 
 wetlands delineation manual pending completion of a National Academy 
 of Sciences study, expected in 1994, and will impose deadlines and 
 provide additional guidance so that permitting decisions will be made 
 in a timely and more predictable fashion.
<p>
 In addition, the plan will increase emphasis on state, tribal, and 
 local government roles, as well as voluntary wetlands protection and 
 restoration programs with landowners. It will also reduce duplication 
 and inconsistency for farmers by designating the Soil Conservation 
 Service (SCS) as the lead agency for wetlands determinations on 
 agricultural lands. Furthermore, the plan will withdraw a proposed 
 rule that would have left critical Alaskan wetlands unprotected.
<p>
 Farmers can be further aided by efforts to simplify compliance with 
 USDA conservation requirements by creating a single plan for each 
 farm. The proposal would consolidate various USDA plans into a single 
 authority administered by the SCS whenever a new plan is required by 
 USDA. The consolidated plan relieves the farmer from dealing with 
 multiple management plans for one farm. 
<p>
 Comprehensive plans, governing all aspects of a producer's farm 
 operations, would go beyond a consolidated plan involving only USDA-
 required actions. Comprehensive plans would cover conservation of 
 other federal and nonfederal entities. These comprehensive plans 
 would enable SCS to address a farm's conservation requirements as an 
 integrated ecosystem, rather than focusing on isolated fragments of 
 its environment. Neither the Office of Environmental Policy's (OEP's) 
 efforts nor any recent legislative actions fully respond to the 
 complex environmental and conservation concerns associated with 
 agriculture. OEP has not included pesticide use in its water quality 
 task force, and legislative efforts have not dealt with the questions 
 of quality assurance, burden of proof (for compliance), liability for 
 environmental damage, and the ability of SCS to successfully 
 administer the single farm plan concept. Efforts to resolve disputes 
 among federal agencies and to simplify regulations and requirements 
 for farmers will markedly improve the quality of the federal 
 government's service to the agricultural sector, as well as improve 
 environmental quality.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. The USDA should coordinate federal agencies in assisting producers 
 to implement the consolidated farm management plan. This should 
 include assuring the quality of consolidated farm management plans 
 and compliance.
<p>
 USDA should phase in the development of the consolidated plans and 
 assist producers in the development of comprehensive, site-specific 
 farm management plans. As a part of the quality assurance mechanism, 
 a partnership between the USDA, EPA, the Corps of Engineers, and the 
 Fish and Wildlife Service should be formed to review a representative 
 sample of the comprehen-sive farm management plans per year. The 
 partnership should identify issues most in need of monitoring, such 
 as water quality. The guidance should be issued by March 1995.
<p>
 
 2. The consolidated farm management plan should seek to coordinate 
 with programs administered by other federal agencies and states, in 
 order to create an integrated comprehensive farm management plan. The 
 plan, however, should not override or supersede requirements of other 
 programs.
<p>
 In addition, compliance with the comprehensive farm management plan 
 does not guarantee full compliance with federal regulations, but 
 eventually USDA should incorporate as many federal standards into the 
 plans as possible. Finally, while USDA should work to incorporate 
 state requirements to create the comprehensive farm management plan, 
 compliance with this comprehensive plan cannot guarantee compliance 
 with state regulations. Also, updates of the plans in response to 
 subsequent changes in nonfederal requirements should not be the 
 responsibility of USDA.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 These recommendations will clarify federal jurisdiction over 
 agricultural, environmental, and conservation planning. Furthermore, 
 a consolidated farm management plan will provide better customer 
 service to farmers and encourage greater participation in voluntary 
 conservation programs.
<p>
 
 <b>Fiscal Impact</B>
<p>
 This recommendation is revenue neutral when phased in.

<h2>USDA05:  Administer the Employment and Training Requirement for Food Stamp 
Recipients More Effectively and Efficiently
 </h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
 Food stamp recipients are required by law to register for work and 
 training. They are exempt from this requirement, however, if they are 
 under 18, older than 59, disabled, taking care of dependent children 
 under six or incapacitated adults, or working at least 30 hours per 
 week. Failure to register for work or training can result in 
 disqualification from the Food Stamp Program (FSP), administered by 
 the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). To comply with this 
 requirement, recipients can attend an employment and training program 
 sponsored by FSP or other qualified entity.
<p>
 Out of 13 million food stamp recipients, about 3.5 to 4.5 million are 
 required to register annually for work and training. By statute, FSP 
 must place at least 10 percent of the non-exempt registrants into a 
 work-training program. Job search and job search training are the 
 predominant components of the employment and training programs.
<p>
 Total fiscal year 1993 employment and training costs are 
 approximately $245 million, including state matching costs. Federal 
 costs for the program total about $160 million; $75 million of this 
 represents a federal grant for basic operating and administrative 
 costs, distributed to each state by a formula. The remaining $85 
 million in federal funds is directed to 50 percent matching of 
 administrative or operating costs above the state's portion of the 
 formula-determined share of the $75 million, and to reimburse 
 participants for transportation and dependent care expenses.
<p>
 Although a primary goal of the FSP is moving food stamp recipients 
 from welfare to work, 1988 USDA research found that the employment 
 and training program administered by the FSP did not increase 
 participants' earnings. As a result, 1988 USDA evaluations concluded 
 that these programs were not effective.
<p>
 Currently, there are no data on how many participants are actually 
 placed in jobs as a result of this program. Of all the persons that 
 enter the FSP, half leave the program in six months or less and two-
 thirds leave within one year. Over one-third of recipients who stop 
 receiving food stamps begin receiving them again within one year.(1)
<p>
 Although many short-term food stamp recipients return to work within 
 three to six months after becoming eligible for benefits, the FSP 
 employment and training program has had no discernible effect on 
 participants' aggregate earnings, probability of finding work, amount 
 of time worked, or average wages.(2) Recipients may have participated 
 in the employment and training program, but they likely would have 
 found gainful employment without the benefit of the program. The 
 program's failure undercuts the goals of the Food Stamp Act work 
 requirements.
<p>
 Employment and training programs that appear to be more effective 
 than FSP programs are those that are operated by or administered 
 jointly with entities such as Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) 
 programs, local education, state employment services, and community 
 action agencies.(3) In 1988, these made up over half of food stamp 
 employment and training efforts.     
<p>
 An example of one such program is the $3 billion JTPA program, which 
 applies a case-management approach to job training. This program 
 spends roughly $2,000 to $3,000 per person and provides help before, 
 during, and after food stamp use. It has had a positive impact on 
 employment rates of participants. The JTPA program already is open to 
 individuals eligible for food stamps. Many states use it to fulfill 
 the requirements of the FSP employment and training program. The JOBS 
 program, for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
 (AFDC), unlike the FSP employment and training program, targets 
 individuals likely to stay on the AFDC rolls for long periods of 
 time.
<p>
 
<b> Action</b>
<p>
 Legislation should be enacted to amend the Food Stamp Act to 
 strengthen the work and training requirement and require food stamp 
 recipients to participate in more effective employment and training 
 programs.
<p>
 States should no longer be required to operate a separate employment 
 and training program. The needs of these recipients could be better 
 served if this requirement were met by referring them to, and 
 requiring them to participate in, other job training programs. This 
 in no way diminishes the food stamp program work requirement. A 
 separate organization to administer food stamp employment and 
 training requirements is not needed. Eliminating it will save the 
 $160 million federal funding currently directed to this program. 
 These funds will then be available for other work training programs. 
 Those recipients truly in need of job training will participate in 
 programs better able to serve their needs as they move from welfare 
 to work.
<p>
 
 <b>Implications</b>
<p>
 States should be in favor of having the administrative burdens 
 associated with this aspect of the food stamp program lifted. This 
 recommendation will not increase the number of individuals eligible 
 for job training programs, because food stamp recipients are already 
 eligible for a variety of job training programs. Although this 
 recommendation actually strengthens the work and training component 
 of the food stamp program, Congress could view the redirection in 
 funding as an erosion of support for food stamp recipient work 
 requirements.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 This recommendation will redirect approximately $1 billion over six 
 years to other work training programs as determined by the 
 administration. A change in law will be required to implement this 
 recommendation.

<h2>USDA06:  Encourage Better Food Package Management  Practices and Facilitate 
Multi-State Contracts for  Infant Food and Formula Cost Containment in the 
 WIC Program
 </h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
  The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children 
 (WIC) was established in 1972 to improve the health of at-risk, low-
 income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children under age 
 five by providing them supplemental foods, nutrition and health 
 education, and health screening. Administered by the Food and 
 Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
 the program awards grants to state health departments or state health 
 and welfare agencies to provide nutrition services.
<p>
 The WIC program is successful and cost-effective with regard to 
 prenatal WIC services. A 1992 General Accounting Office (GAO) study 
 estimated that the savings that accrue over 18 years from providing 
 prenatal WIC services to those infants born in 1990 would yield a 
 return of $3.50 for each federal dollar invested.(1) (There are no 
 cost/benefit studies available for children age two through four 
 assisted under the program).
<p>
 This success has led to strong congressional bipartisan support for 
 the WIC program. Funding for the program has increased from $900 
 million in fiscal year 1981 to $2.86 billion in fiscal year 1993; 
 participation also has increased from 2.1 million to an expected 
 monthly average of 5.8 million participants during this same period. 
 The program, however, does not reach all those eligible for it. In 
 1991, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 8.4 million 
 women, infants, and children were eligible to participate in the WIC 
 program, although available funding allowed only 4.7 million to be 
 served.(2)
<p>
 The fiscal year 1993 program is expected to serve about 67 percent of 
 all those eligible. Although the administration has proposed to fully 
 fund the program by the end of fiscal year 1996, cost-containment 
 efforts in the WIC program remain critical because they currently 
 provide the opportunity to serve hundreds of thousands of 
 participants who otherwise could not participate and benefit from 
 WIC. Enhancing and extending cost-containment efforts can lower WIC 
 costs and serve more participants with limited funds.
<p>
 Infant formula is the single most expensive item in the WIC food 
 package, with prices rising much faster in recent years than the 
 prices of other WIC-covered items. During the 1980s, some states 
 distributing food through retail stores implemented infant formula 
 cost-containment efforts. These efforts required infant formula 
 manufacturers to compete for selection as the single source of infant 
 formula products used by a state WIC program; all WIC program 
 participants from that state were required to purchase only a 
 specific brand of infant formula. Contracts were awarded to the 
 manufacturer offering the highest rebate to a state.
<p>
 In 1988, Congress mandated that all WIC state agencies implement some 
 form of infant formula cost containment. In 1989, Congress added the 
 requirement that states use competitive bidding in their cost-
 containment efforts. An estimated $600 million was saved in fiscal 
 year 1991 through cost-containment efforts. These savings were 
 redirected to serve additional participants.
<p>
 Although experts agree breastfeeding provides a healthier and more 
 economical means of feeding an infant, as recently as 1987, less than 
 40 percent of early postpartum WIC mothers were breastfeeding. The 
 Surgeon General advises that breastfeeding is the healthiest way for 
 a mother to nurture her infant and has set a goal of reaching a 75 
 percent rate for breastfeeding. The WIC program seeks to encourage 
 breastfeeding by providing an expanded food package to mothers who 
 elect to breastfeed.
<p>
 Infant and adult cereals offer the next logical items from the WIC 
 package to consider for rebate cost-containment targeting. There is 
 little variety in infant cereals, and most are manufactured by three 
 major corporations. Seven states have entered into agreements for 
 rebates with infant cereal manufacturers. For example, New York 
 currently is receiving a 76-cent rebate on each box of infant cereal 
 purchased under the WIC program.
<p>
 Although the savings potential from these efforts remains somewhat 
 less than the savings achieved from infant formula (the price of 
 infant formula increased nearly 11 percent per year over the last 
 decade while other items in the WIC food package have not increased 
 at this rate), a federal effort will enhance the opportunity to 
 achieve savings. Additional areas for cost savings could include (a) 
 foods appropriate for older children, such as dry cereal, where brand 
 name and generic products compete for market share, and (b) routine 
 specification and selection of economical food package sizes and 
 brands. Significant savings could be achieved, for example, by buying 
 least-cost brands and milk by the gallon or half-gallon rather than 
 in quarts.
<p>
 If the WIC program is fully funded, as has been proposed, the 
 pressure for states to keep costs down will be reduced; however, it 
 will fall to the federal government to ensure that the focus on cost-
 containment efforts is not lost.
<p>
 
<b> Actions</b>
<p>
 1. USDA should assume a leadership role in cost containment efforts 
 and focus on cost containment for additional items in the WIC food 
 package such as infant cereal, juice, and other food products.
<p>
 FNS should actively solicit states to develop and test new approaches 
 to containing costs for each of the major food items in the WIC 
 packages. One possible approach would be through a competitive grant 
 announcement. FNS should disseminate information about initiating 
 contracts for items other than infant formula. FNS should also serve 
 as a broker or facilitator for multi-state contracting efforts for 
 rebates on items such as infant cereal or juice. FNS's authority to 
 direct a portion of administrative funds toward testing new cost-
 containment strategies offers an immediate vehicle for funding these 
 efforts. This testing should be included in fiscal 1995 budget plans.
<p>
 About 75 percent of WIC funds are spent on food. Savings could be 
 achieved through a combination of federally mandated cost containment 
 measures, cooperative or shared contracts, as well as food package 
 size and brand name management. Some states are already exploring 
 other cost-containment approaches. Also, the Secretary of Agriculture 
 has authority under current law to purchase and distribute WIC foods 
 at the request of state agencies.
<p>
 Additionally, FNS should develop a semiformal channel of 
 communication with the Federal Trade Commission to provide an "early 
 alert" system for trends reflecting bid-rigging in connection with 
 WIC contract bidding.
<p>
 
 2. USDA should expand its role in disseminating "best practices" 
 information to states interested in pursuing multi-state cost-
 containment efforts.
<p>
 Many states have been successful, without federal oversight, in 
 developing multi-state consortia to achieve economies of scale in 
 awarding contracts to infant formula manufacturers. Other states and 
 Indian reservations may find the experiences and information from 
 their counterparts in other parts of the country useful in pursuing 
 their efforts. A more aggressive federal role in this area will 
 ensure that interested parties receive thorough, accurate information 
 quickly. FNS should develop "best practices" materials to distribute 
 to WIC agencies and update them regularly.
<p>
 
 3. USDA should continue and expand its educational efforts to promote 
 breastfeeding.
<p>
 Funding for breastfeeding promotion has increased in recent years. 
 FNS should consider entering into agreements with advocacy groups 
 such as La Leche League or the Ad Council to expand its promotion of 
 breastfeeding to low-income mothers, emphasizing the health and 
 nutritional advantages afforded breastfed children. The right of a 
 WIC mother to choose how to feed her baby must be balanced against 
 the public's interest in promoting the long-term health and well-
 being of children and holding down unnecessary expenditures on 
 formula and health care. Health experts agree that healthy mothers 
 who can, should breastfeed their infants.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 These recommendations would serve to hold down costs of the WIC 
 program, as well as emphasize the nutritional well-being of program 
 participants. They will help USDA meet the President's goal of fully 
 funding WIC sooner than expected. In addition, they will help to 
 reduce the long-term costs associated with full funding.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 In the short run, savings in the WIC program free up resources to 
 serve a greater number of eligible participants; in the long run, 
 savings reduce the cost of achieving the President's goal of full 
 funding. USDA should establish an ambitious goal of roughly $100 
 million per year in savings to be achieved through aggressive cost 
 containment efforts in foods other than infant formula. This equates 
 to roughly a 5 percent saving on foods other than infant formula. 
 However, given the development work needed to obtain such savings, it 
 would be premature to count on them when developing near-term funding 
 levels for WIC. Therefore, no fiscal impact is claimed.

<h2>USDA07:  Deliver Food Stamp Benefits Via Electronic
 Benefits Transfer to Improve Service to Customers 
 While Remaining Cost-Effective
</h2>
<b> Background</b>
<p>
 The overall issue of Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) is addressed 
 in the National Performance Review (NPR) Accompanying Report 
 Reengineering Through Information Technology. This recommendation 
 supports that report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food 
 and Nutrition Service (FNS) has been at the forefront of EBT 
 development since the early 1980s, and EBT has the potential to 
 improve substantially the delivery of food stamp benefits to 
 recipients.
<p>
 The Food Stamp Program (FSP) works through the state agencies, which 
 issue food stamps, in the form of coupons, to eligible recipients. 
 The recipients use the food stamps like cash to purchase food at FNS 
 authorized retail stores. The retail stores deposit the food stamps 
 at banks, which credit the store accounts for their value. The banks 
 send the redeemed food stamps to a Federal Reserve Bank, which 
 credits the bank's account, bills the U.S. Treasury for the value of 
 the food coupons, and destroys them.
<p>
 This involved process (printing and distributing food coupons and 
 oversight and monitoring of state, food outlet, and financial 
 institution operations) is costly (1992 costs were estimated at $145 
 million) and labor intensive, and presents abundant opportunities for 
 abuse. In fiscal year 1990, more than $500 million in unredeemed 
 coupons, which represent a contingent liability, were written off by 
 the Treasury.
<p>
 The USDA Inspector General has, in the past, identified several areas 
 associated with the FSP as high-risk or material weakness 
 vulnerabilities, such as food stamp coupon illegal trafficking and 
 food stamp coupon deposit and bank reconciliation.
<p>
 The EBT card holds the potential to address these issues and may also 
 improve the nutritional intake of recipients by ensuring that food 
 stamp benefits are used only for their intended purpose. EBT uses 
 technology and commercial infrastructure such as point-of-sale 
 devices and on-line data transmission networks to serve FSP 
 recipients. EBT is operating statewide in Maryland and in test 
 locations in six other states; another 26 states are in various 
 stages of planning. EBT pilots have received a positive response from 
 recipients, state agencies, grocers, and banks.
<p>
 The major impediments to nationwide expansion of EBT are the unknown 
 cost-benefit impact to the federal government and who bears the cost-
 -the states, federal government, beneficiaries, merchants, banks, or 
 processors. Additional concerns involve Regulation E, a proposed 
 Federal Reserve Board regulation which would make federal-state 
 governments liable for the replacement of recipient benefits 
 associated with an EBT card reported lost or stolen, without regard 
 to recipient responsibilities. The cost of this regulation, coupled 
 with the potential increase in benefit fraud, could represent a major 
 deterrent to expansion of EBT. Another unresolved issue involves the 
 question of who benefits from the "float" on these funds--the federal 
 government, the states, or financial institutions.
<p>
 
<b> Action</b>
<p>
 USDA's Food and Nutrition Service should participate in an 
 interagency task force reporting to the Vice President to accelerate 
 implementation of EBT.
<p>
 The most convenient means for food stamp delivery would involve 
 integrating food stamp benefits and other entitlement programs such 
 as Aid to Families with Dependent Children and direct federal 
 benefits into one EBT card. An interagency task force would 
 facilitate this integration. This group should address the 
 limitations that cost neutrality places on EBT expansion, 
 particularly with respect to the food stamp program, and how much it 
 would cost the federal government to remove them.
<p>
 
<b> Implications</b>
<p>
 EBT, as a means of delivering food stamp benefits, holds the 
 potential to improve service to recipients, improve their nutritional 
 intake, reduce the paperwork burden for retailers and banks, and 
 deter certain types of food stamp fraud and trafficking.
<p>
 
<b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
 The fiscal implications of this proposal are addressed in the EBT 
 recommendation of the NPR Accompanying Report Reengineering Through 
 Information Technology.

<h2> Agency Reinvention Activities </h2>
<p>

<b> Team Building</b>
<p> 
 After President Clinton's March 3, 1993, announcement to launch an 
 effort to reinvent the federal government, the U.S. Department of 
 Agriculture (USDA) moved quickly to institute an internal review. 
 Secretary Espy launched the USDA National Performance Review Team 
 (NPRT) to lead the department's issue development and problem 
 diagnosis process for reinventing USDA. The NPRT is made up of over 
 25 USDA employees from a variety of backgrounds and USDA agencies.
<p>
 The Secretary challenged the team to expose policies that impede 
 employee innovation and productivity. The team carried out its task 
 through a participatory process characterized by a variety of 
 initiatives to generate employee contributions to this reinvention 
 effort. Over 1,500 USDA employees made recommendations through open 
 forums sponsored by the team. The team analyzed over 8,000 responses 
 to questionnaires that solicited comments and suggestions for 
 improvements from employees and trade and consumer groups.
<p>
 To further develop opportunities for reinvention, the team collected 
 data from internal and external reviews, reviewed agency success 
 stories, and evaluated ideas from past seminars and conferences. Team 
 members participated in a summit on "Reinventing Government" convened 
 by Vice President Gore that provided an opportunity to share ideas 
 with cutting-edge businesses, state and local governments, and 
 experts in organization and management who know how to make 
 "reinvention" work. Team members solicited input from other federal 
 agencies and organizations such as the World Bank, foreign embassies, 
 and land grant universities.
<p>
 
<b> Reinvention Laboratories</b>
<p>
 Team members have worked with USDA agencies to identify unique 
 projects, called reinvention laboratories, to promote change and 
 serve as models for others to follow. These labs are focused on 
 forming a partnership between USDA customers and USDA agencies to 
 improve service delivery. For example, the Infoshare Lab will improve 
 delivery through reengineering farm service, conservation, and rural 
 development agencies' business processes, and integrating their 
 computer information systems. The Forest Service Lab will implement 
 changes agencywide in organizational culture by eliminating 
 administrative barriers and delegating more authorities to the 
 operational level. The Extension Service Lab will improve information 
 and educational technology by aligning the Extension Service's 
 organizational culture and structure with available technology. 
 Interactive information and educational linkages with citizens will 
 be tested through Interactive Citizen Participation Centers.
<p>
 Since the inception of this project, the Secretary worked personally 
 with the team. There was a high level of interaction between the 
 Secretary and NPRT through briefings and a constant sharing of ideas. 
 The Secretary's support for the role and accomplishments of the NPRT 
 have been presented in his conferences, speeches, and staff meetings. 
 To spread his commitment to employees, the Secretary held a USDA town 
 meeting with Vice President Gore.
<p>
 
<b> Headquarters and Field Structure Reform</b>
<p>
 It is clear that major action to reform and revitalize USDA is 
 necessary. For this reason, the administration is proposing specific 
 steps to reform both the headquarters structure and the field 
 structure of the department. At the headquarters level, a new 
 structure will be implemented that recognizes the six key mission 
 areas of the department: commodity programs and trade; rural 
 development; nutrition programs; conservation; food quality; and 
 research, education, and economics. As part of this process, 
 individual USDA agencies will be reduced from 43 to 30. 
 Administrative Services will be reduced through consolidation from 14 
 administrative support staffs into six administrative units. When 
 fully implemented, it is anticipated that total USDA headquarters 
 staffing will be reduced by about 7 percent, producing annual savings 
 of $45 million. Additional headquarters' savings in a variety of 
 areas--including communications, publications, travel, and office 
 space--are expected to yield annual savings in the range of $40 
 million.
<p>
 At the field level, the new USDA plan will restructure and streamline 
 the field level offices beginning with those currently operated by 
 the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, Farmers Home 
 Administration, and Soil Conservation Service to focus both on 
 improving services to clients and reducing government expenditures.
<p>
 The new field structure will focus on delivery of services through 
 collocated USDA Service Centers. As evidenced by the recent USDA 
 response to floods in the Midwest, there is considerable benefit for 
 both USDA customers and USDA agencies by consolidating agencies under 
 one roof. It has been proven that "one-stop shopping" is an effective 
 way to deliver program services.
<p>
 In addition to the department level reforms, USDA is developing some 
 specific program initiatives designed to reinvent the way it serves 
 USDA customers.
<p>
 
<b> Commodity Programs and Trade</b>
<p>
 The department is developing a new farm income strategy designed to 
 increase demand for agriculture products by reinventing foreign 
 market development, export, and trade programs/policies and 
 development of new uses for agricultural products. USDA will also 
 provide protection from excessive risk by reforming the crop 
 insurance program and making it a primary vehicle for farm disaster 
 risk protection. In addition, long-term prospects for farm income 
 growth will be further enhanced by maintaining balanced commodity 
 programs.
<p>
 
<b> Rural Development</b>
<p>
 The department's rural development strategy will provide the 
 infrastructure that is essential for the economic revitalization of 
 rural communities. The strategy will be specified in an annual report 
 to Congress as required by the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980.
<p>
 
<b> Nutrition Programs</b>
<p>
 Nutrition initiatives are being developed to improve the nutrition 
 options for the poor and to provide Electronic Benefit Transfer 
 nationwide for the Food Stamp Program.
<p>
 
 <b>Conservation</b>
<p>
 The department is developing a comprehensive program for conservation 
 including programs for soil and water conservation and responsible 
 forest service management.
<p>
 
<b> Food Quality</b>
<p>
 Initiatives have been developed to address public concerns about 
 microbiological contamination of meat and poultry products and 
 pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables.
<p>
 
<b> Research, Education, and Economics</b>
<p>
 Under the Secretary's proposal, research and education functions 
 conducted by four separate agencies will be merged into one, the 
 Agricultural Research and Education Service (ARES). These agencies 
 are the Agricultural Research Services (ARS), the Cooperative State 
 Research Service (CSRS), the Extension Service (ES), and the National 
 Agricultural Library (NAL). The proposal would create a streamlined, 
 coordinated, and consolidated organization that would be more 
 responsive and accountable to the needs and concerns of the public 
 and Congress than the existing structure. Administrative and 
 management support would be provided by a single staff. A 12 percent 
 reduction in staff over five years is projected.

<Title>Executive Summary</Title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<p><H2>Department of Education</H2>
<HR>
<p> 
<p><H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p>
<p>In developing this report, the National Performance Review (NPR) is guided, first and foremost, by the administration's policy toward 
 education. This policy stems from a profound dissatisfaction with a 
 system that produces SAT scores below the levels of 30 years ago, 
 produces students who lag well behind the rest of the industrialized 
 world, and allows millions of Americans to leave school unable to 
 read the first paragraph of our own Constitution.
<p>
<p>Created in 1979, primarily from parts of what had been the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Education (ED) 
 has 230 programs and about 5,000 employees. It is responsible for 
 only about one dollar in 15 of the $445 billion invested each year in 
 American education.
<p>
<p>The department administers a fiscal 1993 budget of $31.1 billion, 
 distributed largely as grants-in-aid to state and local education 
 agencies for programs designed to educate disadvantaged children and 
 help the disabled or to students to help finance their higher 
 education.
<p>
<p>The department has suffered from mistrust and management neglect, 
 almost from its beginning. To overcome this legacy and to lead the 
 way in national education reform, ED must refashion and revitalize 
 its programs, management, and systems.
<p>
<p>To this end, the administration already has presented five major 
 legislative proposals: Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the Safe 
 Schools Act, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, the Student Loan 
 Reform Act, and the National Service Trust Act. Student Loan Reform 
 and National Service Trust have already been enacted into law. The 
 department also has undertaken notable management initiatives and 
 cooperative efforts with other cabinet departments.
<p>
<p>The Goals 2000: Educate America Act is intended to promote school 
 reform by helping communities and states to establish    voluntary 
 internationally competitive standards. It will encourage communities 
 and states to tie curriculum and teacher training to standards and 
 devise and implement related assessment and accountability systems. 
 It will encourage partnerships among the federal government, states, 
 parents, business, labor, schools, communities, and students.
<p>
<p>Reinvention strategies are a central theme of the management reforms 
 sought by this administration. A new ED management structure ensures 
 continued senior-level attention to reform and reinvention: (1) the 
 Executive Management Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary and 
 consisting of a number of the department's senior political leaders, 
 focuses on strategic planning and general management issues; and (2) 
 the Reinvention Coordinating Council initiates and oversees the 
 department's improvement efforts.
<p>
<p>This report supports the administration's proposals to redesign 
 Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is the 
 major federal program to support compensatory education for 
 disadvantaged students. Expert evaluation concludes that the annual 
 $6.5-billion investment is not producing the expected results. NPR 
 presents recommendations to reinvent the program, focusing its 
 funding and removing its elaborate structure and replacing it with 
 simplified requirements.
<p>
<p>NPR recommends reducing the number of programs the department 
 administers. ED runs 230 education programs, many of which overlap or 
 have achieved the purpose for which they were created--or are better 
 addressed by non-federal resources. NPR specifically recommends:
<p>
<p>--- eliminating over 40 of them;
<p>
<p>--- consolidating various formula grants; and
<p>
<p>--- consolidating the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the 
 pending Safe Schools programs.
<p>
<p>NPR also recommends repealing the grantback provisions of the  General  Education Provisions Act, as proposed by the administration. This 
 provision allows an organization to pay ED a penalty when it has 
 failed to comply with some regulation and then ask the department to 
 return up to 75 percent of the money on the grounds that potential 
 beneficiaries of the grant should not be penalized.
<p>
 Other recommendations in this report will result in greater 
 efficiencies, including streamlining and improving ED's grants 
 processing, simplifying and strengthening institutional eligibility 
 and certification for participation in federal student aid programs, 
 and providing incentives for the department to increase debt 
 collection. This report also recommends initiatives that will improve 
 ED's effectiveness and customer service by creating a single point of 
 contact for programs and grant information; improving ED's employee 
 development opportunities; building a professional, mission-driven 
 structure for research; and developing a strategy for technical 
 assistance and information dissemination.
<p>
<p>While NPR does show how the Department of Education can spend $173.2      
 million less over the next five years, the    recommendations also 
 indicate how, by clarifying and simplifying its work, the department 
 can begin to do the public's business in the effective and efficient 
 way the nation's future requires.

<p>
<p><H2>ED01:  Redesign Chapter 1 of Elementary and Secondary Education Act</H2>
<p>
<HR>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 
 (ESEA) is the major federal program to improve the education of 
 disadvantaged children. The program was budgeted to receive $7.1 
 billion in fiscal 1994, 21 percent of the Education Department's 
 request. Chapter 1 serves one in nine school-age children, largely 
 providing compensatory reading and mathematics instruction at the 
 elementary school level. While the basic skills of low-income 
 children have improved in the last 20 years, a wide consensus now 
 holds that the time has come, as the Education Department's own 
 assessment says, for reinventing Chapter 1.(1)
<p>
<p>Expert evaluation concludes that Chapter 1 monies do not make much 
 positive difference. On average, the program adds only about 10 
 minutes a day of reading and mathematics instruction and takes a 
 remedial, basic skills approach that is inconsistent with substantive 
 curricula. Influenced largely by fear of federal audit procedures, 82 
 percent of school districts offer limited pullout instruction, which 
 takes children away from normal classroom activities. While the 
 percentage of districts also offering in-class Chapter 1 instruction 
 has increased from 28 percent to 58 percent between the 1985-86 and 
 1990-91 school years, this instruction is often characterized by 
 drill and practice instruction and homogeneous grouping, which are 
 generally regarded as counterproductive.(2) Table 1 compares 
 mathematics achievement levels for U.S. students overall with the 
 one-tenth of students who live in disadvantaged urban areas. The 
 Education Department's assessment concludes that "the evidence is 
 consistent in showing that students receiving Chapter 1 services, as 
 currently configured, are not progressing."(3)

 Educational Progress 1992 Mathematics Assessment (U.S. Department of 
 Education, January 12, 1993), pp. 9, 21.
<p>
<p>Several key aspects of the program need reinvention. The Chapter 1 
 law and regulations often result in rigid procedures, discouraging 
 the exercise of judgment by teachers and principals--those closest to 
 the point of service delivery. School districts are required to 
 document that Chapter 1 funds go to programs that benefit only 
 designated Chapter 1 children and that those programs are distinct 
 additions to regular school activities, even if a teacher's or 
 principal's best professional judgment is that a disadvantaged child 
 would be better served by upgrading certain activities in which the 
 child is integrated with other students.(4) Therefore, school 
 districts often perceive that the safest course is to use Chapter 1 
 funds only to support services in which Chapter 1 children are 
 segregated.
<p>
<p>The rigid specifications for the Chapter 1 program are so well 
 established that they tend to persist even when they are no longer 
 required. Although the 1988 reauthorization of ESEA encouraged 
 schoolwide projects serving all students in schools with 
 concentrations of 75 percent or more of low-income children, in 1990-
 91 such projects were found in only 2,000 out of 9,000 eligible 
 schools.(5) At nearly half the Chapter 1 schools eligible to use the 
 new schoolwide approach, principals were not even aware of that 
 option.(6) Explaining this persistent rigidity, a team of researchers 
 concluded:
<p>
<p>Habits of compliance-orientation no doubt change slowly even under 
 strong pressures. Staying with a compliance approach provides the 
 protection of a regulatory framework tested over time. The local 
 administrators may be betting that they would have more to lose by 
 risking an innovative approach whose outcome is uncertain than by 
 introducing change to the system only when necessary, and then only 
 gradually, and at the margin.(7)
<p>
<p>A second major problem with the Chapter 1 program is that it requires 
 funding to be allocated to schools based on their numbers of 
 educationally disadvantaged students identified by annual 
 standardized testing. This creates perverse incentives because 
 schools that succeed in improving the achievement of their students 
 stand to lose resources. Thirteen percent of all Chapter 1 elementary 
 school principals in the country reported that their Chapter 1 
 program has lost some funding as a result of improved student 
 performance.(8)
<p>
 A third major problem is that Chapter 1 funds are spread thinly 
 across most school districts and schools instead of being 
 concentrated in places with the greatest needs. Approximately 93 
 percent of all school districts receive Chapter 1 funds, including 85 
 percent of the least needy districts (where no more than one in 10 
 children is eligible for free or reduced-price lunches). At the 
 school level, 45 percent of the least needy elementary schools (with 
 no more than 10 percent of students eligible for subsidized lunches) 
 are Chapter 1 schools. Perhaps even worse, in these least needy 
 settings federal accountability statutes and regulations tend to 
 promote--as indicated above--the segregation of low-achieving 
 children from regular classroom activities.
<p>
 At the same time, many high-poverty schools go unserved because poor 
 districts do not receive enough Chapter 1 funds to serve all of their 
 needy schools. Fourteen percent of the elementary schools with more 
 than 50 percent of students eligible for subsidized lunches receive 
 no Chapter 1 funds. Furthermore, many poor schools cannot serve all 
 of their low-achieving children. One-third of the low-achieving 
 children (those who score below the 35th percentile on reading tests) 
 in high-poverty schools (with at least 75 percent of students 
 eligible for subsidized lunches) do not receive Chapter 1 services.
<p>
 In addition to changes in these three major problem areas, Chapter 1 
 needs to be integrated with the strategy of systemic education reform 
 as represented in the administration's Goals 2000 legislation 
 currently moving through Congress. For example, instead of annual, 
 norm-referenced, basic skills testing, Goals 2000 calls for 
 assessment of students' proficiency in challenging academic content 
 areas. Many states are well ahead of the federal government in 
 adopting this approach to assessing student learning outcomes. 
 Nonetheless, "although many states are moving forward with their own 
 systems for assessing students' proficiency levels at critical 
 transition points (e.g., grades 4, 8, and 12), they are required to 
 maintain a dual system by testing Chapter 1 students in all grades at 
 which the program is offered."(9)
<p>
<p>Chapter 1 also needs to be a prominent part of the emerging national 
 effort to intervene comprehensively in the decisive period before at-
 risk children reach the age of 10. The program too often functions as 
 if schools operated in a social vacuum. For example, the strong 
 emphasis on parental involvement that is found in some programs for 
 younger children is not now typical of Chapter 1. In no school-
 related activity do more than 30 percent of principals report that 
 Chapter 1 parents are very involved. While the number of all types of 
 Chapter 1 schools reporting high parental involvement as volunteers 
 did rise between 1985-86 and 1991-92, the number of high-poverty 
 Chapter 1 schools doing so did not.(10)
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>The 1993 ESEA reauthorization should focus more Chapter 1 resources 
 on the highest-poverty schools and create effective incentives at the 
 school level to improve the entire education these children receive, 
 not just to improve basic skills.
 
<p>1. Rigidity in the Chapter 1 program should be replaced by 
 accountability for results.
<p>
<p>The schoolwide flexibility option should be extended, in stages, to 
 all Chapter 1 schools that have more than 50 percent low-income 
 students. Further, reform should be achieved by linkage with the 
 National Education Goals, which include the objective that the 
 academic performance of elementary and secondary students will 
 increase significantly in every quartile, and the distribution of 
 minority students in each level will more closely reflect the student 
 population as a whole.
<p>
<p>2. The disincentives created by the use of standardized testing 
 should be reversed.
<p>
<p>The link between the Chapter 1 funding allocation formula and the 
 designation of children as educationally deprived should be broken. 
 School districts and states should be encouraged to use poverty data 
 to allocate funds to schools. Further, they should replace annual, 
 standardized, norm-referenced testing with general use state 
 assessment procedures that are congruent with the National 
 Educational Standards being developed as part of Goals 2000.
<p>
<p>3. Chapter 1 funding should be concentrated on schools serving large 
 proportions of low-income students.
<p>
<p>The mix of funding between the basic grant mechanism and grants that 
 concentrate on low-income areas should be changed to approximately 
 50/50. To further concentrate funds on the highest-poverty  areas, 
 the funds allocation also should include an absorption provision that 
 would exclude from Chapter 1 allocations the number of low-income 
 children equivalent to 2 percent of the total number of children in a 
 county.
<p>
<p>4. Schools and school districts should be permitted to use some 
 Chapter 1 funds to identify needed social services and develop 
 cooperative arrangements with the other agencies that can provide 
 those services.
<p>
<p>They should be permitted to do this within a comprehensive plan for 
 improving the education of low-income students. Moreover, high-
 poverty schools should be permitted to operate family literacy 
 programs of the type that are carried out now, on a limited scale, 
 under the Even Start program.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>The Education Department's assessment of the program observes:
<p>
<p>Changes . . . could bring Chapter 1 into the mainstream--indeed, the 
 forefront--of reform in curricular standards, whole school 
 improvement, performance monitoring, and integrated services. The 
 urgent need to transform Chapter 1 reflects the need to transform 
 American education, with special attention to the schools serving the 
 most disadvantaged students.11
<p>
<p>This transformation could extend Chapter 1's earlier successes in 
 narrowing the basic skills gap to even more rewarding academic 
 content areas. In this way, reinventing Chapter 1 can respect and 
 build on the deep commitment that many people have to the program as 
 it was fashioned originally during the Great Society era.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>The Education Department estimates that, based on current 
 appropriation levels, up to $500 million annually could be redeployed 
 from lower-poverty counties to higher-poverty counties by shifting to 
 the 50/50 funding mix and adding a two percent absorption provision 
 to the Chapter 1 formula (together with other proposed targeting 
 measures). As a result of this reallocation, the counties with the 
 highest poverty rates will receive slightly over 50 percent of all 
 funds (up from their current 43 percent share). This redeployment, 
 however, would not result in overall budget savings.
<p>
<pre>
                    Current Chapter       Improved Targeting
                       1 Formula                Formula

</pre>
<p>
<p>Elimination of the Chapter 1 requirement for separate testing each 
 year would allow, at the least, much better use of approximately $300 
 million annually of Chapter 1 funds that go to state and local 
 administration.(12)

<p><H2>ED02:  Reduce the Number of Programs the Department of Education Administers</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Some of the 230 programs the Department of Education (ED) administers 
 serve purposes that overlap those of other ED programs; some have 
 achieved the purpose for which they were created; and others serve 
 purposes that are more appropriately addressed by non-federal 
 resources. Continued funding of these low-priority programs draw 
 resources away from programs that serve the most urgent needs of 
 students. The nation's priorities are defined by the six National 
 Education Goals.(1) Although each of these programs might address the 
 goals in some way, the savings from eliminating them could be used by 
 other ED programs, which are better at addressing national 
 educational priorities.
<p>
<p>The department has three basic types of programs: (1) formula grants, 
 which allocate funds to states, localities, or institutions based on 
 a mathematical formula with variables related to the purpose of the 
 program; (2) discretionary grants, which award funds based on a 
 competitive review of application proposals; and (3) student 
 financial aid, which includes loans and grants to assist students in 
 attending postsecondary schools. In addition, the department is the 
 conduit for the non-competitive allocation of federal funds to 
 several organizations. The President has already submitted and 
 Congress has passed a legislative package to redesign student loan 
 programs; accordingly, this report focuses only on formula and 
 discretionary grant programs.
<p>
<p>The administrative costs associated with all 230 programs in the 
 department are not easily calculated. They involve costs at all 
 levels of government--federal, state, and   local--and would include, 
 for example,    development of regulations and grant competition 
 notices; development of applications; reporting on programs; and the 
 monitoring and auditing of projects. Of the department's 230 
 programs, 160 award funds through national competitions. Competitions 
 are held only when funds are available for new projects, so not every 
 program holds a competition every fiscal year. Some programs award 
 funds through multiple competitions in different programmatic 
 priority areas. To award funds available under some of these 
 programs, the department is expected to hold about 245 competitions 
 in fiscal 1993.
<p>
<p>During the legislative process, policy and legislation for new 
 initiatives and reauthorization of existing programs are developed. 
 Prior to the expiration of authorizing legislation, program and 
 policy staff identify issues, review evaluation data, recommend and 
 analyze options, conduct outside consultations, and solicit public 
 comment. This work results in reauthorization proposals that are 
 submitted to Congress.
<p>
<p>An example of how the department plans to pursue consolidation of 
 these many programs is the current effort to design the Elementary 
 and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) reauthorization. The department 
 has conducted a major effort to reshape the current legislation so 
 that states, communities, and schools will be able to use programs 
 flexibly, imaginatively, and effectively--not as mere categorical 
 programs supporting piecemeal reforms, but as part of their own 
 comprehensive efforts to move all students toward high educational 
 standards in line with the National Education Goals.
<p>
<p>In the ESEA reauthorization, the department has taken a number of 
 steps to increase the flexibility of grant funds and to increase 
 coordination of activities carried out under ED funded programs. The 
 proposed measures include waiver authority, simplification and 
 reduction of forms, consolidation of state plans, and reduction of 
 auditing requirements.
<p>
<p>During the budget process, the department identified a number of its 
 programs that are no longer a priority for federal funds and 
 requested no funds for them in the President's fiscal year 1994 
 budget submission. The department also will propose elimination or 
 consolidation of some of these programs through the submission of 
 reauthorization packages, particularly the ESEA.
<p>
<p>The National Performance Review (NPR) studied the department's 
 programs, along with the department's recommendations and information 
 supplied by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), based on the 
 criteria explained above. Based on this review, the NPR has developed 
 a list of programs to eliminate or consolidate.
<p>
<p>Examples of programs NPR recommends for elimination or consolidation 
 and the reasons why they should no longer be supported by limited 
 federal resources follow:
<p>
<p>1. Congress continues to fund programs that duplicate the purpose and 
 service provided by other programs administered by ED. For example, 
 the National Academy of Space, Science, and Technology program and 
 the National Science Scholars program both provide scholarships to 
 support students studying in the fields of science,  mathematics, and 
 engineering at the postsecondary level.(2)
<p>
<p>2. Congress funds programs that have met their original goals. For 
 example, the State Student Incentives Grants (SSIG) program was 
 created as an incentive for states to develop their own need-based 
 programs. Today, all 50 states have such programs. In addition, many 
 of the states substantially overmatch the program's dollar-for-dollar 
 federal-state matching requirement. The states provide in total about 
 $2 billion in need-based student aid compared to the $72 million 
 provided by the federal government under the SSIG program.(3)
<p>
<p>3. Congress also funds programs that should be funded by non-federal 
 dollars. For example, other non-federal sources of support, such as 
 university endowments, are available to support activities funded 
 under the Research Libraries program, which provides grants to major 
 research libraries to help them strengthen their collections.(4)
<p>
<p>A number of the department's formula grant programs serve similar 
 educational purposes, but target discrete populations. State and 
 local education agencies, which provide the services funded under 
 these formula programs, must separately apply for, track, and report 
 on the use of these funds. For example, the programs under the Drug 
 Free Schools Act and the proposed Safe Schools Act both address the 
 sixth National Education Goal. The sixth goal states that by the year 
 2000, every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and 
 will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. 
 Consolidating these programs, as the administration has proposed, 
 would allow states and local communities to pursue the sixth national 
 education goal in the most efficient and effective way.
<p>
<p>Elimination and consolidation of programs would allow the department 
 to streamline administration of its programs. Customers should, in 
 turn, experience improved service from the department.
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. Legislation should be enacted to eliminate 34 Department of 
 Education programs, which are duplicative of other programs, have 
 already achieved their purpose, or are more appropriately funded 
 through non-federal resources.
<p>
<pre>Justification for eliminating the 34 programs,
 listed below, appears in Appendix A.

<p>2. Legislation should be enacted to consolidate the Drug Free Schools 
 and Communities Act and the proposed Safe Schools Act programs into a 
 single, comprehensive, flexible program for safe and drug-free 
 schools.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>These actions would reduce the number of programs administered by the 
 Department of Education, thereby reducing the administrative burden 
 on the department's program and staff offices. This reduced 
 administrative burden would allow the department to focus its 
 monitoring and assistance resources on a smaller number of programs.
<p>
<p>The actions would also create a more cohesive and comprehensive 
 federal educational program system aligned with the National 
 Education Goals that would be more easily accessible to state and 
 local education agencies, institutions of higher education, and 
 individual students who use the system.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>Some administrative cost savings would be realized by the elimination 
 and consolidation of these programs. However, since the Department of 
 Education generally does not receive additional administrative funds 
 or full-time equivalents to administer small programs such as many of 
 these, the savings would be negligible. Staff currently working on 
 these programs would be freed to focus on other priorities.
<p>
<p>The savings associated with these actions total approximately $515 
 million from fiscal year 1995 through 1999 and would be available for 
 programs aimed at supporting the National Education Goals.
<p>
<p><b>Endnotes</b>
<p>
<p>1. The National Goals state that by the year 2000: (1) all children 
 in America will start school ready to learn; (2) the high school 
 graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent; (3) American 
 students will leave grades four, eight, and twelve having 
 demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter, including 
 English, mathematics, science, history, and geography; and every 
 school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their 
 minds well so they may be prepared for responsible citizenship, 
 further learning, and productive employment in our modern economy; 
 (4) U.S. students will be first in the world in science and 
 mathematics achievement; (5) every adult American will be literate 
 and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a 
 global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of 
 citizenship; and (6) every school in America will be free of drugs 
 and violence and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to 
 learning.

<p><H2>ED03:  Consolidate the Eisenhower Math and Science Education Program with Chapter 2</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Although small by Department of Education standards, the Eisenhower 
 Mathematics and Science Education Program is the largest federal 
 program for training elementary and secondary teachers in mathematics 
 and science, and, thereby, addressing the fourth National Education 
 Goal adopted by the President and the nation's governors in 1989: 
 that, by the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in 
 science and mathematics achievement.
<p>
<p>The program was established in 1984 and moved to the Elementary and 
 Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) in the 1988 reauthorization. 
 The Eisenhower Program includes a small national program, as well as 
 the state grant program, which was budgeted at $252.7 million in the 
 Education Department's fiscal 1994 request.
<p>
<p>While at least 16 federal agencies support some efforts to improve 
 mathematics and science in the schools, only the National Science 
 Foundation (NSF) is a comparable source of support ($276 million in 
 fiscal 1992). All these agencies coordinate their efforts through the 
 Committee on Education and Human Resources (CEHR) of the Federal 
 Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology 
 (FCCSET).
<p>
<p>Teacher training consumes the bulk of Eisenhower program funding. The 
 impact of that training is difficult to determine because of multiple 
 influences on student performance. Funds for the state grant program 
 are distributed according to a formula based on student populations 
 and poverty levels. Seventy-five percent of a state's grant goes to 
 the state education agency, which must allocate most of it to local 
 school districts for teacher training (the other 25 percent goes to 
 the state higher education program for competitive teacher training 
 grants). The median amount of district-sponsored training that 
 teachers received in school years 1985-86 through 1989-90 was six 
 hours. In only one state was more than one-third of the training 
 provided by the school districts in 1989-90 of significant duration: 
 100 percent of the training provided by the school districts in South 
 Carolina was in the form of full-term courses. Experts are unanimous, 
 however, in holding that short-term in-service training cannot bring 
 about significant educational improvement.(1)
<p>
<p>Management of the Eisenhower state program needs improvement. To 
 begin with, applications are reviewed based on the presence of 
 required assurances and the adequacy of the program plans; they are 
 not reviewed for the effectiveness of the states' planned programs, 
 nor is performance data from previously funded programs taken into 
 account. No state application has ever been rejected. States are 
 required to report annually on program activities, but Education's 
 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that, after two years, 
 many reports were still missing or unusable, many of the other 
 reports were not responsive, and, in any case, the department had not 
 analyzed the reports it had received. Program monitoring also needs 
 improvement. A single program officer must attempt to conduct a site 
 visit to all levels of the program in an entire state in one week or 
 less. The average time between state reviews is 3.3 years; 19 states 
 (including California and New York) had not been reviewed in four 
 years; and 37 states had only been reviewed once in the history of 
 the program, with no follow-up review to determine if any suggested 
 corrective action had been taken. The site review instrument focuses 
 on programmatic compliance, with no attention to student learning 
 outcomes.(2)
<p>
<p>Funding for school districts through the state program is spread so 
 thin as to be inconsequential in many cases. In 1989-90, 17 percent 
 of the nation's school districts did not apply for the Eisenhower 
 grants for which they were eligible; 75 percent of these non-
 applicants would have received less than $1,000.(3) By fiscal 1992, 
 when funding for the program had increased by 90 percent, the average 
 grant was still only $3.4 million per state; in fiscal 1993, it was 
 $3.5 million.(4)
<p>
<p>An approach with some similarities to the Eisenhower state grant 
 program is taken in Chapter 2 of Title 1 of the Elementary and 
 Secondary Education Act of 1965. It was created by the Education 
 Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. Rather than narrow 
 categorical programs, the state and local programs part of Chapter 2 
 is intended to support a broad range of activities to improve the 
 quality of elementary and secondary education. Among those activities 
 is training and professional development for teachers and other 
 education professionals. Funds are distributed by formula to the 
 states and from the states to local education agencies. The average 
 state award in fiscal 1993 was $8.3 million. The Education Department 
 requested $415.5 million for the Chapter 2 state and local programs 
 for fiscal 1994.(5)
<p>
<p><b>Action</b>
<p>
<p>In the 1993 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
 Act, the Eisenhower Math and Science Education State Grant Program 
 should be combined with the state and local program under Chapter 2 
 of ESEA.
<p>
<p>Funds should be combined to create a new Eisenhower Professional 
 Development program, providing a more coherent national focus on 
 teacher training and staff development in the context of state 
 systemic reform plans submitted under the Goals 2000 legislation. 
 Additional professional development funding should be leveraged by 
 requiring as much as a 50 percent local matching of funds. 
 Performance data should be collected only on a multiyear cycle from 
 grantees, and that data should be aligned with identified student 
 learning outcomes based ultimately on the National Education 
 Standards currently being developed.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Eisenhower money would be focused within the framework of the 
 National Education Goals as a concentrated investment with an 
 expected return. A combined formula grant of this magnitude, with a 
 focus on professional development, would complement the opportunities 
 to learn standards and state systemic plans called for in Goals 2000.
<p>
<p>This expanded new Eisenhower program would provide for a coordinated 
 strategy of sustained training to provide teachers with the skills 
 needed to teach to new standards and administrators who can create 
 school  reform for diverse groups of students. Comprehensive 
 professional development plans, coordinated at the school level, 
 would crystallize a unified professional development strategy to 
 provide the staff renewal necessary to achieve the results defined by 
 Goals 2000. The collection of performance data aligned with student 
 learning outcomes would set the stage for eventually introducing 
 incentives for improved student performance as a component of the 
 funding formula.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>At current appropriation levels, this recommendation would leverage a 
 total of approximately $1.2 billion annually of sustained 
 professional development targeted at achieving the National Education 
 Goals. Integrating the two formula funding programs and focusing on 
 systemic approaches to define results will reduce the costs of 
 detailed and duplicative administration and compliance monitoring at 
 the federal, state, and local levels. Because the recommendation 
 would reallocate dollars, it would have no net fiscal impact on 
 federal spending.

<p><H2>ED04:  Consolidate National Security Education Act Programs</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>The National Security Education Act of 1991 (NSEA) established a 
 trust fund of $150 million to be used to award grants, scholarships, 
 and fellowships to study foreign languages and areas of the world not 
 commonly studied in the United States. The National Security 
 Education Program (NSEP), currently located in the Department of 
 Defense, will support undergraduate study abroad, as well as graduate 
 fellowships and programs of study. In the words of its principal 
 sponsor, Senator David Boren: "The National Security Education Act is 
 the largest new higher education initiative of this kind since the 
 adoption of the National Defense Education Act of 1958."(1)
<p>
<p>The trust fund is currently set up in the Treasury; staff in the 
 Department of Defense--recently reorganized and relocated within that 
 Department--have sketched out pilot programs. Implementation awaits 
 legislation freeing use of the funds, as well as nomination and 
 Senate confirmation of the full oversight board.
<p>
<p>Implementation of NSEP will involve cooperation with the scholarly 
 community, which has reacted to the initiative with simultaneous 
 praise and concern. The praise arises from the probability of 
 increased and well-conceived support for foreign language and 
 international studies education. The alarm is occasioned by the 
 location of the program and the appearance of active involvement by 
 the defense and intelligence communities in its administration. The 
 scholarly community believes this has implications for the physical 
 safety of program participants in many countries, and probably also 
 for restricted research access for     individual scholars and others 
 at their institutions.
<p>
<p>While stressing its deep commitment to the purposes of the NSEA, the 
 American Council of Learned Societies has insisted formally on the 
 "urgency of developing a more appropriate institutional location and 
 structure of governance for NSEP, one which will better protect the 
 interest of the people whom the program is intended to support."(2) 
 The Social Science Research Council and a number of key regional 
 studies associations have elaborated similar concerns. Meeting on 
 April 10, 1992, members of the Association of African Studies 
 Programs adopted a motion that they were "greatly concerned about 
 maintaining the access, safety, long-range perspectives, and academic 
 integrity of the Africanist scholars in Africa and in this country" 
 and that they "unanimously agreed to abide by a moratorium on all 
 soliciting or receiving of NSEA funds. . . ."(3) On October 28, 1992, 
 the Middle East Studies Association of North America passed a motion 
 that the connection with the defense and intelligence community "can 
 only increase the existing difficulties of gaining foreign 
 governmental permissions to carry out research and to develop 
 overseas instructional programs. It can also create dangers for 
 students and scholars . . . " The Board urged "that its members and 
 their institutions not seek or accept program or research funding 
 from NSEA" until these concerns were addressed.(4)
<p>
<p>In response, the NSEP staff has held that "the trust fund is a 
 Treasury account that may be used only for the Boren Program. Under 
 the budget agreement in effect at the time, the trust fund had to be 
 administered by the Department of Defense . . . The legislation is 
 explicit: no one with a Boren award may do anything for an 
 intelligence agency."(5)
<p>
<p>While accepting that the scholarships "are for undergraduate study in 
 foreign countries that are not emphasized in other U.S. study abroad 
 programs," the NSEP staff insists that "the Board will not approve 
 areas of undue risk for study and research abroad."(6) The academic 
 community has not found these arguments reassuring or convincing, and 
 the impasse continues. A very promising effort to enhance U.S. 
 capacity to operate in the newly competitive and complicated 
 international arena remains immobilized, caught in a political 
 entanglement.
<p>
<p>The Center for International Education in the Department of Education 
 already administers the largest assemblage of International Education 
 and Foreign Language Studies programs in the federal government. The 
 programs support comprehensive language and area studies centers 
 within the United States, fund research and curriculum development, 
 and provide opportunities for American scholars to study abroad. Most 
 of these programs were established under Title VI of the National 
 Defense Education Act of 1958 or the Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961. For 
 fiscal year 1994, the Education Department has requested an 
 appropriation of $54.1 million (roughly the same as previous years) 
 for these programs which "not only promote general understanding of 
 the peoples of other countries, but also serve important trade, 
 diplomatic, defense, and other security interests of the United 
 States."(7)
<p>
<p>Most experts find the United States severely underprepared in the 
 area of foreign language and international education. With NSEP's 
 innovative emphasis on in-country undergraduate study of less 
 commonly taught languages and on integrating graduate study of those 
 languages and important technical specialties, it would be a natural 
 complement to the existing foreign language and area studies programs 
 of the Education Department.
<p>
<p><b>Action</b>
<p>
<p>The Departments of Education and Defense should consider a 
 legislative proposal to move administration of the Boren program to 
 the U.S. Department of Education, coordinating it with the Fulbright-
 Hays and Title VI programs.
<p>
<p>Technically, the National Security Education Act of 1991 should be 
 incorporated into Title VI of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The 
 Education Department should seize the opportunity to revitalize and 
 upgrade the administration and policy oversight of all its foreign 
 language and international education programs. Cost savings from 
 eliminating overlapping programs could be possible.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>The era of global competitiveness is forcing new attention to 
 effective foreign language education. The Goals 2000  legislation, 
 for example, has added foreign language to the areas in which 
 academic achievement must be raised. Implementing this recommendation 
 will demonstrate that listening to the customer can produce effective 
 public-private cooperation to address critical national needs.
<p>
 In addition, the NSEP enables students to exchange service for 
 financial support and, in that respect, would reinforce one   aspect 
 of the National Service Trust Act.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>Combining these programs in the Department of Education would permit 
 significant reductions in costs by streamlining and consolidating 
 program administration. NPR is not able at this time to estimate FF
 these savings.

<p><H2>ED05:  Streamline and Improve the Department of  Education's Grants Process</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Interviews with several Department of Education (ED) grant recipients 
 have revealed frustration with the discretionary grant application 
 process in the department. Grantees have complained about the lack of 
 sufficient time between the notice of some grant programs and the 
 date for filing applications, particularly in cases requiring 
 collaboration among agencies or institutions. The department takes 
 nearly three times as long to process and award grants than it gives 
 applicants to develop proposals. Once applications are filed, ED 
 further frustrates applicants' ability to plan for the following 
 school year by awarding grants in the summer for school terms that 
 may start as early as August.(1)
<p>
<p>Grant functions in ED are separated between program offices and the 
 Grants and Contracts Service (GCS). Program offices in ED handle 
 substantive programmatic issues related to a grant and make funding 
 recommendations to the assistant secretaries. The GCS deals with 
 administrative issues, such as reviewing applications for compliance 
 with law and regulation and financial reports for allowable costs. 
 The first major step in the grants process is the development and 
 publication of regulations and notices of funding priorities, which 
 can take one year or longer. After publication of these, the 
 approximate time frames for the major steps in the grant process are 
 as follows:
<p>
<p>1. Printing and mailing the application packages takes an average of 
 two weeks.
<p>
<p>2. ED allows applicants a minimum of 45 days for preparation of 
 applications or proposals under existing programs and 60 days for new 
 programs.
<p>
<p>3. The Application Control Center, an office of the GCS, receives 
 grant applications and logs pertinent data into the Grants and 
 Contracts Management System. Since the postmark on an application 
 package establishes whether the submission meets the closing date 
 requirement, ED allows a minimum of three weeks between the postmark 
 deadline and the start of panel reviews to be sure that all 
 applications are received. For competitions expecting more than 500 
 applications, an additional one or two weeks is allowed.
<p>
<p>4. The panel review process and preparation of an award slate takes a 
 total of at least five weeks. This includes program office screening 
 of applications for eligibility criteria (one to two weeks), peer 
 reviewer reading and evaluation of proposals (one week), and program 
 office administrative review of panel evaluations (three weeks).
<p>
<p>5. Preparation of a funding recommendation memorandum for the 
 assistant secretary's signature, including justification for funding 
 any application out of rank order, takes one week.
<p>
<p>6. Negotiation of the award with the grantee and production of the 
 award document takes approximately six weeks to complete. This 
 includes reviewing to ensure grant file completion, compliance with 
 appropriate laws and regulations, independent cost analysis, 
 negotiation of the final terms of the grant, submission of any 
 revised material by the applicant, and review of the grantee's 
 revised budget.(2)
<p>
<p>The department estimates that the normal discretionary award process-
 -after ED publishes in the Federal Register the notice requesting 
 application submissions--takes 26 weeks, of which only six to eight 
 weeks are for the actual development of the application proposal.(3)
<p>
<p>This lengthy process seriously affects ED's customers---the grant 
 applicants and the beneficiaries of the programs, including students 
 and teachers. The timing of the notice of grant programs often 
 results in a grant award in the middle of the summer or as late as 
 September, many months after the grantee has to begin planning for 
 the school year in which the grant funds will be used. From the 
 perception of some ED grant applicants, ED does not attempt to line 
 up a review panel for some competitions until well after the 
 application deadline.
<p>
<p>The first major delay in the process occurs when ED must go through 
 the rulemaking process before soliciting grant applications. This 
 delay may reduce the time that applicants have to submit applications 
 for new programs. Program regulations are published for newly 
 authorized programs, and even reauthorized programs often require 
 major revisions to existing regulations. Rulemaking is also necessary 
 for establishing priority areas in which the Secretary wishes to 
 focus the department's limited resources. The application packages 
 themselves also go through a clearance process before publication in 
 the Federal Register. The department estimates that the regulatory 
 process--including clearance of application forms--takes nine to 12 
 months.
<p>
<p>Some of the delays are caused by statutory provisions which place 
 various unique restrictions on ED's rulemaking authority. According 
 to the department, these provisions, contained in section 431 of the 
 General Education Provisions Act, impede flexibility, constrain the 
 setting of priorities, and delay the award of grants. The timing and 
 logistical requirements placed on the department are incompatible 
 with the timing constraints for running an efficient grants process 
 and making grant awards on a timely basis. Examples of these unique 
 provisions include requiring the department to:
<p>
<p>1. Transmit regulations to Congress. The regulations will take effect 
 45 days (subject to the rules of adjournment) after transmission, 
 unless Congress passes a resolution disapproving the regulation.(4) 
 (Although this veto authority is considered unconstitutional in light 
 of the Supreme Court's ruling in Immigration and Naturalization 
 Service v. Chadha, the department still abides by the waiting 
 period.(5))
<p>
<p>2. Transmit a rulemaking schedule to Congress 60 days after enactment 
 of each piece of legislation. Final regulations must be published 
 within 180 days from the transmission of the schedule. Sometimes the 
 department has to negotiate and transmit a new schedule to 
 Congress.(6) This process has the effect of ordering certain 
 regulations to be published ahead of others that may have higher 
 priority.
<p>
<p>3. Provide a cite of authority after every section of each 
 regulation.(7) This adds to the length and complexity of the 
 documents. Other agencies can provide a cite or list of cites of 
 authority once at the beginning of each document.
<p>
<p>4. Take public comments on any rule of general applicability, 
 including priorities proposed for a one-year competition.(8)
<p>
<p>To remove some of these delays, the department has initiated reforms 
 in the rulemaking process. ED has begun using policy working groups 
 to speed up the development of regulations. These groups consist of 
 interested internal program and support staff members, and 
 occasionally include a representative from the Office of Management 
 and Budget (OMB). A few staff members draft the regulation, taking 
 into account the concerns and ideas of the entire working group. 
 Departmental nonparticipants in the working group relinquish the 
 opportunity to comment on the regulation, and are not included in the 
 departmental clearance process.
<p>
<p>In addition, ED, along with several other agencies, has recently 
 agreed to participate in an OMB pilot project begun in July 1993. 
 Under this project, ED submits to OMB a monthly list of upcoming 
 regulations requiring OMB clearance. OMB and ED jointly determine 
 which regulations ED may publish without OMB review, and which 
 regulations ED should submit to OMB for review.
<p>
<p>The department has convened a quality improvement team to analyze and 
 recommend further improvements to the regulatory process. The team's 
 goals include determining whether appropriate ways exist for the 
 department to: (1) avoid rulemaking for the first year of a new 
 program; (2) simplify procedures for the preparation and clearance of 
 funding criteria and priorities for these programs, including 
 reduction or elimination of OMB review; and (3) better coordinate 
 regulations and paperwork clearances to expedite these processes.(9)
<p>
<p>The department is also using other methods to reduce delays and 
 assist customers in planning. For some programs, the department 
 prints in the Federal Register the program announcement and all forms 
 necessary for submitting an application. (For other programs, 
 potential applicants have to request an application package.) In 
 addition, usually in September of the preceding fiscal year, the 
 department prints in the Federal Register a combined application 
 notice (CAN) which lists all programs that ED plans to compete in the 
 upcoming fiscal year and gives the approximate date an announcement 
 for each program will appear in the Federal Register. The department 
 also prints a mini-CAN in April, updating the combined application 
 notice with changes to competitions or information on new 
 competitions.(10)
<p>
<p>Further, to assist potential applicants in identifying programs and 
 the availability of funds, the department recently instituted an on-
 line bulletin board (ED Board) with grant (and contract) information. 
 The bulletin board has a limited database of program information 
 which a potential applicant can search by program office, Federal 
 Register announcement publishing date, or current availability of 
 grant funds.
<p>
<p>The department also notes a serious paperwork problem in many 
 discretionary grant competitions. For example, applicants who may not 
 have a realistic chance for funding often spend extraordinary time 
 and effort preparing lengthy application packages. The department 
 reviews all applications submitted. Some programs have initiated a 
 pre-application process in which potential applicants submit a 
 shortened application package. These pre-applications are then 
 reviewed by the department. In the next round of competition, the 
 department accepts applications only from those applicants who 
 submitted the best pre-applications.
<p>
<p>In addition to pointing out delays in processing, some customers have 
 noted that the evaluation criteria used by ED for peer review often 
 remain a mystery and a frustration. Peer reviewers, experts in their 
 fields, bring specialized knowledge and expertise, which ED staff may 
 not have, to the review of proposals. Although ED publishes 
 evaluation criteria in the Federal Register and peer reviewers are 
 supposed to review proposals objectively based on these criteria, 
 some customers perceive that peer review panels look for specific 
 ideas in a proposal, which are not printed in the Federal Register 
 announcement and about which applicants are not adequately notified. 
 After awards are announced, applicants sometimes cannot tell what 
 differentiates a good proposal from a bad one. Awards made to middle-
 range applications appear to be made with no differentiating 
 evaluation criteria. This raises the question of whether peer 
 reviewers can      effectively read and evaluate applications    in 
 accordance with the department's programmatic goals, or whether the 
 department's criteria are written as clearly and objectively as 
 necessary. Although the department is not bound to fund applications 
 that peer reviewers rate highly, in most cases it does.
<p>
<p>The peer review process costs ED considerable money and in some cases 
 may not significantly contribute to the decisionmaking process. 
 Senior staff frequently perform logistical tasks, such as 
 photocopying proposals and booking hotel rooms, to run the panel 
 reviews. In fiscal year 1992, ED spent $4.3 million on peer review 
 compensation and travel. ED estimates it will spend $4.9 million for 
 fiscal year 1993.(11)
<p>
<p>Even though grants specialists use an automated, standardized 
 negotiation instrument, customers complain that the negotiation 
 process is inconsistent. Often differences in the process depend on 
 the particular grants specialist working with the customer or even 
 the time of year. Grants awarded toward the end of the fiscal year 
 tend to be awarded with little or no negotiation. This is sometimes 
 caused by Congress' passing an appropriations bill after the fiscal 
 year begins, the length of the application process, and the necessity 
 to award all  grants before funds expire at midnight of September 30.
<p>
<p>The department reviews all eligible applications that are submitted 
 on time, whether or not the application exceeds the dollar estimate. 
 For example, the Federal Register announcement may say that the 
 department expects to award 10 grants in the amount of $200,000 to 
 $300,000. If an applicant submits a proposal with a budget of 
 $500,000, the department will still review the $500,000 proposal. 
 Thus, proposals based on a budget that exceeds the upper level of the 
 department's award range compete alongside applications within the 
 department's announced award range. It is questionable whether a 
 proposal would score as high in the rankings if that proposal were 
 based on a smaller budget.
<p>
<p>Some grantees view funding levels as arbitrary.(12) Once ED cuts a 
 grantee's proposed budget and requests revisions to the proposal to 
 accommodate these cuts, the proposal may no longer look like the one 
 the panel reviewed. Also, grantees noted that they are usually given 
 only 24 hours to respond to negotiation requests, which frequently 
 does not give them sufficient time to produce quality revisions or to 
 get the required authorizing signatures within the applicant's 
 organization.
<p>
<p>Some grants are negotiated by personnel who may not have a full 
 appreciation of the work proposed in the application. This is because 
 the program officials who authorized the grant award usually are not 
 involved in the negotiation. The grants specialist conducting the 
 negotiation is well-versed in what may represent fair and reasonable 
 costs for certain line-items but may not be able to suggest 
 substantive program areas that should be cut out of the application 
 to satisfy funding requirements.
<p>
<p>Applicants and the department identified delays in notifying 
 applicants of whether a proposal was selected for funding, especially 
 if the applicant was unsuccessful. Current department practice is to 
 delay informing unsuccessful grant applicants until grant awards are 
 made. This practice appears to be driven by a concern that disclosure 
 to an unsuccessful applicant before the funds have been obligated may 
 invite congressional pressure to alter the funding slate. This 
 practice, however, is harmful to the applicants and the students they 
 serve. Delays in making this information available early impede good 
 planning and decisionmaking by the applicant who needs to learn as 
 early as possible whether it can expect to be funded.
<p>
<p>At the end of each budget period during a grant (except for the final 
 year of the grant), the grantee must submit to the department an 
 application to continue funding for the next budget period. Through 
 this process, known as the continuation application process, the 
 department is supposed to review a grantee's performance to date and  
 decide whether to award funds for continuation of the project for 
 another one-year budget period. According to the Education Department 
 General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), projects may be funded 
 for up to 60 months, but usually are approved with a budget period of 
 not more than 12 months.
<p>
<p>Everyone involved in the grant process agrees that the continuation 
 application process has serious flaws. Frequently, grantees must 
 submit continuation applications after only a few months of 
 operation. This does not allow the grantee time to collect useful 
 data to help inform ED in making continuation funding decisions. The 
 department recently convened a quality improvement team to study the 
 shortcomings and possible changes to the continuation application 
 process.
<p>
<p>Grants management extends to overseeing grantee operations during the 
 project. The department monitors a grantee to ensure that it is 
 achieving its goals and adhering to all applicable rules. 
 Traditionally, monitoring of grantee performance has consisted of 
 federal staff visits to grantee program sites. In some cases, 
 Congress requires in a program's authorizing legislation that the 
 department visit a certain number or percentage of grantee project 
 sites each fiscal year. This requirement limits the department's 
 ability to prioritize its visits to grantees based on relevant risk 
 factors. For example, the department may have to visit low-risk 
 grantees under a program with a congressionally mandated monitoring       
 requirement, while higher-risk grantees funded under programs without 
 a congressional monitoring requirement may go without a site visit.
<p>
<p>The department's fiscal year 1992 report to the President and 
 Congress under the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) 
 cites the monitoring of all of its grants as a high-risk area needing 
 significant improvement.(13) The department has taken a number of 
 steps to address this problem. In the FMFIA report, ED notes that a 
 Monitoring and Performance Measures Team (MPMT) was established "to 
 ensure a unified and coordinated approach to developing a 
 comprehensive system of monitoring standards and performance 
 measures, which should improve accountability for the department's 
 discretionary and formula grants."(14)
<p>
<p>To further the performance measurement effort, the department 
 contracted with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) 
 for a pilot project to begin developing performance standards for 
 some programs. The first program that NAPA focused on was a formula 
 grant program, the Eisenhower Math and Science Program. The 
 contractor's draft report, as noted by ED in the fiscal year 1992 
 FMFIA report, "indicates that it will be even more time consuming to 
 develop program specific standards than originally estimated."(15) 
 The department expanded the pilot project to four other programs or 
 areas.(16) The department recently chartered a reinvention laboratory 
 on performance measurement which will attempt to reach the following 
 goals:
<p>
<p>1. identify the major programs or administrative functions to be 
 studied by the laboratory;
<p>
<p>2. define the mission, goals, and objectives for each selected 
 program and function;
<p>
<p>3. establish performance indicators for the selected programs or 
 functions;
<p>
<p>4. develop strategies for measuring performance indicators;
<p>
<p>5. report performance in a clear and readable format; and
<p>
<p>6. propose action plans for putting the indicators to work in daily 
 operations, including annual performance reports and planning for new 
 funding priorities. This new effort will coordinate with the existing 
 MPMT.
<p>
 These efforts should allow the department to focus on the performance 
 outcomes of its grantees, as well as its own internal offices. This 
 new focus should allow the department to strike a balance between 
 standard monitoring of grantees for compliance with procedural 
 requirements and monitoring for programmatic performance.
<p>
<p>The FMFIA report also cites a material weakness in grant (and 
 contract) closeout, which is the final step in managing a grant. The 
 report notes that in some cases "final products have not been 
 received. These products could have been disseminated to further 
 improve education." Without final reports, grants cannot be closed by 
 the GCS staff. In addition, "without final reports [the department] 
 cannot be sure that the terms of individual grants . . . are 
 met."(17) This includes ensuring that federal funds were spent 
 properly. Final program reports are not due from grantees until after 
 the project period has ended.(18) GCS staff members, who are 
 responsible for documenting the collection of the reports in official 
 program files, cite a current difficulty in getting final reports 
 from grantees who have already spent all of their funds. The only 
 leverage the GCS staff has to get final reports from grantees is the 
 authority to place the grantee on a list so that the grantee's 
 noncompliance is taken into account when making future decisions 
 about that grantee receiving federal funds under that specific 
 program or when determining future eligibility for further funding 
 from ED.(19)
<p>
<p>Final reports are especially critical for demonstration projects. One 
 type of report describes a grantee's activities, including how 
 federal funds were expended and whether the original objectives of 
 the project were met. Other reports examine the results of a project, 
 such as whether the project effectively achieved the desired 
 outcomes. If a federally funded demonstration project is to have any 
 national impact, ED must have documentation of program outcomes and 
 barriers to implementation of the original proposal and how these 
 were overcome.
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. Legislation should be enacted to repeal Section 431 of the General 
 Education Provisions Act.
<p>
<p>Repeal of this section would leave the department's rulemaking 
 process subject to Title 5, United States Code, sections 552 and 553, 
 and put the department's rulemaking process on generally the same 
 statutory footing as other federal agencies.
<p>
<p>2. To shorten the grant application review process, the Department of 
 Education should change the policy for receipt of applications to 
 require that applications be received by the closing date (not 
 postmarked by the closing date), while extending the time available 
 for applicants to prepare application packages.
<p>
<p>This policy is already used for responses to requests for proposals 
 for contracts and would allow the department to be consistent in its 
 dealings with customers. This requires a change to EDGAR and a change 
 in the application packages so that grantees understand the new 
 policy. Since three to five weeks are allowed for receipt of 
 applications after the current closing date, this would eliminate a 
 considerable portion of this time from the grants process. To avoid 
 possible negative customer reaction that this will cut into the time 
 to prepare proposals, the time between the publication of the program 
 announcement and the closing date would be extended, especially in 
 cases in which the project requires collaboration among agencies or 
 institutions. The advantage to customers is that they should have a 
 shorter wait between the time a proposal is submitted and when awards 
 are announced.
<p>
<p>3. The Department of Education should consider ways to reduce the 
 unnecessary paperwork in applying for funding under some 
 discretionary grant competitions.
<p>
<p>The department should consider various reforms such as limiting the 
 length of applications and returning to the applicant unread any 
 application that exceeds the limit, or requiring pre-applications--as 
 a number of programs already do--and only accepting applications from 
 those who submitted the best pre-applications.
<p>
<p>4. The Department of Education should give program offices the 
 flexibility to eliminate the peer review panel process in cases where 
 it adds little benefit to the grant award process.
<p>
<p>The process places an incredible logistical burden and cost on the 
 department. Program staff spend one week coordinating the panel 
 review process and three weeks reviewing the work of panel reviewers 
 to validate their work. Elimination in some programs will require 
 legislative changes. Savings from the elimination of the panels could 
 be used to offset the costs of contracting for services in Action 5.
<p>
<p>Program offices should assemble teams, with input from experts in the 
 education field, to develop guidelines for determining where panel 
 reviews add little value and to develop alternative, objective 
 methods for reviewing proposals. Program offices should also identify 
 ways to improve the peer review process, especially to (1) improve 
 the quality of review criteria; (2) ensure that reviewers use the 
 published criteria to objectively rate proposals; (3) improve methods 
 of scoring; (4) reduce administrative costs, including travel and per 
 diem expenses for reviewers; and (5) shorten the three-week period 
 needed by program offices to review the work of the panels.
<p>
<p>5. Where panel reviews continue to be used, the Department of 
 Education should immediately contract out panel review logistics to a 
 single contractor which would perform the function for all program 
 offices, including photocopying of applications, booking hotel 
 facilities, and other clerical functions.
<p>
<p>This will reduce the burden of panel reviews on the program offices.
<p>
<p>6. The Department of Education should   develop materials to explain 
 better to       customers how the department reviews     applications 
 so that applicants have a better understanding of what happens to an 
 application once it reaches the department. 
<p>
<p>This could be a separate pamphlet or an inclusion in the Federal 
 Register program announcement.
<p>
<p>7. The Department of Education should reduce the need for negotiation 
 with grant recipients by publishing in the Federal Register program 
 announcement the maximum amount of grant awards and return to the 
 applicant, as disqualified from competition, any proposal which 
 exceeds the maximum amount.
<p>
<p>Since decisions about the amount of awards are made before 
 negotiations occur, it makes no sense to negotiate the bottom line of 
 an award after the decision to fund a project has been made. Awards 
 will be granted on the merits of the proposal submitted.
<p>
<p>This will also create fairer competitions because all proposals would 
 be developed based on the same basic budget. This will no longer 
 cause grantees to have to make major last-minute changes to their 
 proposals to meet the department's demands. Grants and Contracts 
 Service staff will still review budgets for allowable and reasonable 
 costs and negotiate any changes necessary.
<p>
<p>8. The Department of Education should initiate immediate steps to 
 further standardize the negotiation process through staff training.
<p>
<p>ED should review and standardize its negotiation procedures. It 
 should then train all negotiators in the process with periodic 
 refresher courses to ensure continued standardization of the process. 
 This training could be included as part of the grant management 
 training in Action 10.
<p>
<p>9. The Department of Education should notify applicants of the status 
 of their applications and funding as early as possible to help 
 applicants plan and, if necessary, seek alternative funding.
<p>
<p>10. The Department of Education should improve training for program 
 and grants specialists so they can better serve their customers.
<p>
<p>The department's Horace Mann Learning Center currently offers several 
 grants management related courses which could serve as a starting 
 point for this initiative.
<p>
<p>11. Grants and Contracts Service (GCS) staff members should rotate to 
 program offices and program office staff members should rotate to the 
 GCS on detail periodically to remain in touch with, and gain a better 
 understanding of, the work of the other part of the department.
<p>
<p>These rotations could be short four-to six-week details every two 
 years and occur simultaneously to ensure that neither office is left 
 shorthanded.
<p>
<p>12. The Department of Education should eliminate the continuation 
 application process for budget years within the project period.
<p>
<p>The current continuation process does not serve a meaningful 
 programmatic or financial control purpose, but adds an administrative 
 burden to program offices, GCS, and grantees. The process should be 
 replaced by yearly program progress reports focusing on program 
 outcomes and problems related to program implementation and service 
 delivery, combined with the regular financial reporting as required 
 by OMB Circular A-110. At the beginning of each new budget period 
 within the project period, provided funds are appropriated by 
 Congress, grantees should receive authorization to obligate funds for 
 that budget period unless the grantee notifies the department of a 
 need for revision which must be reviewed and approved by ED, or 
 unless ED becomes aware of some deficiency through program reports, 
 audits, or other means.
<p>
<p>If Congress delays appropriating funds for the department, the 
 department would be unable to authorize funds for the grantee's use 
 until the appropriation is made. The department should reserve the 
 right to require continuation applications from any grantee with a 
 history of demonstrated financial or programmatic deficiencies or to 
 terminate a grant for cause or if funds are not available. 
 Elimination of this process may require changes to some program 
 authorizing statutes.
<p>
<p>13. The Department of Education should develop criteria for 
 evaluating the quality of a grantee's final program progress report.
<p>
<p>The department's current directive on Discretionary Grant Closeout 
 focuses on the receipt of final reports and a review to determine 
 "whether or not each grant recipient has achieved the objectives of 
 the grant and satisfied the grant requirements." The standards 
 developed for these reports should address such issues as whether the 
 grantee reported on all of the original program objectives, which 
 objectives were changed and why, what implementation problems were 
 encountered, and how the grantee dealt with these problems. To 
 successfully attain these goals, program staff members will require 
 training in the provision of technical assistance to grantees for the 
 writing of reports that meet the standards ED develops. Finally, ED 
 staff should provide to grant recipients, at the start of a grant, 
 information in regard to the expectations for submission of a high-
 quality final report that meets ED's standards.
<p>
<p>14. The Department of Education should revise the Education 
 Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to  allow the 
 Secretary of Education to refuse future funding under any department 
 program, excluding student aid, to a grantee that has failed to 
 submit a final program progress report or has submitted a report of 
 unacceptable quality.
<p>
<p>This could begin as a pilot project within ED, which could then 
 expand to other federal agencies with grant authority. It would add 
 more authority to the department's  ability to secure final reports 
 from grant    recipients, and to make grantees more accountable for 
 performance. Failure to submit a final report will be considered at 
 least as serious an issue of noncompliance as any misuse of or fraud 
 involving federal funds.
<p>
<p>15. The Department of Education should use identified risk factors to 
 establish priorities in monitoring of grantees.
<p>
<p>The department must stop trying to spread its resources thin in an 
 attempt to visit as many grantees as possible. Prioritized monitoring 
 with swift action and repercussions for violations, combined with 
 performance outcome measures supported by evidence, should prevent 
 waste, fraud, and abuse. Possible risk factors could include 
 organizational experience with grants, size of grant awards, 
 demonstrated programmatic or administrative deficiencies, or recorded 
 public complaints. For some programs, this will require statutory 
 changes as Congress often includes in program authorizing legislation 
 a requirement for visiting a certain percentage or number of grantees 
 per year. This increased flexibility will also give program office 
 staff more time to assist grantees with substantive programmatic 
 issues and technical matters.
<p>
<p>16. The Department of Education should continue the efforts of the 
<p>Monitoring and Performance Measurement Team to improve monitoring and develop performance measures to:
<p>
<p>(1) identify successful programs and practices; (2) aid in the 
 dissemination of information to interested parties; (3) provide 
 technical assistance to grantees, potential grantees, and other 
 interested organizations; (4) assist grantees with substantive 
 programmatic issues; and (5) ensure compliance with grant terms and 
 conditions.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>Eliminating the peer review process for certain programs would save 
 the Department of Education the costs of transporting reviewers to 
 Washington, D.C., renting hotel facilities, and compensating them for 
 their time. Some of these savings could be used to offset the 
 increased costs of contracting out for the remaining panel review 
 logistics as stated in Action 5 above. In addition, with reduction of 
 the negotiation process, the Grants and Contracts Service staff 
 should have reduced negotiation work loads, with the possibility of 
 shifting some staff time to other priorities.

<p><H2>ED06:  Provide Incentives for the Department of Education's Debt Collection Service</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for managing several 
 student loan programs that together make up the Federal Family 
 Education Loans (FFEL) program. The FFEL will soon be replaced over 
 several years by the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP), but 
 will continue to require substantial management for many years until 
 all loans are repaid or forgiven. The FDSLP, President Clinton's 
 legislative initiative, will begin in fiscal year 1994 as authorized 
 by the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993.
<p>
<p>Under the current FFEL program, borrowers receive loans through 8,000 
 participating lenders, such as banks, savings and loans, and credit 
 unions. Each of the loans is guaranteed by one of 46 guaranty 
 agencies. When a borrower defaults on a loan, the lender is 
 reimbursed for the defaulted loan by the guaranty agency. The 
 guaranty agency is then reimbursed by ED after attempting to get the 
 loan back into a repayment status. Within ED, the Debt Collection 
 Service, a unit of the Office of Postsecondary Education, is 
 responsible for collecting defaulted FFEL student loans once they 
 have been assigned to the department from the guaranty agency.
<p>
<p>The Debt Collection Service attempts to collect on the loan with its 
 in-house collection staff. If unsuccessful, the Debt Collection 
 Service contracts with private collection agencies to pursue the 
 uncollected debt. Although the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes 
 ED to fund HEA-related debt collection activities from default 
 collection, thus far default collection revenues have been used 
 solely to pay for contracts with private collection agencies. All 
 other costs, including in-house staffing related to debt collection, 
 are currently funded out of ED's salaries and expenses budget.
<p>
<p>One of the largest debt collection-related contracts, for example, 
 supports the maintenance of a database for the FFEL and Perkins 
 Student Loan programs. This contract also provides for billing 
 borrowers, receiving payments, and depositing payments in the 
 Treasury. Other debt collection-related contracts perform such 
 functions as handling debt collection correspondence, preparing ad-
 hoc documents for litigation, tracking down addresses of defaulters, 
 and supplying credit reports. Obviously, the availability of these 
 services affects the effectiveness of the Debt Collection Service in 
 collecting on its portfolio of almost $5.7 billion in defaulted 
 student loans.(1) Examples of the magnitude of debt collection-
 related workload appear in Table 1.

<p>Source: U.S. Department of Education, Debt Collection Service Fiscal 
 Year 1994/95 Salaries & Expenses Budget Request.
<p>
<p>Recent policy initiatives and levels of program activity indicate 
 that debt collection warrants special attention. Consistent in part 
 with enormous increases in borrowing, defaults have grown by well 
 over 100 percent over the last seven years. Regional debt collection 
 staffing has declined by 18 percent.(2) In fiscal year 1992, defaults 
 on student loans cost federal taxpayers $2.5 billion. Although the 
 new Federal Direct Student Loan Program has been designed to reduce 
 the complexity of student loans, collection of student loans will 
 remain a critically important function for ED.
<p>
<p>During the transition from the FFEL program to direct loans, the 
 burden of debt collections could actually increase as lenders and 
 guarantors in the current program begin to withdraw. Currently, the 
 department carries about 1.4 million accounts in its defaulted 
 student loan portfolio. This is up from about 1.0 million at the end 
 of fiscal year 1992 and is projected to increase to 2.9 million 
 accounts by fiscal year 1995. Much of this increase is due to 
 liquidation of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation (HEAF), a 
 national guarantor of student loans that faced collapse in 1990 and 
 has been wound down under ED supervision over the last three years. 
 ED must assume all of HEAF's outstanding defaults. Although the more 
 flexible repayment options incorporated into the new FDSLP, including 
 income-contingent loan repayment, will reduce the likelihood of 
 default, ED will remain responsible for collecting on those defaults 
 that occur in the new program. To collect on the projected magnitude 
 of defaulted loans, ED will likely require substantially increased 
 resources.
<p>
<p>The department uses several other tools to collect on student loans 
 in addition to in-house and collection agency methods. The most 
 successful of these is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax refund 
 offset, which resulted in collection of $512 million in fiscal year 
 1992. ED also garnishes the wages of federal employees who have 
 defaulted on student loans and is developing a pilot wage garnishment 
 program for private employers.
<p>
<p>A 1990 study showed the department's revenue collection operation to 
 be reasonably effective. Although it had a higher recovery rate than 
 six of nine guaranty agencies studied, there remain both private and 
 public sector methods and organizational structures that should be 
 tested by the department to further improve its debt collection 
 performance.(3) The IRS, for example, which has a strong record in 
 enforcing compliance with the Internal Revenue Code, could be further 
 used in the collection of student loans. It is incumbent on ED to 
 explore these various alternatives. To do otherwise would be 
 shortsighted and a disservice to the taxpayers. This is truly a 
 situation in which ED has to spend money to make money. There is 
 little doubt the average citizen expects the department to maximize 
 its net revenues from debt collection.
<p>
<p>Revenues can also be increased through productivity increases. One 
 method of increasing productivity is through the use of gainsharing 
 programs. Gainsharing programs use incentives and employee 
 involvement systems such as incentive payments and cooperative labor-
 management relationships to improve productivity and achieve more 
 efficient, effective use of resources. Guidance regarding 
 implementation of gainsharing programs within the federal government 
 has been issued by the Office of Personnel Management.(4)
<p>
<p>A prototype of gainsharing was implemented in 1987 within the Debt 
 Collection Service and was considered successful. Nicknamed the Midas 
 Program, this gainsharing program was in effect for the last five 
 months of fiscal year 1987 and helped increase revenues by $16 
 million. Given the business-type environment of the Debt Collection 
 Service, with productivity increases fairly easy to measure, a 
 gainsharing program may be a logical step in efforts to increase 
 revenues.
<p>
<p><b>Action</b>
<p>
<p>The Department of Education's Debt Collection Service should develop 
 a management strategy and evaluation plan, to be adopted by the end 
 of fiscal year 1994, which does the following:
<p>
<p>--- maximizes collections, consistent with broader student loan 
 administration policies;
<p>
<p>--- identifies ways in which the Debt Collection Service can use a 
 larger proportion of the revenue it collects to fund more of the 
 costs of its operations;
<p>
<p>--- tests the effectiveness of different revenue-enhancing measures;
<p>
<p>--- devises a gainsharing program within the Debt Collection Service;
<p>
<p>--- identifies ways in which personnel, contracting, budget, and 
<p>logistical policies can be adapted to enhance the effectiveness of 
 the Debt Collection Service; and
<p>
<p>--- to ensure that lower-income students are not adversely affected 
 by the increased debt collection activity, ensures that repayments 
 for those least able to repay are based on income, similar to the 
 income contingent provisions of the FDSLP.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Legislation for the administration's direct loan proposal included 
 additional funding for debt collection activity. The Debt Collection 
 Service's most optimistic projections show new defaults rising 
 rapidly. The recommendation calls for ED to devise an effective 
 approach for dealing with the rapidly growing defaulted student loan 
 portfolio. In implementing its debt collection strategy, the 
 department should be able to take advantage of rapidly changing 
 technology (e.g., call routing, caller ID, optical scanning) to 
 generate additional collection revenue.
<p>
<p>Increased collection efforts would have a side benefit as well. An 
 increased emphasis on collecting defaulted loans would send a strong 
 message to defaulters and potential defaulters. This message, along 
 with the income-contingent repayment options included in the direct 
 loan program, could have a significant impact on the percentage of 
 loans that end up in default.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>The fiscal impact of this recommendations cannot be determined at 
 this time as it depends upon the plan the Department of Education 
 develops.

<p><H2>ED07:  Simplify and Strengthen Institutional Eligibility and Certification for Participation in Federal Student Aid</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>There are 8,500 colleges, universities, community colleges, and 
 proprietary schools approved by the Department of Education (ED) to 
 participate in the federal student-aid programs.(1) Participation in 
 these programs allows students attending these institutions to 
 receive funds from the federal government's two largest student aid 
 programs (Guaranteed Student Loans and Pell Grants), as well as aid 
 from several smaller loan, grant, and work-study programs. Each year, 
 approximately 200 new applications are submitted, and another 150 
 applications are submitted by proprietary vocational institutions 
 whose ownership has changed. 
<p>
<p>The eligibility and certification process is scheduled to undergo 
 extensive changes under the 1992 program integrity amendments to the 
 Higher Education Act, which take effect July 1, 1994. The current 
 process has been criticized persistently by the ED Office of the 
 Inspector General (OIG) and the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) 
 as not providing sufficient assurance that the approximately $20 
 billion in federal student aid generated annually will be used as 
 intended. Although federal losses on defaulted student loans declined 
 in 1992 (from $3.6 billion in 1991), defaults still cost the 
 taxpayers $2.5 billion.(2)
<p>
<p>Institutional eligibility to participate in the financial aid 
 programs has been based on accreditation, state licensure, and 
 federal certification. To become eligible, an institution must be 
 certified by an approved accrediting body. Since the institutions 
 being accredited are members of these accrediting bodies, there is 
 not always a strong incentive for close scrutiny of institutions. 
 Institutions must also be licensed by the state. While some states 
 have played a strong role in licensing, most states have not chosen 
 to monitor vigorously or review schools licensed within the state. 
 Obtaining a license often involves little more than submitting an 
 application and paying a fee. 
<p>
<p>As a result, the department has been the last link in the chain of 
 ensuring schools are both administratively and financially able to 
 provide the education promised. Since the current review process 
 relies on labor-intensive analysis of mostly subjective criteria 
 (e.g., facilities and equipment, faculty training, support services, 
 and administrative abilities), the department has not been able to 
 adequately perform this function given staffing limitations and the 
 sheer number of institutions involved in the program. In addition, 
 studies have shown a weak relationship between the school inputs 
 mentioned above and a school's effectiveness in providing an 
 education to students.(3) (Changes in the process scheduled to take 
 effect July 1, 1994, are along the lines of the suggestions presented 
 in this report.)
<p>
<p>As a result of the high student loan default rates and media coverage 
 of financial abuse by some institutions, proprietary schools have 
 been the focus of much of the criticism aimed at student financial 
 aid programs. The amount of federal student financial aid being used 
 to attend proprietary institutions providing vocational training has 
 dramatically increased over time. Between fiscal years 1979 and 1988, 
 the number of students receiving loans at proprietary institutions 
 rose from seven percent of borrowers to over 34 percent of borrowers. 
 During the same period, the dollar amount of loans associated with 
 proprietary school students rose from 6.2 percent to just under 30 
 percent of total dollar value of Guaranteed Student Loans.(4)
<p>
<p>Under the current procedures, the primary factor in determining 
 whether an institution can continue to participate in federal student 
 loan programs is what is called the cohort default rate. This is the 
 percentage of borrowers who begin repayment during a given fiscal 
 year and who default before the end of the next fiscal year. Congress 
 and the department have done much in recent years to restrict 
 participation of schools with excessive default rates. In 1994, a 
 school can be eliminated from participating in the loan program if 
 its cohort default rate is 25 percent or higher, but the school is 
 not automatically eliminated from participating in other federal 
 student aid programs (such as Pell Grants). Cohort default rates for 
 fiscal year 1991 by institution type were as follows:(5)
<p>
<pre>
                                    Default
      Type                         Rate     
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Proprietary		35.9%
 
 Public 2-year		4.7%
 
 Private 2-year		15.5%
 
 Public 4-year 		6.5%
 
 Private 4-year		5.7%
</pre>
<p>
<p>While problems still remain, the statutory changes are expected to 
 lead to a decline in both default rates and in the volume of federal 
 aid to high-default schools.
<p>
<p>Since students attending proprietary schools borrow more than one-
 fourth of guaranteed student loan funds, a default rate of 35 percent 
 is very costly to taxpayers. Students attending proprietary schools 
 account for about 70 percent of loan default dollars.(6) In 1991, 70 
 percent of default costs amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
<p>
<p>Problems exist with the use of the cohort default. The cohort default 
 rate counts all borrowers that default, even after the borrower 
 resumes making payments. The current method of determining defaults 
 does not take into account the percentage of students at a school 
 that receive loans or the proportion of dollars in default. 
 Therefore, there is no distinction between schools that rely on 
 federal student aid programs for the bulk of their revenue and those 
 that have very few students receiving loans.
<p>
<p>There are two main reasons for high default rates. One reason is that 
 the education being provided is not effective and therefore does not 
 adequately prepare the student to obtain a job in his or her field of 
 study or a job with a sufficiently high level of earnings. The second 
 factor is that there is little demand for students in the particular 
 field for which the student is being trained. In either case, by 
 allowing the student to receive financial aid at an institution, the 
 federal government in essence lends a degree of     legitimacy to the 
 institution involved and creates an expectation of employment 
 (following graduation) by the student. Too many times, the student 
 ends up with sizable debts, little or no education of value, and no 
 job. As a result, students are unable to pay back their loan and the 
 taxpayer is left to pay the bill. This situation was characterized by 
 the GAO as follows:
<p>
<p>Many people believe that students who typically default on their 
 loans got a good education for their money, became doctors or 
 lawyers, and simply chose not to repay. While this happens sometimes, 
 the more common situation is far different. Many defaulters are poor, 
 attended a proprietary school, dropped out of their course of 
 instruction, and have little or no means to repay. Some were 
 pressured by unscrupulous recruiters to enroll in proprietary schools 
 that provided a poor-quality education and dismal employment 
 prospects. As a result, many such students failed to get value for 
 their money and are reluctant or unable to repay their loans. 
<p>
<p>Students who fail to repay their loans, however, may suffer 
 greatly for that default. They may (1) be denied other federal 
 student aid, (2) receive a negative credit rating, (3) have their 
 income tax refund seized, and (4) have their wages garnished.(7)
<p>
<p>There are many examples of problems within the financial aid system. 
 Three proprietary schools in Texas enrolled 2,600 students in 
 security guard training that was about 300 hours in duration. The 
 schools received $7.4 million in student-aid payments, even though 
 the students could have been trained in a 30-hour course for about 
 $260,000.(8) Another example is the Inspector General's finding that 
 $725 million in student aid trained 96,000 cosmetologists in 1990, 
 even though the current supply of trained cosmetologists greatly 
 exceeded the number of available jobs.(9)
<p>
<p>The process by which institutions are approved to participate in 
 federal student aid programs was dramatically altered in the 1992 
 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965. 
 Institutional approval was put on a four-year cycle, for example, and 
 audits were required annually rather than biennially. The 1992 
 reauthorization of HEA also contained provisions for state review 
 programs of postsecondary institutions. The state review program is 
 an effort to establish a shared state and federal responsibility for 
 oversight of postsecondary institutions that participate in student 
 financial aid programs by providing federal funding to support their 
 review programs. The 1994 budget request for the department contained 
 a proposal for states to share in default costs through a default 
 penalty fee, beginning in fiscal year 1995.(10) While these changes 
 are expected to significantly improve the certification and 
 eligibility process, the use of performance measures would ensure 
 students have a reasonable chance of graduation and employment before 
 the government provides federal resources to an institution.
<p>
<p>The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program shares some of the 
 same goals as training provided by proprietary schools. While the 
 department is working with the Department of Labor on school-to-work 
 transition (which involves JTPA), there currently is not a link to 
 occupational training funded through student aid. JTPA allows for 
 incentives to providers to encourage effective training programs and 
 successful job placement. Up to 6 percent of a state's JTPA funds are 
 set aside to reward agencies that perform well.(11) Introduction of 
 performance measures into the student-aid program would encourage the 
 same type of behavior by proprietary schools, et al.
<p>
<p>The certification and eligibility function within the department 
 involves ongoing compliance activities to ensure that certified 
 institutions participating in student-aid programs do not mismanage 
 federal funds. To ensure proper program management, there are 
 numerous rules, regulations, and reporting requirements that have to 
 be followed by all participating institutions, regardless of the risk 
 involved. As a result, a school like the University of Virginia is 
 subject to the same oversight and reporting requirements as a 
 cosmetology school.
<p>
<p>The department currently has a pilot quality assurance program with 
 over 100 schools that focuses on prevention of errors rather than 
 after-the-fact inspections. While the current method of program 
 reviews and audits relies on penalties to deter mismanagement of the 
 program, the quality assurance program provides institutions with 
 management flexibilities and incentives based on performance and 
 accountability.(12) This program has proven to be very successful 
 thus far and has resulted in improvements in student-aid management 
 by even well respected schools.
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
 <p>1. Legislation should be enacted to allow the department to implement 
 changes in the measures of school quality. The following changes 
 should be considered and used if appropriate:
<p>
<p>--- Development of additional default indicators, including a default 
 rate based on proportion of dollars in default and the percentage of 
 students receiving loans.
<p>
<p>--- Creation of profiles of high-risk institutions that are 
 potentially insolvent or likely to misuse student aid funds, which 
 would then be used to concentrate oversight resources on institutions 
 that pose the greatest risk.
<p>
<p>--- Establishment of outcome measures to determine performance of 
 participating schools, regardless of course length. These measures 
 would include program completion rates, employment and earnings 
 following program completion, and occupational skills testing to 
 determine if students had acquired the knowledge required for the 
 occupation for which the training was undertaken. Unsatisfactory 
 performance would be grounds for removing an institution's 
 eligibility to participate in the program.
<p>
<p>--- Withholding of a certain percentage of funds from the school 
 until a student has successfully completed the program of instruction 
 and been employed for 90 days. A variation on this theme would be to 
 provide a bonus to the school for successful training, placement, and 
 retention of students.
<p>
<p>2.     The department should move aggressively to implement those 
 provisions of the Higher Education Act that become effective July 1, 
 1994, which greatly strengthen the program integrity requirements.
<p>
<p>The 1992 amendments strengthen all three parts of the program 
 integrity "triad": accreditors, states, and the Department of 
 Education. Effective implementation of the new state role--the State 
 Postsecondary Review Program--is especially important, because it 
 provides a new tool to examine and remove problematic postsecondary 
 institutions from the program. Congress should provide all the 
 resources the administration requests for this purpose. The 
 Department should ensure through its grant mechanism that states 
 concentrate resources on schools where the problems are greatest and 
 where the most federal funds are at risk.
<p>
<p>3. Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 should be 
 amended to avoid the effect of the interpretation of the existing 
 statute made in recent court decisions. The amendment should remove 
 allegations of improper servicing and collection of loans as a basis 
 for contesting the accuracy of cohort default rates.
<p>
<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
 Circuit recently ruled that, based on the current wording of section 
 435, the Department of Education must allow institutions to appeal 
 cohort default rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing 
 and collection. The effect of this ruling is to jeopardize the 
 efforts of Congress and the department to reduce default rates.
<p>
<p>4. Legislation should be enacted to provide that once a school has 
 been determined to be ineligible for participation in the student 
 loan program, it would also become ineligible for all federal student 
 aid programs, unless it can be demonstrated that the default rates 
 are high because the school serves a historically disadvantaged 
 population and the school shows a continuing good-faith effort to 
 reduce the default rate.
<p>
<p>Currently, a school remains eligible for Pell Grants and other 
 student aid programs even though it cannot participate in the 
 Guaranteed Student Loan program due to unsatisfactory default rates.
<p>
<p>5. The department should review the accuracy of, then expand, the 
 current institutional Quality Assurance Program to provide regulatory 
 relief to more institutions with reliable performance.
<p>
<p>Performance data will be published so that students and parents can 
 make informed choices among institutions of postsecondary education.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>This recommendation would further strengthen the certification and 
 eligibility function and make performance a key indicator of whether 
 an institution is allowed to participate in the student financial aid 
 program.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>The estimated change in budget authority is $175 million through 
 Fiscal Year 1999.

<p><H2> ED08:  Create a Single Point of Contact for Program and Grant Information</H2></A>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Customers of the Department of Education (ED)--State Education 
 Agencies (SEAs), Local Education Agencies (LEAs), community-based 
 organizations (CBOs), Native American tribal governments, colleges 
 and universities, individuals, and others--should have reasonably 
 easy access to complete information on the department's programs, 
 contracts, availability of funds, and other education resources. This 
 information will allow customers to make the most effective use of 
 their time and resources, to find the best match between their 
 functional capabilities and ED programs, and to access ED's 
 educational resources.
<p>
<p>Currently, a potential applicant must contact multiple sources to 
 access information on individual programs and obtain application 
 information and forms. ED lists nearly 230 programs in its Guide to 
 U.S. Department of Education Programs. The Catalogue of Federal 
 Domestic Assistance (CFDA) also lists the department's programs, 
 along with other federally funded domestic programs. In fact, ED's 
 Guide directs potential applicants to the CFDA for "a more detailed 
 description of each program." In addition, the Federal Register 
 prints, at various points in the grants process, regulations, 
 priority area announcements, and application deadline information 
 related to these programs. For some programs, a potential applicant 
 can get the appropriate application form in the Federal Register, 
 while for other programs, a potential applicant must call the 
 department. Under these circumstances, a potential applicant might 
 not identify the programs that best match its capabilities and the 
 populations it serves.
<p>
<p>Within the department, program and staff office personnel spend time 
 responding to inquiries from the public regarding each of these 
 programs. Customer complaints of multiple telephone transfers also 
 indicate that department personnel answering telephone inquiries 
 frequently do not know who should handle calls pertaining to certain 
 inquiries.
<p>
<p>From the customer's point of view, this creates an image of a 
 department that does not know who has information about its own 
 programs. To make matters worse, a card distributed by the Office of 
 Education Research and Information has five different telephone 
 numbers at the Department of Education to call for information. The 
 five different telephone numbers only pertain to five specific areas 
 of interest within the department. If customers want to find out 
 something other than the items listed on the card, they have to call 
 one of the numbers listed and ask for help finding the appropriate 
 office, or start from scratch. Also, the phone numbers do not 
 simplify the search if the caller does not know in advance which 
 office he or she needs.
<p>
<p>The department has a growing number of on-line services available, 
 some open to limited audiences, others open to the public. These on-
 line services operate out of different offices within the department, 
 and there is no overall strategy for determining what information 
 needs to be available and how best to provide that information to the 
 department's customers. The department recently instituted an on-line 
 bulletin board (ED Board) with limited grant and contract 
 information. The bulletin board has a limited database of program 
 information that a potential applicant can search by program office, 
 Federal Register announcement publishing date, or current 
 availability. However, a potential applicant cannot search the 
 database by key words related to eligibility criteria. The department 
 is also developing a system that is intended to disseminate 
 educational information to teachers, administrators, parents, 
 librarians, and community members. This system will contain four 
 prototype databases:
<p>
<p>--- Programs and Practices,
<p>
<p>--- Funding Opportunities,
<p>
<p>--- Sources of Help, and
<p>
<p>--- Research Results.(1)
<p>
<p>A third system, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), 
 provides access to the largest education database in the world.
<p>
<p>The services mentioned above--coupled with a growing number of 
 services available through the private sector to inform the public, 
 businesses, and governments about the grants and contracts award 
 process--make it apparent that the department needs to implement a 
 unified information retrieval system for its many customers. The 
 Texas Comptroller's Office has established a comprehensive 
 computerized directory of state and federal grants that anyone in the 
 nation with a computer and a telephone modem can use to search for 
 possible sources of funds. This system was built in-house, using off-
 the-shelf software, and allows users to look up information on 2,000 
 grants as well as send electronic mail messages.(2) Many other 
 government agencies are moving to this technology to make their 
 services more easily accessible.
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. The Department of Education should  create an on-line database 
 with multiple modem access capability which will allow potential 
 applicants to obtain information on available grants, fellowships, 
 and student aid through a single contact.
<p>
<p>This database could also be used to disseminate information about 
 important topics in education, research findings, and best practices. 
 If the database software is not capable of handling the volume of 
 information anticipated to be put on-line, it could serve as a 
 gateway to one or more other databases (such as ERIC), thereby 
 simplifying access to information.
<p>
<p>As part of the on-line database, the department also should maintain 
 an up-to-date file with specific names, phone numbers, and addresses 
 to contact for information on a specific topic, grant, or issue. Once 
 all ED employees are connected by a local area network, this list of 
 contacts could be contained in a database. Anyone answering a call 
 coming into ED could search the database to find the name and phone 
 number of the appropriate person to whom the call should be referred. 
 In case of a planned absence from work, the designated contact could 
 enter the name of an alternate contact directly into the database.
<p>
<p>
<p>2. The Department of Education should establish a single phone number 
 that anyone desiring information or forms could call to receive 
 assistance.
<p>
<p>This will involve setting up an office that would handle phone calls, 
 simple tasks such as mailing out grant applications, and forwarding 
 calls that require more in-depth knowledge. This approach is 
 patterned after services provided by such companies as General 
 Electric, which offers one toll-free number to help customers with 
 questions about its products.
<p>
<p>Since the department does not know how many telephone calls it 
 receives, it is impossible to determine the exact size of the staff 
 needed to handle this centralized help line. As a result, the size of 
 the office will have to be adjusted based on the actual number of 
 calls received.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Should the department institute such changes, a number of parties 
 would benefit. A potential applicant for ED funds would only need to 
 make one contact with the department to receive information on ED 
 programs. At this time, the department does not count the number of 
 phone calls or written inquiries it receives, but each year it 
 receives approximately 30,000 applications and mails 1 million 
 applications to potential applicants. The recommended changes should 
 benefit these applicants and others who did not apply or could not 
 apply because they did not get timely or proper information.
<p>
<p>These actions would put the department in the forefront of customer 
 service within the federal government. The technology needed to 
 implement the suggested improvements is readily available and widely 
 used in private industry as well as many state and local governments. 
 The department could serve as a pilot project for the entire federal 
 government in providing first-rate customer assistance. The system 
 could be expanded at a later point to include electronic transmission 
 of grant applications and instructions for completion of 
 applications.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>The department would incur the cost of developing the database 
 software, purchasing the necessary communications and computer 
 equipment, providing training, and maintaining the database and 
 equipment, as well as personnel salaries for staffing the 
 clearinghouse. Users would be required to pay their own long distance 
 fees. Program offices would experience an increased availability of 
 program staff time currently spent on answering public inquiries that 
 the clearinghouse would now answer.

<p><H2>ED09:  Improve Employee Development Opportunities in Department of Education</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>Employee development frequently has been identified as an area in 
 need of improvement in the Department of Education (ED). The General 
 Accounting Office (GAO), in its recently published general management 
 review of ED, concluded:
<p>
<p>ED has been unsuccessful in developing and upgrading the skills of 
 its current work force due to insufficient training resources. ED 
 managers and several reports identified serious skill weaknesses in 
 such areas as accounting, finance, analysis, writing, and management. 
 But, throughout the 1980's, ED lagged far behind the growth in 
 training investment in the federal government as a whole.(1)
<p>
<p>The term employee development, as it will be used in this discussion, 
 includes the full spectrum of activities that can potentially 
 contribute to the career development of the individual in the 
 workplace. Such activities as training, rotational assignments, 
 college courses, participation on task forces, cross-training, and 
 conference attendance are possible elements in a well-formulated 
 employee development plan.
<p>
<p>The employee development plan (or individual development plan) is a 
 plan jointly developed by employee and supervisor that indicates the 
 career development goals of the employee and the specific activities 
 or experiences that will advance the individual toward those goals. 
 It is a plan, not a contract. It provides a direction for the 
 individual in the context of the organization's needs and resources 
 to support the plan. As an illustration, a potential executive's 
 development plan might include an assignment to a regional office 
 (i.e., rotation) lasting several months, while an appropriate 
 developmental activity for a mid-level employee might be a one-week 
 training course in supervision. The gamut of possibilities for 
 employee development ranges from on-the-job training to a year-long 
 sabbatical. Both organizational needs and resources, as well as 
 individual needs, must be taken into account when implementation 
 decisions are being made regarding employee development plans.
<p>
<p>Employee training and development in ED is provided in two ways: 
 centrally through the department's Horace Mann Learning Center 
 (HMLC), which offers departmentwide training in generic areas 
 including secretarial skills, supervisory and management skills, 
 career development, communications, contracts and grants 
 administration, and other areas. The HMLC budget for fiscal year 1993 
 is $960,000, which equates to approximately $192 per employee (based 
 on a workforce of 5,000).
<p>
<p>Training funds are also allocated in the department's salaries and 
 expenses (S&E) budget to each of the Principal Operating Components 
 (POCs). These funds are generally used for technical training and 
 conferences related to particular program areas. However, POCs have 
 the prerogative to move funds to other categories within the S&E 
 budget, e.g., to travel, computer services, consultants, and so on. 
 In recent years, though the department sought higher S&E 
 appropriations, Congress did not fully fund its requests. The overall 
 employee development needs in ED are graphically described in the 
 Strategic Training Plan for the department:
<p>
<p>In addition to having to be more and more productive, we are also 
 experiencing increased pressure for programmatic and fiscal 
 accountability. . . . The need for fiscal and program accountability 
 takes on additional urgency when we note that the number of contracts 
 awarded by the Department increased by the end of 1991 a total of 147 
 percent from fiscal year 1986 levels and the number of grants awarded 
 increased by a total of 53 percent from fiscal year 1984 levels. The 
 focus on fiscal and program accountability requires a significant 
 increase in training in financial and program management skill areas 
 often ignored by Department employees in current training.(2)
<p>
<p>An example of the neglect of employee development is identified in 
 the GAO High-Risk Series report on the department's Federal Family 
 Education Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan 
 program), administered by the Office of Postsecondary Education 
 (OPE). "The Department has not had adequately trained staff, and some 
 lacked appropriate skills. . . . Its staff have lacked experience, 
 training, and proficient skills in finance, information systems, data 
 analysis, planning, and policy making."(3)
<p>
<p>According to a U.S. Office of Personnel Management report for fiscal 
 year 1988, the ED had one of the lowest expenditures for training per 
 employee of all agencies of comparable size.(4) GAO indicated that, 
 from 1981 to 1989, the average expenditures for training in the 
 federal government as a whole increased by 162 percent, while those 
 in ED increased only 18 percent, as illustrated in Table 1.(5)
<p>
 Reports from the ED regional offices and the director of ED's Horace 
 Mann Learning Center (HMLC) indicate that training and development 
 opportunities are even fewer for regional than for headquarters 
 staff. The regional offices are at a particular disadvantage because 
 they generally have fewer funds and because there are no staff with 
 full-time training responsibilities.(6)
<p>
<p>In their 1992 book, Putting People First: How We Can All Change 
 America, President Clinton and Vice President Gore assert: "If 
 America is to regain its competitiveness, we must revitalize the 
 American workplace to increase productivity and expand opportunity." 
 One of the many goals they set for the new administration is to 
 provide lifetime training for all workers by requiring that every 
 employer spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and 
 training.(7) ED is, at present, far from attaining that goal. In 
 1992, the total ED payroll was $262.5 million, which would translate 
 into an expenditure of $3.9 million for training at the 1.5 percent 
 goal. The department's total training expenditure for 1992 was $1.7 
 million, less than one half of the target level. Deputy Secretary 
 Kunin stated that the department has requested a 26 percent increase 
 for training and skills development in the President's 1994 budget, 
 which represents a significant increase in funding.(8)
<p>
<p>The mission and role of the department is clearly shifting as the 
 systemic reform movement in education gathers momentum. States and 
 local districts are moving forward. The department still has the 
 opportunity to play a crucial leadership role in this historic change 
 if its staff is adequately prepared for the task. The GAO argues that 
 if the department is to truly lead the government's reform efforts in 
 education then "[ED] will need a skilled work force. But the 
 department does not adequately recruit, train, or manage its human 
 resources to ensure that workers can accomplish its mission and 
 implement Secretarial initiatives."(9)
<p>
<p>Further, the staffing needs in the department are changing, but there 
 is little turnover. This means that extensive technical training and 
 retraining is essential for ED employees. As one Acting Assistant 
 Secretary stated: "We should ensure that staff have the skills to 
 carry out new roles caused by reform and provide the training 
 necessary to keep those skills current."(10) A report to the 
 department issued during the transition between administrations 
 argued that "significant resource commitments must be made to provide 
 retraining opportunities for all staff."(11)
<p>
<p><b<Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. The Department of Education should set employee development as a 
 priority.
<p>
<p>Employee development should be an element in the department's 
 strategic plan and in strategic plans within each Principal Operating 
 Component and Regional Office. Training identified in the 
 department's strategic plan and the strategic plans in Principal 
 Operating Components and regions should be linked to budget requests 
 during the annual budget preparation process.
<p>
<p>2. The department should conduct an assessment of the training and 
 development needs for each Principal Operating Component and Regional 
 Office, and for each individual employee, so that future planning and 
 budgeting can be well-grounded in data.
<p>
<p>The department must first determine the qualifications required for 
 each position and then determine if the individual in the position 
 meets those qualifications. Skill gaps must be determined and 
 individual development plans formulated. Agencywide training plans 
 will address identified needs based on departmental priorities.
<p>
<p>3. Managers throughout the department, including Regional Offices, 
 should be held accountable for investing in and supporting employee 
 development activities by including this as an element in each 
 manager's performance plan.
<p>
<p>The Horace Mann Learning Center will prepare regular reports to 
 senior management on the extent to which employees in their offices 
 have been engaged in training. Without such data, it will be hard to 
 hold managers accountable for appropriate planning for and support 
 for training.
<p>
<p>4. The Horace Mann Learning Center should develop generic curriculum 
 useful to all employees to support new directions indicated by the 
 National Education Goals, such as performance measurement; and HMLC 
 should develop alternative means of delivering learning services to 
 employees, e.g., the use of distance learning and desktop personal 
 computers.
<p>
<p>5. Principal Operating Components should be encouraged to make use of 
 their own internal staff expertise to provide training events for 
 others in the department.
<p>
<p>Some central support will be needed to stimulate and coordinate the 
 use of ED staff in this way. The Horace Mann Learning Center should 
 establish a formal ED Faculty program to coordinate, provide 
 assistance, and disseminate information on the use of department 
 staff to conduct training.
<p>
<p>6. Employees should be encouraged to develop and implement individual 
 development plans that indicate the skill and knowledge areas needing 
 attention and the training and development activities that will 
 address those areas.
<p>
<p>7. The department should make full use of free training opportunities 
 available through other government agencies and non-federal 
 organizations.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Providing ED employees the knowledge and skills necessary to perform 
 their jobs effectively will address a number of the reinvention 
 principles. First, it will enhance customer service: state and local 
 education agencies, as well as other grantees, and the public, as 
 well, will benefit from the expertise of well-trained, knowledgeable 
 department staff. Second, knowledgeable employees will be empowered 
 to work productively, make decisions and move forward 
 programmatically.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>Fiscal impact cannot be estimated until the department has conducted 
 the assessment of training and development needs and determined the 
 requirements to meet those needs. Significant gains can be made 
 through adopting these actions without requiring additional 
 resources.

<p>
<p><H2>ED10:  Eliminate the Grantback Statutory Provision of the General Education Provisions Act</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) gives the Secretary of 
 Education authority, whenever funds are recovered from a grant or 
 cooperative agreement recipient, to repay--or grant back--to the 
 recipient up to 75 percent of the recovered funds provided the 
 recipient agrees to meet certain conditions. Funds are recovered as a 
 result of audit findings of noncompliance with the terms of the grant 
 or cooperative agreement. This provision applies to all recipients of 
 federal education funds except funds received under the Higher 
 Education Act of 1965 and Impact Aid programs.(1) This repayment 
 provision is unique to the Department of Education (ED).
<p>
<p>Originally authorized under the Education Amendments of 1978, the 
 grantback considers 75 percent of funds recovered as additional funds 
 available for the program from which ED recouped them; in other 
 words, a recipient found in violation of grant terms ultimately gets 
 back from ED the money the recipient had to pay to the department for 
 violating those terms.(2) Thus, funds appropriated for education 
 purposes which were recovered from a recipient through audit 
 proceedings would not revert to the Treasury but would instead still 
 be spent for educational purposes. States supported this measure for 
 this reason.(3) (The remaining 25 percent which the department cannot 
 grant back reverts to the Treasury.)
<p>
<p>The grant recipient might initially spend the funds in noncompliance 
 with program requirements. After funds are repaid to ED and the 
 department grants them back to the recipient, then the recipient 
 spends the funds again. If the law did not provide this second 
 chance, recipients would have a greater incentive to comply with 
 grant requirements from the start of the award. With the grantback 
 provision in place, grantees can take the chance of not complying 
 with requirements in the hope that ED will not audit them and 
 discover the noncompliance. The recipient only risks 25 percent of 
 the final penalty negotiated with ED; that is, the 25 percent that 
 cannot be granted back under the statutory provision.
<p>
<p> For example, the department receives an audit report that finds that 
 a state has been charging an excessively high rate for unemployment 
 insurance to ED-funded projects and recommends the state reduce the 
 charges to the same rate charged to non-ED funded projects and repay 
 all excess amounts collected, totalling $1 million. After receiving 
 the report and supporting documentation, ED program officials decide 
 to accept the audit recommendations and issue a program determination 
 letter that notifies the state of the decision, instructs the state 
 to take the recommended corrective actions, and to repay the excess 
 $1 million collected. The state must return the $1 million to ED.
<p> 
<p>The date of the department's decision, in the form of the program 
 determination letter, begins a three-year period in which the 
 recovered funds remain available for use. (If the grantee appeals the 
 decision to ED's Office of Administrative Law Judges [ALJ], the start 
 date of the availability period is delayed until the appeal decision 
 is issued.)
<p>
<p>The state may then request repayment of 75 percent of the funds 
 recovered, in this example a total of $750,000. ED program officials 
 review the state's request to determine whether:
<p>
<p>1. the state repaid the $1 million;
<p>
<p>2. sufficient documentation exists to determine if the state 
 completed the required corrective actions;
<p>
<p>3. the state meets all other requirements of the program;
<p>
<p>4. a plan for the use of funds exists that achieves the purposes of 
 the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population 
 affected by the failure to comply; and
<p>
<p>5. the state can use the repaid funds as proposed in the plan within 
 the three-year availability period.
<p>
<p>If all other aspects of the state's request meet the eligibility 
 requirements, ED program officials may negotiate with the state to 
 improve the project plan to better meet program objectives.
<p>
<p>Based on the final project plan and other pertinent considerations, 
 the program officials decide whether to approve the repayment and the 
 amount to repay, or grant back. Program officials then prepare a 
 memorandum to the secretary that explains the circumstances that led 
 to the recovery of funds and recommend repayment of the $750,000 as 
 requested by the state. A proposed Federal Register notice announcing 
 the department's intention to grant back the funds accompanies the 
 memorandum. The decision memorandum and Federal Register notice then 
 enter the department's internal clearance process for review and 
 comment by other departmental components.
<p>
<p>When the decision memorandum and notice are submitted for clearance, 
 program officials notify the ED budget office to submit a request to 
 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an allotment of funds 
 for the grantback. Following resolution of any issues raised during 
 the clearance process, the decision memorandum and notice are 
 submitted to the secretary for final decision.
<p>
<p>After the secretary authorizes the repayment of funds, ED publishes 
 the notice in the Federal Register for 30 days. At the end of the 30-
 day period, ED issues the $750,000 grantback award to the state.
<p>
<p>Upon completion of the project for which the funds were awarded, the 
 state submits a project report to the program office. After the 
 program office accepts the final report, it provides a copy to the ED 
 budget office for transmittal to OMB.(4)
<p>
<p>The amount of time the grantback process takes varies by case, 
 depending on the extent of corrective actions needed, whether the 
 recipient appeals the audit decision, and, if there is an appeal, the 
 extent of changes, if any, that the ALJ makes to the plan as a result 
 of the appeal. The department directs a recipient eligible for a 
 grantback to apply no later than five months before the recipient 
 plans to obligate the funds. This five-month period includes the 30 
 days necessary for the Federal Register notice.(5)
<p>
<p>Legislation should not provide recipients of ED funds with a 
 disincentive to comply with program and procedural requirements. 
 Valid audit findings should result in appropriate recovery of misused 
 funds to protect the federal government from future cases of waste, 
 fraud, and abuse.
<p>
<p>In addition, the grantback process places an administrative burden on 
 ED that simple recovery of funds as a result of audit action would 
 not.
<p> 
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. The grantback provision in the General Education Provisions Act, 
 Part E, Section 459, should be repealed to eliminate the disincentive 
 for grantees to comply with the conditions of a grant or cooperative 
 agreement.
<p>
<p>In lieu of the grantback provision, the ED should decide the amount 
 of the disallowance to recover from the recipient according to 
 current program law and regulations. The recipient would then have 
 the right to appeal the disallowance. Once a final decision is 
 reached, the recipient would have to return to ED the sum of the 
 final agency action. All recovered funds would revert to the 
 Treasury. The department would not have the discretion to grant back 
 any portion of the disallowance to the penalized recipient. 
 Sanctioned recipients should receive the necessary assistance from ED 
 or other federal sources to correct the deficiencies cited so that 
 they may remain eligible to receive federal funds in the future. In 
 addition, in cases where grant recipients are found in violation of 
 departmental regulations, but a good-faith effort was made to comply 
 with them, the department should negotiate final audit amounts that 
 do not place an undue burden on the recipient.
<p>
<p>2. The department should then notify all affected grant recipients of 
 the change in the law.
<p>
<p>Upon repeal of the grantback provision, the department should mount 
 an aggressive campaign to ensure all grant recipients are aware of 
 the change in the law.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Elimination of the grantback provision would no longer allow a 
 grantee cited for noncompliance with grant requirements a second 
 opportunity to spend some of its funds. 
<p>
<p>Elimination of the grantback also eliminates the department's 
 administrative burden of going through the grantback application 
 process and monitoring the use of funds granted back.
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>

<p>
<p><H2>ED11:  Build a Professional, Mission-Driven Structure for Research</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p> 
<p>The Department of Education spends at least a quarter of a billion 
 dollars on research annually. This includes basic and applied 
 research, program and product development, program evaluation 
 research, and statistics. Most research is conducted in four offices: 
 the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), the Office 
 of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), the Office 
 of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), and the Office of Policy 
 and Planning (OPP). Other offices also do research, primarily for 
 program evaluation; however, they often arrange for OPP to manage 
 their research activities.
<p>
<p>Three of the principal offices operate national research centers. The 
 largest is OERI's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES--
 $125 million requested for fiscal 1994). Included in NCES is the 
 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP--$65 million in 
 1994). The second largest center is the National Institute on 
 Disability and Rehabilitation Research ($67 million) operated within 
 OSERS. Two smaller centers are funded by OVAE: the National Center 
 for Research in Vocational Education ($6 million) and the National 
 Institute for Literacy ($5 million).(1)
<p>
<p>In addition to the NCES and NAEP, OERI also supports 18 national 
 research centers ($29 million), 10 regional laboratories ($38 
 million) and 16 Education Resource Information Clearinghouses (ERIC--
 $7 million). Education's national research and development centers 
 are modeled after the Atomic Energy Commission laboratories. There 
 have been as many as 25 centers, dedicated to topics from "Families, 
 Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning" and "Education in the 
 Inner Cities" to "Effective Schooling for Disadvantaged Students" and 
 "Gifted and Talented." In fiscal 1991, average funding for a center 
 was only $861,000, and in most cases the money was divided among two 
 or three separate institutions of higher education. The principal 
 investigators at the centers, excluding the directors, spend an 
 average of one quarter of their time on center studies. Of the 12 
 centers operating in the early 1980s, six have been terminated and 
 three awarded to new bidders. Like the regional laboratories and ERIC 
 clearinghouses (which are focused more on information dissemination), 
 the national research and development centers are supported only by 
 five-year grants or cooperative agreements.(2)
<p>
<p>Much of Education's research structure was created long before the 
 department was formed in 1979 and has not undergone a comprehensive, 
 independent review. However, in 1992, the National Academy of 
 Sciences (NAS) did conduct a thorough review of OERI, the 
 department's principal research arm. 
<p>
<p>The NAS study concluded that OERI has no coherent mission or 
 strategic plan and no effective structure for long-term research and 
 development. It found:
<p>
<p>Long-term agenda setting undertaken in the early years of NIE [the 
 National Institute of Education, OERI's predecessor] became difficult 
 and then futile; quick fixes replaced thoughtful investments; 
 resources were spread so thinly that mediocrity was almost assured. 
 Only a few lines of research have been sustained for the time needed 
 to bring them to fruition. There has rarely been support for the 
 successive iterations of research, development, and testing that are 
 needed in any field to develop marketable innovations.(3)
<p>
<p>OERI has not used research conducted by independent individual 
 investigators. The Academy observed that it is this type of research 
 that harvests the insight, creativity, and initiative of researchers 
 widely dispersed across the country. Only two percent of OERI's 
 research and development (R&D) budget supports individual 
 investigators doing field-initiated (extramural) research. The 
 comparable percentages at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 
 National Science Foundation (NSF) are 56 and 94 percent, 
 respectively.(4) Furthermore, basic research--investigation aimed at 
 fundamental new discoveries--receives only 5.5 percent of OERI's R&D 
 budget. By contrast, basic research receives 60 and 94 percent, 
 respectively, of the R&D budgets of NIH and NSF.(5)
<p>
<p>OERI has not been able to summarize and synthesize the results of its 
 research efforts, and while it works hard to link research and 
 practice, these efforts have not met with great success. Many of the 
 innovations presented to teachers and administrators have been fuzzy, 
 lacking in a clear       rationale and specific procedures as well as 
 convincing evidence as to their effectiveness. Others have been so 
 specific--in an attempt to be "teacher proof"--that they have 
 demeaned the teachers and undermined their talents and skills.(6) 
 Research offices within OERI, within the department, or across 
 departments operate with little coordination or cooperation. There 
 are, in addition, major administrative flaws and weaknesses.(7)
<p>
<p>A broad consensus holds that the fundamental difficulty with the 
 Department of Education's research efforts lies in how they are 
 organized. One state department of education official observed:
<p>
<p>To us, the fundamental problem has been political. The Congress and 
 sundry administrators have routinely been at odds over what should be 
 researched. Hence, there has been minimal funding for research except 
 the rather diffuse, short-term agendas. . . Unless there is a 
 fundamental structural change to obviate this nonproductive 
 arrangement, progress is unlikely.(8)
<p>
<p>Members of Congress have held that ideological and political agendas 
 have skewed the appointment of top OERI administrators, the selection 
 of topics to be studied and how they are studied, the awarding of 
 contracts, and the editing of reports and the timing of their 
 release. On the other hand, members of the executive branch have 
 charged that Congress has affected the research by favoring 
 constituent interest with mandates and large set-asides for specific 
 laboratories, centers, and studies, and by pushing other pet projects 
 with threats against OERI's appropriations.(9)
<p>
<p>Major Owens, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Select Education, 
 concludes that:
<p>
<p>"Despite the education research and development system's obvious need 
 for more federal dollars, greater resources are unlikely to be 
 forthcoming unless action is first taken to address more fundamental 
 weaknesses in the way OERI funds and carries out research and 
 development activities. Policy makers in Washington and educators 
 throughout the nation now have little confidence that funds provided 
 to OERI will be invested wisely or productively."(10)
<p>
<p>Contrary to the perception of most critics, however, much education 
 research is of high quality and directly relevant to public policy. 
 Much of the intellectual underpinnings of the major reforms of 
 elementary and secondary education, which are fully supported in 
 recommendation ED01 and administration policy, were developed through 
 OERI research. The issues now are to focus the research agenda and 
 restore credibility among all interested groups.
<p> 
<p>There has been a decline in funding for education research and 
 development, just as the nation is beginning to spend additional 
 billions on education reform. The decline at OERI has not been offset 
 by investment by other parts of the federal government. Between 1973 
 and 1989, the R&D budget of OERI and its predecessor agency, NIE, 
 declined by 82 percent (in constant dollars). In 1973 the entire 
 federal government spent $1.1 billion (in 1990 constant dollars) on 
 education research and development; in 1991 it spent between $310 
 million and $364 million.(11) In response to these findings, the NAS 
 study recommended major changes in how OERI is structured, funded, 
 and staffed. The central thrust of these recommendations has wide 
 support.
<p> 
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. The upcoming reauthorization of OERI should include several of the 
 central recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences 
 report.(12) These include:
<p>
<p>--- A stable and broad-based advisory board--including outstanding 
 researchers, teachers, principals, parents, and state and local 
 officials--should be established and charged with guiding the agenda-
 setting process of OERI.
<p>
<p>--- The board should identify procedures for contracts and grant 
 peer-review panels that ensure that research merit and programmatic 
 merit of proposals are judged only by those with the appropriate 
 professional expertise.
<p>
<p>--- The currently fragmented education research structure (centers, 
 labs, clearinghouses, etc.) and the functional division of research 
 funding (institution-based, individual, etc.) should be replaced as 
 it becomes feasible by a very few education R&D institutes 
 established after the model of the National Institutes of Health. 
 Each should target a specific problem area with a sustained program 
 of research and development that includes field-initiated efforts, 
 institutionally based R&D, and special projects. These institutes 
 should be charged with conducting high-quality research and 
 development in support of the national education goals.(13)
<p>
<p>--- A Reform Assistance Office should be established to coordinate 
 the integration and translation of research into reform assistance 
 efforts.
<p>
<p>--- OERI should report research findings directly to streamline its 
 work and minimize opportunities for political pressure.
<p>
<p>2. The Secretary of Education should request that the National 
 Academy of Sciences extend its review to the rest of the department, 
 looking at the other arrangements for research, especially NIDRR, the 
 research aspects of OPP, and the small centers within OVAE.
<p>
<p>The review should consider mission, governance, funding, 
 coordination, sustained results, accumulation of results, and links 
 to practice. It should recommend which other aspects of the 
 Department's research activities should be incorporated into the OERI 
 research structure.
<p>
<p><b>Implications</b>
<p>
<p>Rebuilding OERI as a professional, mission-driven research 
 organization is likely to receive considerable support. In the last 
 Congress both the House and the Senate made considerable progress on 
 bills to reauthorize OERI that incorporated many of the recommended 
 features. The administration is working with Congress on those bills. 
<p>
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
<p>Focusing education research on a few key topics in keeping with the 
 department's mission and the National Education Goals would mean the 
 current level of funding would be better used. There would be no 
 other significant fiscal impact.

<p><H2>ED12:  Develop a Strategy for Technical Assistance and Information Dissemination</H2></A>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
 The Department of Education (ED) supports an array of technical 
 assistance activities, created through legislative mandates totaling 
 $298.7 million.(1) The programs and technical assistance centers or 
 clearinghouses, where the projects are carried out, are broadly 
 defined as providers of both on- and off-site consultation, 
 information dissemination, access to computerized education data 
 systems, conferences, and workshops. Program-funded projects can 
 include one or more of the following activities: research and 
 development; funding and dissemination of demonstrated effective 
 models; technical assistance to states, districts and schools 
 regarding the implementation of federal categorical programs; 
 information dissemination; and direct services to specific 
 populations. Offices within ED fund these projects through grants, 
 contracts and cooperative agreements or provide the services 
 directly.(2)
<p>
<p>These centers support programs administered by six different offices 
 in the department. Chapter 1 (compensatory education programs for 
 low-income students) technical assistance centers (TACs) and Rural 
 TACs are administered by the Office of Policy and Planning (OPP).
<p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the department's program 
 offices are not in full agreement on the definition of technical 
 assistance. In a 1991 report, the OIG included projects that provided 
 technical assistance, research, and information dissemination in its 
 definition of technical assistance centers, whereas ED's program 
 offices generally included only technical assistance centers and 
 laboratories in their definition. As a result, the number of centers 
 reported by the Inspector General differed from the number reported 
 by program offices. The numbers for technical assistance centers 
 identified by the OIG are reflected in Table 1 on the next page.
<p>
<p>This analysis focuses on the technical assistance centers in the 
 Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Office of 
 Educational Research and Improvement, as these centers are presently 
 up for reauthorization.
<p>
<p>The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) provides 
 technical assistance through the following:
<p>
<p>--- The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) is an 
 information network, with clearinghouses responsible for developing, 
 maintaining, and providing access to the world's largest education 
 database. While ERIC is above average in ease of use, scope of 
 coverage, and ability to find desired or useful citations, teachers 
 and administrators say that the information caters more to the needs 
 of researchers than to the needs of teachers.(3) It does not provide 
 electronic mail or bulletin board capabilities, which would link 
 teachers to researchers and other teachers. ERIC does not provide 
 electronic access and retrieval of curriculum modules or teaching 
 aids for classroom use. In 1992, OERI responded to these criticisms 
 by funding a research and development project, called AskERIC, to 
 test the feasibility of providing answers electronically, in 48 hours 
 or less, to any question posed by Kindergarten through grade 12 
 educators.
<p>
<p>--- The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects data 
 on educational institutions at all levels and longitudinal data on 
 student progress.
<p>
<p>--- The National Diffusion Network (NDN) is a system that promotes 
 the awareness and implementation of exemplary education programs, 
 products, and practices developed by public and private schools, 
 colleges, and other institutions by providing funds to distribute 
 information about exemplary programs. Recent studies have shown, 
 however, that adoption of individual innovative programs generally do 
 "not have a large and enduring impact on the quality of 
 schooling."(4) OERI has initiated a revision of NDN procedures to 
 promote systemwide rather than project-oriented change.
<p>
<p>--- The National Research and Development Centers conduct research on 
 educational policy and practice issues of national significance. OERI 
 has provided very little funding for the research and development 
 (R&D) necessary for major advances in educational reform.(5) It 
 spends only 5.5 percent of its R&D budget on basic research. In 
 contrast, the National Science Foundation invests 94 percent of its 
 total R&D budget on basic research.(6)
<p>
<p>--- Ten regional educational laboratories carry out applied R&D and 
 technical assistance for educators, parents, and decision makers. 
 Evidence suggests the need for broader efforts to do development and 
 demonstration work, but also indicates that the laboratories do not 
 have the staff expertise for such efforts. However, a recent national 
 survey of school districts found that they used the resources of the 
 laboratories more than any other source.(7)
<p>
<p>A study conducted by the Laboratory Review Panel noted the lack of 
 communication and coordination among the laboratories, centers, ERIC, 
 and the National Diffusion Network and problems with the 
 communication of research results of the regional laboratories to 
 practitioners in state and local agencies.(8)
<p>
<p>The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) funds the 
 following centers in fiscal year 1993: six Drug-Free Schools Regional 
 Centers ($18.1 million); six Chapter 1 Technical Assistance Centers 
 ($5 million) and 10 Rural Chapter 1 Technical Assistance Centers ($5 
 million) serving OESE but administered by OPP; three Migrant Program 
 Coordination Centers ($3 million); and six Indian Education Technical 
 Assistance Centers ($2.3 million).(9)
<p>
<p>The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education is concerned that 
 there is no system or strategy for coordination of technical 
 assistance centers to promote the systemic reforms encouraged by the 
 proposed Goals 2000 legislation and the reauthorization of the 
 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) or to provide one-stop 
 shopping for technical assistance for federal programs. The typical 
 technical assistance center focuses on a particular categorical 
 program or mission (e.g., Chapter 1, federal support for substance 
 abuse prevention), with recipients of assistance generally limited to 
 those who are funded or served by the program. The extensive 
 opportunities for information sharing and training available through 
 technology have not been fully realized or implemented by the 
 department or technical assistance providers. Currently, few state 
 and local administrators or educators are aware of the ED-supported 
 technical assistance available to their state, district, or 
 schools.(10)
<p>
<p>A 1991 report by ED's Office of the Inspector General was critical of 
 the department's approach to providing technical assistance. The OIG 
 listed several problems afflicting the system:
<p>
<p>1. Similar services are provided by centers supported by different 
 programs, both within and across offices. This is true for both 
 technical assistance and information dissemination. The problem 
 afflicts Chapter 1, Office of Vocational and Adult Education and 
 Office of Educational Research and Improvement programs.
<p>
<p>2. There is no departmental plan "to ensure adequate coordination and 
 avoid, or at least minimize, duplication and overlap."
<p>
<p>3. Centers may not be located where they are needed. The rationale 
 for the location of centers is unclear.(11)
<p>
<p>The department is taking steps to analyze existing technical service 
 activities and identify some needed legislative changes.
<p>
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. The Department of Education should develop a strategy for 
 technical assistance and information dissemination to promote the 
 Goals 2000, themes of equity, access, and achievement.
<p>
<p>The department must decide who its customers are, what the purposes 
 of the technical assistance centers should be, how prescriptive it 
 wants to be, and the best vehicles to provide that assistance to 
 effect educational change. A strategy is currently being developed by 
 the department for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
 reauthorization.
<p>
<p>2. The Department of Education should create multi-purpose technical 
 assistance centers that serve several programs and focus on a variety 
 of issues, in contrast to those related to specific programs.
<p>
<p>By aligning the functions of the various categorical centers, 
 assistance providers would address the needs of all children in a 
 school, district, or state in a unified way, rather than just helping 
 to fix one program at a time. Coordinated support, or one-stop 
 shopping, would be available to states and local districts in 
 applying federal resources to systemic reform. Efficiencies would 
 result from reducing the number of centers, which would decrease 
 overhead.
<p>
<p>Ten regional centers should be created, eliminating 49 categorical 
 centers and the 50 state contacts in the National Diffusion Network. 
 The 49 categorical technical assistance centers to be eliminated 
 include: six Drug-Free Schools Regional Centers ($18.1 million), 16 
 Title VII Multifunctional Resource Centers ($11 million), two Title 
 VII Evaluation Assistance Centers ($1.7 million), six Chapter 1 
 Technical Assistance Centers ($5 million), 10 Rural Chapter 1 
 Technical Assistance Centers ($5 million), three Migrant Program 
 Coordination Centers ($3 million), and six Indian Technical 
 Assistance Centers ($2.3 million).
<p>
<p>Centers should be required to maintain staff expertise in each of the 
 federal program areas, be accessible to its customers, and meet their 
 needs in a timely manner. State and local education agencies and 
 schools should be provided with prompt access to federal priorities, 
 policies, and guidelines through an electronic network. Federally 
 funded toll-free hotlines should supplement the computer network 
 information exchanges.
<p>
<p>3. The Department of Education should foster development of a 
 national electronic network that allows states, local agencies, 
 teachers, and administrators to access research and exemplary 
 practice information easily and share ideas and feedback among 
 themselves through "electronic bulletin boards."
<p>
<p>This action should be implemented as part of Issue ED08: "Create a 
 Single Point of Contact for Program and Grant Information," described 
 earlier in this report, or an expanded AskERIC.
<p> 
<p>4. The Department of Education should establish the laboratories as 
 institutions directed toward assisting state and local education 
 agencies as they plan and implement systemic reform.
<p>
<p>ED should then enhance the close contact with school districts and 
 state agencies across the country by assisting local agencies with 
 improvements and reform and engaging customers as more active 
 partners.
<p> 
<p><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p> 
<p>Some savings may be achieved through consolidation of functions and 
 elimination of administrative and program duplication. These savings, 
 however, would then be applied, through the use of a hotline and 
 electronic bulletin board, to improve and extend technical assistance 
 to better serve ED's customers.

<p><H2>Agency Reinvention Activities</H2>
<p>
<p>Improving the management of the Department of Education (ED) and 
 achieving the National Education Goals are top priorities for 
 Secretary Richard Riley and Deputy Secretary Madeleine Kunin. They 
 believe that reforming the educational system should start "at home," 
 by turning the department into a model government agency that 
 continuously improves management practices and provides national 
 leadership and assistance to states and communities as they seek to 
 improve the educational system for all Americans.
<p>
<p>The department, however, has inherited significant management 
 problems that ultimately affect program outcomes, e.g., the shortfall 
 in the Pell Grant program, mismanagement of student loan repayments, 
 lack of appropriate oversight of programs, outmoded technology for 
 basic staff functions, and low morale of the department's staff. The 
 U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office, 
 the ED Office of the Inspector General, and ED employees have 
 identified a myriad of problems that reinvention can address.
<p>
<p>To systematically reform the department, Secretary Riley and Deputy 
 Secretary Kunin have developed an action plan calling for the 
 department to set goals, strategically plan to meet those goals, put 
 comprehensive initiatives into place, and test regularly to ensure 
 that progress is being made. Goals are being addressed through policy 
 and management actions.
<p>
<p><b>Policy Actions</b>
<p>
<p>The Secretary's major policy initiatives include:
<p>
<p>--- Defining key educational goals for the nation through the Goals 
 2000: Educate America Act. This legislation outlines a vision for 
 American education and provides a clear direction for the department: 
 to assist every state, community, and school to set its sights on 
 high standards.
<p>
<p>--- Reshaping the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, through the 
 congressional reauthorization process, so that states, communities, 
 and schools can provide access to a comprehensive system of related 
 programs that will support all students in achieving high educational 
 goals.
<p>
<p>--- Focusing legislation on the critical, but long neglected, 
 transition from school to work--a vital part of the development of a 
 world-class workforce. The Department of Education and the Department 
 of Labor have been working collaboratively for several months to set 
 the groundwork for the development of a comprehensive system for the 
 transition from school to work. Funding from the two departments will 
 be used by states and localities to initiate planning and 
 implementation efforts. Activities at the federal level will include 
 research, evaluation, and technical assistance.
<p>
<p>---  Reducing and eliminating programs that contribute least toward 
 achieving the National Goals and high educational standards for all 
 Americans. The President's budget asks Congress to cut back spending 
 in low-priority programs and to eliminate 24 programs that have 
 already achieved their purposes, duplicate other programs, or fall 
 outside the scope of the federal role in education.
 
 --- Reducing, through the Direct Loan Program, the percentage of 
 student loan dollars used by lenders for administrative purposes, so 
 that more funds can go directly to students.
<p>
<p>--- Moving away from audit-type compliance monitoring toward 
 performance measurement that emphasizes program improvement. By 
 providing grantees with performance as well as compliance information 
 early in the grant process, and providing technical assistance during 
 implementation, the department aims to reduce the need for audits and 
 legalistic reviews.
<p>
<p>--- Ensuring adherence to the laws that guarantee equal access to 
 education. The department must make full use of limited enforcement 
 resources and also develop innovative remedies and preventive 
 approaches to ensure equal access.
<p>
<p><b>Management Actions</b>
<p>
<p>The Secretary and the Deputy Secretary have taken steps to improve 
 management systems within the department. Their focus is on 
 information resources management, financial management, and human 
 resource management. Through a variety of improvement teams and 
 reinvention activities, with representation from support and program 
 offices, they are working to create an organizational culture that 
 values continuous improvement.
<p>
<p>The strategic planning initiative is a top priority within the 
 department and two new structures have been created to support and 
 institutionalize it.
<p>
<p>The Executive Management Committee advises the Deputy Secretary on 
 general management and strategic planning issues and ensures 
 coordination of departmentwide policy and management activities. The 
 Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary, consists of the 
 department's senior political leadership.
<p>
<p>The Reinvention Coordinating Council initiates and oversees the 
 department's reinvention and quality improvement efforts. Its 
 membership includes an equal number of Senate-confirmed political 
 appointees and senior career employees representing all parts of the 
 department to build partnerships among support and program offices. 
 The Council meets at least weekly. Its activities, to date, include 
 designing a framework for effective implementation of the Goals 2000 
 legislation, coordinating and overseeing the work of all cross-
 cutting department committees and work groups, and working with the 
 National Performance Review team.
<p>
<p>A departmentwide strategic planning    effort has been initiated with 
 completion scheduled for early in fiscal year 1994. Each Principal 
 Office (the 17 major offices in the department) has been asked to 
 define its mission, goals, and objectives, and to link those with the 
 overall mission, goals, and priorities of the department. Further, 
 each office will establish performance indicators so that progress 
 toward its goals can be measured. A critical part of the strategic 
 planning process is to engage all ED staff in defining and 
 implementing a meaningful plan for action.
<p>
<p>Secretary Riley and Deputy Secretary Kunin have communicated to both 
 the incoming political leadership and senior career officials that 
 improving internal management is a high priority. A management 
 retreat for senior officers was conducted to clarify the 
 organizational mission and priorities and to begin to build working 
 relationships among senior team members.
<p>
<p><b>Improving Department Management Operations</b>
<p>
<p>To build cooperation and collaboration on issues that cut across 
 offices, the Reinvention Coordinating Council is chartering quality 
 improvement teams with representation from support and program 
 offices. Teams have been chartered to improve: (1) personnel 
 classification procedures; (2) processes for receiving and responding 
 to employee complaints to Building Services; (3) the non-competitive 
 grant continuation application process and the funded programs; and 
 (4) the development and issuance of regulations for discretionary 
 grant programs. Surveys are being conducted by the teams to identify 
 the expectations and needs of ED staff. Preliminary results and 
 recommendations are expected in September 1993. Another team--
 focusing on the Secretarial initiative to further the implementation 
 of Goals 2000--has been chartered to develop strategies for meeting 
 the National Education Goals at the federal, state, and local levels.
<p>
<p>To enhance communication among department offices, the ED local area 
 computer network (ED-LAN) will be provided to 2,300 ED staff by the 
 end of September 1993, and to remaining headquarters staff by the end 
 of fiscal year 1994. Half of the regional staff will be connected to 
 the LAN in fiscal 1994 and the remainder in fiscal 1995. By fiscal 
 1994, Internet, a major "network of networks" including colleges and 
 universities, will be accessible through the LAN, providing the 
 department with the capacity to communicate with more than 10 million 
 users inside and outside of government.
<p>
<p><b>Financial Management Improvements</b>
<p> 
<p>Five high-risk management areas have been identified by the 
 department for improvement. The Management Audit Committee, chaired 
 by the Deputy Secretary, meets regularly to resolve the most 
 significant audit areas and to facilitate the handling of audit 
 resolution and follow-up. Progress is reported to the Secretary 
 through the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) 
 process. The department is also working to reduce the paperwork 
 burden on states and localities.
<p>
<p>The department is redesigning its core financial management systems 
 to ensure that data from accounting, grants, contracts, payments, and 
 other systems are integrated into a single system. The agency has 
 also taken steps to improve its performance in cash management, 
 including instituting improved quality controls.
<p>
<p><b>Specific Reinvention Projects</b>
<p>
<p>Reinvention Laboratories have been formed to target key department 
 concerns in two areas: (1) the development and use of performance 
 measures in management and program improvement, and (2) the 
 collection of outstanding debts in student financial aid.
<p>
<p>The Performance Measurement Laboratory is intended to create a Total 
 Organization Performance System (TOPS) that will enable the 
 department to answer key questions about the performance of programs 
 and its own operation--such as whether vocational education programs 
 improve the skills and jobs of participants, whether regulations are 
 readable, and whether demonstration and capacity building programs 
 produce results beyond the mere funding of grantees.
<p>
<p>TOPS will involve all 17 ED offices in a systematic effort to obtain 
 performance indicators for the major programs and support functions 
 of the department. Project staff will work with top management to 
 link performance measurement directly to the department's strategic 
 planning, budget, financial management, legislative, and evaluation 
 activities, and to coordinate information across programs.
<p>
<p>Two groups--one internal, the other external--will review the 
 department's work in this area. The Monitoring and Performance 
 Measurement Team--a departmental team of Assistant Secretaries and 
 their representatives charged with developing strategies for 
 improving monitoring and performance measurement--will review the 
 performance measures of all Principal Offices and serve as a forum to 
 develop staff capability. The Evaluation Review Panel, an 
 independent, external evaluation board (with members nominated by the 
 National Academy of Sciences and other educational research and 
 evaluation organizations) will provide a second-level review of the 
 measures.
<p>
<p>While performance indicators were previously available for some of 
 the larger programs, data collected on these measures often remained 
 unused and unanalyzed. Now, the development of performance measures 
 has begun in the majority of Principal Offices--both support and 
 program offices--and early reports are promising. Action plans for 
 using performance data have been developed for some programs. Support 
 offices in the department that had not previously examined their own 
 performance are reporting success in defining their mission, goals, 
 and objectives as first steps.
<p>
<p>The Department of Education is responsible for managing several 
 student loan programs. Most of these programs have been plagued by 
 high default rates. The Department's record of collecting debts in a 
 timely and efficient manner could be improved. Creation of the Debt 
 Collection Service Laboratory is intended to transform the practices 
 of the Debt Collection Service (DCS), a unit within the Office of 
 Postsecondary Education. The goals for a reinvented DCS are as 
 follows:
<p>
<p>--- Performance measurement and accountability. DCS will be 
 accountable in terms of net revenues produced, dollar recovery rates, 
 and customer satisfaction.
<p>
<p>--- Self-supporting. DCS will explore ways to finance itself entirely 
 out of the revenue it generates.
<p>
<p>--- Incentives. DCS will consider strategies for introducing 
 gainsharing and other productivity-increasing and worker-empowering 
 incentives.
<p>
<p>--- New collections strategies. DCS will develop new collections 
 strategies and will pursue options more vigorously.
<p>
<p>--- Workforce excellence. DCS will be a test site for creative 
 approaches to hiring, classification, and compensation.
<p> 
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b>
<p> 
<p>Some early lessons learned through ED's reinvention activities 
 include: (1) the need for sustained top management support and 
 visibility; (2) the value of taking a comprehensive approach to 
 internal management by integrating strategic planning and performance 
 measurement with other key administrative activities, such as 
 budgeting, legislation, and evaluation; and (3) the necessity to 
 identify short-term goals as well as long-term goals to improve 
 management. Programs are reporting the benefits of developing their 
 missions, goals, and objectives--a first-time activity for many. 
 Further lessons will be learned as performance data become available-
 -lessons that can be applied in the budget and reauthorization 
 cycles.

<Title>Appendix A</Title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<p><H2>Department of Education</H2>
<HR>
<p>
<p><H2>Appendix A: Justifications for the Elimination of Programs</H2>
<p>
<p>Impact Aid 3(e) Payments: 
<p>
<p>This program authorizes four years of payments to school districts 
 after they have lost federally connected students. This prolonged 
 payment period is unnecessary. The payment provided under the 
 department's authority to base payments on prior-year enrollment data 
 is sufficient to allow districts to adjust to decreased enrollments. 
 Scarce Impact Aid dollars should be provided to Local Education 
 Agencies (LEAs) that enroll federally connected students rather than 
 those that do not.
<p>
<p>Ellender Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation): 
<p>
<p>An audit of the program, requested by Congress, indicated that 
 despite significant increases in federal support, the Close-Up 
 Foundation, which administers the program, has not expanded the 
 fellowship program. In fact, the number of fellowships decreased and 
 the federal share per fellowship increased, indicating a substitution 
 of federal for non-federal support. Other organizations offer similar 
 government education programs in Washington, providing financial 
 assistance to economically disadvantaged secondary students, without 
 federal support.
<p> 
<p>Education for Native Hawaiians: 
<p>
<p>Native Hawaiians, to the extent that they meet eligibility criteria 
 that are applied to all citizens, are already eligible for ED 
 services, including student financial aid programs, that duplicate 
 many of the activities in the programs.
<p>
<p>Foreign Languages Assistance: 
<p>
<p>This program is poorly structured to be an appropriate vehicle for 
 the advancement of foreign language education in the schools. The 
 size of the fiscal 1993 appropriation is insufficient to support a 
 formula grant program, particularly one with the ambitious goals and 
 broad scope of this program.
<p>
<p>Consumer and Homemaking Education: 
<p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to assist states in conducting 
 consumer and homemaking education programs that prepare youth and 
 adults for the occupation of homemaking. This program can be 
 supported with non-federal resources. All states currently have 
 active, well-established consumer and homemaking programs that will 
 continue without direct federal support.
<p>
<p>Bilingual Vocational Training: 
<p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to provide bilingual vocational 
 education and training and English language instruction to persons 
 with limited English proficiency and to prepare these persons for 
 jobs in recognized occupations. A small discretionary program such as 
 this cannot begin to meet the needs of the nation's 4.3 million 
 limited English proficient adults. These needs are more appropriately 
 addressed through Vocational Education Basic Grants and Adult 
 Education Basic Grants.
<p>
<p>State Student Incentive Grants: 
<p>
<p>This program was intended to provide an incentive for state 
 need-based postsecondary student grant assistance through dollar-for-
 dollar federal matching funds. Federal funds are no longer necessary 
 as an incentive to states to provide need-based aid, inasmuch as 
 state expenditures for need-based grant aid have continued to expand 
 in recent years, even as federal funding has dropped or remained 
 constant. This suggests a considerable level of state commitment 
 regardless of federal expenditures.
<p>
<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program: 
<p>
<p>This program awards grants to institutions of higher education or 
 nonprofit organizations to support the development of student 
 leadership skills. Allowable activities under this program are 
 already included in the regular curriculum at many institutions of 
 higher education.
<p>
<p>Cooperative Education: 
<p>
<p>Cooperative Education programs are those having alternating or 
 parallel periods of academic study and employment related to the 
 student's academic programs or professional goals. Federal 
 encouragement and motivation in the area of cooperative education is 
 no longer necessary. The concept of cooperative education has been 
 demonstrated successfully and accepted by the higher education 
 community, as evidenced by the number of institutions of higher 
 education operating such programs without federal funding.
<p>
<p>Assistance to Guam: 
<p>
<p>This program assists the University of Guam and Guam Community 
 College in providing education programs for nonresident Micronesian 
 students. Direct federal subsidy of postsecondary schools is not an 
 appropriate federal role. In no other case does the federal 
 government make direct payments to postsecondary institutions to help 
 meet the costs related to the education of non-state or non-
 territorial residents. Moreover, the cost of educating nonresident 
 students is, for the most part, reimbursed to the postsecondary 
 institutions through the fees charged to these students. These 
 students also may qualify for federal student aid to help pay 
 tuition.
<p>
<p>Robert A. Taft Institute of Government: 
<p>
<p>For 20 years, the Institute has sponsored a variety of teacher 
 training programs. Given the fact that the Institute operated for 
 many years without federal support, it should be able to continue 
 this work without direct federal support. In addition, funds are 
 awarded on a non-competitive basis, which is not an appropriate 
 method of allocating federal resources. Financing for this purpose is 
 available under a number of competitive federal programs.
<p>
<p>National Academy of Science, Space, and Technology (NASST): 
<p>
<p>The administration strongly supports efforts to improve the 
 mathematic and scientific capabilities of American students and is 
 requesting increases in many of its mathematics and science programs. 
 However, this program is duplicative of the National Science Scholars 
 program. All funds under that program are awarded to students, 
 whereas program funds under NASST must also be used for 
 administration, thereby reducing the amount available for 
 scholarships. NASST also has a service repayment requirement that is 
 very difficult to monitor.
<p>
<p>College Housing and Academic Facilities Loan Program--New Loan Subsidies: 
<p>
<p>The academic facilities programs were created to provide financial 
 assistance to institutions of higher education for the construction, 
 reconstruction, or renovation of academic facilities and the 
 acquisition and maintenance of special research and instructional 
 instruments and equipment. The federal government should not support 
 new loan commitments because these programs are excessively 
 subsidized and supplant rather than supplement traditional state, 
 local, institutional, and private sector support. The federal 
 government should not bear responsibility for financing the capital 
 outlay needed to maintain the physical plant of institutions of 
 higher education.
<p>
<p>Territorial Teacher Training: 
<p>
<p>An evaluation of the program concluded that while it has had a 
 positive impact on the professional standards and teacher performance 
 in the Territories, the impact has been relatively modest in relation 
 to the amount of time and resources expended. To help meet locally 
 determined teacher training needs, the Territories can use resources 
 under the authority to consolidate their allocations from the 
 department's formula grant programs.
<p>
<p>Public Library Construction: 
<p>
<p>This program provides formula grants to states for the construction 
 of new public library buildings; the acquisition, expansion, 
 remodeling, and alteration of existing buildings; and the purchase of 
 equipment. In 1991, the last year for which data are available, only 
 13 percent of the funds were used for new construction projects. The 
 majority of funds were used for remodeling projects. Purchases of 
 equipment, added to the authorized activities, are already permitted 
 under other library programs. Early indications are that the number 
 of funded projects that do not involve construction will increase.
<p>
<p>Foreign Language Materials: 
<p>
<p>Federal funding for the purchase of library books and materials for 
 public libraries is not necessary when larger and more appropriate 
 sources--the general operating budgets of local jurisdictions, gifts, 
 and state aid available to local public libraries--are available. The 
 impact of the program is slight since it awards only a few small 
 grants. Furthermore, foreign language material may be purchased under 
 the Public Library Services program, for which an increase in funding 
 was requested.
<p>
<p>Library Literacy Programs: 
<p>
<p>This program provides $35,000 grants primarily to local public 
 libraries to assist in promoting volunteerism, acquiring materials, 
 and using library facilities for literacy projects. Since the program 
 was first funded in 1986, nearly 2,000 small grants have been made to 
 state and local public libraries. In 1990, only 22 percent of 
 libraries applying had never previously received a grant. 
 Furthermore, programs under the much larger Public Library Services 
 can support literacy activities.
<p>
<p>College Library Technology: 
<p>
<p>This program supports grants primarily to institutions of higher 
 education for the acquisition of up-to-date equipment used to expand 
 library resource sharing among the nation's colleges and 
 universities. Academic libraries are arguably among the most 
 sophisticated users of technology and lead the library community in 
 applying technology to the development and enhancement of library 
 services. The most urgent needs for up-to-date technological 
 equipment for use in college libraries have been met through funds 
 provided by the program over the past six years. Colleges and 
 universities generally overmatch the federal contribution.
<p> 
<p>Library Education and Training:
<p>
<p>This program supports grants to assist in educating and training 
 individuals in library and information science. While spot shortages 
 of librarians occur, no studies have predicted a widespread lack of 
 adequately trained librarians at any level.
<p>
<p>Library Research and Demonstrations: 
<p>
<p>This program supports small grants for the improvement of library 
 services. Other than a one-time increase in 1993, this program has 
 been essentially funded at the same very low level since 1980. There 
 is no justification for continuing a small categorical     program to 
 support research and demonstrations. Meritorious proposals could be 
 supported through a variety of other sources.
<p>
<p>Research Libraries: 
<p>
<p>This program supports grants to major research libraries to help them 
 strengthen their collections through the acquisition or preservation 
 of materials and to help make these collections available to other 
 libraries and users. Only a few research libraries have received a 
 single award over the life of the program, and several have enjoyed 
 virtually uninterrupted funding. Many of these awards go to 
 institutions that are among the wealthiest in the nation and that 
 could support such projects themselves. Institutions would still be 
 eligible for funds from other federal sources and, of course, they 
 may also seek private support.
<p> 
<p>Foreign Periodicals Program: 
<p>
<p>This program provides grants to libraries and institutions of higher 
 education to provide assistance for the acquisition of and access to 
 periodicals published outside the United States. This is a low 
 priority for federal funds and should be primarily an institutional 
 responsibility.
<p>
<p>Impact Aid 3(b) Payments: 
<p>
<p>The department requested a 50 percent reduction for these payments in 
 the fiscal 1994 budget request as the first step of a three-year 
 phase-out called for by President Clinton in his February 1993 
 message to Congress. These payments, which are made on behalf of 
 children who live or have a parent working on federal property, 
 provide very small amounts of $25 to $125 per section 3(b) child. The 
 presence of these children, most of whose parents pay local taxes to 
 their communities, imposes little if any financial burden on local 
 education agencies.
<p>
<p> Fund for the Improvement and Reform of Schools and Teaching (FIRST): 
<p>
<p>The purpose of the program is to improve the educational 
 opportunities for and the performance of elementary and secondary 
 school students and teachers, and to encourage local education 
 agencies to increase the involvement of families in the improvement 
 of the educational achievement of their children. These purposes 
 should be part of a comprehensive school restructuring proposal, not 
 separate categorical programs.
<p>
<p>Educational Partnerships Program: 
<p>
<p>This program was established to encourage the creation of alliances 
 between public elementary and secondary schools or institutions of 
 higher education and representatives of the private sector to work 
 together on school improvement projects. Educational partnerships 
 have been amply demonstrated as a school improvement strategy and are 
 now widespread and generally supported without federal assistance. 
 The department's fiscal year 1994 request reflects a phase-out of the 
 program.
<p> 
<p>General Assistance to the Virgin Islands: 
<p>
<p>This program provides general assistance to improve public education 
 in the Virgin Islands; it does not address any specific educational 
 goal but can be applied to all goals. This assistance duplicates 
 support under Chapter 1 and other ED programs. The department 
 proposed a 50 percent reduction for fiscal year 1994 to begin 
 phaseout of the funding. The program was established in 1978 as a 
 response to the increasing public school enrollment in the Virgin 
 Islands. By the early 1980s, however, enrollment had stabilized, and 
 by 1991-92 enrollment had declined. These statistics suggest that the 
 original purpose for providing the funds no longer exists.
<p> 
<p>Immigrant Education: 
<p>
<p>This program is designed to assist state education agencies (SEAs) 
 and LEAs in providing supplementary educational services and 
 offsetting costs for immigrant children enrolled in elementary and 
 secondary public and nonpublic schools. The eligible recipients are 
 the states, which then distribute the funds to LEAs within the state 
 according to the number of immigrant children. Immigrants are served 
 in bilingual and compensatory education programs; therefore, this 
 program is duplicative of the more general programs.
<p>
<p>Law School Clinical Experience: 
<p>
<p>This program is a demonstration that has achieved its original 
 purpose. This program provides funds to accredited law schools to 
 establish or expand programs that provide clinical experience in the 
 practice of law, with preference given to programs providing legal 
 experience in the preparation and trial of actual cases, and to 
 programs providing service to persons who have difficulty in gaining 
 access to legal representation.
<p>
<p>Educational Improvement Partnerships: 
<p>
<p>Law-Related Education: The purpose of this program was to enable 
 children, youth, and adults to become more informed citizens by 
 providing them with knowledge and skills pertaining to the law, the 
 legal process, the legal system, and the fundamental principles and 
 values on which these are based. The projects predominantly serve 
 students in public and private schools in kindergarten through grade 
 12. This is an example of a capacity-building program that has met 
 its goal; these goals can be met through a comprehensive school 
 reform designed around the National Education Goals.
<p>
<p>Dropout Prevention Demonstrations: 
<p>
<p>The department is conducting an assessment of the projects under this 
 program. The first interim report is scheduled for January 1994 with 
 a final report in August 1996. The statute limited funding to 
 applicants: (1) proposing to replicate successful programs conducted 
 in other LEAs or to expand successful programs within an LEA; and (2) 
 having a very high number or high percentage of school dropouts. The 
 demonstrations supplement other federal programs that help children 
 complete school, such as Chapter 1, Special Education, and Vocational 
 Education. Demonstrations will be complete with fiscal 1994 funds.
<p> 
<p>Follow Through: 
<p>
<p>This is a 25-year-old demonstration that has met its original 
 objectives. The program was intended to sustain the gains made by 
 preschool children through Head Start and similar programs. Also, 
 these populations can be served with funds under other Elementary and 
 Secondary Education Act programs such as Chapter 1 and Even Start, 
 and through collaborative efforts between Head Start programs and 
 schools.
<p>
<p>Impact Aid-Section 2 Payments: 
<p>
<p>These payments go to school districts with federally owned property, 
 based on ED's estimate of local revenue that the local education 
 agency would have received from the eligible federal property if that 
 property were taxable. Most school districts that receive payments 
 under section 2 also receive substantial payments in lieu of taxes 
 from other federal agencies, such as the Interior Department. The 
 department requested a 50 percent decrease for fiscal 1994.
<p>
<p>Vocational Education: 
<p>
<p>Community-Based Organizations (CBOs): The purpose of this program is 
 to provide special vocational education services to disadvantaged 
 youth through community-based organizations. Where CBOs can reach 
 disadvantaged groups that regular vocational schools cannot, states 
 can use their multi-billion dollar programs supported by federal and 
 state grants. There is no information available at the national level 
 on how critical CBOs are to the success of this population in this 
 area.
<p>
<p>Civics Education: 
<p>
<p>This program provides a non-competitive grant to the Center for 
 Civics Education to support instruction in history and civics. 
 History and civics are important parts of school curriculum, but this 
 grant is non-competitive and too small to have national impact.

<Title>Department of Energy</title>

<HR>
<H2>Department of Energy</H2>
<p>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p>
DOE was established by the Department of Energy Organization Act on October 1, 1977. The act 
consolidated the major federal energy functions into one cabinet-level department. The agencies 
incorporated into the new department were the Federal Energy Administration (FEA), the Energy 
Research and Development Administration (ERDA), the Federal Power Commission (FPC), and units of 
several other agencies. Today, the department provides the framework for a compre-hensive national 
energy plan by coordinating and administering the energy functions of the federal government. DOE also 
is responsible for long-term, high-risk research and development of energy technologies, marketing 
federal power, promoting energy conservation, a greatly reduced nuclear weapons program and an 
increased nuclear clean-up program, energy regulatory programs, and a central energy data collection and 
analysis program.
<p>
The NPR has identified eight issues for discussion in this report and made recommendations for 
further action. These issues and recommendations highlight key reinvention principles as well as 
fundamental areas of critical importance to agency management. 
<p>
NPR has helped identify a number of ways to ensure that environmental cleanup activities at DOE 
weapons production sites can be accomplished with better value for the substantial costs and increased 
responsiveness to local stakeholders. These recommendations include improvements in environmental 
contract management and incorporation of sitewide future land use planning into the cleanup process. 
<p>
The first of these recommendations encourages DOE to promote true competition among 
environmental restoration contractors and to improve management at cleanup sites. DOE should improve 
cost estimates, reduce costs, and use outcome-oriented performance measures. The second 
recommendation is designed to ensure a reasonable level of cleanup and to encourage cooperation with 
local partners to identify future uses of sites.
<p>
NPR has also worked with DOE to develop policies to make the laboratory contracting process more 
accountable to customers and to make contracts for DOE field facilities more outcome-oriented.
<p>
NPR encourages DOE to upgrade the status of the office responsible for directing a governmentwide 
energy efficiency and water conservation program by strengthening the Federal Energy Management 
Program. This recommendation will empower and encourage employees to accomplish their mission. In 
addition, this program takes advantage of private sector incentives that save federal dollars and stimulate 
business.
<p>
As federal agencies plan and prioritize their activities to make the best use of limited resources, NPR 
has identified ways to adjust the mission and operations of its national laboratories and former weapons 
production facilities to meet the challenges of the post-Cold War era. The end result is that the laboratory 
assets will be more effectively shared with other agencies, industry, and universities.
<p>
NPR recommends that restrictive legislation be amended to provide incentives for private sector 
involvement in constructing and operating new cogeneration power plants at government facilities. This 
program can greatly reduce costs to the government, increase business opportunities, and encourage 
growth. Finally, market mechanisms can also help improve decisions about price and usage of 
hydroelectricity. Implementing energy conservation programs, recovering full costs of hydroelectric 
power by the Power Marketing Administrations, and allowing market rate studies will all help make 
decisions more objective and equitable. 
<p>
NPR recommendations are estimated to provide net benefits to the federal government of nearly $3 
billion in savings and $3.5 billion in additional revenues between 1994 and 1999. Some increase in 
federal employment to ensure stronger management of the field facilities is expected, but this should be 
offset by reductions in contractor costs at these sites.
<p>
Secretary O'Leary established 15 Priorities Teams to take a hard look at the critical management and 
technical issues that are important to the future of DOE. In March, she announced a new organizational 
structure for DOE geared to achieve the administration's energy, environmental, and economic 
objectives. Six reinvention laboratories have been initiated to improve DOE's services.

<p>
<H2>DOE01:  Improve Environmental Contract Management</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program (EM) at the Department of Energy 
(DOE) was created in 1989 and has grown to comprise one-third of the total DOE budget. The EM 
program is responsible for two primary tasks:  (1) managing the safe storage and disposal of radioactive, 
hazardous, and solid waste at DOE sites; and (2) cleaning up the environmental pollution at these same 
sites. 
<p>
EM's fiscal year 1993 budget is $5.5 billion, much of which is spent on contracts (in fiscal year 1992, 
67 percent of the total budget was expended on contracts). A former Assistant Secretary estimated that, 
due to wasteful and inefficient expenditures of funds, the program was operating at 60 to 65 percent 
efficiency.(1) If this is the case, the program could waste $2 billion this year. Given that the program is 
estimated to cost $200 billion over 30 years, as much as $70 billion could be saved if the current course is 
changed. Many of these inefficiencies could be eliminated through improved contract structures and 
management of contractors. DOE is sensitive to the need for change in contract management and has 
begun a wholesale review of DOE contracting practices.(2)
<p>
DOE generally executes its environmental programs using management and operating contractors 
(M&Os) and environmental restoration management contractors (ERMCs). M&Os are general 
contractors who have traditionally been hired to manage DOE's defense production mission. M&Os are 
unique to DOE; they are issued a letter of credit that allows them to draw funds directly from the 
Treasury, and they are granted considerable latitude in deciding how to manage a DOE facility. Part of 
their management responsibility includes the provision of environmental restoration services at DOE 
weapons, research, and laboratory facilities that are still in operation.
<p>
The ERMC is a new contracting concept that was put into place in late 1992. ERMCs are general 
contractors with specific environmental expertise; they exclusively manage environmental restoration at 
DOE weapons production facilities that have been closed (Hanford Reservation near Richland, 
Washington, and the former Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio).(3) Only the ERMC at 
Fernald is currently in place and operating. The ERMC contracting mechanism is still very new. It was 
devised to bring contractors with cleanup expertise into the DOE system, reduce potential conflict of 
interest, improve management control of the environmental restoration program, reduce cleanup costs, 
enhance technology exchange throughout the environmental restoration program, and facilitate a more 
timely restoration of DOE facilities.(4) 
<p>
Under both of these contract mechanisms (the M&Os and the ERMCs), contractors are paid on a 
cost-plus-award fee basis, whereby DOE covers all the contractors' costs and, in addition, pays them an 
award fee (a percentage of the total cost) based on their performance in meeting DOE requirements.(5) 
The award fee is not only based on the total cost incurred by the prime or management contractor, but 
also on total costs incurred by every subcontractor. The more layering of subcontractors, therefore, the 
more advantageous it is to the management contractor.
<p>
Although the M&O contracting mechanism has been generally successful at promoting preeminent 
research and development, the contracts have been criticized by DOE program officials, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), the General Accounting Office (GAO), and Congress. The contracts 
have been excessively expensive and difficult to control because of their lack of accountability and 
DOE's traditionally lenient approach to M & O management. M&Os have been found to be minimally 
accountable because performance measures and criteria in the contracts are vague and subjective. 
Additional weaknesses in M&O contracting include the use of sole-source, cost-plus-award-fee 
subcontracts, non-standard contract clauses that hamper DOE's ability to correct contractor abuses, and 
inadequate auditing, cost accounting, and cost estimating mechanisms to oversee the M&Os. 
Furthermore, DOE lacks sufficient personnel to properly oversee the M&Os. The lack of oversight 
personnel is especially acute in EM, as the program has fewer total staff per program dollar than any 
other DOE program, including defense production and nuclear energy.(6)
<p>
Specifically with regard to environmental management, M&O contractors are perceived as not 
having adequate incentives to ensure rapid cleanups. There is also some concern that DOE should not be 
using the very contractors who created the pollution, and that many M&Os have insufficient cleanup 
expertise to address the problem. Further, because DOE has had such a close relationship with its M&Os, 
it has been quite difficult to seek expertise beyond the M&O community. For example, DOE is involved 
in approving salary levels, benefit packages, and, in some cases, retirement plans for M&O personnel. In 
terminating a contract with an M&O, DOE not only has to close out the contract but has to make 
provisions for terminating its involvement in the M&O's operating processes as well. Even when an 
M&O contract is terminated, it is replaced by another M&O, thereby preserving the staff and operating 
procedures. There is, therefore, great administrative difficulty and little incentive to seek expertise 
beyond the M&O community. DOE should ultimately be able to access the growing environmental 
expertise available outside the DOE weapons production complex and introduce more competition 
among contractors for environmental restoration work.
<p>
The ERMC was developed to correct some of the problems associated with the M&Os. Primarily, the 
ERMC was supposed to reduce contracting costs 15 to 20 percent by using more fixed-price subcontracts 
and by reducing labor costs. Program management and contractor performance were to be improved by 
using a single contractor responsible for cleanup and by setting up clear delineations of responsibility and 
authority. The ERMC was also intended to speed site restoration by using contractors who could focus 
exclusively on cleanup, were provided with incentives for rapid cleanup, and could apply their Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act (CERCLA) experience. 
<p>
Although several concerns have been raised about the ERMCs, this contract mechanism has been in 
place at Fernald for only nine months. It is too early to know whether the ERMC concept will remedy the 
weaknesses that it was intended to address.(7)
<p>
Contracting for environmental services under both the M&Os and the ERMCs is hampered by a 
number of general conditions. Many of the concerns regarding contracting at DOE are related to 
oversight and management of the contractors. EM has difficulty performing requisite management and 
oversight functions as it has too few staff with, in some cases, insufficient technical capability to ensure 
contractor performance. EM has far fewer federal employees overseeing program dollars, contracts, and 
contract employees than other programs in DOE and other programs doing comparable work. For 
example, in fiscal year 1993, EM will have 1,780 employees overseeing 37,000 contract employees, a 
ratio of one federal employee to 21 contract employees. By contrast, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), as a whole, employs 17,500 federal employees who oversee 9,000 to 10,000 contract 
employees, a ratio of approximately two federal employees for one contract employee.(8)
<p>
EM also has significantly less staff per program dollar than any other DOE program or comparable 
program in other agencies. For example, in EM there is $3 million in program funding for every federal 
employee versus approximately $2.35 million dollars per federal employee in the DOE defense 
production program and $300,000 per federal employee at EPA.(9) An interagency review by OMB and 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) cited the lack of EM personnel with the appropriate skills as a 
primary reason for high contract costs.(10) Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary states, "These disparities 
[in federal-to-contractor employee ratios] are, I believe, a significant factor in the department's 
weaknesses in program and contract manage-ment. Most fundamentally, they impede our ability to give 
adequate direction to our contractors and ensure that this direction is followed."(11)
<p>
The current DOE cost-plus-award-fee contracts are expensive and may be inappropriate for the 
purchase of all environmental services. Because there is little financial exposure for the contractor and 
few penalties for poor performance, these contracts also provide little incentive to control costs. Other 
agencies, such as the Corps, the Navy, the Air Force, and EPA, use a mix of fixed price and cost-plus-
award-fee contracts to pay for their environmental services.
<p>
Furthermore, the award fee is intended to reflect the relative risk associated with a service and 
provide an incentive for the private sector to perform a task. The new Assistant Secretary for EM 
questioned the applicability of the current award fee system by saying that the weights for judging 
contractor performance seem arbitrary, and that the subjectivity of the process is problematic.(12) GAO 
was similarly critical of the award fee incentive system in a 1992 report.(13)
<p>
With regard to ensuring contractor performance, DOE contracts for environmental services contain 
general work statements that do not adequately define the terms and conditions of the work to be done, 
do not lay out strong performance objectives, and do not shift the risk of poor performance to the 
contractor.(14) The new Assistant Secretary for the EM program has already voiced concerns about 
DOE's ability to measure contractor performance and the level of information that DOE is given with 
which to make decisions about millions of dollars in awards. The Assistant Secretary also described the 
decisionmaking process for evaluating contractor performance as deeply troubled.(15)
<p>
DOE's contracting practices have also been criticized for their lack of incentives to safeguard worker 
safety and health. Under the DOE cost-plus-award-fee system, 51 percent of the variable fee is to be 
awarded on the basis of contractor performance in environment, safety, and health, yet studies show that 
the award fee contracting provisions are not functioning as they should be. A report by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) stated that M&Os have avoided being penalized for not 
meeting health and safety standards by negotiating higher base fees.(16) In 1990, at the Nevada Test Site, 
the contractor was rated average in its environment, safety, and health performance. Theoretically, this 
rating should have resulted in a lower award fee. The DOE Inspector General found, however, that DOE 
field personnel adjusted the maximum fees so that the contractor could receive fees similar to those 
previously received even with a lower performance rating.(17)
<p>
DOE has some difficulty defining a scope of work and providing accurate cost estimates for 
environmental restoration contracts. This is due in part to the lack of agreement on future site uses and 
acceptable cleanup standards. It is exacerbated by the fact the DOE lacks sufficient numbers of trained 
cost engineers and estimators. EM relies on the contractors to do their own cost estimates but does not 
have enough staff or expertise to review the contractors' estimates.(18) For example, a joint study by EPA 
Region 10 and the State of Washington Department of Ecology found that one DOE employee at the 
DOE Richland Operations Office had to review contractor cost estimates for 325 projects within a two- 
week period.(19) 
<p>
In those cases where DOE was able to review a contractor's cost estimates with a "check estimate," 
the department found unnecessarily high estimates. For example, for the Oak Ridge/K-25 site solar pond 
cleanup, the contractor's cost estimate to DOE was $157 million, while the DOE program office estimate 
was $50 million to $70 million.(20) DOE's inability to review contractor cost estimates with its own 
"check estimates" means missed opportunities for cost savings. Furthermore, DOE cost estimators in 
some cases do not have sufficient training or expertise to perform reliable cost estimates. In 1992, an 
audit by the Corps of Engineers found that:
. . . DOE's estimated costs were higher than the Corps estimates for comparable environmental 
restoration and waste management projects. Specifically, after a detailed evaluation of nearly $1 billion 
(18 percent of the EM program), costs were found to be higher than the amounts the Corps would expect 
to pay for the same work by 42 percent. The primary difference in the estimates can be attributed to 
overhead and administrative costs that may be saved through changes in management and contracting 
procedures.(21) 
<p>
DOE has a cost estimation mechanism in place that is currently underused. Each field office is 
equipped with a local cost estimating guide designed to standardize cost estimating in the region. The 
guides are not consistently used, and often the contractors develop and rely upon their own cost 
estimating handbooks. The Corps, which has experience performing hazardous waste remediation work 
(although no experience performing radioactive waste cleanup), is generally recognized for its proficient 
cost estimating capabilities.(22) All cost estimates at the Corps are prepared in-house by a multi-talented 
technical team, which includes cost estimators and environmental engineers. The Corps also uses an 
automated cost estimating software package that allows for consistency in the collection of baseline data.
<p>
DOE officials originally intended to control overall costs by reducing labor costs under the ERMC 
system. However, both ERMC requests for proposals contain provisions that salary levels at the sites will 
not change. Furthermore, both ERMCs will be required to hire as much of the old M&O's workforces as 
they can effectively employ at current salary and benefit levels. This has occurred despite the fact that the 
ERMCs will require a work force with different skills.(23)
<p>
It appears that DOE has yet to achieve the optimum balance in the allocation of responsibilities 
between its headquarters and field operations. This problem was recog-nized early by Secretary O'Leary 
and is being addressed at headquarters by a recent realignment of functions and responsibil-ities. Many 
decisions regarding contracts and environmental policy must travel up and down the chain of command 
for headquarters input.(24) The ratio of headquarters versus field employees needs to be reexamined to 
implement the Secretary's operating philosophies.
<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. DOE should introduce competition and innovation in contracting for environmental cleanup services.
<p>
DOE should allow for true competition among environmental cleanup contractors and the M&Os in 
bidding for DOE environmental remediation and management work. In ensuring that it exercises fair, 
open, and competitive contracting, DOE will be able to attract the most qualified companies (whether 
they are M&Os, ERMCs, or others) in the field of environmental restoration and management to perform 
the work in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Furthermore, all environmental restoration 
work should be awarded on a cost reimbursement basis rather than with a letter of credit. To ensure the 
above-mentioned conditions at the sites that EM does not control, environmental restoration and 
management work should be separated out from the M&Os.
<p>
2. DOE should enhance the management of its waste management and environmental restoration 
contracts by providing qualified on-site DOE personnel to assume greater environmental project 
management and project design responsibilities.
<p>
For DOE to adequately manage its contractors and ensure competitive and innovative contracting, the 
EM program at DOE should build capable, technically trained teams of DOE personnel who work at 
DOE cleanup sites. Adequate authority to manage and oversee the site coupled with clear accountability 
should be delegated to these teams from DOE headquarters. As the federal presence is increased in EM 
tasks, care needs to be taken to clearly delineate federal and contractor responsibilities for 
decisionmaking and accountability. Consistent with priorities cited by the new DOE leadership, the EM 
program should reexamine the distribution of responsibilities and personnel between headquarters and the 
field.(25)
<p>
3. DOE should adopt measures to reduce costs.
To maintain management convenience and minimize transition time between the various phases of a 
cleanup at very large sites, as well as achieve economies of scope and scale, it appears that it would be 
prudent to remain with a single management contractor. At smaller sites, however, it might be 
appropriate to have several special-purpose contractors working under federal management. Whatever the 
arrangement might be, in order to manage costs, it will be important to distinguish the methods of 
contracting for various services. For example, site characterization and site assessment services should be 
purchased on a cost-plus-award-fee basis due to the relative uncertainty of this kind of work. Other 
relatively finite and discrete services such as landlord functions (grass-cutting, janitorial services) and 
actual remediation services (moving earth, pouring concrete, digging wells) should be purchased on a 
firm, fixed-price basis. To guard against excessive overhead charges (which accumulate when they are 
applied to each subcontractor), DOE should devise a policy clearly stating when to emphasize 
subcontracting and when to emphasize direct services from the contractor.
<p>
4. DOE should build tangible, outcome-oriented performance measures into its environmental restoration 
contracts to ensure objective, measurable assessments of contractor performance.
<p>
Positive and negative incentive fee criteria should be built into environmental management contracts. 
DOE could furnish the contractor with interim payments that are contingent upon the outcome of the 
contractor's work. Fees would reward contractors who exceeded contract specifications, but contractors 
would have to reimburse the department if the work did not meet specifications.
<p>
5. For the award of such environmental restoration contracts and the disbursement of fees, DOE should 
put more emphasis upon the contractors' record for ensuring worker safety and health.
<p>
Management systems and oversight controls in contracts should include accountability, monitoring, 
feedback reporting, and oversight of performance to ensure that safety and health requirements are 
implemented and adhered to.
<p>
6. To control costs, DOE's waste management and the environmental restoration programs should build a 
reliable methodology for estimating costs that is applied uniformly at all EM sites.
<p>
Although DOE has gone to considerable lengths to build its cost estimating capabilities, it needs to 
continue efforts to develop and implement effective cost estimating methodologies. The programs should 
issue a directive (followed up with prompt promulgation of a formal order) requiring that the local cost 
estimating guide be used by all DOE contractors in the region. Where necessary, DOE should work with 
the Corps and EPA to revise the cost estimating guides so that they provide a consistent system for 
measuring the thoroughness of project definition, the degree of technological complexity, the variety and 
type of contaminated media and contaminants present, and contingencies and escalation rates.(26) To 
build contract management capability throughout the EM program, environmental program managers, in 
addition to contract officers, should receive contract training.
<p>
7. DOE should build capable cost estimating and cost engineering teams at each DOE site who will be 
able to proficiently determine the contractors' scope of work and review cost estimates.
One possible means of building such capability might be through the Corps of Engineers. Currently, the 
Corps has extensive experience in estimating contract costs for hazardous waste remediation and 
construction and, furthermore, is attempting to "downsize." Experienced senior Corps cost estimators 
could be loaned or transferred to DOE and given the task of building cost-estimating teams at individual 
DOE sites.
<p>
8. For those environmental services that are paid for on a cost-plus-award or a cost-plus-fixed fee award 
basis, DOE should perform systematic and timely audits on costs incurred by every contractor to verify 
that costs charged are legitimate and reimbursable.
DOE signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), 
whereby DCAA performs the majority of cost-incurred audits for DOE on non-M&O contracts and M&O 
subcontractors. If environmental restoration and management contracts are separated from the M&Os and 
awarded on a cost-plus-award fee or other basis, responsibility for auditing will fall to DCAA.(27) 
<p>
9. DOE should reevaluate the merits of requiring environmental restoration contractors to hire as many of 
the former M&O's staff, at current salary and benefit levels, as they can effectively employ.
<p>
DOE should use the existing contractor work force for those positions that are similar in nature and 
retrain employees to the maximum extent possible. DOE should, however, verify that its contractor work 
force strategy maximizes the effective application of worker skills to skill requirements in order to ensure 
successful environmental restoration.
<p>
10. DOE should examine options to increase the ratio of federal workers to contract employees to 
improve management and oversight and control costs.
<p>
DOE should determine whether its current personnel ceiling can be raised in exchange for reductions in 
contractor funding, or if contractor positions can simply be converted into federal positions. On the 
whole, it is cheaper to perform certain functions using federal employees than it is through contract 
employees. For example, on average, a DOE contract employee costs $120,000 a year versus $90,000 per 
DOE employee, including salary and benefits. Equalizing the ratio between federal employees and 
contractors, especially out in the field, could improve contractor management and ensure that DOE 
activities are being administered by the appropriate people, and will save money in the process.
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
These actions move DOE toward a more active role in planning and managing environmental restoration 
at a DOE site. The speed of cleanup should increase by delegating authority to the field, the quality of 
decisions and oversight should improve by building technically capable oversight teams, and rising costs 
should be mitigated with accurate cost estimating procedures and credible DOE oversight.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The environmental cleanup program at DOE is estimated to cost $200 billion over 30 years. This number, 
however, is subject to change given that DOE still has not ascertained the full extent of the contamination 
at its sites.
<p>
Beginning in 1989, the program's budget allocation increased at a rate of 30 percent a year or more. The 
President's 1994 budget plan calls for a 3 percent real growth in EM's budget authority beginning in 1995. 
The EM program will have to make considerable adjustments and achieve significant efficiencies to 
accomplish its mission within this budget scenario. The NPR recommenda-tions on sitewide future land 
use planning and on contract management elsewhere in this report should help the department achieve 
these efficiencies.
<p>
Recommendations DOE01 and DOE02, "Incorporate Land Use Planning in Cleanup, should be 
implemented together," and it is difficult to estimate savings for each recommendation individually. 
Taken as a whole, however, these recommendations should achieve collective savings through:
<p>
--- competition among environmental contractors; 
<p>
--- a reduction of fees and overhead in environmental contracting; 
<p>
--- increases in productivity; 
<p>
--- enhanced management and oversight of contractors; 
<p>
--- cost control and cost reduction through better cost estimation of environmental services; 
<p>
--- increased use of federal employees in place of contractors; and 
<p>
--- a remedial decisionmaking process based on reasoned land use assumptions. 
<p>
Viewed as a reform package, contracting reform and sitewide future land use planning could achieve a 15 
to 25 percent cost savings over five years. In other words, within the limits of their resources, the EM 
program at DOE should become 15 to 25 percent more efficient in administering the cleanup program 
over five years. In essence, the above changes should enable DOE to perform more cleanup more 
effectively for each dollar spent and potentially mitigate the escalation of costs for the whole 
environmental restoration and waste management program.

only. The Office of the Inspector General will be responsible for performing a traditional cost-incurred 
audit.

<H2>DOE02:  Incorporate Land Use Planning in Cleanup</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
Cleanup at federal sites is guided primarily by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The National Contingency Plan (NCP), which is the 
blueprint for implementing CERCLA, specifies that cleanup remedies must protect human health and the 
environment and comply with all applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs), which 
are federal and state environmental standards.(1) The NCP also identifies cost as a criterion for 
consideration when cleanup remedies are evaluated.(2)
<p>
To determine what cleanup remedies will protect public health and the environment, satisfy applicable 
requirements, and be cost-effective, an understanding of existing and anticipated exposure of individuals 
to contamination is necessary. Because future land use decisions often are not an explicit part of the 
CERCLA cleanup process, there is no effective approach either for establishing cleanup objectives based 
on anticipated future use of the site and level of exposure to the population, or for measuring and 
comparing the benefits of alternative cleanup strategies.
<p>
In assessing the risks posed by contamination, unrestricted residential land use is virtually always 
assumed, whether such an assumption is reasonable or not. As a result, the assessment and remedy 
selection process may lead to unnecessary or inappropriate cleanup decisions. Often the scope of the 
assessment and remedy selection process is expanded greatly to account for all possible outcomes 
associated with residential use, even when such future use at large, federally owned sites is unrealistic. In 
addition, technologies may be selected that result in excessive expense for little demonstrable benefit to 
human health or the environment.
<p>
This situation is complicated by the fact that there are no national standards for radioactive waste and 
mixed waste cleanup. CERCLA defers to state and federal standards for waste, water, and air 
contamination; neither state law nor federal law, however, comprehensively addresses the issue of how to 
mitigate the risk of exposure to radioactive waste or to radioactive waste mixed with hazardous waste. 
Furthermore, public expectations that a site or facility will be cleaned up to allow unrestricted use may be 
disappointed if this level of cleanup cannot be achieved because of technology or resource limitations.
<p>
Without reasonable assumptions about future land use being determined early in the cleanup process, 
remedy selection tends to focus on which technologies could be employed at the site. Without a clear 
objective as to the future use of the land or facility after cleanup, the cost-effectiveness of a particular 
technology cannot be evaluated. In addition, emerging technologies may be ignored in favor of known 
technologies, even when such technologies may be cost-prohibitive or have been shown, by sound 
science or through actual application, to be ineffective.
<p>
In the past, DOE's decisionmaking processes have been largely isolated from the public, although DOE is 
currently working aggressively to remedy this situation. As a result, DOE's credibility with the general 
public and state and local stakeholders needs further improvement.(3) Stakeholders affected by DOE's 
cleanup decisions have voiced concern over everything from slow cleanup to creating "national sacrifice 
zones."(4) In addition, local stakeholders are not always fully informed about the resource, technical, and 
statutory constraints within which cleanup decisions are made. The stakeholders' inability to get 
information and their level of distrust can result in opposition to DOE's cleanup decisions which, in turn, 
brings delays and increased costs.
<p>
DOE has successfully implemented an important first step in a land use planning process at the Hanford 
Reservation, which was formerly devoted to producing plutonium for nuclear warheads. This 560-square-
mile site houses large plutonium production facilities and constitutes DOE's most difficult cleanup 
problem. Although it is too early to gauge its full impact on the cleanup process, it is possible to identify 
some benefits of the Hanford future use planning process.
<p>
At Hanford, a broad-based group of stakeholders worked together and developed an array of land use 
options for various portions of the Hanford Reservation. One outcome of the process was the identifica-
tion of an option to restrict use of part of the site, known as the "200 Area," for waste management. The 
200 Area is severely contaminated and therefore will be used temporarily as a waste management site for 
the rest of the Hanford Reservation. As a result, two other plots of land totaling 260 square miles can be 
turned over for recreational use beginning next year because the small amounts of waste on that land will 
be transferred to the 200 Area.(5)
<p>
Furthermore, public participation provided data to DOE and regulatory agencies about public needs and 
preferences for land use. For instance, through the Hanford future use planning process, representatives of 
the agricultural sector stated that they did not see agricultural value in much of Hanford land because 
public perceptions of radioactive contamination might give Washington State produce an unmarketable 
image. Such important information might not come to government's attention without such public 
forums. Finally, early and effective public participation, as evidenced at Hanford (while a benefit in its 
own right), may help to build support for subsequent remedy selection decisions.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) should be 
amended to provide more explicit encouragement of and direction for a cleanup process that incorporates 
early future use planning (i.e., the identification of a reasonable set of future land and facility use 
assumptions based on a number of criteria including current and expected future site use).
<p>
The intent is that reasonable land use assumptions would guide the cleanup process, from development of 
risk scenarios to remedy selection. This suggested clarification of the statute would help to ensure that 
such planning would occur as cleanup progresses across federal sites. In anticipation of an eventual 
reauthorization of CERCLA, the administration should also issue an explicit policy encouraging the 
implementation of future site use planning early in the remediation process regardless of what statute 
governs cleanup.
<p>

2. DOE, federal and state regulators, and other stakeholders should work together to address land use 
planning at DOE sites while CERCLA is being reauthorized.
<p>
While it is true that CERCLA and the NCP do not expressly support future site use planning, it is also 
true that such planning is not prohibited. In addition, identification of possible future site uses has many 
potential benefits. The future use of land and natural resources is the clearest means of defining cleanup 
objectives. Establishing baseline risk assessments and identifying methods of attaining regulatory and 
statutory requirements can more effectively be done once such cleanup objectives are established.
<p>
For future land use planning to achieve the greatest benefits, it should:
<p>
--- be done early in the site remediation planning process; 
<p>
--- be a collaborative process involving all stakeholders; 
<p>
--- guide risk assessment and remedy selection to ensure that scenarios identified and evaluated are 
realistic and that cleanup standards that are identified are based on the best available science, protect 
human health and the environment, and achieve land use objectives; and 
<p>
--- be carried out from a sitewide   perspective, unless impossible or impracticable, so that remedial 
action alternatives include the range of future site use assumptions applicable to the site and can then be 
considered in light of their impacts on sitewide restoration strategies. 
<p>

3. The cleanup of contaminated land should achieve specific standards based upon the future intended use 
of the site.
<p>
Cleanup should ensure protection of human health and the environment in conjunction with such future 
site uses. Health assessment criteria developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, the National Institutes of Health, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry should also be used. Furthermore, DOE should work collaboratively with these agencies 
to gather and analyze data on exposure rates, risk, and related issues as a basis for the regulatory agencies 
to develop standards for cleanup of both radioactive and mixed waste (containing both radioactive and 
hazardous materials).
<p>
As national cleanup standards are developed, they should be designed to accommodate future land use 
planning, although health-based considerations should remain the primary basis for cleanup standard 
setting.6 Finally, EPA should work with DOE and other federal agencies responsible for cleanup to 
define various land categories broadly and clearly. This will help to ensure that various land use 
categories can be understood and applied consistently.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Early incorporation of future site use planning, identifying a reasonable set of future land and facility use 
assumptions and clarification of cleanup objectives, can help to streamline the cleanup process, making it 
more effective and efficient, while still maintaining the protection of human health and the environment 
as the highest priority. Clear cleanup objectives can guide the development of risk assessments to be 
tailored to specific alternatives for future use, potentially saving considerable time and resources, as well 
as aid in the selection and implementation of cleanup remedies. Furthermore, agreement about the 
appropriate remedy could potentially be achieved more easily, and expectations concerning the results of 
the remedial action would be clearer.
<p>
Statutory changes and development of administrative policy would help ensure that, as the law and policy 
are implemented, land and facility use planning would be incorporated into the cleanup process. This 
would be particularly helpful for agencies like DOE that are responsible for cleanup and regulated by 
CERCLA.
<p>
DOE has several advisory boards in place and is currently reviewing them and establishing others based 
on the recommendations of the Federal Facility Environmental Restoration Dialogue Committee. With 
these boards, DOE has or will have the institutional mechanisms in place to ensure a collaborative land 
use planning process. Within this context, land use and facility use planning could take place.
<p>
In the absence of national cleanup standards, future land and facility use could be instrumental in 
determining cleanup levels that would protect of human health and the environment. These cleanup 
levels would be tied to specific land and facility use objectives.
<p>
Targeting cleanup objectives based on future land and facility use will help identify emerging 
technologies that may be appro-priate at a particular site. In addition, the development of new 
technologies can be focused clearly on meeting cleanup objectives.
<p>
The funding allocated for research and development of new and emerging technologies can be targeted 
more effectively at meeting needs clearly defined by early future use planning.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
See Fiscal Impact statement in DOE01 "Improve Environmental Contract Management." The discussion 
of the benefits from DOE01 envisioned that the recommendations would be implemented together.  
<p>

<b>Endnotes</b>
<p>
1. "Remedies" are particular methods chosen to clean up a site. "Applicable or relevant and appropriate 
requirements" (ARARs) are still primarily federal standards promulgated under other laws such as the 
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, etc. Over the last few 
years, however, states have begun to promulgate their own state regulations under these statutes, and 
CERCLA has had to increasingly defer to state regulations. In some cases, state regulations are more 
stringent than federal regulations, which means that DOE will have to meet different standards depending 
on the state in which the facility is located.
<p>
2. The nine criteria applicable to the remedy selection decisions, as specified by 300.430(e)(9)(iii) of the 
National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), are: (1) overall protection of 
human health and the environment; (2) compliance with ARARs; (3) long-term effectiveness and 
permanence; (4) reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment; (5) short-term 
effectiveness; (6) implementability; (7) cost; (8) state acceptance; and (9) community acceptance. 
Protection of human health and compliance with ARARs are "threshold criteria" that all alternatives must 
satisfy (unless an ARAR waiver is granted). The next five criteria, including cost, are "primary balancing 
criteria," less important than threshold criteria but of equal weight among themselves. State and 
community acceptance are "modifying criteria" and are given less weight than threshold or "balancing 
criteria."
<p>
3. The proposed final report of the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board Task Force on Radioactive 
Waste Management described public trust and confidence in the EM program in this way: "The 
institutional context within which the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM) 
operates presents opportunities for developing institutional trustworthiness. EM has a broader conception 
of what is needed to build trustworthiness and has set in place an elaborate structure doing so. It has not 
demonstrated, however, that it can sustain trustworthiness as it grapples with highly contentious issues 
nor has it developed a strategy for managing constraints that might create vicious cycles for it as well." 
U.S. Department of Energy, Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, Earning Public Trust and Confidence: 
Requisites for Managing Radioactive Waste (Washington, D.C., June 1993), executive summary and pp. 
46-48.
<p>
4. "National sacrifice zones" refers to areas that might be deemed so contaminated that they would not be 
cleaned up.
<p>
5. Lippman, Thomas W.  "Nuclear Arms Center Heads Slowly to Oblivion," 
The Washington Post (May 15, 1993), p. A4.
<p>
6. Future use considerations should be an important component of setting cleanup standards; however, 
future uses cannot be guaranteed indefinitely, nor can it be assumed that active institutional controls (e.g., 
security guards, on-site management, etc.) will remain in place over the long term. In fact, EPA 
Standards for the Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High Level and Transuranic Nuclear Waste (40 CFR 
Part 191 b) authorized under the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, specifically 
states that, for the purposes of radioactive waste disposal, active institutional controls cannot be assumed 
to be in place for any longer than 100 years. Standards, therefore, must be primarily driven by health-risk 
considerations.

<H2>DOE03:  Make Field Facility Contracts Outcome-Oriented</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy's (DOE's) national laboratories, including weapons laboratories and 
production plants, were established by the federal government to attract the best minds in the country to 
conduct scientific research and development (R&D) projects of national significance. DOE operates 16 
major R&D laboratories and several production installations through management and operating (M&O) 
contracts with large private sector companies, universities, and nonprofit organizations (for example, 
Westinghouse, Martin Marietta, the Universities of California and Chicago, and Princeton University).
<p>
At the national laboratories and nuclear weapons production centers, the govern-ment owns all the land, 
facilities, and equipment, while the contractor manages the facility and employs research, development, 
and production personnel. The contractor also employs various support and maintenance personnel 
needed to operate the installation.
<p>
The national laboratories represent a partnership between government and private industry to develop and 
maintain worldwide leadership and competitiveness in various scientific disciplines (nuclear research, 
highenergy physics, mathematics, high-speed computing, engineering, and others). DOE laboratories 
have played an integral part in developing the nation's defense capability and in carrying out basic 
research in all major fields, including energy.
<p>
M&O contracts at DOE amount to $16 billion annually and currently employ 140,000 people.(1) 
Contracts were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s, primarily for nuclear weapons and other nuclear 
research, design, and production. The projects developed into programs of extraordinary scale, challenge, 
and uncertainty. For example, the contractor for Argonne National Laboratory, located near Chicago, is 
the University of Chicago. The installation employs 4,840 employees and operates 26 major research 
facilities. R&D includes experimental and theoretical research in the physical, life, and environmental 
sciences to support development of energy technologies and to advance scientific understanding. The 
1993 operating budget was $527 million. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, outside San 
Francisco, is run by the University of California. The Laboratory employs 8,000 employees and conducts 
national security, energy, environmental, and biological R&D. Its 1993 annual operating budget is $1.2 
billion.
<p>
Each site is unique because of its location, physical arrangement, size, and mission. The mission at a site 
can involve theoretical research, applied research, weapons research, nuclear weapons production, non-
nuclear production, environmental restoration, or a combination of these missions.
<p>
Because the government wanted to take advantage of private sector capabilities to carry out research of 
critical national importance, government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) R&D facilities were 
constructed using M&O contracts for the national laboratories. The contracts have traditionally contained 
broad oversight and performance requirements and special provisions for the contractor. The contractor 
requires no capital investment. The government sets up a special bank account to cover operating 
expenses; this covers all costs except costs for deliberate waste, fraud, and abuse. These provisions were 
necessary during the early, uncertain, and urgent stages of nuclear weapons development. The M&O 
contract approach has come under increasing criticism from DOE program officials, the Office of 
Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and Congress. Criticism includes poor 
business management practices and inadequate cost accounting procedures. An M&O contract typically 
includes:
<p>
--- long-term, core scientific and technological research or production missions;
<p>
--- special one-time R&D projects; and 
<p>
--- support functions and daily operations and maintenance activities at the installation.(2)  
<p>
The M&O contract for each GOCO laboratory and weapons center has typically been awarded on a cost 
reimbursement-type contract basis that covers five-year periods with options for contractor renewal. 
While such contracts may be appropriate for complex and high-risk scientific projects, they may not be 
the most cost-effective management arrangement for routine support functions. For that reason, some of 
those functions are subcontracted by the prime contractor.
<p>
A close association has developed between DOE program managers at headquarters and contractor 
laboratory managers. Congress appropriates funds for R&D by program (laboratories get no 
appropriation). Program managers direct major research funding to the specific laboratories they believe 
are best able to carry out the work, based on proposals from those laboratories. Within program areas, 
laboratory managers compete with others in their scientific field for this R&D funding. The complexity 
of the projects, the close association between the contractor and the government at a GOCO facility, and 
special provisions in M&O contracts have resulted both in R&D success and in a number of 
administrative complications that have been documented in GAO and DOE Inspector General reports. 
<p>
In 1990, GAO designated DOE's contract management as one of 16 high-risk areas governmentwide 
because of its extensiveness and history of inadequate contractor oversight. For example, DOE's nuclear 
weapons labs have routinely reported quantities of nuclear materials as "in use" or "needed" when they 
were actually excess. Sandia National Laboratory reported $500,000 worth of excess uranium as 
"needed." Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Savannah River also reported incorrectly. These 
inaccuracies affect DOE's ability to forecast nuclear materials requirements and result in purchasing and 
storage costs that are larger than necessary, as well as added safety and environmental risks.(3) 
<p>
Many other documented incidents involving complications in security and contracting have been serious 
and costly. For example, tens of thousands of documents relating to secret nuclear weapons and laser 
technology could not be located. Also, since 1986, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory has leased 58 
vehicles from the University of California (the M&O contractor) using a sole-source contract and at a 
cost of $987,000 when the vehicles could have been obtained through the General Services 
Administration at a cost of $396,000. In addition, in 1989, Los Alamos Laboratory, when performing 
work for non-federal parties, exceeded sponsor advances by $460,000 and its approved budget authority 
by $719,000, putting DOE at-risk for financing the sponsors' work.(4)
<p>
Subcontracting by DOE's M&O contractors amounts to roughly $5 billion per year and has also been 
subject to criticism. DOE reviews have disclosed excessive use of sole-source subcontracts, inadequate 
separation of duties, and initial prices below review thresholds that are subsequently raised by contract 
modifications.(5) They have also revealed significant deficiencies in record keeping and analysis needed 
to ensure that prices were fair and reasonable. When M&O contractors do not take full advantage of 
competition and fixed-price mechanisms in their subcontracts, they pay more than they should for the 
goods and services that they buy on behalf of the government.
<p>
Oversight of M&O contracts is performed by government officials in program offices and operations 
offices. Program managers oversee the science, technology, research, and development aspects of 
laboratory and weapons production activity. Operations office managers oversee contractual and cost 
accounting matters and provide day-to-day oversight and an on-site field presence. Relative to the size of 
the contracts being managed and the complexity of the work being performed, the government oversight 
staff is considered to be small and inadequately trained. Oversight is also hampered by a lack of 
specificity in the descriptions of products of M&O contracts and performance requirements, expectations, 
and measurement criteria.
<p>
In many cases, DOE officials are limited in their ability to specify objective measures in contracts 
because entities outside DOE that sponsor or regulate DOE activities have failed to provide adequate 
performance criteria to DOE. This is particularly true for work done in defense programs and 
environmental restoration. Moreover, in areas involving basic science, where outcomes cannot be 
specified, performance criteria based on peer review are needed to promote the best basic science without 
discouraging creative research.
<p>
Alternative management and contracting arrangements exist that might improve both the control and cost 
of operations and support at laboratories and weapons production plants. One option is to separate large 
M&O contracts into their major components and replace them with more traditional contracts. Another is 
to assume direct government management for selected activities of existing M&O contracts as those 
contracts expire. Under this option, government operations office officials would manage, rather than 
oversee, certain carefully chosen contractor and subcontractor functions that are now managed by the 
M&O contractor.
<p>
The Secretary of Energy is well aware of the weaknesses in the contracting system she has inherited. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on May 26, 1993, she summarized her 
concerns and announced a series of initiatives to improve DOE contract management.(6) Included was 
the formation of a contract reform team to perform a top-to-bottom review of DOE's contracting 
mechanisms and practices. The team is tasked to present a report to the Secretary by December 31, 1993, 
containing recommendations to improve accountability, stimulate competition, and simplify 
administration.
<p>
The Secretary is also applying quality management to the Department and its  contractors. In an effort to 
do more, do it better, and use fewer resources, the Secretary is developing a comprehensive strategy that 
deals with all aspects of science and technology. Current management practices are being improved to 
enhance accountability and reponsiveness to national needs. As part of a strategic planning process, a 
new and effective system is being developed with specific performance criteria, objectives, and 
performance metrics to make results-oriented evaluation and budgeting a reality.
<p>
In the National Performance Review Accompanying Report on budget issues, it is recommended that 
managers should have the flexibility to spend their available dollars in a manner that will most 
effectively achieve the agency's mission. Managers should consider both government employees and 
contractor personnel within their personnel ceilings and should select the most appropriate and cost-
effective combination. Long-range financial plans and sound accounting systems must first be in place 
before the government makes the transition to this approach. Assuming support for this approach, DOE 
program managers and operations officials should consider the mix of contractor and government 
personnel at laboratories and weapons production centers and recommend changes to optimize the use of 
available funding.
<p>
<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. DOE program managers should increase the use of performance objectives and goal-based budgeting 
when establishing funding levels for programs and projects.
<p>
DOE should provide contractors with performance-based contracts containing clear, specific directions, 
incentives, and measures to test performance and compliance. Performance criteria should be crafted for 
each mission area to capture its unique features. DOE program managers and Department of Defense 
officials should jointly define tests for performance of defense activities. Environmental cleanup 
activities should be measured against   predetermined definitions of acceptable outcomes.
<p>
<p>
2. DOE program managers should promote better coordination and more active competition at and 
among facilities.
<p>
Program officials should be encouraged to rely less on sole-source arrangements with DOE labs and to 
solicit bids on projects from all government facilities and the private sector. This should be done in 
conjunction with a thorough scientific evaluation of proposals using the best elements of peer review.
<p>
<p>
3. DOE should strengthen the authority of government field managers and hold them accountable.
<p>
Federal field managers should be more active in cost estimating, cost accounting and oversight of core 
contracts, and the management of support functions and non-core activities.
<p>
<p>
4. DOE should test and assess alternatives to the cost reimbursement contract model traditionally used by 
the agency at laboratories and weapons production plants.
<p>
Since DOE's facilities and their missions are varied, a number of different contracting mechanisms is 
likely to be more appropriate than a single mechanism for all sites. Tests should be conducted at 
individual sites before adopting them more broadly at national laboratories and weapons centers.
<p>
When significant cost savings can be achieved, serious consideration should be given to a structure in 
which on-site federal managers play a more direct role in managing a facility-- for example, managing 
one-time projects and such support functions as security and maintenance of buildings, grounds, and 
roads. Where savings are anticipated from the substitution of government personnel for contractor 
personnel, DOE's appropriation should be reduced by the amount of the savings.
<p>
DOE should also increase the use of competitive, fixed-price contracts, subcontracts, and grants for non-
core activities including discrete environmental cleanup projects, one-time R&D projects, and routine 
installation M&O services.
<p>
<p>
5. DOE should improve the capability of the financial management systems used to accumulate data from 
laboratories and weapons centers to measure, analyze, report, and control spending so that it is uniform, 
accurate, and received rapidly for programs and facilities.
<p>
All contractors and all facilities should be required to report to DOE using a standard financial reporting 
system, except in cases where the cost to implement the system would exceed the benefits. Federal 
program managers should be more active in the management of funds, obligating them for clearly 
defined activities with specified outcomes.
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
The operation of national labs including the advancement of science, research, and development as well 
as normal maintenance and support of buildings, roads, and grounds would be conducted in a more open, 
fair, and objective environment. Enhanced competition among labs and cooperation with industry and 
universities will improve performance while lowering costs.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
Under present conditions, government employees at DOE operations offices oversee contractors who 
manage and operate government-owned laboratories and nuclear weapons production sites. As proposed, 
at selected locations, government employees would become actively involved in, and responsible for, the 
management and operations of the site and for the contracts in effect there. Reconsideration of the mix of 
government and contractor personnel is expected to result in net reductions in personnel, overhead, and 
prime contractor fees for subcontractor activities. Savings will begin to materialize in fiscal 1995.

<h2>DOE04:  Increase Electrical Power Revenues and Study Rates</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The federal government owns and operates major water resource 
management systems comprising nearly 130 dams. The systems control 
river flows, create navigable waterways, provide recreational areas, 
and generate hydroelectric power. The hydroelectric power is sold by 
the Department of Energy (DOE) through organizations known as Power 
Marketing Administrations (PMAs) at below-market rates to public, 
cooperative, and private utility customers. In most cases, PMA power 
supplements the electricity those utilities sell to their customers. 
Utilities in 34 states in the Southeast, Southwest, West, and 
Northwest receive PMA power.
<p>
The Flood Control Act of 1944 provides that PMA electricity should be 
sold "at the lowest possible rates to consumers, consis-tent with 
sound business principles."(1) PMA electricity rates are established 
on an at-cost basis to cover the costs of construction, operation, 
and maintenance of the hydroelectric facilities. However, assigned 
interest rates for repayment of the federal monies used to build 
these dams and facilities are generally well below the Treasury's 
cost of money. Also, the PMAs' hydroelectric power is cheaper because 
it is renewable energy that does not require the purchase of fuel to 
generate electricity. Even though most PMAs' power is provided to 
utilities at below-market rates, the U.S. Treasury receives nearly 
$3.4 billion annually from the sale of PMA electricity. There are two 
opportunities for the federal government to increase its revenues 
through the sale of PMA hydroelectric power.
<p>
The first opportunity for increasing revenues would not increase PMA 
charges to their utility customers. Currently, a number of power 
utilities offer their consumers energy conservation and efficiency 
programs called Demand Side Management (DSM). Considerable energy 
savings can be obtained if the utilities' DSM programs are promoted 
well and offer strong incentives to consumers to participate. The 
programs can be win-win situations because they reduce consumers' 
electricity bills, reduce fuel consumption, minimize environmental 
degradation, stimulate growth in industries that produce energy-
efficient technologies, and lessen the demand for electricity that 
might otherwise force utilities to build costly new power generators.
<p>
Utilities that purchase and distribute PMA power can be given 
incentives to expand their current energy conservation programs or 
develop new ones. If a utility increases or initiates a new 
conservation program, the energy savings could be shared between the 
utility and the PMA. For example, if PMAs agreed to permit their 
utility customers to sell the energy saved to other utilities at 
market rates, the proceeds from such sales could then be shared 
between the utility and the U.S. Treasury. The increase in revenue 
could be substantial.
<p>
A second opportunity for increasing government revenues may entail 
slight increases in rates PMAs charge their customers. In recent 
years, these rates have not kept pace with the government's costs of 
financing the construction of the dam systems. Since the first 
federal hydroelectric projects were built, the Treasury's cost (its 
long-term interest rates) has increased, while interest rates on PMA 
hydroelectric projects and many project improvements have been kept 
artificially low at 1930 and 1940 levels. As Treasury long-term 
interest rates increased in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, they 
exceeded the interest rates that PMAs elected to pay on project 
debts. The resulting differential created federal subsidies for these 
projects.
<p>
Since the 1950s, PMAs have been allowed to pay interest rates on new 
debts that are considerably below the govern-ment's cost of borrowing 
money. According to an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) study on 
PMA debt repayment, the Treasury has made a practice of borrowing 
money for the PMAs at 6 to 12 percent and accepting repayments on 
that debt at 2 to 4 percent.(2) This process, which continues today, 
results in an estimated revenue loss of over $360 million annually 
and an estimated $12.5 billion loss over the life of the PMA loans. 
This is inconsistent with the application of sound business 
principles required by the Flood Control Act. The revenue loss 
amounts to a taxpayer subsidy for those fortunate enough to live in 
PMA regions and receive PMA power through their local utility.
<p>
According to OMB, if the PMA rates were increased to cover the total 
cost of financing, the one-time rate increase to retail consumers 
would vary between 1 and 7 percent, depending primarily on the amount 
of power each utility purchases from a PMA in relation to the 
utility's total power output.(3) Utilities that receive only a small 
portion of their power from their regional PMA would pass on only a 
slight increase in rates. Utilities that receive a significant 
portion of their power from a PMA would pass on a more noticeable 
increase in monthly electricity bills. It is estimated that the 
average consumer receiving PMA power would experience a rate increase 
of about 5 percent--or an additional estimated $3.13 per month for a 
typical bill.(4) Even after this increase, utilities receiving PMA 
power would still be providing the cheapest electricity in the 
country.
<p>
While the interest rates for a few loans are determined by 
legislation, the interest rates on the debt for most PMAs is 
established by DOE. Thus, the decision to recover the full costs of 
government financing is a policy decision that can be made 
administratively by the Secretary.
<p>
Restructuring of debt may be examined as an alternative to rate 
revision and represents another opportunity for increasing federal 
revenues by allowing PMAs to refinance, for additional consideration, 
the present value of the current expected debt payments. Public and 
private sources of funds, terms and conditions of loans including 
interest rates and duration, and the remaining useful life of the 
assets subject to refinancing should be carefully considered. Options 
that minimize customer rate increases should be given priority. In 
assessing rate reform and debt restructuring alternatives, both the 
short- and long-term macroeconomic impacts on the region should be 
carefully analyzed.
<p>
Finally, the federal government is hampered by legislation that 
restricts its ability to oversee electrical power issues. Currently, 
the government cannot study the effect of applying market rates to 
the sale of PMA power. Some contend that studying market-based rates 
of electrical power would automatically lead to raising PMA rates to 
market levels. Congress has included a provision in either the Energy 
and Water Development Appropriations Acts or continuing 
appropriations each year since 1982 to prohibit the use of government 
funds for the study of electricity market rates.
<p>
This prohibition from studying market rates could deter DOE from 
developing and implementing programs that can be beneficial. For 
instance, in the energy conservation program discussed above, a DOE 
study of electricity market rates would help deter-mine appropriate 
levels of revenue sharing between PMAs and utilities. There may be 
future instances when programs of potential benefit cannot be 
promulgated because of DOE's inability to collect and analyze needed 
information. This prohibition prevents DOE from carrying out its 
mission and acting in the best interests of the nation as a whole.
<p>
<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. The Secretary should encourage Power Marketing Administrations 
(PMAs) in the Southeast, Southwest, western areas, and Bonneville to 
be more aggressive in promoting energy conservation programs with 
their subscriber utilities.
<p>
These utilities should be permitted to sell PMAs' electric power 
saved under conservation programs to other customers. Sale of the 
saved PMA power should be at market rates. The preferred utilities 
and the Treasury should share in the proceeds from the sale of saved 
PMA power. The opportunity to sell PMA power at market rates should 
be an incentive for utilities to expand or start up new energy 
conservation programs with their customers.
<p>
<p>
2. The Secretary should establish a new rate policy for PMAs in the 
Southeast, Southwest, western areas, and Bonneville.
The new policy should require that PMAs recover full operating costs, 
including differentials in interest rate financing, of each PMA 
hydroelectric facility. Annual repayment rate studies are conducted 
by PMAs and can be used as a basis for analysis by DOE. By 
establishing PMA electrical power rates that cover all operating 
costs, the federal government will eliminate direct taxpayer subsidy 
of PMAs and also take responsible steps toward reducing the federal 
deficit. Debt restructuring may be considered as an alternative to 
rate reform.
<p>
<p>
3. Congress should remove the Energy & Water Development 
Appropriations Act prohibition against expending federal funds to 
conduct studies of market rates or other non-cost-based methods for 
the pricing of hydroelectric power by federal PMAs.
<p>
Any market-based electrical rate studies conducted by DOE should be 
made available to the public. Any market rate studies should apply to 
the southeastern, southwestern, western, and Bonneville PMAs. While 
the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is not a PMA, it is also 
protected under the restrictive legislation. In fairness, TVA should 
not be excluded from the study. The government needs to be able to 
collect and analyze market information that is necessary to carry out 
its mission and act in the best interest of the country as a whole. 
Any such studies should be con-ducted by DOE using available 
resources.
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
The action to implement energy conser-vation programs would be 
beneficial to a broad range of stakeholders. Consumers of PMA power 
would take advantage of energy conservation rebates and incentives 
that would save money on their electrical bills. Utilities purchasing 
the saved energy would obtain additional power to help meet market 
demands. The utilities and the U.S. Treasury would receive additional 
income from the sale of the saved power.
<p>
The action to recover the full cost of PMA power would simply allow 
the federal government to meet all of its expenses while providing 
this service. Electricity bills for some consumers in parts of more 
than 34 states may slightly increase. However, these consumers 
currently pay substantially less for the electricity they consume 
than others who are not fortunate enough to live in areas receiving 
PMA subsidized power.
<p>
The action to allow market rate studies provides DOE with the 
authority it needs to carry out its mission.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
OMB has projected that the sale of saved electrical power at market 
rates could provide, in the first year of the program, a modest $31 
million in additional federal revenues. OMB expects that the program 
would pick up momentum in succeeding years and accrue an estimated 
$75 million, $95 million, $163 million, and $163 million in fiscal 
1996 through 1999 respectively. These are conservative estimates.
<p>
OMB also projected that increasing PMA electrical rates to cover the 
cost differential between Treasury costs when the projects went into 
service and the interest rates the PMAs are applying to their debt 
would increase federal government annual revenues by $60 million, 
$117 million, $117 million, $119 million, $119 million and $119 
million in fiscal 1994 through 1999.
<p>
The debt restructuring alternative may result in the reduction of 
some of the subsidy and recovery of some revenues. Depending on 
financial assumptions used, the increase in annual debt service could 
range from zero to $2.4 billion. The effect on consumers' electricity 
rates may be adjusted by obtaining favorable issuance terms and 
repayment periods for new debt sold on the open market.
<p>
The increase in revenues from these actions is shown in the following 
table.

<H2>DOE06:  Redirect Energy Laboratories to Post-Cold War Priorities</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
For the first time in 50 years, the United States is not engaged in producing or testing nuclear weapons. 
Significant reductions in funding ($1.25 billion in fiscal year 1994) for nuclear weapons-related activities 
have already occurred.(1) Further reductions have recently been made possible by the President's decision 
not to resume testing of nuclear weapons. 
<p>
Department of Energy (DOE) officials must shift their facilities to the post-Cold War environment. This 
means that it will be necessary to take a hard look at the DOE weapons complex, including production 
facilities, testing sites, and laboratories, to determine what is needed in the post-Cold War era and to plan 
for closure or consolidation of excess facilities. They must also take care that a lower level of nuclear 
weapons research, production, and testing activities is used effectively to meet our defense requirements.
<p>
At the same time, DOE's weapons laboratories and production plants represent an investment in world-
class intellectual, research and development (R&D), and computing capability that was cultivated for five 
decades and would be difficult to redevelop. With adequate planning, the laboratories can redirect some 
of their worldclass talents and equipment to partnerships with industry and to meeting non-defense 
government requirements.
<p>
New post-Cold War era projects of national scope and importance that combine public benefits with the 
potential to advance technology, further the growth of knowledge, promote industrial develop-ment, and 
stimulate the creation of productive, high-quality jobs are being discussed. DOE laboratories may be able 
to contribute to these projects because they have special capabilities that are not available elsewhere. 
These include basic and applied research involving large-scale and multidisciplinary problems that would 
be difficult for others to tackle because of their size, complexity, and long-term nature. 
<p>
These same capabilities could be put to use to meet the needs of government agencies other than DOE. In 
some cases, DOE laboratories may be able to meet those needs better than the other agencies' own R&D 
institutions-- perhaps better than any government or private R&D institution. There might be room for 
DOE laboratories to do more work for other government agencies on a competitive basis, in which the 
lab best suited would be awarded the work based on merit. Similarly, within DOE there could be more 
flexibility in the competition among DOE laboratories for DOE research programs.
<p>
Activities to transfer technological knowledge and promote closer partnerships among government 
agencies and between government and industry have received new interest and attention in recent 
months. The national laboratories can help industry use science and technology to become more 
competitive, and technology transfer has been established as a mission at all of them. A number of 
initiatives totaling more than $250 million have been proposed in DOE's fiscal year 1994 budget.(2) Most 
of these funds are for cooperative research and development agreements, which require matching funds 
from private industry and universities.
<p>
To promote a user-friendly, customer-oriented environment in the laboratories, and to achieve successful 
government-industry partnerships, a distinct cultural change will be necessary in headquarters program 
offices and at field facilities by both government officials and the contractors who operate the 
laboratories. Institutional barriers will need to be removed, and some legislative and regulatory actions 
may be necessary.
<p>
Altogether, the redirection of DOE laboratories and other facilities will be an extensive undertaking that 
requires both the establishment of a uniform review of all facilities and actions tailored specifically to 
each site.
<p>
<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. DOE should continue to support the reduction of funding for nuclear weapons production, research, 
testing programs, and infrastructure that are not needed to meet current defense requirements.
<p>

2. The Secretary should develop a vision and mission for the total DOE laboratory complex. The 
Secretary should then review the mission and facilities of DOE laboratories, weapons production 
facilities, and testing sites and recommend the phased consolidation or closure of obsolete or redundant 
facilities.
<p>
The recommendations should be developed in consultation with the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, the National Science Technology Council (proposed by NPR), the Secretary of Defense, and other 
appropriate federal offices. Facilities to be retained should be targeted for refurbishment as may be 
necessary. Functional facilities and equipment no longer needed by DOE or other federal agencies should 
be sold or leased, with the proceeds used to offset capital improvements within the DOE complex.
<p>

3. The Secretary should convene a group to design and implement mechanisms for identifying 
intellectual assets, test facilities, and research capabilities at national labs that can be useful to other 
government agencies.
<p>
These mechanisms would promote development of joint R&D projects within government and improve 
efficiency, consistency, and responsiveness.
<p>

4. Once DOE has established a fair "pricing" process, it should encourage laboratory managers to bid on 
federal contracts and to apply for government grants that could utilize their unique technical capabilities 
without competing directly with the existing capabilities of private industry.
<p>
They should be encouraged to seek appropriate projects from program offices throughout government to 
optimize the use of local people and facilities.
<p>

5. Laboratory managers should also be encouraged to work more closely with the private sector on high-
priority R&D needs and to bid for contract or cooperative work on such projects.
<p>
The laboratories should be able to work on the projects either alone or in consortia with other 
laboratories, the private sector, and universities where such cooperative arrangements foster unique 
blends of talent and resources. In bids for contract work for others, overhead costs of these laboratory 
activities must be fully recovered to ensure that DOE laboratories do not have an unfair competitive 
advantage. However, managers should have discretion concerning cost allocation and pricing comparable 
to that available to managers in private businesses in transition. Unnecessary legislative and regulatory 
impediments that inhibit collabora-tion between the national labs and industry and universities should be 
identified and removed.
<p>

6. DOE, the contractors who manage the laboratories, and laboratory managers should work to make 
access to the laboratories' resources more accessible to the private sector, removing unnecessary layers of 
approval for cooperative R&D agreements and contract work-for-others, and taking other steps to 
simplify and speed up the process.
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Cost savings would result from program reductions as well as the closure of obsolete or redundant 
facilities and the sale or lease of excess functional equipment and facilities. DOE is not currently allowed 
to use the proceeds from the sale or lease of excess facilities and equipment to offset its continuing 
capital improvement needs. Authorizing legislation is required.
<p>
Taxpayer return on investment in DOE's scientific and technical facilities would be improved by making 
effective, efficient use of national laboratory facilities to meet evolving national needs in areas such as 
fundamental science, industrial technology, and environmental protection, as well as the changing 
requirements for national security.
<p>
The nation's ability to address its most critical technological challenges would benefit substantially. 
Increased use of cooperative partnerships and transactions with industry and universities would improve 
the connections between laboratory research, education, and the marketplace.
Disruption to DOE laboratory work forces and local communities due to defense program cutbacks would 
be minimized.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
Significant reductions in funding for research, development, testing, and production of nuclear weapons 
are already included in current baseline budgets. Additional reductions should be considered for the years 
after fiscal 1994 based on these recommendations.
<p>
The sale or lease of excess facilities and equipment could average $20 million per year from 1995 
through 1998.

<H2>DOE07:  Save Costs Through Private Power Cogeneration</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
Private sector construction of needed new power plants at government installations represents a cost 
savings opportunity to the federal government. The Department of Energy (DOE) owns and operates 
under contract approximately 100 steam plants at production centers and national laboratory sites around 
the country. Most of the plants have been in operation for 40 years or more and are at or beyond the 
limits of their design lives. Many need either refurbishing or complete rebuilding. New state-of-the-art 
gas fired cogeneration generators can operate at up to 80 percent energy efficiency (producing both steam 
and electricity in the same operation) while the average, electricity-only generators operate at about 33 
percent efficiency.(1) Refur- bishing older electricity generators to improve performance or capacity or to 
burn alternative fuels can improve energy efficiency from 5 to 10 percent.(2) Older plants use less 
efficient technologies, which are more harmful to the environment and more expensive to operate than 
new state-of-the-art facilities.
<p>
In the near term, DOE must either expend considerable funds to refurbish or rebuild these steam plants or 
provide incentives to utilities and independent power producers in the electrical power industry (power 
providers) to build and operate new plants for DOE. Many power providers are eager to construct and 
operate new cogeneration plants (producing both electricity and steam) at government installations at no 
cost to the government. Such projects offer profit-making opportunities for the power providers while 
providing both short-term and long-term savings for the government.
<p>
Under this arrangement, DOE would avoid the costs of refurbishing or rebuilding the existing facility. In 
addition, DOE would receive a cost savings of 10 to 25 percent on future steam and electricity bills, 
depending on fuel and other factors at each installation. In return for these services, the power provider 
would:
<p>
--- own and operate the facility for up to 25 years; 
<p>
--- contract with the government facility to supply power and steam at lower rates than currently paid by 
the facility; and 
<p>
--- sell any excess power to local utilities. 
<p>
The incentives of a long-term govern-ment contract and the opportunity to sell excess power off-site 
make such cogeneration projects potential profit-making ventures for the power providers.
<p>
Power providers seek these opportunities because they are guaranteed a steady government customer for 
a long period of time and because the permit process to replace an old plant is less cumbersome than the 
permit process to build a new stand-alone facility elsewhere.
<p>
The obstacle to securing such private sector initiatives is a provision in the 1986 Shared Energy Savings 
amendment to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA).(3) While the amendment 
provides the only government long-term contract authority (up to 25 years) at non-military government 
installations, one provision restricts power plants at those installations from selling excess electrical 
power off-site. However, it is the sale of excess capacity off-site that, in many cases, makes the venture 
economically viable for power providers. The restrictive legislation effectively prevents the private sector 
and the government from entering into such ventures. No new power plants using private sector 
investment have been built at non-military government installations since this restrictive legislation was 
enacted.
<p>
If NECPA is amended to remove the restriction, the government would have the potential opportunity to 
obtain new power plants at no cost and pay reduced utility bills. A DOE initial analysis of six aging 
government steam plants reveals the following potential savings in avoided construction costs: (1) if all 
six plants were refurbished--at the lowest expenditure level--the minimum estimated obligation for DOE 
would be $183 million; and (2) if all six were rebuilt--the maximum expenditure--the total estimated 
obligation would be $735 million. Because of the age of the existing facilities, an expenditure somewhere 
between these two figures must be obligated within the next 10 years by the federal government. If the 
plants were built by power providers, that cost could be avoided.
<p>
Because the new power and steam is produced with high-efficient generators, the utility costs for the new 
power, spread out over 25 or 30 years, represents a consider-able savings in electricity and steam costs. 
DOE estimates the long-term utility savings at the six sites would be approximately $1 billion. DOE 
believes that similar savings potential is available at 11 other government installations that can be 
considered as potential sites for private sector investment in cogenerated power.
<p>
The window of opportunity for one site may have passed. DOE's Savannah River Site (SRS) production 
facility is powered by a 37-megawatt electrical and steam power plant. The plant has high operating and 
maintenance costs and is operating beyond its 50-year design life. Refurbishment or rebuilding is needed 
now. In 1991, the local regulated utility proposed construction of a larger power plant at the site at no 
cost to the government. The utility would also have provided substantial discounts in electricity and 
steam costs for 20 years. However, because DOE could not allow the utility to sell excess power off-site, 
the utility withdrew its offer and has constructed a new plant elsewhere to meet its demand. It is 
estimated that the SRS project would have saved $72 million in refurbishment costs (which are now 
included in the fiscal 1995 budget) and utility costs totaling more than $200 million over 20 years. While 
another power provider may want to pursue such a cogeneration facility at SRS, such an opportunity may 
be lost because the demand for off-site power should be met by the utility's new power plant.
<p>
In a similar situation, DOE's Richland Field Office received an unsolicited proposal from a private 
developer to build a power plant at the government's Hanford Reservation in Washington State. The 
proposal has the potential for saving as much as $50 million in refurbishment costs in the short term 
(including $11 million expended on partial refurbishment in fiscal year 1992) and at least $360 million in 
energy bills over a proposed 30-year contract period. At present, the Richland Field Office has issued a 
request for proposals to construct a facility that would power only the Hanford Reservation and not sell 
excess power off-site. If bidding is unsuccessful, the $50 million refurbishment will have to be obligated 
at least by fiscal year 1998. If the restrictive legislation is removed, a contract more beneficial to both the 
government and the private sector could be negotiated.
<p>
The restrictive language in the shared energy savings provisions does not apply to military bases. 
Consequently, power providers are generating electrical power on at least nine military bases and selling 
that power to those installations and to their local utilities. The arrangement at the China Lake Naval 
Base in California is lucrative (i.e., the contract generates approximately $3.5 million annual savings for 
the Navy). The savings will increase steadily to approximately $10 million annually after 10 years. 
Although specific savings will depend on site-specific negotiations, the China Lake facility represents an 
example of further cost savings that might be negotiated through the shared energy savings program.
<p>
There is no logical reason to preclude the federal government from pursuing shared energy savings 
opportunities with the private sector. When the restriction was implemented, there was a general surplus 
of electrical power in the United States. However, there is now a shortage of electrical power in several 
sections of the country, and local and regional utilities are purchasing increasing quantities of power from 
privately constructed power plants.
<p>
<p>
<b>Action</b>
<p>
Legislation should be enacted to amend section 804(2)(B) of Title VIII, the Shared Energy Savings 
amendment of NECPA, to remove the restriction that limits the sale or use of cogenerated electricity to 
federally owned facilities.
<p>
If this restriction is removed, power providers would have an incentive to build and operate cogeneration 
power plants at no expense to the government at DOE and other non-military government installations. 
DOE would have the option of refurbishing or rebuilding with government funds or avoiding such 
construction costs by contracting with power providers. Removal of the restriction would not require that 
such work be undertaken through private sector initiatives. Rather, it would provide the government and 
the electrical power industry with the alternative to work together for the benefit of the government, the 
industry, and the taxpayer.
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
On a case-by-case basis, the government would have the option of avoiding the cost of renovating old 
and constructing new steam plants. The government would receive new plants at no cost. In addition, the 
government's costs for power and steam generated by new, energy-efficient cogeneration technologies 
would be substantially less than the amount currently paid for steam and electricity used by the facilities. 
Cogenerated power would help meet the demand for electrical power in many utility service areas. 
Finally, new state-of-the-art cogeneration plants are also less damaging to the environment because they 
use new generating technologies.
<p>
Shared energy savings contracts include provisional commitments from the government to purchase 
designated amounts of steam and electricity over the 25-year life of the contract. Because government 
policy could change the use of installations (expand, reduce, or close), there may be instances when the 
power needs of the installation might change. Thus, a contingency clause should be negotiated in shared 
energy savings contracts to account for possible changes in power needs and reduce taxpayer liabilities.
<p>
Within the U.S. electrical power industry, utilities generally supported the restrictive legislation in 1986 
when there was little or no demand for additional electrical power. However, many utilities now need 
additional power generated by independent power producers and would support removal of the restriction 
because it provides them with increased market opportunities and stimulates industry growth.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The cost to refurbish a facility can be as much as $50 million. New plant construction, depending on the 
size, is estimated at over $100 million. Whether and when a refurbishment or replacement is conducted 
depends on the condition of each existing steam plant and the power demand situation for the local 
utilities surrounding each installation. The generator at Savannah River is scheduled to be refurbished at 
a cost of $72 million. If it can be replaced by 1996 with a privately funded facility, the costs of 
refurbishment can be avoided and its annual costs of power will be reduced. Refurbish-ment of the 
Hanford Reservation generator is not totally obligated at present but must be upgraded before fiscal 1998. 
These represent over $120 million in direct costs to the federal government that could be saved through 
shared energy savings contracts for cogeneration facilities.
<p>
Indirect savings from reduced electricity and steam utility bills at these two facilities (over 25- to 30-year 
contract periods) can be roughly estimated at $550 million.

<H2>DOE08:  Support the Sale of the Alaska Power Administration</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The federal government markets power from its 129 hydroelectric projects throughout the United States 
through five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). These multipurpose projects are constructed and 
owned by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
They operate the projects for flood control, navigation, irrigation, and more recently, for recreational 
purposes. They also generate 45 percent of the nation's hydroelectric power as a by-product. This power 
is sold by the PMAs to local public, private, and cooperative utilities at cost. Supplemental power from 
these projects is provided to all but 16 states.
<p>
Unique among PMAs, the Alaska Power Administration (APA) owns, operates, and maintains two 
hydroelectric projects, Eklutna and Snettisham. Not only are these two projects confined to local Alaska 
markets, but, unlike the other PMAs, the APA's single-purpose projects are not the result of a water 
resource management plan, nor are they intended to remain indefinitely under federal government 
control.(1) Instead, they were created to encourage and promote economic development and to foster the 
establishment of essential industries in Alaska. To carry out their mission, they provide and encourage 
widespread use of hydroelectric power at the lowest possible rates, consistent with sound business 
principles.(2) It was for these purposes, rather than flood control, navigation, irrigation, and recreation, 
that the 30 megawatt (MW) Eklutna project was built in 1955 to serve the Anchorage and Matanuska 
Valley areas, and the 78 MW Snettisham project was constructed in 1975 to serve Juneau.
<p>
To date, the two projects have served their original purposes well.(3) Findings indicate that not only have 
they provided widespread, relatively low-cost, long-term supplies of renewable energy to the areas served 
and recovered the federal costs as intended in the authorizing legislation, but economic and industrial 
development has occurred to the point where their role in Alaska as major providers of electric power has 
greatly diminished. Together, these projects provide only about 8 percent of the total energy requirements 
of Alaska's electric utilities. Individually, the Eklutna project provides about 5 percent of the power needs 
in its market area, and Snettisham provides 80 percent of Juneau's power requirements.(4)
<p>
These findings indicate that the time has come for the federal government's divestiture of these projects, 
since the goals, as originally intended, have been met. It is no longer necessary for the federal 
government to operate a small separate power program in Alaska because:
<p>
--- the projects fill a small market niche; 
<p>
--- economic and industrial development of the regions served has evolved as planned; 
<p>
--- other providers have emerged that can serve the region's needs; and 
<p>
--- the state and local electric utilities are poised to manage the projects in a manner consistent with 
Alaska's future energy and development needs. 
<p>
It is against this backdrop that divestiture of APA projects must be reviewed.(5)
<p>
Although informal discussions of divestiture date back many years, it was not until 1986 that the formal 
proposal first appeared in the budget. Subsequent to this, a public comment process resulted in invitations 
of proposals to purchase the projects being extended in the spring of 1987 to electric utilities served by 
APA projects. In response to solicitations requests, the Alaska Energy Authority proposed to purchase the 
Snettisham Project, while three utilities, the City of Anchorage, the Matanuska Electric Association, and 
the Chugach Electric Association, submitted a joint proposal to purchase Eklutna. Finding both 
prospective purchasers well-qualified to own, operate, and maintain the projects, APA moved forward to 
draft purchase agreements.
<p>
APA and the proposing parties negotiated the purchase agreements, which set forth the terms, conditions, 
and responsibilities of each party for the orderly sale and transfer of the projects. The final agreements, 
signed in 1989, have been amended twice to extend the purchase deadline to February 1995. They reflect 
great care and deliberation to incorporate and address, to the extent possible, all views and concerns of 
interested parties to ensure a balance between federal taxpayers, federal agencies affected, state and local 
utilities, and retail customers. As a result, the divestiture proposal has widespread support.
<p>
Since the initiation of the proposal, the Alaska congressional delegation, three governors, local officials, 
the utilities, DOE, OMB, and the House Appropriations Committee have supported the divestiture 
proposal.(6) The only matter pending for the purchase agreements to take effect is for authorizing 
legislation to be enacted similar to H.R. 5516, which was introduced but not considered by the 102nd 
Congress. Current plans call for a similar bill to be presented to Congress this summer. Failure to pass the 
bill will result in the status quo and perpetuate the current administratively inefficient federal operation of 
these two projects.
<p>
<p>
<b>Action</b>
<p>
Legislation should be enacted that is the same as, or similar to, H.R. 5516 from the 102nd Congress 
authorizing the sale of the two Alaska Power Administration projects in accordance with the previously 
negotiated purchase agreements.
<p>
The sale of the APA assets will result in the transfer of approximately $80 million to the U.S. Treasury. 
This amount represents about 95 percent of the present value of the interest and principal payments the 
government would receive under continued federal ownership. The government would no longer be 
responsible for staffing and for funding the operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement costs of the 
two projects and would avoid potential future claims and liabilities, such as the 1964 earthquake damage 
to Eklutna.(7)
<p>
<p>
<b>Implications</b>
<p>
The public process leading to the purchase agreements has been conducted in a manner that ensured that 
the views of all interested parties were heard and, to the extent possible, accommodated and reflected in 
the current purchase agreements. Nevertheless, the General Accounting Office (GAO), some members of 
Congress, and public power interests may raise concerns once the legislation is re-introduced.
<p>
GAO's objections center around the fact that the sale price is negotiated rather than market-based. While 
a market-based price  would certainly result in an increase in the asking price, it would do so at the 
expense of Alaska ratepayers and stakeholders and raise objections from members of Congress who 
consistently argue that the government should not make a profit from the sale of such government 
property.(8) In objecting to market rate studies of PMA electrical power, Congress has indicated that 
these public facilities should provide services at the lowest possible cost to consumers consistent with 
sound business principles; selling at market price would defeat this purpose. Rates charged to consumers 
would increase substantially to enable the buyers to recover the market-based selling price.(9)
<p>
Some public power interests are concerned that the APA sale will establish a precedent and lead to the 
sale of other PMA assets. This concern is unfounded since APA's unique situation cannot be considered 
as setting a precedent for other PMAs. Instead, divestiture of APA should be viewed as a unique situation 
that supports the concept of identifying unique circumstances where divestiture is beneficial to both the 
federal and state governments and affected local sectors. Another concern of the public power interests is 
that public utilities and cooperatives be given preference in any such sale of PMA assets. In the case of 
APA, the purchasers are either public power utilities or rural electric cooperatives, all of which have a 
history of effectively serving the regions of APA projects.
<p>
While mild opposition to the sale has been voiced by different stakeholders, the current terms and 
conditions are expected to be approved by Congress. On the whole, there should be minimal opposition 
to the sale and transfer of these projects. By all measures, it is time to divest. Studies indicate that state 
and local power utilities can operate and maintain the projects and align their management in a manner 
consistent with Alaska's energy needs and future growth requirements.
<p>
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The federal government will be relieved of the responsibility of owning and operating two small isolated 
hydroelectric projects in Alaska and of any liabilities for future maintenance, equipment replacement, 
and claims. Equally important, proceeds from the sale will recover nearly 95 percent of the present value 
of the original federal investment in APA projects and prescribed interest (estimated between $73.5 and 
$80.3 million, depending on certain conditions when the sale is approved), and forgone annual revenues 
of approximately $10 million will be nearly offset by the avoidance of annual expenditures averaging $4 
million for management and operations and $6 million in principal and interest on the outstanding debt 
on these two projects.
<p>
In designing a break-even or cost-recovery sale of these two projects, the federal government meets two 
goals: first, it furthers the taxpayers' interests by recovering nearly all of the original investment, and 
second, it addresses the consumers' concerns that hydroelectric power continue to be provided without a 
significant increase in rates.
<p>
<p>
The fiscal impact of the sale of these two projects will be as shown in the following table.

<p>
<h2>Agency Reinvention Activities</h2>
<p>
Secretary Hazel O'Leary came to office January 22, 1993, bringing to the Department of Energy (DOE) 
extensive private-sector experience in market dynamics and quality management. She has placed strong 
emphasis on results, strategic planning, work force empowerment, and customer satisfaction. In response 
to the administration's commitment to change, Secretary O'Leary leads as an active participant in the 
reinvention activities of the National Performance Review (NPR).
<p>
<p>
<b>Getting Started and Motivating Participation</b>
<p>
In a Town Hall meeting at DOE headquarters, broadcast live via satellite to 40 DOE sites nationwide, 
Vice President Gore stated that DOE "has been leading the way" in efforts to make the federal 
government more efficient and effective in the way it does business.
<p>
In February, as part of her emphasis on improving the department, Secretary O'Leary established 15 
teams, called Priorities Teams, to take a hard look at the critical issues that are important to the future of 
the department. The teams, which include members from across the department, are addressing 
management, process, and technical policy issues. These teams will report their progress to the Secretary 
in September.
<p>
On March 4, 1993, Secretary O'Leary announced a new organizational structure for DOE geared to 
achieve the administra-tion's energy, environmental, and economic objectives for a changing world. The 
new focus is on developing clean energy sources to meet the needs of the economy while protecting the 
environment, transferring technologies from laboratories to the private sector to enhance U.S. 
competitiveness, and cleaning up former weapons production facilities to protect public health and safety. 
"Our goal," the Secretary said, "is to carry out our piece of the promise President Clinton brought with 
him into office: to reinvent government to make it responsible, accountable, and cost-effective and to put 
the public's interest first."
<p>
On May 10, in a departmentwide Town Hall meeting, Secretary O'Leary shared her vision on how quality 
management and a quality culture would be used throughout the department to achieve DOE's new 
priorities.
<p>
Secretary O'Leary headed a class of 60 department executives, including laboratory directors, all field 
operations managers, and key program managers at a July 8-10 training session. The objective of the 
training program was to begin the process of building a DOE management and leadership team dedicated 
to meeting the expectations of their stakeholders and customers by providing quality products and 
services in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. The overall goal was to develop a plan for 
reinventing DOE enterprise by applying key quality management principles.
<p>
Evolving from teamwork and town meetings, the elements of a strategic planning process for the 
Department that addresses long-term as well as short-term needs were formulated. The long-term strategy 
includes two key groups that will lead the depart-ment into the future: the Leadership Group and the 
Quality Council.
<p>
The Secretary chairs the Leadership Group. Senior managers from throughout DOE are members of the 
group. The Leadership Group was formed to promote implementation of quality management in the 
department. Specific responsibilities include:
<p>
--- promoting the department's strategic direction; 
<p>
--- committing required resources to the process of quality improvement, customer satisfaction, and work 
force empowerment; 
<p>
--- establishing policy to support quality and process improvement initiatives; 
<p>
--- overseeing the activities of the Quality Council by evaluating, recommending, approving, and 
implementing proposals; 
<p>
--- supporting the development of departmentwide performance measures; 
<p>
--- modeling the department's core values in all aspects of work; and 
<p>
--- coordinating implementation of the NPR and DOE team activities. 
<p>
The Quality Council is a diverse group of 27 employees selected from all levels and organizations in the 
department. Its objective is to design and develop the department's quality implementation plan. In this 
capacity, the Quality Council will provide advisory support and coordination for all quality activities in 
the department.
<p>
A direct result of this introspective evaluation and strategic planning is a substantial change to the 
department's organizational structure. The new structure, adopted June 10, 1993, is designed to 
emphasize the new focus of the department. The organization will meet the new challenges set forth by 
President Clinton by stressing energy security, sustaining the environment, and boosting economic 
growth. The department is now organized in functional clusters that include energy programs, science 
and technology programs, and weapons and waste cleanup programs.
<p>
<p>
<b>Reinvention Laboratories</b>
<p>
<p>
Secretary O'Leary's request for candidate reinvention laboratories received enthusiastic response. Among 
many candidates, the six programs described below are at the fore-front. Others are planned for 
development after September 7, 1993. The labs are ongoing projects to improve program and 
management operations using reinventing government principles.
<p>
Reinventing the Federal, State, and Local Partnerships. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy (EE) is sponsoring this DOE reinvention lab. The mission of this pilot project is to broaden DOE's 
network of external stakeholders, to increase understanding of EE's capabilities and goals, and to invent 
better partnerships. Three specific activities are the focus of this reinvention lab:
<p>
--- involve stakeholders earlier and more completely in strategic, multiyear, annual operating and budget 
planning; 
<p>
--- invent more effective and flexible ways to implement state and local provisions of the Energy Policy 
Act of 1992; and 
<p>
--- build stronger public and private collaborations to deploy new energy efficiency and renewable energy 
technologies in the marketplace. 
<p>
The lab will employ a two-step strategy to open dialogue with its customers on how partnerships should 
be reinvented. The first step was the creation of an ad hoc Core Stakeholders Committee to serve as a 
gateway to a larger universe of customers. The committee includes representatives of DOE, plus senior 
managers representing 16 stakeholders organizations.
<p>
The committee first met July 27-28, 1993, at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, 
Colorado, to develop three products:
<p>
--- a list of changes that EE and the stakeholder group must make to improve their partnerships; 
<p>
--- ideas and mechanisms that stakeholders and EE should pursue for future partnerships; and 
<p>
--- performance measures that EE and its customers will use to determine whether the reinvention lab has 
succeeded. 
<p>
The Reinvention Lab on Federal, State, and Local Partnership is designed to foster a frank and open 
dialogue between EE and its stakeholders. It also should broaden EE's list of stakeholders in order to 
explore new partnerships for technology deployment.
<p>
EE anticipates that the outcome of the two-step process will be a candid and thoughtful list of 
recommendations on the cultural and procedural changes needed in the department to deal with state and 
local governments, industry, and private organizations more effectively, and, in partnership with them, to 
more effectively execute DOE's programs.
<p>
National Clean Industry Initiative. U.S. industry generates nearly 11 billion metric tons of waste each 
year -- roughly one ton of waste each week for every U.S. citizen. One estimate indicates that U.S. 
industries produce approximately five times more waste per dollar of goods sold than Japanese 
companies and more than twice as much as German companies. Not only does this waste pose a 
significant environmental threat, it also represents a costly drain on our economy and our natural 
resources. It signals the inefficient use of energy and materials and inefficiencies that contribute to our 
rapidly eroding ability to compete internationally. In addition, it signals inefficiencies that may 
eventually shut out some international markets: the European Commission recently identified green 
product standards as one of the fastest-growing kinds of non-tariff trade barriers. As the world's 
population and output continue to grow, so will the economic opportunities associated with developing 
clean, efficient technologies and industries.
<p>
Against this backdrop, the United States is in the process of increasing the general productivity and 
competitiveness of its industrial base. The administration has recently announced an aggressive 
technology policy to accomplish this. Several bills have been introduced that are designed to increase the 
competitiveness of U.S. industry, expanding on the core capabilities and assets of various federal 
agencies, including DOE. Environmental considerations and environmentally conscious manufacturing 
are integral to the administration's plan and the proposed legislation.
<p>
Realizing the specific goal of clean industry will require leadership that stresses integrated policies, 
strategies, and plans that recognize the crosscutting, multidimensional nature of this objective. The core 
capabilities exist in many agencies, most notably DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the 
Department of Commerce. These resources must be pooled and directed in a way that provides seamless, 
transparent services and support to U.S. industry, the ultimate end users. Additionally, the problem is not 
just one of technology; it is one of market incentives, regulations, the business environment, public 
attitudes and values, corporate mind set, international markets, trade barriers, educational and skill levels 
in the work force, technical assistance, finance, and communication. These are all areas where the federal 
government can and must exert major positive influence. This influence must be coordinated and 
managed as a single system under guiding national environmental and economic principles and policies. 
The need for a National Clean Technology Initiative is compelling. It pulls together the pieces under a 
guiding framework and synthesizes the combined efforts of the major stakeholders.
<p>
One of the three major goals of the current administration's technology policy is to promote long-term 
economic growth that creates jobs and protects the environment. A National Clean Industry Initiative that 
integrates and expands existing federal and state efforts would provide this kind of stimulus. By 
accelerating the development of innovative clean manufacturing technologies and processes, DOE can 
make U.S. industry more competitive, encourage U.S. leadership in a new generation of green 
commercial products, and reduce the impact of economic growth and human consumption on 
environment.
<p>
Reinventing Government at Hanford Reservation. The end of the Cold War has allowed the Hanford 
Reservation (near Richland, Washington) to move from a defense weapons production site to an 
environmental cleanup site. In addition, it is changing from a closed and secretive government 
organization to an open and interactive partnership between government, industry, and community, 
focused initially on cleanup and ultimately on economic viability.
<p>
The Hanford reinvention lab has concentrated initially on two key activities. One is the peeling back of 
the multiple layers of defense security built up during 45 years of weapons production. The second is the 
creation of an economic trade environment at Hanford, encouraging entrepreneurs and the private sector 
to use the laboratories and site operations to develop new technologies.
<p>
The reinvention approach to economic transition at Hanford is community-based, not government-based. 
Hanford has joined the existing local and regional economic development entities and sets policies jointly 
with outside partnerships. A Northwest Economic Cabinet was formed among DOE's Richland 
Operations Office and the directors of trade and commerce from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho state 
governments. The cabinet will develop broad economic issues and coordinate specific business 
opportunities as the site changes from a government to a private facility.
<p>
To date, the economic transition activities have saved over $22 million and created new private sector 
jobs in the local community. Cleanup milestones have been accelerated and inactive DOE facilities have 
been put back into economic use. The government has been proactively supporting local economic 
diversification while conducting its own cleanup business.
<p>
Real-Time Access to Oil and Gas Information. The Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) Office 
of Oil and Gas is seeking new avenues to make oil and gas data and information more readily available to 
a broader constituency. Early efforts will concentrate on developing an interagency cooperative program 
with the Department of Commerce (DOC) to use its Economic Bulletin Board and Internet link. (This 
approach will enable DOE to use an existing network at minimal cost. It represents a synergistic link 
between energy information being provided by EIA and economic data provided by DOC.)
<p>
The real-time access to oil and gas information system will provide weekly, monthly, and annual oil and 
gas information and will be updated as appropriate. It will be available to the 10 million members of the 
worldwide Internet community as well as the 35,000 monthly users of the bulletin board. Currently, the 
data are not integrated into a single information system.
<p>
The information system comprises approximately 100 documents that detail the domestic petroleum and 
natural gas industries, including reserves and extraction from the ground, importation, ultimate 
consumption, and exportation. The reinvention experiment is scheduled to start in September. Two 
important advances reflected in this system are: (1) it presents an integrated representation of domestic 
oil and gas; and (2) it is available electronically, in machine-readable form, rather than on paper.
<p>
As part of the reinvention lab experiment, the Office of Oil and Gas plans to carry out user response and 
marketing surveys to determine the extent of use, characteristics of the user community, and success of 
the information system in meeting the user's needs and requirements. The customer base includes state 
and local governments, congressional offices, other federal agencies, industry and economic planners, 
consultants, academics, and other members of the public who need rapid access to information in 
electronic format.
<p>
Declassification of Information. DOE and its predecessor agencies have a long history of classifying 
nuclear weapons-related information for valid national security reasons such as minimizing nuclear 
proliferation. Withholding classified information from potential nuclear proliferants inevitably withheld it 
from the public. Beginning in World War II and throughout the Cold War period that followed, tens of 
millions of documents were classified in support of the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
<p>
Today, as a result of the dramatic changes over the last few years in the international arena, much 
information in classified documents no longer warrants classification and could be released to the public. 
Additionally, unclassified information is often intermin-gled with nuclear weapon technology that is still 
very sensitive. For example, a document may contain unclassified information relevant to environmental, 
safety, and health concerns yet still contain legitimately classified technology that should not fall into the 
hands of a proliferant group or country.
<p>
As a result of new domestic objectives, the classification culture of DOE must be expanded beyond its 
traditional national security focus to include sensitivity to information needs in new areas such as 
environmental restoration, worker radiation dose reconstruction, and technology transfer. DOE's 
customers, broadly defined as the "public"--a large constituency ranging from off-site neighbors, 
environmental researchers, historians, and science and industry workers, to state and other federal 
personnel--must have access to the information they need in these areas. To meet these new mission 
objectives, DOE must take radical steps away from its old way of doing business. The document 
declassification review process itself must be made more effective and efficient to get the needed 
information into the customers' hands as soon as possible. In addition, the policies that restrict vast 
amounts of information must be reviewed.
<p>
Bonneville Power Administration: Implementing a Business Model for Power Marketing Operations in 
the Pacific Northwest. For the entire 55 years of its existence, the Bonneville Power Administration has 
taken a one-size-fits-all approach to meeting the needs of its customers in the Pacific Northwest. 
Increasingly, these customers--all 130 electric utilities and a number of large industries in the region--
have asked Bonneville to be more customer-focused, market-driven, cost-conscious, and results-oriented. 
Bonneville supplies half the electricity and 80 percent of the high voltage transmission capacity in the 
region.
<p>
Bonneville's management volunteered as a DOE reinvention lab and launched "The Competitiveness 
Project." The aim of the project is four-fold:
<p>
--- develop a new marketing strategy that would offer a wide array of power and transmission products 
tailored to the different desires and business plans of Bonneville's customers; 
<p>
--- streamline, realign, and downsize Bonneville's internal systems to reduce costs and increase 
responsiveness to support the new marketing approach; 
<p>
--- change the organization from government to a business-oriented management style; and 
<p>
--- change to a government corporation. 
<p>
<p>
<b>Looking Ahead</b>
<p>
DOE has found strong, early enthusiasm among its customers plus a need to demonstrate to them that the 
current administration and the department are committed to reinvention, even when reinvention demands 
fundamental cultural and procedural changes.
<p>
The strategic planning process at DOE has accomplished much to set the direction for the future. The 
department has agreed on a mission statement and a set of core values to guide the department's future 
service to the nation. External trends have been identified that are most likely to shape the environment 
in which the department operates a decade from now. The next steps in the strategic planning process 
will be to develop strategies and action plans to respond to those externally driven trends.
<p>
The Federal, State, and Local Partnership Lab anticipates that this partnership will lead to a better 
understanding between DOE and its stakeholders about the forces that influence their behavior. Also, the 
lab will help identify new stakeholders who are crucial to successfully commercializing new energy 
technologies.
<p>
The National Clean Industry initiative, led by the Cabinet Cluster on Energy, Environment, and Natural 
Resources, would effectively respond to the administration's new criteria for U.S. investments in 
advanced technology by:
<p>
--- strengthening America's industrial competitiveness and creating jobs; 
<p>
--- creating a business environment where technical innovation can flourish and where investment is 
attracted to new ideas; 
<p>
--- ensuring coordinated management of technology all across government; 
<p>
--- forging a closer partnership among industry, federal and state government workers, and universities; 
and 
<p>
--- redirecting the focus of our national efforts toward technologies crucial to today's business and a 
growing economy, such as information and communication, flexible manufacturing, and environmental 
technologies. 
<p>
Private sector involvement at Hanford will save hundreds of millions of dollars while establishing a 
business and job base that will flourish in a post-cleanup era. Cooperative efforts between the 
community, organized labor, industry, and DOE will create thousands of new private sector jobs to clean 
up the base.
<p>
By 1995, this example of rethinking government is expected to reduce the Hanford security budget by at 
least one-third of the fiscal year 1992 level. Savings will be returned to programs and will be used in the 
environmental cleanup of the Hanford site. The security transition team is attempting to ensure that the 
process of change becomes part of the Hanford culture. To the extent that the security transition 
succeeds, it holds out hope for additional changes to the ongoing programs and projects at the site that 
will complement the privatization efforts of the economic transition.
<p>
Bonneville managers see their efforts as a first-of-its-kind attempt to establish strategic business 
objectives in the Pacific Northwest. Its industrial customers, which include one-third of the nation's 
aluminum smelting capacity, see this as a radical turn in its management.
<p>
Needs have changed. In response, DOE must make domestic oil and gas information available 
electronically to a wide base of customers. Today, less information merits the protection of classification 
and, therefore, classification itself at DOE needs to be reinvented. Bureaucratic obstacles to efficiency 
must be overcome (for example, improving government coordination and streamlining the information 
declassification process). State-of-the-art information processing technology must be developed and 
utilized to increase productivity and better serve DOE external and internal customers.
<p>
In view of the above, and in response to the opportunities afforded by the Vice President's and the 
Secretary's initiatives, a multifaceted plan has been initiated in order to move DOE from the past to a 
new era-- an era that recognizes the importance of serving customers, increasing productivity, and 
providing the tools and incentives to focus on results.
<p>
DOE has begun a reinvention process that will continue far beyond delivery of the NPR report to the 
President. With enthusiastic leadership from the Secretary and an energized, empowered work force, 
DOE is on its way to becoming an agency that sets the trend for enthusiastic and effective service to the 
nation.

<Title>Executive Summary</Title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<p><H2>Environmental Protection Agency</H2>
<p> 
<HR>

<p><p> <H2>Executive Summary</a></H2>
<p> In 1970, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
 by pulling together a complex patchwork of federal programs into a 
 single regulatory body. The new agency was charged with a deceptively 
 straightforward mission: to control and abate the spread of 
 pollution.
<p> Over the last two decades, this goal has remained unchanged, but the 
 means needed to achieve it have proven to be far from simple. EPA 
 integrates research, monitoring, standard-setting, and enforcement, 
 coordinating these diverse activities with state and local 
 governments, private and public organizations, and educational 
 institutions. It works with the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, 
 and Energy, serving as a focal point for all federal agencies whose 
 operations affect the environment. EPA undertakes these functions 
 with a work force of 17,468 and a 1994 budget of approximately $6.4 
 billion.
<p> The years since 1970 have brought an expanding system of 
 environmental statutes under EPA's jurisdiction. These include the 
 Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Pollution 
 Prevention Act (PPA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
 (RCRA), the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
 (FIFRA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, 
 and Liability Act (CERCLA, or Superfund), to name only a few. 
<p> The growing outside scrutiny, increasing responsibilities, and 
 limited resources have brought EPA to a critical juncture. To ensure 
 the viability of the nation's environmental future, the agency must 
 embark on a new course. Rather than responding to high-profile 
 incidents of pollution with isolated, media-specific approaches based 
 on a command-and-control bureaucracy, it must pursue an integrated, 
 flexible strategy. Rather than tolerating status-quo inefficiencies 
 as necessary evils, it must reinvent its approach to management.
<p> To help guide EPA's new course, first, the agency must eliminate 
 obstacles to increased accountability and performance. EPA should 
 give local communities greater flexibility in achieving the 
 environmental focus of federal statutes wherever possible and should 
 solicit their input before completing major regulatory reforms. In 
 addition, EPA should delegate responsibility over permit programs to 
 states that are legally and organizationally prepared for the job. To 
 coordinate this decentralization, EPA should assemble a clearinghouse 
 providing potential permit holders with relevant information.
<p> No matter how effectively EPA removes the barriers to federal, state, 
 and local performance, it must also bolster the role of the private 
 sector by creating competitive government. Shrinking resources, the 
 immense costs of toxic cleanup, and the difficulty of eliminating 
 pollutant transfer demand that EPA redirect its focus: The new 
 priority must be to prevent environmental degradation altogether. 
<p> Although the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 provides a worthy point 
 of departure, the agency can do more. Regulatory reform, private 
 partnerships, technological innovation, greater public information, 
 and state and local cooperation must each be harnessed to effect the 
 shift in paradigm. One specific example of this principle lies in the 
 arena of water quality, where the agency should recognize that 
 parties subject to Clean Water Act regulations can often identify and 
 implement the most efficient mechanisms to ameliorate toxic buildup. 
 To make it possible, however, EPA must work with Congress to allow 
 trading of waste discharges when such exchanges meet overall quality 
 requirements while saving money. The agency should augment its effort 
 to promote independent industry initiatives and public-private 
 partnerships. These could be instrumental in the accelerated 
 development of innovative environmental technology, especially in the 
 area of pollution prevention. Eliminating the export of banned 
 pesticides overseas will not only ensure that Americans are not 
 exposed to harmful chemicals on imported foods but will also 
 demonstrate American responsibility and leadership worldwide.
<p> EPA must also make better use of the resources already at its 
 disposal by empowering employees to manage for results. It should 
 begin with an agency-wide drive to exert new leadership through 
 measurable goals, performance standards, and strategic planning. 
 These steps should address the nation's full range of environmental 
 problems and EPA's own internal operations. Overdependence on 
 contractors and inadequate oversight of their work have yielded 
 ethical abuses due to a lack of accountability. 
<p> The agency's future lies in promoting not only environmental safety, 
 but environmental justice as well. Administrator Browner is acting to 
 resolve both issues with major initiatives, and EPA's senior 
 management must follow through on her proposals.
<p> Measures to advance local action must be accompanied by efforts to 
 improve EPA's own results, and an important step in this direction 
 would come from ensuring that all agency decisions are based on 
 quality science. To that end, EPA should develop a personnel system 
 and professional tracks for scientific and technical employees and 
 should intensify its use of peer review and quality assurance to 
 promote excellence in science. Finally, another pressing internal 
 issue lies in the agency's Office of Enforcement, where disparate, 
 media-specific approaches have thwarted the overall effort to ensure 
 environmental compliance. Reorganization of the Office of Enforcement 
 will result in greater enforcement and compliance.
<p> The discussions that follow do not attempt to encompass the full set 
 of concerns within EPA. The continuation of this process will bring 
 additional issues and further reports on its own internal reinvention 
 findings. The present recommendations of the National Performance 
 Review, however, save approximately $33 million over the next six 
 years and set EPA on a new course for the next century.

<p><H3>Recommendations and Actions</H3>
<HR>
<p> <H2> EPA01:  Improve Environmental Protection Through Increased
 Flexibility for Local Government</H2><p>
<p><H3>Background</H3>
<p>Environmental laws and regulations implemented over the past decade 
 have led to significant improvements in environmental quality. 
 Airborne lead has decreased 98 percent since 1970, largely due to the 
 ban on lead in gasoline.(1) Since 1983, carbon monoxide levels in the 
 air have dropped 34 percent.(2) The Clean Water Act has dramatically 
 improved the quality of rivers and waterways throughout the country, 
 resulting in increased tourism, the resurgence of recreational 
 boating and commercial fisheries, and other economic gains. Today, 
 twice as many rivers meet quality conditions for their designated 
 uses as did in 1974.(3)
<p> Many of these laws, however, place a very real cost burden on local 
 governments. Localities now struggle to comply with new requirements 
 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource 
 Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and 
 Superfund, with little or no prospect of significant increases in 
 federal grants and only limited availability of loans in the future. 
 By the year 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates 
 that local governments will need to spend nearly $44 billion annually 
 to meet existing requirements.(4)
<p> As the front-line managers of many environmental programs, local 
 governments have had too little to say in the development of past 
 environmental regulations. With the opportunity to "reinvent" the way 
 EPA works with state and local governments, EPA has a chance to 
 significantly increase the effectiveness of our nation's 
 environmental programs.
<p> One key challenge for the agency is to allow states and localities 
 increased flexibility in environmental regulations, without 
 compromising environmental performance, accountability, or fairness 
 across communities. Greater flexibility may be warranted in a variety 
 of circumstances to accommodate the diversity of environmental 
 conditions across the country; to allow and encourage the use of more 
 cost-effective methods to achieve the same or improved environmental 
 outcomes; and to enable communities to more easily pursue 
 environmental solutions across the multiple media of air, water, and 
 land.
<p> Local governments cite examples where failure to devise better ways 
 to protect the environment affordably may result in just the opposite 
 of the intended effect. In the Southwest, one city reports an 
 increase in desert dumping of solid waste by citizens because of a 
 refusal by the citizenry to pay to expand the local landfill in 
 accordance with federal regulations, which require installation of 
 double liners and a leachate collection system to comply with RCRA 
 groundwater laws. The city questions whether the requirements are 
 necessary in this case because of its geology and arid climatic 
 conditions.
<p> The problems associated with inflexible laws, regulations, and 
 practices are exacerbated by the sheer volume of new regulations the 
 EPA is required to implement. For example, the Safe Drinking Water 
 Amendments of 1986 call for the testing, monitoring, and control of 
 an additional 25 new contaminants every three years. If EPA fails to 
 issue these new standards, it violates the federal law. At the same 
 time, the issuance of such standards adds significant new cost 
 burdens to local governments.
<p> Flexibility does exist in some statutes. EPA allows the states that 
 have been delegated the authority to manage the Safe Drinking Water 
 Act the right to waive some of the Act's monitoring requirements. 
 Eleven states currently operate a waiver program, and 12 others have 
 begun to establish new waiver programs. In some cases, however, the 
 states and the local public water systems are finding they lack the 
 resources necessary to develop an adequate program to modify the 
 monitoring requirements.
<p> EPA has also begun to work with some states and local governments to 
 conduct comparative risk assessments to help communities set 
 priorities among competing needs. However, progress in this area 
 varies considerably among the EPA regions, where primary 
 responsibility exists for dealing with state and local governments, 
 and considerable work needs to be done to translate the findings of 
 comparative risk analysis into the day-to-day decisionmaking of EPA 
 and its state and local partners in environmental protection.
<p> In the financial arena, EPA has begun, through university-based 
 environmental finance centers, to help individual communities 
 identify innovative financial approaches to meet environmental goals. 
 In the technical and management areas, EPA has developed model 
 laboratory/local government cooperative ventures. EPA needs to 
 continue to explore, promote, and expand these and other ways to 
 achieve environmental objectives and address barriers to innovation 
 and change, along with maximum flexibility wherever warranted.
<p> EPA must recognize that increased regulatory flexibility offers 
 tremendous opportunities for positive institutional change at 
 federal, state, and local levels. Then EPA must work to take 
 advantage of these opportunities by finding ways to allow flexibility 
 without compromising fairness, accountability and, above all, 
 performance. This move toward institutionalizing flexibility in 
 regulatory processes can occur only in an atmosphere of true 
 partnership that serves to promote and perpetuate the economic 
 viability of local governments while protecting the health of the 
 nation's citizenry and environment.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>1. EPA should amend the regulations pursuant to the Regulatory 
 Flexibility Act of 1980 determined to be most troublesome for local 
 government to provide alternative and flexible approaches to meeting 
 environmental mandates.
<p> EPA should establish an implementation group to determine which 
 regulations should be selected for revision. The group should obtain 
 input from state and local governments, environmental organizations, 
 and other stakeholders. With guidance from the group, relevant EPA 
 program offices should begin to develop appropriate language to amend 
 the regulations selected. The public notice of EPA's intent to amend 
 the selected regulations should be issued by January 1, 1996. If 
 successful, this process could set a precedent for additional 
 flexibility in the future.
<p> 
 2. The EPA should convene a series of town meetings across the United 
 States with environmental and other citizen groups and local 
 officials to ensure that outside input is considered before 
 regulatory reform recommendations are finalized.
<p> The town meetings should start by January 30, 1994. One objective of 
 these meetings should be to solicit interested stakeholders for their 
 views on how EPA should increase its support of state, tribal, and 
 local governments in assessing and prioritizing their ecological and 
 community health risks.
<p> 
 3. The EPA should establish a pilot project that will assist one 
 community to assess its environmental and community health risks in 
 directing resources to priority problems.
<p> The pilot should be established by March 1, 1994. If successful, this 
 pilot should then serve as a model for other communities and could 
 become the impetus for additional regulatory and, perhaps, statutory 
 change.
<p> </DL>
 <H3>Implications</H3>
<p><DL><DT><DD> In addition to promoting within EPA an understanding of the need for 
 flexibility during rule-writing, town meetings and the process of 
 identifying and selecting specific rules for revision are certain to 
 increase awareness and understanding of health and environment-
 protecting regulations, as well as their importance.
<p> Perhaps the greatest danger in promoting flexibility lies in the 
 potential for some communities to use that flexibility to reduce 
 their commitment to environmental protection for their citizens, 
 rather than to allow the innovation that will result in improved 
 environmental outcomes. It becomes essential, therefore, for greater 
 flexibility to be accompanied by performance measures and clear 
 accountability.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>Granting regulatory flexibility will not require an additional 
 investment of resources. The implementation of the pilot program and 
 the town meetings will impose additional costs on the agency.

<p> <H2> EPA02:  Streamline EPA's Permit Program</H2>
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p> Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its state 
 partners have relied heavily on permits as the primary vehicle to 
 achieve environmental protection. A permit is an authority granted by 
 EPA to the permit holder to discharge a pollutant into the 
 environment or to store, treat, or dispose of hazardous waste 
 materials. The permit reflects the limitations established by the 
 statutes for pollution discharges and handling of hazardous wastes. 
 Permits may be general or specific. General permits state exactly 
 what is required of a class of facilities, such as in the dry 
 cleaning or the paper pulp industry. General permits are used when it 
 is impractical or unnecessary to issue individual permits for each of 
 many small facilities with similar operations. Specific permits 
 dictate what a given facility is required to do, often taking into 
 account particular conditions at the specific facility. While this 
 strategy has succeeded in controlling sources of pollution from 
 large, centralized facilities, the current permitting process has 
 been less effective in managing small, diverse, and decentralized 
 sources of pollution, like stormwater discharges.
<p> Currently, EPA and the states are responsible for processing more 
 than 730,000 permits in the media (air, water, solid waste, and 
 toxics). EPA budgets more than 1,000 positions annually (most of 
 which are located in regional and field offices) and provides about 
 $800 million in the form of grants to states and contract dollars to 
 conduct permit activities.(1) Despite this resource investment, it is 
 not always possible to issue or reissue permits in a timely manner 
 due to insufficient data available to the EPA or state permit writer. 
 Depending on the type of permit, the time it takes from application 
 to issuance may range from 10 months to two years. 
<p> EPA operates under 12 major environmental statutes and the 
 regulations implementing those statutes. In order to ensure due 
 process, some permit programs tend to prescribe the specific means by 
 which environmental protection is achieved. This eliminates the 
 opportunity to use innovative or alternative approaches. These 
 requirements constrain EPA's ability to address cross-media concerns 
 and innovative pollution abatement methods, even when the statute 
 does not prohibit such approaches. For example, point sources (such 
 as discharges from facilities), nonpoint sources (such as fertilizer 
 runoff), wastewater effluent, and stormwater discharges would benefit 
 from alternative solutions in permitting. A true cross-media approach 
 can be stymied if no flexibility is available in a different statute.
<p> Given the large volume and different kinds of permits, neither the 
 states nor EPA can effectively address all of their permittees. This 
 raises the question of whether permits are always the best mechanism 
 for achieving environmental protection. Consequently, it is essential 
 to prioritize, group, and target permitting activities according to 
 types of facilities to be regulated, their geographic location, and 
 the nature of the types of permits that will be required.
<p> Because the responsibility for issuing permits is divided between EPA 
 and the states without clear-cut lines delineating respective 
 expectations and responsibilities, miscommunication often adds to the 
 delay in the permitting process. States must rely on EPA to provide 
 them with technical guidance and permit rules. When EPA does not 
 provide the guidance, implementation becomes problematic. For 
 example, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) required EPA to 
 issue a permit rule by November 15, 1991; however, disagreement among 
 EPA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Council on 
 Competitiveness over certain requirements in the final rule delayed 
 its issuance for eight months. This in turn caused a delay in issuing 
 the final permit rule for federal and state implementation of Title 
 V's requirements. 
<p> Moreover, some state legislatures deferred action on bills 
 authorizing agencies to implement permit programs and collect permit 
 fees. For example, while EPA has provided some guidance on 
 implementing Title V, additional program and fee guidance that it 
 planned to provide to states in 1992 has not been issued. 
 Consequently, some states will find it difficult to meet the November 
 1993 deadline set by the CAAA for submitting their permit program 
 plans to EPA.(2) Delays in meeting the milestones for implementing 
 the permit program slow efforts to improve air quality, determine 
 emission levels, monitor emissions, and fulfill other requirements.
<p> Both the regulators and the regulated community (the permittees) view 
 the permitting process as an administrative burden. They have 
 complained that too many forms are required to apply for a permit. 
 This excess paperwork adds to the administrative burden at both the 
 state and federal level and significantly slows the permit review 
 process.
<p> Many states believe that EPA practices excessive oversight. States 
 with well-established pollution control permit programs have 
 indicated that a more appropriate role for EPA is in technology 
 transfer, not in excessive oversight of the states. These states 
 would prefer more authority to carry out their program 
 responsibilities. For example, in the water quality permitting 
 program, some states raised concerns that EPA micromanages each water 
 quality permit issued by the state. Some states suggest that greater 
 environmental protection could be achieved by refocusing EPA's 
 activities from individual permit reviews to technical assistance 
 services and development of a state/federal resource allocation plan 
 to address water quality problems with the highest environmental 
 risk.
<p> Furthermore, the lack of an integrated database system and mechanism 
 to track permits in the states or regional EPA offices makes it very 
 difficult for applicants to know permit requirements, and for 
 regulators to know the types of permits, number of permits, and 
 geographic location of the various permitted facilities. Partnerships 
 with the states need to be developed to build the integrated 
 databases that would enhance monitoring and compliance for 
 enforcement and provide information for emergency responses to 
 environmental accidents.
<p> Finally, as stated earlier, the current permitting procedures and 
 programs do not effectively encourage flexibility. Even when 
 regulations and statutes allow for various approaches, the agency 
 budgeting and planning process does not allow upfront investments to 
 pay for them. Although some statutes do not specifically prohibit 
 pilot projects, many dictate the specific technology that must be 
 used. Without incentives to encourage new approaches, little progress 
 will be made in streamlining the permit process. For instance, the 
 National Advisory Council For Environmental Policy and Technology has 
 stated that the current permitting and compliance systems discourage 
 all stakeholder groups from taking the risks necessary to develop 
 innovative technologies whether for pollution prevention or for 
 pollution control and to bring them into routine use to solve 
 environmental problems.(3)
<p></DL> 
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p><DL><DT><DD> 1. EPA should establish a permits clearinghouse by July 1995 to serve 
 as a single point of contact for regulated industries and local 
 governments to obtain information about national and regional 
 regulations and permitting requirements.
<p> This should include general, simple to understand information, as 
 well as names and numbers of state and/or EPA regional or 
 headquarters contacts for technical assistance on permitting issues. 
 The clearing-house should offer a national EPA permit hotline and 
 computer bulletin board.
<p> 
 2. EPA should authorize states that now have full statutory authority 
 and permit fee systems in place to take full responsibility for 
 permit programs.
<p> This would allow states needed flexibility in dealing with local 
 program requirements instead of relying on the one-size-fits-all 
 approach.
<p> 
 3. EPA should identify, by June 1994, statutes that prevent 
 flexibility in permitting and report to the Administrator for follow-
 up action.
<p> Flexibility in permitting is needed to stimulate new approaches for 
 pollution abatement. EPA should direct regional offices to use more 
 flexibility in dealings with states, especially where traditional 
 approaches have proven ineffective.
<p> 
 4. EPA should develop a cross-program permit tracking system pilot 
 with one state and one region by June 1994.
<p> This would allow for multi-media permit assessment, cross-media 
 compliance, and enforcement <H3>Actions</H3>, as well as greater access for 
 the public and researchers to permit information. In addition, such a 
 database could include environmental results and outcomes based on 
 monitoring systems with feedback and targeting for permit programs. 
 If the pilot project is successful, the technology could be 
 transferred to other states.
<p> </DL>
 <H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 <DL><DT><DD>Streamlining and simplifying the permitting process will increase 
 stakeholder participation and credibility as well as EPA and state 
 level administrative costs savings. Increased state partnerships will 
 improve performance and increase stakeholder participation in the 
 permitting process. Establishment of a permit clearinghouse will 
 improve customer satisfaction by reducing paperwork and other 
 administrative burdens. Development of a permit tracking database 
 will expedite the permit process, target risk assessment, and provide 
 information for emergency responses to environmental mishaps.
<p></DL> 
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<DL><DT><DD> Streamlining by reducing delays and staff time in the permitting 
 process could result in savings for EPA, the states, and the 
 regulated communities. Additional personnel needed for 1994-96 should 
 be reassigned from existing staff within the agency.

<p><H2>EPA03:  Shift EPA's Emphasis Toward Pollution  
Prevention and Away From Pollution Control</H2>
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 establishes a bold national 
 objective for environmental protection: "[T]hat pollution should be 
 prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible."(1) The 
 Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Science Advisory Board has 
 strongly recommended that pollution prevention be emphasized as the 
 preferred means of reducing risk, explaining, "Preventing pollution 
 at the source through the redesign of production processes, the 
 substitution of less toxic production materials, the screening of new 
 chemicals and technologies before they are introduced into commerce, 
 energy and water conservation, the development of less polluting 
 transportation systems and farming practices, etc. is usually a far 
 cheaper, more effective way to reduce environmental risk, especially 
 over the long term."(2)
<p> EPA has defined pollution prevention as source reduction (reducing 
 pollution at its source by shifting to the use of materials, 
 processes, or practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of 
 pollutants or wastes), as well as to mean protecting natural 
 resources through conservation or increased efficiency in the use of 
 energy, water, or other raw materials. Pollution prevention is not 
 the only strategy for reducing risk; rather, it is the preferred one. 
 Environmentally sound recycling shares many of the advantages of 
 prevention it can reduce the need for treatment or disposal and 
 conserve energy and natural resources. Where prevention or recycling 
 are not feasible, treatment followed by safe disposal as a last 
 resort will play an important role in achieving environmental goals.
<p> When EPA was created in 1970, it focused first on controlling and 
 cleaning up the most immediate environmental problems. Those efforts 
 have yielded major reductions in pollution. Over time, however, 
 analysis has shown that traditional end-of-pipe approaches not only 
 can be expensive and less than fully effective, but sometimes 
 transfer pollution from one medium to another (for example, from 
 water to air). 
<p> Preventing pollution also offers important economic benefits, as 
 pollution that is never created avoids the need for expensive 
 investments in waste management or cleanup. For example, an 
 environmental research group, INFORM, Inc., found in its study of 29 
 chemical plants that 15 percent of the 181 source-reduction 
 activities identified resulted in annual dollar savings of $1 million 
 or more.(3) Nearly half saved between $45,000 and $1 million 
 annually, and more than one quarter saved between $6,000 and $45,000 
 each year. Only one out of all 181 source- reduction activities 
 documented reported a net cost increase. Thus, this study suggests 
 that pollution prevention has the potential for both protecting the 
 environment and strengthening economic growth through more efficient 
 manufacturing and raw material use.
<p> An effective pollution prevention strategy must reflect the complex 
 and multiple array of factors that motivate the private sector to 
 invest in cleaner, less polluting technologies and practices. These 
 factors include regulations and compliance, state and local 
 partnerships, private partnerships, federal partnerships, public 
 information and the right to know, and technological innovation.
<p> Regulations and compliance play an integral part in preventing 
 pollution. A report by INFORM, Inc., documented the critical role 
 that both existing and anticipated future regulations play in 
 providing an incentive to eliminate waste at the source. Federal and 
 state experience with multi-media inspections and enforcement 
 settlements demonstrate that effective compliance strategies can 
 accelerate the introduction of new technologies. The recent decision 
 to reorganize the Office of Enforcement creates major opportunities 
 to focus on multi-media compliance goals.(4)
<p> EPA regulations, permits, inspections, and enforcement <H3>Actions</H3> need 
 better coordination to minimize the cross-media transfer of waste and 
 to more effectively reduce waste at the source. The Source Reduction 
 Review Project, through which EPA is attempting to coordinate 
 different rules affecting 17 key industrial categories, is a good 
 start. Regulations and compliance strategies must focus on the whole 
 facility, rather than individual environmental problems.
<p> State and local partnerships will be an important factor in 
 determining the success of pollution prevention. Increasingly, state 
 and local governments are the face of government to the general 
 public. States have also proved to be excellent sources of 
 innovation, promoting pollution prevention through both compliance 
 and technical assistance programs. For example, the State of 
 Massachusetts won a national award from the Ford Foundation for the 
 Blackstone project, which combines multi-media inspections with 
 effective delivery of technical information to industries trying to 
 find cost-effective methods of compliance.
<p> EPA disburses approximately $600 million per year in grants to states 
 that have been charged with implementing federal law under authority 
 delegated by EPA. It is critical that EPA follow up on its existing 
 commitment to provide states with flexibility to use such funding to 
 find innovative ways to carry out these responsibilities. In 
 particular, EPA must offer more flexible approaches to funding state 
 implementation efforts to reward innovation and emphasize results.
<p> Private partnerships are yet another key to achieving pollution 
 prevention. In many cases, collaborative efforts with industry or 
 public agencies can help achieve results through pollution prevention 
 more quickly than could be obtained through regulation alone. For 
 example, EPA's Green Programs to promote voluntary energy efficiency 
 will play a critical role in achieving obligations under the U.S. 
 Action Plan to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000.
<p> Furthermore, regulations do not often reach the more complicated 
 corporate decisions needed to evaluate design, manufacturing, 
 packaging, distribution, and marketing practices to reduce pollution 
 and energy consumption. EPA has undertaken a series of innovative 
 efforts through its Design for the Environment Program to work with 
 industry groups such as the printing and dry cleaning industries, the 
 accounting profession, and the insurance industry to incorporate 
 environmental life-cycle thinking into business decisions. The 
 Federal Trade Commission has developed standards for the use of 
 specific environmental terms in advertising but has not reached the 
 more complex questions of environmental claims based on more 
 comprehensive, life-cycle analysis. The American National Standards 
 Institute (ANSI) is currently developing positions on these issues 
 and could benefit from EPA involvement.
<p> EPA needs to expand the scope of programs to encourage industry to go 
 beyond compliance and to make measurable commitments to pollution 
 prevention. That will require a better understanding of the 
 relationship between compliance programs and the achievement of 
 broader environmental goals.
<p> Federal partnerships must also be undertaken to achieve the goals of 
 pollution prevention. President Clinton's Earth Day speech challenged 
 the federal government to "lead by example not by bureaucratic 
 fiat."(5) The federal government has a tremendous impact on the 
 environment as the nation's largest landlord and its biggest consumer 
 of goods and services. Accordingly, the President signed an Executive 
 Order on August 3, 1993, that requires federal agencies to report 
 toxic emissions under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to 
 Know Act, establish a goal of cutting toxic emissions 50 percent, and 
 set priorities for reducing the unnecessary use of extremely 
 hazardous materials in government standards and specifications.(6)
<p> Other federal agencies can create major opportunities for pollution 
 prevention through policies that shape decisions in agriculture, 
 energy, transportation, and the management of natural resources. If 
 pollution prevention is to expand in these sectors, EPA must form 
 partnerships that take advantage of the authority and expertise of 
 other federal agencies. Earlier this year, EPA joined the Food and 
 Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture in announcing a 
 joint effort to develop a strategy to reduce the use of pesticides 
 that present unreasonable risks. Other countries, including Canada 
 and the Netherlands, have already adopted ambitious programs to cut 
 back on the inefficient use of hazardous pesticides and fertilizers, 
 which can cost farmers many dollars as well as pose risk to human 
 health and the environment.
<p> A driving force in pollution prevention has been public information 
 and the concept of the right to know. Since pollution prevention is 
 motivated in part by public information, one of EPA's most important 
 tasks is to collect and disseminate user-friendly data that measures 
 progress in reducing waste at its source. The Toxics Release 
 Inventory (TRI) has proved vital in helping industry to identify 
 opportunities to reduce waste and improve economic efficiency. For 
 example, many state pollution prevention planning laws are based 
 directly on TRI data collected and maintained by EPA. New reporting 
 requirements of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, which took 
 effect last year, expands data requirements to include the reporting 
 of chemicals that were reduced at the source, recycled, treated, or 
 disposed, as well as the volume released directly to the environment.
<p> EPA has already committed to expanding the scope of the TRI to 
 include different chemicals and major sources of emissions not 
 already required to report. To make room for this expansion, EPA 
 should reduce other paperwork requirements that are redundant or of 
 less value.
<p> Technological innovation can serve as the engine that drives 
 pollution prevention. The federal government plays a critical role in 
 funding research in new technologies and in disseminating information 
 about technological options to the private sector. The President's 
 new initiative includes $36 million in funding for research in new 
 technologies and anticipates a major expansion of technical 
 assistance through the National Institute of Standards and 
 Technology.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p><DL><DT><DD> 1. The preamble to each major rule proposed by EPA should include a 
 summary of the total multi-media releases and resultant risks to the 
 environment from the activities that are the subject of the rule.
<p> The analysis should include the estimated impact of the rule on these 
 multi-media (e.g., air and water) releases and risks, and the 
 preamble should identify other pending regulatory decisions likely to 
 affect the same industry or industrial category that is the subject 
 of the proposed rule. Having to provide these data will require 
 identification of significant cross-media issues during development 
 of the rule, and it will ensure that senior managers do not make 
 significant regulatory decisions in a single-media vacuum. Such data 
 will also provide industry with a more comprehensive picture of the 
 web of regulatory transactions to which it must adjust over the 
 coming years. EPA's performance can be measured according to whether 
 it has incorporated this multi-media analysis into significant 
 proposed rules within one year.
<p> 
 2. EPA should use its flexibility as it already has for the pulp and 
 paper industry to adjust regulatory timetables so that major rules 
 are proposed on the same date.
<p> Integrated rulemaking offers major opportunities to overhaul 
 industrial processes to improve efficiency while reducing transaction 
 costs by satisfying multiple regulatory requirements. Integrated 
 rules can also help lay the groundwork for more efficient multi-media 
 permitting and inspection strategies. EPA's performance can be 
 measured according to the number of single-media rules it has 
 combined for proposal on the same date.
<p> 
 3. EPA should change existing reporting requirements that create 
 disincentives to multi-media inspections and enforcement <H3>Actions</H3> at 
 both the federal and state level.
<p> For example, EPA's single-media inspection programs require states to 
 report results in conflicting formats and different time frames. 
 Changing reporting require-ments should be addressed as part of the 
 pending reorganization of EPA's enforcement program. EPA's 
 performance can be measured according to whether it has integrated 
 the reporting requirements for state inspections into one multi-media 
 database by the end of next year. EPA should also be required to keep 
 data on multi-media inspections carried out by the agency and by 
 states pursuant to federal regulations.
<p> 
 4. EPA should move toward a consolidated grant approach providing 
 states with maximum flexibility in the use of federal funds in 
 carrying out responsibilities that have been delegated to the states 
 by EPA.
<p> This may require developing performance-based measures that allow 
 states the leeway to focus funding on the most significant problems. 
 This flexibility should be exercised within a framework of clear 
 federal objectives established by existing law (that is, the goal 
 should not be a revenue-sharing approach). EPA's performance can be 
 measured initially according to the number of dollars that states 
 have been allowed to invest in multi-media projects under existing 
 grant authority.
<p> 
 5. EPA should provide states with incentives to invest funds in water 
 conservation and pollution prevention programs that reduce pollutant 
 loadings of concern.
<p> EPA's performance can be reflected in whether new policies are 
 promulgated (by statute or rule) that accomplish the above 
 objectives. Over time, the agency should be able to point to a 
 reduction in the quantity of wastewater to be treated as a result of 
 water conservation and pollution prevention.
<p> 
 6. EPA should invite a specific industry sector to jointly undertake 
 several projects to evaluate the feasibility of developing multi-
 media pollution prevention strategies for that particular industry.
<p> The projects should have clear objectives, including relating the 
 pollution prevention objectives to compliance requirements, 
 developing effective measures of performance, and assessing the 
 efficacy of industry codes of conduct, for example, the Chemical 
 Manufacturing Association's Responsible Care Program. Data from these 
 projects could be extremely useful in developing strategies that 
 offer industry more flexibility in return for achieving performance-
 based objectives. EPA's performance can be measured initially 
 according to whether these projects have been undertaken. In the long 
 run, EPA should be accountable for incorporating project 
 recommendations into its legislative, regulatory, and compliance 
 strategies.
<p> 
 7. EPA should help focus existing private sector labeling and 
 standards programs by identifying the product categories of greatest 
 concern. In addition, the agency should work with the American 
 National Standards Institute in developing a coherent U.S. position 
 on eco-labeling and life-cycle analysis.
<p> EPA's performance can be measured according to whether existing 
 private sector groups focus research and labeling efforts on the 
 product categories of concern, and whether ANSI is able to develop an 
 effective position on environmental standards and labeling.
<p> 
 8. EPA should work cooperatively with the Department of Agriculture 
 (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies to 
 develop a national strategy to promote more efficient use of 
 pesticides and fertilizers.
<p> The strategy should emphasize priorities, specific goals, and public 
 measures of progress. The strategy should be completed and announced 
 by mid-1994. Over time, EPA and the USDA should be able to measure 
 progress in reducing pesticides and nutrients of concern and to 
 document the savings to farmers from more efficient farming 
 practices. These goals should be accomplished within existing budgets 
 but may require significant reprogramming of funds at USDA, because 
 the amount of funding devoted to sustainable agriculture at USDA is 
 still quite small in relation to other priorities.
<p> 
 9. EPA should develop a plan for implementing the two pending 
 Executive Orders on Pollution Prevention and Recycling, so that it 
 can carry out its role and work jointly with other federal agencies, 
 as outlined in the Executive Orders.
<p> These plans should include deadlines and identify individuals 
 responsible for coordinating the development of the strategy in each 
 agency. Both Executive Orders already include significant measurable 
 goals. The Executive Orders can be accomplished within existing 
 budgets but may require significant reprogramming of funds.
<p> 
 10. EPA should create an integrated database that provides 
 information useful for measuring performance by industry, sector, and 
 facility, and for devising long-term multi-media pollution prevention 
 strategies.
<p> To the extent practical, the data should be public and should be 
 sound enough to be useful in providing alternative, performance-based 
 yardsticks for compliance. In the long run, credible measures of 
 performance are critical to providing industry with the kind of 
 flexibility needed to optimize investments in pollution prevention. 
 The integrated database should include TRI data expanded to cover 
 additional chemicals and facilities with greater efforts at quality 
 control. It should also include an inventory for measuring, on an 
 industrywide basis, changes in the use of toxic chemicals and 
 pesticides. EPA should identify and eliminate redundant reporting 
 requirements or information collection efforts that serve no 
 practical purpose. This integrated database, if credible, will 
 provide Congress and the public with a better basis for measuring 
 EPA's actual performance in reducing pollution. The costs of 
 establishing this integrated database are likely to be significant, 
 although some costs (for example, for TRI expansion) are already 
 reflected in the President's budget. EPA should coordinate with the 
 Department of Commerce to ensure that this does not conflict or 
 overlap with its activities in this area.
<p> 
 11. EPA should earmark funds for environmental technology for 
 prevention. 
<p> The President's 1994 budget includes $36 million in increased funding 
 for research in the development of environmental technologies. A 
 significant portion of this budget should be reserved for investments 
 in pollution prevention with EPA involved in establishing priority 
 areas for investment. Success will be measured in the short term 
 according to how much of the Environmental Technology Initiative 
 (ETI) expenditures are actually invested in technologies that don't 
 pollute.
<p> 
 12. A significant portion of funds for the Environmental Technology 
 Initiative should be targeted for technical assistance, including 
 information access.
<p> The EPA should ensure that a significant portion of new federal funds 
 are used to help provide small businesses with technical assistance 
 for pollution prevention. To the maximum extent practical, the 
 federal government should rely on existing delivery systems (such as 
 state pollution prevention programs) for the distribution of such 
 assistance. EPA should play a wholesale role in developing and 
 packaging materials useful to state and other federal programs, for 
 example, by providing clear and consistent information about 
 forthcoming regulatory requirements. Performance in the short term 
 can be measured according to the amount of funding made available to 
 help small businesses with investments in pollution prevention. In 
 the long run, EPA and other agencies must evaluate how many 
 businesses made use of the information and collect data on cost 
 savings.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>For each of the recommendations regarding regulations and compliance, 
 short-term costs will include funding for cross-media training of 
 regulatory and enforcement staff and for the development of an 
 integrated database that can be shared by different programs. 
 However, the long-term payoffs from a coordinated and efficient 
 approach to rulemaking should far outweigh these temporary costs. 
 Perhaps the greatest savings will be for industry, since integrated 
 rulemaking can help reduce transactions costs by eliminating 
 conflicting or overlapping requirements.
<p> Regarding state and local partnerships, providing states with more 
 flexibility to direct existing grant funds toward pollution 
 prevention should not result in any increased costs. In the long run, 
 emphasizing demand-side management for municipal water systems to 
 encourage conservation and reduce principal sources of pollution may 
 decrease the need for expensive investments in wastewater treatment. 
 States are likely to welcome the increased ability to invest scarce 
 dollars in activities with a higher environmental payoff.
<p> With private partnerships, the demonstration projects outlined in the 
 recommendations may require some funding to support data collection 
 and analysis as well as peer review. Industry may be willing to bear 
 most of these costs if it can reach agreement with EPA on a set of 
 shared objectives. In the long run, these projects should help lead 
 to more efficient approaches to regulations and compliance that offer 
 both government and industry significant cost savings.
<p> Implementing a comprehensive agriculture strategy, as part of federal 
 partnerships, may require significant reprogramming of funds at USDA. 
 Similarly, the Pollution Prevention and Recycling Executive Orders 
 may also require reprogramming of funds at other federal agencies. 
 Each of these initiatives is designed to establish goals and measures 
 to focus existing resources on high-priority environmental problems.
<p> The costs of establishing an integrated database to measure 
 performance and evaluate compliance on a cross-media basis are likely 
 to be in the range of $10 million. These resources will be most 
 effectively spent if they are used to improve and establish linkages 
 between existing databases, such as the TRI and the Office of 
 Enforcement's Integrated Data for Enforcement Analysis network. 
 Government costs may be offset in the long run by the elimination of 
 redundant reporting requirements that currently impose data 
 collection and management costs. Furthermore, an integrated database 
 provides the foundation for establishing performance-based measures 
 that allow both industry and government to find the most cost-
 effective alternatives for compliance.
<p> Finally, with technology innovation, the recommendations do not 
 request any new funds but, rather, suggest earmarking a significant 
 fraction of the ETI budget for pollution prevention research and 
 technical assistance to small business. Investing in new pollution 
 prevention technologies can reduce the cost of environmental 
 protection and position the United States to compete in the global 
 marketplace. Technical assistance is critical for helping small 
 businesses  which are responsible for most new job creation  meet the 
 costs of complying with the new Clean Air Act and other statutes.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p><DL><DT><DD> This proposal is cost-neutral. For the majority of the issues, no new 
 costs are anticipated; in the cases where some costs may be incurred, 
 they are already included in the existing budget.

<p><H2>EPA:05: Increase Private Sector Partnerships to Accelerate Development of Innovative Technologies</H2>
<p> 
 <b>Background</b>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Advisory 
 Committee for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT) has stated 
 that the nation's potential to improve the environment is directly 
 related to its ability to produce and apply technological 
 solutions.(1) However, NACEPT has also noted that the current rate of 
 technological innovation is less than required. This is creating a 
 gap between the ability to define risk and target environmental 
 problems, and the ability to solve them.
<p> EPA can accelerate the pace of technological development by building 
 stronger partnerships with technology providers and users. NACEPT 
 concluded that enhanced technology programs are essential to the 
 achievement of EPA's mission and that EPA should establish the 
 climate, culture, and incentives necessary to encourage widespread 
 use of improved technology. NACEPT further noted that EPA should 
 streamline coordination with its potential partners and, thus, should 
 establish stronger technology partnerships.(2)
<p> The application of more effective environmental technologies, 
 however, is not just a matter of environmental improvement. Improved 
 technologies reduce the costs of environmental protection, and they 
 enhance the competitiveness of the United States in both the domestic 
 and international environmental technology markets. The EPA estimates 
 that the domestic market for environmental technology now exceeds 
 $150 billion per year, and that the world-wide market may exceed $300 
 billion per year.
<p> Innovative technologies can play a significant role in cleaning up 
 the environment in many different situations, such as: 
 monitoring/site assessment situations to determine the degree of 
 contamination at a site; remedial situations used to clean up a site; 
 pollution control, otherwise known as end-of- pipe cleanup; 
 recycling; and pollution prevention where a process or product is 
 designed/redesigned to reduce or eliminate production of pollutants. 
 In the long run, innovative pollution prevention technologies will 
 have a tremendous impact on environmental protection, cost 
 effectiveness, and global competitiveness. 
<p> Designing and redesigning manufacturing processes to produce a better 
 product and one that is designed for the environment, often called a 
 green product, will yield a more competitive product. 
<p> For example, in the Energy Star program, major computer companies 
 joined with EPA to design computers that use less energy and, 
 thereby, contribute to the release of fewer pollutants at power 
 generation facilities. The Energy Star program is expected by some 
 estimates to save up to 2 percent of the nation's energy costs by the 
 year 2000.(3) According to EPA, the early demand for energy-saving 
 computers appears to be very high. The Energy Star program should 
 give domestic computer designers and manufacturers a lead over 
 foreign competition in the sale of these machines.
<p> Improved technology to clean up existing environmental waste and 
 prevent the future manufacture of such waste has great economic 
 importance. According to recent EPA estimates, the average cost to 
 clean up one superfund National Priorities List (NPL) site is $27 
 million, and EPA estimates it will cost a total of $16.5 billion to 
 clean up just those NPL sites already identified. Thus, partnerships 
 between EPA and industry are necessary to develop more cost-effective 
 solutions through innovative technologies that is, those that look 
 promising but may lack the cost and performance data necessary to 
 support routine use.
<p> The President's budget proposes an Environmental Technology 
 Initiative (ETI) for the next five years, which would provide $620 
 million in increased funding for technology development. Much of this 
 money would be in the base budgets of other federal agencies. In 
 addition to participating in partnerships with these agencies to 
 fully advance the innovation of environmental technologies, EPA also 
 needs to leverage its limited resources to spur industry to 
 participate with EPA as full partners in environmental technology 
 innovation.
<p> Recently, EPA started a new public-private partnership program in 
 cleaning up polluted sites. A Cooperative Research and Development 
 Agreement at McClellan Air Force Base in California was developed 
 under the provisions of the Federal Technology Transfer Act.(4)
<p> The project's goal is to evaluate the use of innovative technologies 
 for contaminated soil and ground water (such as soil vapor extraction 
 with innovative off-gas treatment, two-phase vacuum extraction, and 
 bioremediation) as alternatives to established technologies (such as 
 incineration). The project was initiated under a grant from the EPA 
 Technology Innovation Office. A nonprofit organization, Clean Sites, 
 Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia, is facilitating this partnership 
 between the Air Force, EPA's Region 9 (headquartered in San 
 Francisco, California), the California EPA, several private companies 
 (AT&T, Beazer-East, Dow, Dupont, Monsanto, Southern California 
 Edison, and Xerox), the EPA Risk Reduction Engineering Laboratory, 
 and the EPA Office of Federal Facility Enforcement.
<p> Expanding the McClellan model to other federal and state projects 
 would enable EPA to leverage limited resources to promote innovative 
 technologies, clean up or stablilize hazardous environmental sites, 
 prevent pollution, and provide economic improvement to the United 
 States and other countries. The <H3>Implications</H3> of this approach are 
 many. It provides a marketing incentive for firms whose technology is 
 demonstrated; it creates new jobs, since most technology development 
 is occurring at firms that employ 50 people or less (firms that can 
 benefit from the opportunities to demonstrate performance provided by 
 these kinds of projects); and competitive technologies in remediation 
 and pollution prevention can be exported.
<p> While the <H3>Implications</H3> cannot be calculated with certainty, examples 
 of past successes in technology innovation show the economic benefits 
 that could be gained. In February 1993, EPA issued a summary report 
 on its Superfund Innovative Technology Program, noting that 
 innovative technologies used in cleaning up polluted sites can save 
 the government as much as 68 percent of the money that would 
 otherwise be used with existing technologies. In EPA's Region 5 
 (headquarted in Chicago, Illinois) between 1987 and 1990, seven NPL 
 sites underwent remediation with innovative technologies. The 
 projected cost to the federal government, under then-existing 
 technology, was about $225 million; however, the use of innovative 
 technologies accomplished the cleanup for a cost to the government of 
 $8.5 million-a savings of $140 million. As noted, EPA may need about 
 $16.5 billion for its share to clean up existing NPL sites. If, in 
 fact, innovative technologies could be applied to many, or most, of 
 these sites, there is a potential cost savings of as much as $11.2 
 billion, or 68 percent of the total needed, based on Region 5's 
 experience. 
<p> Because of the success of innovative technologies whether in site 
 remediation, pollution control, or pollution prevention there is also 
 an economic benefit to private industry. For instance, a pollution 
 control partnership between EPA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and 
 private industry is field testing an innovative sulfur removal device 
 that can replace flue gas scrubbers. If successful, savings for 
 industries could exceed $1 billion per year, according to EPA, and 
 this estimate does not include the economic gain from selling the 
 technology both here and abroad.
<p> Innovative technology can benefit small business as well. The EPA 
 assisted a small manufacturer of orthopedic devices to switch from a 
 solvent that damages the ozone layer to a more diluted cleaner. The 
 firm's products are now cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with the 
 cleaner to remove grease from the parts. The new cleaning system is 
 saving the business about $4,800 per year, according to EPA. It cost 
 the business about $1,800 to implement the innovation.
<p> Environmental technologies are often extremely difficult to develop 
 and test in a laboratory setting. Possible solutions conceived in a 
 laboratory must, therefore, be evaluated outside of the laboratory in 
 a real-world environment. However, attempting to develop and test 
 innovative technologies outside a laboratory creates a risk for those 
 testing the technology. The technology may not work the way it was 
 planned, exposing technology implementers to financial liability. The 
 McClellan partnership is based on risk-sharing by government and 
 industry, an essential element to encourage first uses of innovative 
 technology.
<p> The Governors of several Western states have already recognized the 
 economic and environmental benefits of such a model program. They 
 have developed an action plan, working with the Departments of 
 Defense, Energy, and the Interior, and the EPA, to implement similar 
 programs in partnership with industry. The Governors have cited the 
 McClellan project as a model for their proposal.
<p> EPA is looking for other possible federal installations to use the 
 McClellan model and is examining possible ways to expand this to non-
 federal sites. It has provided $700,000 to Clean Sites, Inc., to 
 facilitate a series of these public-private partnerships.
<p> In sum, EPA needs to take the lead in the development, evaluation, 
 dissemination, and use of superior environmental technologies. EPA 
 must not only make certain that its policies and regulations allow 
 such innovation, but it must also encourage statutory changes to spur 
 such innovation. Therefore, EPA needs to take a proactive approach 
 by: (1) leveraging its limited resources in partnerships with private 
 industry; (2) providing small and large businesses with technical 
 support regarding the benefits and costs; and (3) establishing a 
 program to validate the performance of innovative environmental 
 technologies.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>1. EPA should develop an action plan with specific milestones, by 
 mid-1994, for improving the regulatory and statutory climate for 
 innovative technologies.
<p> The plan should identify existing barriers to innovative technology 
 development, recommend new approaches for writing regulations, seek 
 opportunities for working with other federal agencies, and identify 
 policies and procedures to facilitate permitting for innovative 
 technologies. Such a plan would encourage the introduction of 
 innovative environmental technology. After the action plan is 
 completed, its permitting component should be tested as a pilot 
 program involving innovative approaches to permit development of new 
 environmental technology. A special team, to be established by mid-
 1994, consisting of permit writers from EPA and the states, should 
 test the action plan by initiating 20 permit reviews. These reviews 
 should begin by January 1995. The reviews would determine whether the 
 permits could be changed or modified to allow the use of more 
 innovative technology to accomplish the environmental mandate 
 dictated by the permits. Results from the pilot program may require 
 changes in the plan or may result in recommendations for statutory 
 change.
<p> 
 2. EPA, in partnership with other federal agencies, should establish 
 a small business center as a pilot program to expand the technology 
 options available in the marketplace by helping businesses obtain 
 financing for new technologies.
<p> The center would identify environmental business opportunities, 
 develop a business plan, provide marketing information, and identify 
 funding sources. Assistance should be provided to 10 small businesses 
 from this center by October 1994, and to another 10 by October 1995.
<p> 
 3. EPA should develop and promote a series of monographs to assist 
 industry in identifying pollution prevention opportunities and making 
 informed, responsible design choices.
<p> These monographs should include information on specific industry 
 processes, products, and systems in the areas of comparative risks, 
 performance, and costs, including environmental costs. The 
 monographs, describing the use of analytical tools including full 
 cost accounting systems and substitute assessment analytical tools, 
 should be completed by October 1994.
<p> 
 4. EPA should establish five partnerships similar to the McClellan 
 Air Force Base model to expand available sites where developers and 
 vendors can test and evaluate their technologies.
<p> Two of the partnerships, including McClellan, should be established 
 by April 1994, and three more by January 1995. These partnerships 
 would help EPA leverage its limited resources to promote innovative 
 technology development by industry.
<p> 
 5. EPA should establish an environmental technology performance 
 verification program by October 1995, to evaluate and validate the 
 claims of environmental technology vendors.
<p> Under this program, EPA could designate an independent group, with 
 the assistance of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
 to perform the assessments. These assessments would be similar to 
 those conducted by Underwriters Laboratories for electrical 
 equipment. The program would provide users, financiers, EPA, and 
 others with consistent, credible protocols and testing data and 
 independent review and verification of performance claims. Protocols 
 for the first technology applications should be developed by October 
 1996.
<p> 
 6. EPA should establish five partnerships with different industries 
 to reengineer common products and processes in order to promote 
 environmentally cleaner manufacturing processes.
<p> The purpose of this effort would be to reduce the use of hazardous 
 materials and eliminate or reduce toxic releases during production 
 release and disposal. The first two of these partnerships should be 
 established by October 1994. Another partnership involving the 
 computer industry should be established by January 1995. Two 
 additional partnerships for reengineering common products and 
 processes should commence by September 1995.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 <DL><DT><DD>Implementation of these recommendations would result in a cleaner 
 environment, and industry and the taxpayers would save money. The 
 potential also exists for the creation of new industries, or 
 expansion of existing small industries, as new technologies are 
 developed. Also, exportable technology would be produced, putting the 
 United States in a better position to compete internationally in the 
 growing environmental technology market. 
<p></DL> 
 <H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p><DL><DT><DD> This proposal should be funded from existing sources. Over the long 
 term, the use of such partnerships should produce significant 
 reductions in cost, but these gains cannot be estimated at this time.

<p><H2> EPA06:  Stop the Export of Banned Pesticides</H2>
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p>The United States is a major exporter of pesticides. The 
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that in 1991, 
 approximately 400 million pounds of pesticides were exported from the 
 United States.(1) This represents 10 percent of the approximately 4 
 billion pounds of pesticides that are used annually throughout the 
 world.(2) The United States exports pesticides to both industrialized 
 and developing countries.
<p> Before a pesticide may be sold or distributed in the United States, 
 it must be registered by EPA. The EPA reaches registration decisions 
 from an evaluation of the risks posed by the use of the pesticide as 
 compared to the benefits the use confers. If EPA determines that a 
 product cannot be safely used, a registration application may be 
 denied, or, in the case of an already registered product, an existing 
 registration may be canceled.
<p> Although decisions by EPA determine whether a pesticide can be sold 
 in the United States, there are no registration requirements for 
 pesticides that are to be exported. The Federal Insecticide, 
 Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act does, however, impose certain labeling 
 and notification requirements for exported pesticides. If these 
 requirements are met, pesticides can be exported even if they are not 
 registered, or were registered and then had that registration 
 cancelled.
<p> EPA has found that most developing countries are illequipped to 
 handle hazardous pesticides. Only a few countries have effective laws 
 governing the import, use, and disposal of pesticides. In 1990, the 
 World Health Organization estimated that as many as 25 million 
 workers in developing countries could suffer an incident of pesticide 
 poisoning each year. International pressure is growing to place 
 stricter controls on the export and import of pesticides.
<p> An issue has arisen in the United States over the export of 
 pesticides that have been banned here but are used in other countries 
 whose crops are then sold in the United States. This "circle of 
 poison" has raised concerns about the safety of some imported foods. 
 About 25 percent of all the foods available to U.S. consumers are 
 imported.
<p> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of 
 Agriculture (USDA) are responsible for ensuring that all foods, 
 including imports, comply with our food safety laws. The FDA and USDA 
 monitor fruit, grain, meat, and dairy products for contaminants, 
 including pesticide residues. Under U.S. food safety laws, foods 
 found to contain residues of a pesticide for which no allowable 
 pesticide limit (tolerance) exists, or that exceed an allowable 
 tolerance, are considered to be adulterated. Such foods are 
 prohibited from sale in the United States.
<p> Of the 18,113 monitoring tests taken by FDA in 1989, 10,719 
 surveillance samples were performed on imported foods. Of these, 97 
 percent contained no violative residues. Most of the violations found 
 consisted of residues for which no tolerance levels had been set.
<p> The government only samples a relatively small number of food 
 shipments. A majority of food shipments enter the country without 
 having undergone any analysis. Further, unless a pesticide has been 
 registered, the government is not likely to have an analytical method 
 capable of detecting residues of a pesticide. Thus, some residues 
 that may be harmful to the public health could be missed.
<p> To address some of the concerns for pesticide exposure incidents in 
 developing countries, as well as to improve the safety of imported 
 foods, the EPA helped develop an international information-sharing 
 program led by the United Nations (U.N.) known as the Prior Informed 
 Consent (PIC) procedures. The PIC can provide importing countries 
 information on pesticides that have been banned or severely 
 restricted in order to protect human health or the environment. An 
 importing country can then notify the U.N. whether a particular 
 banned pesticide is acceptable to that country for future import.
<p> The PIC has broad international support, but it is a voluntary 
 program. Thus, even though the United States, other major exporting 
 countries, and major pesticide trade organizations in many countries 
 have indicated a willingness to comply with PIC, the program is 
 difficult to enforce. There are few steps that can be taken under PIC 
 against pesticide exporters who choose to export a banned pesticide, 
 against the wishes of an importing country.
<p> In addition to relying on PIC, many countries, especially in the 
 developing world, rely on the United States for information about 
 pesticide use. Our regulatory system serves as a valuable guide for 
 developing countries that lack the resources and/or expertise to 
 evaluate health and safety data or establish worker training 
 programs. Further, many countries that export food products to the 
 United States need information about our standards and regulations so 
 that they can meet the requirements for foods to be shipped here. 
 Technical assistance and training from the United States are in great 
 demand in the developing world. The United States receives more 
 requests than it can fulfill to assist these countries in their 
 efforts to use pesticides more safely.
<p> Given the necessity to break the circle of poison, and the technical 
 expertise the United States can provide other countries, EPA should 
 embark on a three-pronged approach to make the world safer from the 
 harmful effects of many pesticides.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>1. EPA should work with Congress in developing legislation that would 
 stop the United States from exporting banned pesticides by June 1994.
<p> This legislation should require appropriate analytical methods that 
 can detect the presence of residues of non-registered pesticides and 
 require exporters to keep records and report on types of pesticides 
 exported, country of destination, and general information on 
 pesticide use. 
<p> 
 2. EPA should work with appropriate national and international 
 organizations and private industry to develop policies that make PIC 
 more enforceable throughout the world.
<p> EPA should seek legislation that gives it the authority to enforce 
 PIC in the United States. This could serve to spur other countries, 
 especially developing countries, to implement similar laws and 
 policies to enforce PIC. These countries look to the United States 
 for the lead in such matters, because of its technical expertise.
<p> 
 3. EPA, in cooperation with USDA and FDA, should consider developing 
 a public-private sector partnership to provide technical assistance 
 to developing countries by January 1995. 
<p> This program should address technical assistance and training 
 requests from developing countries on how to safely use pesticides.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 <DL><DT><DD>This would be a step toward breaking the circle of poison, that is, 
 ensuring that U.S. citizens are not exposed to harmful chemicals on 
 imported foods. Additionally, it would assist developing nations to 
 better control the import of potentially harmful pesticides. The 
 program would enhance the status of the United States in the eyes of 
 developing nations as a leader for a safer environment.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p><DL><DT><DD> EPA should be able to begin implementing this program with current 
 resources.</DL>

<H2>Environmental Protection Agency</H2><p>
<p><H3>Recommendations and Actions</H3>
<HR>
<H2> EPA07:  Establish Measurable Goals, Performance Standards, 
and Strategic Planning Within EPA</H2>
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has targeted 
 its activities toward the implementation of a broad range of statutes 
 and related regulations. These were developed incrementally as major 
 national environmental problems were identified. In response to ever-
 increasing statutory mandates, the agency has focused more on 
 implementing statutes and less on achieving measurable environmental 
 results.
<p> The agency has also pursued a media- specific approach to pollution 
 control that ignores connections between air, water, and waste. The 
 basic approach has been one of command-and-control, one that often 
 addresses environmental issues in a way that transfers pollution 
 among various media rather than eliminating it. Though this approach 
 has resulted in significant environmental improvements over the past 
 20 years, other mechanisms must be developed to address the complex, 
 multi-media environmental problems our country faces today.
<p> Over the past few years, the agency's strategic planning process has 
 begun to take hold, but it is still ineffective in directing EPA's 
 resources and implementation in an optimal manner. There is a growing 
 need to link strategic planning with budget formulation and 
 implementation efforts. This would allow the agency to aim for 
 measurable environmental goals.
<p> The need for strategic planning and performance measurement has been 
 recognized governmentwide. The Government Performance and Results Act 
 of 1993, signed by President Clinton on August 3, 1993, requires the 
 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to designate 10 agencies as 
 pilot projects in planning, measuring, and reporting performance by 
 fiscal year 1994. By September 1997, each agency will submit to OMB 
 and Congress a strategic plan that will set measurable goals, direct 
 agency activities and resources, and identify progress towards 
 objectives.
<p> As its responsibilities continue to grow in a tight fiscal climate, 
 EPA must maximize its opportunity to direct environmental change. A 
 strategic planning process that emerges from broad-based 
 participation and continuous assessment of progress will be the 
 vehicle for transforming agency direction in coming years. This plan 
 should be a living document that guides strategy and implementation 
 on an annual basis and provides the criteria for measuring progress. 
 It should provide the context to link resources to activities and 
 activities to environmental results. As these strategic plans are 
 developed, current management practices and delivery systems need to 
 be reassessed and revised to efficiently deliver the agency's 
 services. Building appropriate incentives for headquarters, regions, 
 states, and industry to participate in the process will be an 
 important component of reinventing EPA.
<p> Clarification of EPA's roles and responsibilities in the larger 
 environmental community will guide stakeholders in determining their 
 own function in the country's overall environmental agenda. Many 
 federal agencies contribute to environmental problems that others are 
 charged with correcting. Opportunities for working together to avoid 
 such inefficiencies must be reexamined to ensure maximum 
 effectiveness in targeting the nation's natural resources. EPA needs 
 to take a lead role in establishing a national environmental 
 strategic planning process and an implementation program to go with 
 it.
<p> Intra-agency partnerships can provide innovative approaches in 
 establishing multi-media strategic for environmentally sensitive 
 areas around the nation. Focusing on specific geographic regions will 
 provide a practical means for the current structure of media-specific 
 programs to integrate their resources and implementation. Such 
 cooperative activity should yield long-term working relationships and 
 reveal potential changes in organizational structure.
<p> </DL>
 <H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> <DL><DT><DD>1. By April 1994, EPA should prepare measurable, internal goals to 
 provide direction for assessing and redirecting existing EPA 
 strategies where needed.
<p> This action will result in the development of a draft strategic plan 
 and will begin to provide the needed direction for fiscal year 1995 
 operating plans and the fiscal year 1996 budget formulation process. 
 The broader participation of other federal agencies in setting goals 
 will set the stage to develop integrated strategies and budgets for 
 selected geographic areas of the country.
<p> 
 2. By April 1995, EPA should draft measurable environmental goals for 
 the range of environmental problems the United States faces.
<p> Development of these goals must be done in the context of long-term 
 environmental and economic sustainability, with direct involvement by 
 appropriate federal agencies, as well as broad-based discussions with 
 states and the public.
<p> 
 3. EPA should develop performance measures for selected goals and 
 strategies consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act 
 of 1993 (GPRA).
<p> EPA should submit a proposal to OMB to be included as a GPRA pilot 
 agency.
<p> </DL>
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 Although these proposals are broad in scope, they encompass a core 
 issue that will determine the agency's overall success in 
 establishing and addressing this country's environmental agenda in 
 the future.
<p> 
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p> This proposal is cost-neutral. There are no additional costs above 
 current operating costs. Imposed planning should reduce costs over 
 the long term, but this impact cannot be estimated at this time.

<p><H2>EPA08:  Reform EPA's Contract Management Process</H2>
<p> 
<p> <b>Background</b>
<p>
<p> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has become increasingly 
 reliant on contractors. Contract obligations have increased from $600 
 million in 1986 to approximately $1.4 billion in 1992. Currently, the 
 agency has about 700 active contracts serving nearly all program 
 areas, including information systems development, pesticide testing, 
 and Superfund site clean-up.
<p> Several reasons underlie this contractor dependence. The use of 
 contractors has provided EPA with a wide array of specific technical 
 expertise on a short-term basis, allowing the agency to forgo long-
 term hiring commitments. In addition, over the years, the agency has 
 been more successful in getting dollars to hire contractors, than in 
 getting dollars for employee salaries. Finally, the law sometimes 
 encourages the use of contractors, as in the legislation governing 
 Superfund site cleanup.
<p> EPA has been subject to criticism because of inadequate oversight of 
 its contractors. During the last four years, agency contract 
 management practices have come under the scrutiny of numerous General 
 Accounting Office and Inspector General reports, as well as several 
 congressional hearings. EPA has long focused on its central mission-
 environmental protection-and not on strong contract management, but 
 the recent criticism is pushing the agency to carefully analyze its 
 current methods and to target specific areas for major improvement. 
 Contract management was declared a material weakness in the agency's 
 December 1992 report on internal controls to the President, required 
 by the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA).(1)
<p> Improving contract management practices at EPA requires an analysis 
 of several issues such as resources, contractor-client relations, and 
 accountability. With respect to resources, EPA does not have enough 
 personnel with the technical knowledge needed to adequately manage 
 contractor performance. Since 1981, EPA's annual contract obligations 
 increased by 237 percent in nominal terms, yet the agency's overall 
 work force grew by only 25 percent during the same period.(2)
<p> EPA is actively searching for opportunities to reallocate staff to 
 contract management. In addition, EPA's Standing Committee on 
 Contracts Management, formed to review the entire contracting 
 process, made several recommendations in its June 1992 report. Of 
 particular importance were the recommendations to highlight contract 
 management in agency vacancy announcements and to place an emphasis 
 on improving the quality of oversight resources currently in place. 
 Doing more with less, however, can only go so far, and if EPA's 
 responsibilities continue to multiply, it will have to match 
 improvements in contract management with a commitment to shrink its 
 dependence on outside help.
<p> The use of so many contractors has engendered problematic ties 
 between EPA and the non-governmental firms to which it turns for 
 assistance. The transformation of a formal contractor-client 
 relationship into the more informal interaction between employer and 
 employee carries potential risks. Other problems exist when 
 contractors have performed inherently governmental functions, such as 
 payroll review. Incumbent firms may receive an unfair advantage when 
 their contract comes up for renewal. Perhaps most serious is that 
 agency oversight has become lax, leading to vague work instructions, 
 nebulous lines of authority, and compromised individual 
 responsibility. Such abuses have been documented, as in the March 31, 
 1992, Inspector General audit of EPA's relationship with the Computer 
 Sciences Corporation.(3)
<p> There is also the possibility of conflicts of interest. This issue 
 has emerged frequently regarding the Superfund Program, where the 
 delegation of cleanup duties to a firm implicated in the initial 
 pollution raises concerns. In some instances contractors are being 
 hired to clean up the pollution that they have created. The conflict 
 of interest risk is particularly worrisome because current federal 
 regulations require contractors to self-police, a process that does 
 not adequately safeguard against abuse.
<p> To improve contract management, EPA should pursue a multitiered 
 approach. As a start, the agency's own Standing Committee has acted 
 on five specific, complementary steps. These include:
<p> (1) implementation of performance standards for contract management, 
 complete with an awards program, to foster awareness and 
 accountability throughout the agency;
<p> (2) encouragement of better contract planning through new 
 requirements for annual acquisition strategies; 
<p> (3) provision of written guidelines wherever possible to facilitate 
 reliable contracting, such as in preparation of Independent 
 Government Cost Estimates or in FMFIA assessments; 
<p> (4) assembly of a quality contracting team pilot composed of a 
 Procuring Contracting Officer, an Administrative Contracting Officer, 
 a Project Officer, an Office of General Counsel Representative, and 
 any needed specialists, to monitor a contract from its inception to 
 closeout; 
<p> (5) injection of more competition into the contracting process by 
 awarding contracts to multiple vendors. This would guarantee a 
 constant alternative to the incumbent and promote continuing 
 competition to meet agency standards even after contract award. 
<p> 
 These measures reappear in EPA's response to a March 1993 review of 
 agency contract policy requested by the Director of the Office of 
 Management and Budget (OMB). In that same response, EPA requested 
 authority over its intramural-extramural budget distribution as a way 
 of empowering the agency to reform its dealings with contractors.
<p> Though the recommendations of both the Standing Committee and the OMB 
 review should improve EPA contract management process, they leave 
 some difficult issues unaddressed. Foremost among them may be the 
 agency's fundamental high reliance on contractors, and the blurring 
 it promotes between contractor and agency responsibilities. Without 
 appropriate controls, training, and monitoring staff, it will be 
 difficult to prevent abuses. Administrator Browner has begun to 
 grapple with this quandary by ordering an independent analysis of the 
 agency's use of intramural-extramural resources to determine, among 
 other things, whether EPA's current distribution of dollars best 
 serves its mission. Administrator Browner has also pledged to 
 spearhead reform in agency culture by emphasizing that management and 
 accountability will be cornerstones of her administration.
<p> With respect to accountability, EPA has failed to hold both 
 contractors and its own personnel accountable for fiscal and legal 
 discrepancies. On the fiscal front, there have been blatant indirect 
 cost abuses by contractors. Indirect costs, those charges not 
 immediately related to specific work orders, include utilities, 
 office rent, administrative salaries, health insurance costs, and an 
 array of similar items. These expenses are generally stated as a 
 percentage of direct labor. Certain costs--alcoholic beverages, for 
 example, or customized chocolates imprinted with the company logo--
 are unallowable. Inspector General audit reports disclosed just these 
 violations by EPA contractor CH2M Hill in 1992.
<p> The agency has also not held its personnel accountable to the legal 
 requirements delineated by the Business Opportunity Development 
 Reform Act of 1989. This legislation requires competition among 8(a) 
 contractors for procurement with an estimated value above $3 
 million.(4) Recent Inspector General audits of EPA's Office of 
 Research and Development laboratories have found instances where 
 requirements were split and government cost estimates understated to 
 stay under the $3 million threshold, thus avoiding competition.(5)
<p> EPA has confronted these problems through several tacks. Many of the 
 aforementioned recommendations of its Standing Committee have been 
 implemented. The Committee's proposal to tighten indirect cost 
 recovery with the assistance of OMB represents a more focused 
 response, as does EPA's participation in the interagency contract 
 management review. This effort, launched by the Office of Federal 
 Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the summer of 1992, challenged internal 
 auditors in 12 civilian agencies to find unallowable expenses in 
 contractor claims and to determine the frequency of negotiated 
 settlements disallowing the costs. EPA's report to OFPP contained 41 
 agency-specific findings and 38 governmentwide--a total of 79 
 recommendations, which accounted for one-third of proposals received 
 from all 12 organizations. Agency action on its internal findings is 
 nearing completion. On a final front, Administrator Browner's 
 initiatives, particularly her program to establish Senior Resource 
 Officials (SROs) responsible for fiscal and ethical management, 
 should substantially support her pledge to restore EPA 
 accountability.(6)
<p> The agency's tripartite response to its accountability deficit, based 
 on proposals from the Standing Committee, interagency review team, 
 and the Administrator, should lessen much of the abuse prevalent thus 
 far, if these proposals are integrated and implemented. A familiar 
 caveat remains, however, concerning EPA's long-term prognosis: if the 
 agency's growing responsibilities are met with an increasing reliance 
 on contractors, enforcing accountability will only become more of a 
 challenge.
<p> 
 <H3>Actions</H3>
<p>
<p> 1. EPA should fully implement performance standards for contract 
 management advocated by the Standing Committee, OMB review, and the 
 Administrator by January 1994. 
<p> Contract management awareness and accountability should be 
 strengthened through the agency performance standard and evaluation 
 process. Individual performance standards for contract management 
 should be one of several human resource management mechanisms that 
 directly support the integration of resource management into the 
 priorities and responsibilities of staff throughout the agency. 
 Others include highlighting contract management in job announcements 
 and position descriptions, providing better training opportunities, 
 and promoting more definitive disciplinary and awards programs. Since 
 so much of EPA's staff is involved in contract management, the human 
 resource mechanisms are a primary means of ensuring accountability. 
 Taken with other agency contract management improvements, these 
 changes should be evaluated overall in terms of how the agency has 
 improved its ability to manage contracts.
<p> 
 2. EPA should institutionalize the oversight recommendations of the 
 Standing Committee, the OMB Review, and the Administrator by January 
 1995.
<p> EPA should evaluate the success of the agency's quality contract team 
 pilot to determine how well the contract was managed, costs were 
 controlled, and goods and services were rendered. If the quality 
 contract team proves to be more effective, EPA should begin 
 implementing it throughout the agency by the end of fiscal year 1994, 
 with the condition that all team members be inhouse agency personnel. 
 EPA should supplement this program by placing the SROs advocated by 
 Administrator Browner throughout the agency by the end of fiscal year 
 1994. EPA should ensure that each of the agency's 10 regional offices 
 has at least one SRO, and this official should be held accountable 
 for extramural resource management in the region.
<p> 
 3. EPA should maximize competition in the contracting process.
<p> EPA should evaluate its pilot program to award multiple contracts 
 with the same work statement to different vendors (a strategy that 
 functions by farming out individual delivery orders and assignments 
 to competing contractors). The contracts should be awarded by the end 
 of the fiscal year 1994. At the midway point of the three-year 
 contract, the agency should assess its effectiveness. If the pilot 
 project is found to yield net savings when compared to the 
 traditional practice of employing single contracts for a project's 
 entirety, EPA should consider implementation by the end of fiscal 
 year 1996.
<p> 
 4. OMB should provide EPA with more flexibility in determining the 
 appropriate balance of extramural versus intramural resources.
<p> EPA is currently conducting an independent analysis to identify this 
 balance. Once an appropriate balance is identified, EPA should begin 
 converting contractor dollars to regular staff to better achieve that 
 balance. Conversion of contractor dollars to fulltime equivalent 
 (FTE) positions will have to be accomplished within the context of 
 the President's Executive Order to reduce federal employment. 
 Additional FTEs may be obtained through the agency's efforts to 
 streamline operations.
<p> 
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 Better contract management and over-sight should result in 
 significant contract dollar savings and improved contract services.
<p> 
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p> This proposal is cost-neutral. Additional FTEs needed to provide 
 oversight and management of contract work that is currently done by 
 contractors will be reassigned from units through agency streamlining 
 efforts.

 <H2>EPA09:  Establish a Blueprint for Environmental 
Justice Throughout EPA's Operations</H2>
<p> 
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p> Pollution is not a problem faced equally by everyone in our society. 
 Minorities and low-income communities often face higher exposure to 
 environmental hazards by living near waste sites, by being subjected 
 to harmful chemicals in poorly maintained housing, or through 
 exposure to pesticides in farm fields. In light of the growing 
 importance of this issue, a national policy of environmental justice 
 (the distribution of environmental risks across population and income 
 groups, and the policy responses to these distributions) needs to be 
 articulated.
<p> Environmental justice is not a new problem. It was first reported 
 more than two decades ago. The problem of environmental justice did 
 not receive national attention until 1982, however, when officials 
 decided to locate a toxic chemical landfill in predominantly African-
 American Warren County, North Carolina. Protests similar to those of 
 the civil rights movements of the 1960s erupted. In response to these 
 protests, the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigated, focusing 
 on the socioeconomic and racial composition of communities 
 surrounding the four major hazardous waste landfills in the South. 
 GAO concluded that three of the four landfills were located in 
 communities that were predominantly African-American.
<p> Since then environmental justice has received more attention. A 
 nationwide study in 1987 found that the proportion of minorities in 
 communities that have a commercial hazardous waste facility is about 
 double that in communities without such facilities. In 1990, the 
 Michigan Conference on Race and the Incidence of Environmental 
 Hazards was convened. In response to the Michigan conference's 
 findings that no public policies were in place to require monitoring 
 equity in the distribution of environmental quality, the 
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a working group on 
 environmental equity. 
<p> In a June 1992 report, the working group determined that there was a 
 general lack of information concerning pollution and minority and 
 low-income communities. There were indications of problems in siting 
 and enforcement of pollution-generating activities in minority and 
 low-income communities. The group concluded that EPA had no specific 
 policy dealing with this issue. In response, EPA established the 
 Office of Environmental Equity to focus on three major areas: 
 education and outreach; community and economic development; and 
 technical and financial assistance to community groups. The National 
 Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), adopted in 1970, sets forth an 
 environmental policy for the nation. Specifically, NEPA states that:
 it is the continuing policy of the federal government, in 
 cooperation with State and local governments, and other concerned 
 public and private organizations, to use all practicable means and 
 measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner 
 calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and 
 maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in 
 productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other 
 requirements of present and future generations of Americans.(1)
<p> 
 In her statement before the House Government Operations Committee on 
 May 6, 1993, Administrator Browner affirmed the need to address 
 environmental justice: as we undertake programs to reduce risks, we 
 must explicitly recognize the ethnic, economic, and cultural makeup
 of the people we  are trying to protect. We now believe that people 
 of color and low  income are disproportionately affected by some
 environmental risks:  the risk of living near landfills, municipal 
 waste combustors, or  hazardous waste sites; the risks posed 
 by lead or asbestos in old,  poorly maintained housing; the risk 
 of exposure to pesticides in farm  fields; and the risk of eating 
 contaminated fish when fish is a  mainstay of their diet.(2)
<p> 
 There are large environmentally related health costs and other 
 concerns associated with minority workers and low-income communities. 
 For example, studies have shown that migrant farm workers suffer from 
 neurological disorders, cancer, and birth defects at a higher rate 
 than the normal population. Another example is exposure to lead. EPA 
 has stated that lead in paint and lead dust are major causes of 
 poisoning in young children. Although there have been no definitive 
 studies on the overall health costs to minority workers and low-
 income communities, there is general agreement that related health 
 care costs could be quite high. While minority and low-income 
 communities inordinately suffer the effects of environmental hazards, 
 all U.S. taxpayers asorb the additional health costs incurred.
<p> Administrator Browner has made environmental equity a key policy 
 theme in her administration. The President's fiscal year 1994 budget 
 contains an additional $15 million to address lead paint hazards, a 
 particular hazard for minority children. The administrator has moved 
 to establish an interagency group to address environmental justice 
 issues across all federal agencies. EPA is working with federal 
 health agencies to strengthen the scientific and health effects data 
 related to communities of color and those of low income, and EPA has 
 initiated three environmental justice projects with the Department of 
 Justice, one of which will be used to establish enforcement 
 priorities.
<p> Congress has also shown a strong interest in environmental justice. 
 In pending EPA cabinet legislation-- H.R. 3425, introduced by 
 Representative Conyers (D-MI)-- there are numerous provisions 
 regarding environmental justice. In May 1993, Representative Lewis 
 (D-GA) introduced H.R. 2105, the Environmental Justice Act of 1993. 
 This bill would require EPA to publish a list of geographic areas 
 with the highest amounts of toxic chemicals. It would require EPA to 
 inspect all toxic chemical facilities operating in Environmentally 
 High Impact Areas (EHIAs) and impose a moratorium on the siting of 
 new chemical facilities in EHIAs. On June 24, 1993, Senator Baucus 
 introduced Senate Bill 1161, the Environmental Justice Act of 1993, 
 which generally parallels the House bill.
<p> While the environmental justice movement gains momentum, a new 
 awareness permeates the environmental community. There exist 
 differing views on prioritizing efforts. EPA is taking action, and 
 more needs to be done.
<p> 
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
  
 1. EPA should develop, by mid-1994, a blueprint of <H3>Actions</H3> that will 
 incorporate environmental justice considerations into all aspects of 
 EPA operations.
<p> Environmental justice will be fully reflected in EPA <H3>Actions</H3> only if 
 it is regularly considered in operational and policy decisions. This 
 would include rulemaking, permitting, data collection, siting of 
 projects and facilities, enforcement, education, and outreach. EPA 
 must also continue its efforts to develop a more culturally and 
 racially diverse workforce. EPA should ensure that all programs 
 receiving federal assistance give assurances that environmental 
 justice issues are appropriately addressed and that all activities 
 subject to EPA oversight abide by the same environmental justice 
 considerations as EPA does. The agency should take a lead role in 
 establishing interagency cooperation on environmental justice issues.
<p> 
 2. EPA should prepare an annual report providing analysis of the 
 progress it has made regarding environmental justice and should 
 develop appropriate remedies for communities that have suffered 
 environmental injustice.
<p> Other <H3>Actions</H3> could include liaison with states and other federal 
 agencies and could emphasize that environmental justice is a shared 
 responsibility of all federal agencies and, ultimately, state, local, 
 and tribal governments. Emphasis could be placed on assessing the 
 environmental impact statements' discussion of socioeconomic 
 considerations apparently missing in some decisions.
<p> 
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 Pending legislation to elevate EPA to Cabinet status, proposed 
 environmental justice legislation, and a proposed environmental 
 justice Executive Order will significantly affect this program. The 
 environmental justice movement is gaining momentum. Proposed 
 environmental justice legislation and the expected Executive Order 
 will require some , facilitate other , and encourage 
 other behaviors. 
<p> 
<p><H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p>
<p> This proposal is cost-neutral. EPA would need an additional five 
 employees to carry out the proposed environmental justice activities. 
 This additional staff will be allocated from existing personnel. It 
 is reasonable to expect some long-term reduction in health costs in 
 low-income and minority communities as the environmental quality of 
 their communities improves; however, this impact cannot be estimated 
 at this time.

<p><H2>EPA10:  Promote Quality Science for Quality Decisions</H2>
<p> 
 <b>Background</b>
<p> Rulemaking and other policy decisions at the Environmental Protection 
 Agency (EPA) almost invariably rely on science, with the nature and 
 extent of that reliance varying considerably from one instance to 
 another. But one factor is constant: quality must be a first-order 
 concern in deciding what scientific information is relevant, how it 
 is presented, and how it is used. Quality science includes the 
 following characteristics: clear identification and prioritization of 
 the most important scientific questions to be addressed; 
 identification and use of the most appropriate and powerful 
 experimental and analytical designs; employment of state-of-the-art 
 experimental techniques; accurate measurements; validation and 
 independent review processes; and recruitment, retention, and reward 
 of high-quality scientific personnel.
<p> Regulatory and research science at EPA is performed in its 12 
 research and development laboratories, its 23 regional and program 
 office laboratories, and its program and policy offices. Many 
 contributions made by EPA scientists are widely respected by the 
 research community. For example, its analytical methods, predictive 
 models, and risk-assessment guidelines are used as standards by other 
 agencies, nationally and abroad.
<p> Nonetheless, the role of science in EPA policies, decisions, and 
 <H3>Actions</H3> is much less prominent than it should be. A recent EPA-
 sponsored study noted that EPA is seen as distorting scientific 
 analysis to make them fit its policies.(1) The study recommendations 
 called for increased use of peer review, expanded inhouse research 
 capabilities, and establishment of risk-based priorities for research 
 and development (R&D). A subsequent study reinforced these ideas and 
 called specifically for consolidation of laboratories to achieve a 
 stronger programmatic focus in selected areas.(2)
<p> EPA must begin to focus its energies and resources in five key areas 
 if it is to bring its domestic recognition to the same high level the 
 agency enjoys internationally, as a science agency as well as a 
 regulatory agency. The first is in the recruiting, nurturing, and 
 development of its entry-level scientific staff. There is currently a 
 highly skilled, well-recognized scientific workforce in the Office of 
 Research and Development that is nearing retirement and will need 
 replacing, due to FTE limitations. EPA has not previously 
 demonstrated capabilities in this area. Scientific and technical 
 factors often receive insufficient weight in developing job 
 descriptions, setting performance standards, designing training 
 programs and career-development opportunities, creating career 
 ladders, and rewarding achievement.
<p> Second is peer review, quality assurance, and quality control. 
 Regulatory decisions are most likely to be cost-effective if they are 
 based on risk assessments or other technical work-products that 
 embody state-of-the-art scientific principles, models, and data. One 
 important procedure for obtaining such high-quality products is peer 
 review- that is, independent reviews by unbiased subject-matter 
 experts. Another key procedure is to require that the underlying data 
 be gathered in accordance with strict quality-assurance guidelines. 
 Although such procedures exist within EPA, they are not consistently 
 used. Historically, policy decisions have often lacked credibility 
 because they were based on work-products that either were obviously 
 flawed or lacked the endorsement of outside experts. As a 
 consequence, EPA regulatory decisions have been frequently perceived 
 by Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and other federal 
 agencies, industry, or the public as unsound.
<p> Third, good laboratory systems are necessary to maintain quality 
 science. Scientists cannot be effective without a quality 
 infrastructure for all EPA laboratories. This includes state-of-the-
 art facilities and instrumentation, well-equipped libraries, high-
 performance computing and telecommunications resources, and a 
 responsive procurement and budgeting system. Moreover, if 
 policymakers are to benefit from improvements to the science base, 
 more strategically focused investment in R&D is imperative. Recent 
 studies have noted that the R&D effort at EPA is neither large enough 
 nor focused enough to meet the mission requirements.
<p> A fourth area necessary to sustain quality science is administrative 
 oversight for R&D. Reductions in science and engineering career 
 positions in recent years not only have fostered undue dependence on 
 contractors but also have encumbered EPA scientists with new contract 
 management duties-thereby shifting their focus and their talents 
 toward administration and away from what they do best. Moreover, 
 laboratory scientists are unnecessarily encumbered by inflexible 
 budgets and the fact that job positions and contract dollars are not 
 interchangeable.
<p> Finally, communication and coordination between EPA policymakers and 
 scientific staff are too fragmented to be effective. For example, 
 inadequate coordination among programs and the laboratories has led 
 to science being practiced in isolation and with no apparent impact 
 on the research agendas of other agencies.
<p> 
<p><H3>Actions</H3>
<p> 1. EPA should work to establish guidelines for professional 
 development and promotion of scientific and technical staff.
<p> EPA should review and evaluate best practices of other federal 
 science agencies for example, the National Institutes of Health, 
 which have made progress in developing successful personnel systems 
 and tenure tracks for scientific and technical employees.
<p> 
 2. EPA should expand the use of peer review and quality-assurance 
 procedures to promote excellence in science.
<p> Through specific policy guidance from the Office of the 
 Administrator, existing procedures for peer review and quality 
 assurance would be integrated further into EPA programs.
<p> 
 3. The EPA Administrator should assess the organizational 
 effectiveness and appropriate structures of EPA's laboratories.
<p> The President's budget request for fiscal 1994 includes funds for a 
 study to address research needs and to identify options for making 
 EPA's research more efficient. As a part of the study, EPA should 
 also identify management and administrative processes that can be 
 streamlined.
<p> 
 4. EPA should develop a plan to integrate opportunities for increased 
 scientific communications within and outside EPA.
<p> Through increased use of workshops, temporary reassignments, and 
 other methods, EPA scientists would gain more opportunities to stay 
 current with the advances in environmental science and its 
 applications. In this way, EPA can better keep congressional staff, 
 members of the news media, and the general public informed about the 
 state of the environment and <H3>Implications</H3> of the latest research 
 findings.
<p> 
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 Improvements in the quality of science at EPA will result in renewed 
 credibility and stature for EPA's scientists. In addition, regulatory 
 decisionmaking will be based on optimal scientific analysis.
<p> 
 <H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p> There are no additional costs associated with this issue.

<p><H3>Recommendations and Actions</H3>
<HR>

<H2>EPA11:  Reorganize EPA's Office of Enforcement</H2>
<p> 
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement program is 
 responsible for bringing parties who are violating the nation's 
 environmental laws into compliance, preparing and litigating cases 
 against these parties, and helping to forge effective responses to 
 harmful environmental conditions. Reorganization of EPA's enforcement 
 operation represents an excellent opportunity to achieve efficiencies 
 in government.
<p> In the early 1980's, EPA reassigned and separated its enforcement 
 responsibilities. EPA placed the environmental compliance engineering 
 and inspections staff, which provides the technical expertise 
 necessary to ascertain whether a source is in violation, into the 
 individual media-specific program offices (Air, Water, Solid Waste, 
 and Toxics). In addition, EPA placed the legal enforcement staff into 
 a separate Office of Enforcement (OE). The regional enforcement 
 divisions were abolished. This decentralized and limited the 
 coordination and management of environmental enforcement within the 
 agency.
<p> The organizational structure created in 1981 continues to define the 
 shape of EPA enforcement today. Presently, there is no centralized 
 authority vested in any one Assistant Administrator for targeting, 
 priority setting, and development and management of enforcement 
 resources. In fact, enforcement priority setting is currently shared 
 by five assistant administrators and 10 regional administrators.
<p> As a result, enforcement has not been a sufficiently high priority 
 for any of the program offices at EPA headquarters, which have 
 conflicting priorities such as permitting and regulation development. 
 In addition, persons at all levels of the agency must be tied into 
 protracted and frequently repetitious consultations over enforcement 
 priorities and implementation plans. For example, the development of 
 a single enforcement initiative typically involves extensive 
 discussion with six different EPA program offices. This situation is 
 not only frustrating to personnel within EPA, but recently caused the 
 Department of Justice's Assistant Attorney General for Environment 
 and Natural Resources to ask for a single point of contact at EPA for 
 enforcement issues.
<p> In addition, the present system adversely affects EPA's ability to 
 address multi-media environmental problems (those affecting more than 
 just one medium, such as air, water, or land). Specifically, it is 
 difficult to develop comprehensive enforcement responses to 
 facilities that are in violation of more than one federal statute. 
 The current enforcement structure has thwarted EPA's ability to 
 implement multi-media enforcement, a top priority of the Clinton 
 Administration.
<p> The current structure also results in parallel and often duplicative 
 processes. For example, each case and policy matter typically 
 undergoes parallel review and analysis up through the office director 
 level in both OE and in related program offices. In the event of 
 disagreement, ultimately only the Administrator and the Deputy 
 Administrator are empowered to resolve these enforcement disputes. 
 Recently, it took more than nine months and the personal involvement 
 of the Administrator to resolve a disagreement among the Assistant 
 Administrator for Water, a Regional Administrator, and the Assistant 
 Administrator for Enforcement concerning the proper enforcement 
 response to a violation of the wetlands regulations.
<p> In addition to being inherently inefficient, this system promotes 
 "forum-shopping"-- choosing a media-specific program office that will 
 give the desired result. By going directly to a program office to 
 discuss an enforcement issue, outside parties (including regulated 
 sources) can effectively try to play one EPA office against another. 
<p> Simply stated, there is no single enforcement voice in the agency. 
 This results in a de-emphasis on enforcement, high transaction costs, 
 duplication of effort, and an inability to effectively pursue multi-
 media enforcement. This problem needs to be rectified.
<p> On July 22, 1993, in connection with the National Performance Review 
 effort, Administrator Browner announced that she intends to 
 consolidate and reorganize EPA's enforcement resources at 
 headquarters. To implement this, she has created a task force, which 
 is developing a plan for implementation by October 1993. A 
 consolidated structure will eliminate duplicative review chains, 
 force issues to final resolution much lower in the management chain, 
 and eliminate forum-shopping. Reorganizing headquarters enforcement 
 will improve EPA's effectiveness.
<p> 
<p><H3>Action</H3>
<p> 
 EPA should implement the Administrator's headquarters enforcement 
 reorganization proposal.
<p> This would bring the various EPA enforcement operations together 
 under the Office of the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement. 
 Within one year, it is anticipated that a reorganized OE should:
<p>      eliminate duplication of effort, thereby maximizing the 
 government's environmental enforcement efforts;
<p>      restore accountability to a presently fractured system;
<p>      provide a single voice on national environmental enforcement 
 priorities, thereby eliminating mixed and conflicting signals between 
 headquarters, the regional offices, and the states;
<p>      position the agency to respond to cutting-edge issues and 
 vulnerabilities, such as environmental justice, multi-media 
 enforcement capacity, penalty practice, measuring program success, 
 and enforcement data integration; and
<p>      enhance agency efficiency and promote cost effectiveness.
<p> 
<p><H3>Implications</H3>
<p> 
 In a time of flat or declining resources and a nearly unmanageable 
 case docket, EPA can no longer afford the inefficiencies of the 
 current organizational framework for enforcement. Reorganization 
 would enable EPA's OE to more effectively identify and respond to 
 national environmental problems, including targeting companies that 
 consistently violate the law, addressing sources that are responsible 
 for ecosystem destruction, and addressing pollution problems that 
 affect minority and low-income populations. A reorganization will 
 demonstrate the administration's commitment to eliminate duplication 
 and waste in the federal government and will leave EPA's enforcement 
 apparatus stronger and more responsive to the priorities of this 
 administration.
<p> 
 <H3>Fiscal Impact</H3>
<p> This issue will require no new expenditures. Reorganization will 
 produce a net savings by streamlining enforcement operations, and 
 result in a total savings of 138 workyears over the period of FY 1997 
 through FY 1999. It is assumed that dollar savings will be 
 reprogrammed to increase compliance monitoring, inspection, legal 
 enforcement, and other activities in EPA.

<H2> Agency Reinvention Activities</H2>
<p> 
<p> Getting Started
<p>
<p> After President Clinton's March 3, 1993, directive on reinventing the 
 government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved quickly 
 to capture the spirit of reform in an internal reinvention effort. 
 Administrator Browner committed more than 450 full-time employees 
 from across the agency to EPA's National Performance Review Team 
 (NPRT).
<p> In planning a new EPA, the Administrator charged NPRT to focus on the 
 principles of the governmentwide reinvention drive. The EPA's review 
 thus emphasized four themes: cutting red tape, putting customers 
 first, empowering employees to get results, and cutting back to 
 basics. These themes yielded specific proposals that should 
 fundamentally change the way EPA pursues its mission.
<p> To facilitate such fundamental change, NPRT directed a variety of 
 initiatives to generate involvement and activism throughout the 
 agency. The Administrator herself encouraged all employees to submit 
 ideas for improvement, and in addition, NPRT reviewed countless 
 responses to questionnaires designed to solicit comments from EPA 
 personnel, business interests, and local communities. The team 
 likewise combed through records of past seminars, conferences, and 
 reports for worthy recommendations lost or ignored.
<p> To promote more hands-on participation, NPRT sponsored forums at 
 several levels. The Administrator held a town meeting with Vice 
 President Gore that covered agencywide concerns ranging from 
 procurement to hiring to enforcement. Focus groups provided 
 opportunities for more extensive discussions, as program specialists 
 and managers from throughout EPA met with relevant NPRT personnel to 
 flesh out their suggestions. EPA's internal review team remains 
 committed to discussing the recommendations that emerge from its 
 cumulative analysis with all parties that have contributed input.
<p> 
<p>Reinvention Teams
<p>
<p> To create a new EPA, its review effort established an array of teams. 
 While each assumed a specific, defined role, together they formed an 
 interdisciplinary force. The Senior Leadership Council consisted of 
 EPA's top political and career executives. This group, which will 
 remain active through the entire course of the reinvention program, 
 advised the Administrator on NPR planning and implementation.
<p> The Process and Policy Teams, consisting of 19 groups in total, drew 
 members from all employee grade levels and all agency branches--
 headquarters, regional offices, program centers, and laboratories. 
 With sizes ranging from 18 to 25 people, the groups were charged with 
 developing in-depth reports on specific topic areas. The topics 
 included:
<p>
<p> Awards/Recognition Workforce Capacity
<p> Ecosystem Protection 
<p> Environmental Justice
<p> Environmental Technology 
<p> Extramural Resource Management
<p> Financial Management
<p> Intergovernmental Partnerships
<p> Internal Communications Workforce Diversity
<p> Management Development 
<p> Performance Management
<p> Permit Streamlining 
<p> Planning and Budgeting
<p> Pollution Prevention 
<p> Position Classification
<p> Quality Management 
<p> Quality Science
<p> Regulatory Development
<p> 
 The Leadership Team, consisting of about 20 employees from all agency 
 levels, provided direction and guidance to the process and policy 
 teams. In addition, it assumed responsibility for those cross-cutting 
 issues that lay outside the domain of individual parties.
<p> Finally, the Quality Advisory Group offered consultation, 
 facilitation, and logistical support to all other NPRT components, in 
 particular the Senior Leadership Council.
<p> 
<p> Lessons Learned
<p> 
 EPA's internal review identified several principles it should 
 instill, wherever possible, to better fulfill its mission. First, the 
 organization must commit to performance measurement. EPA has already 
 made progress here--Administrator Browner recently accepted the 
 recommendation of an earlier EPA improvement team to establish 
 environmental goals that will provide the American people with very 
 real means to gauge EPA performance. NPRT's findings indicate a need 
 to continue in this positive direction.
<p> The agency must likewise devote itself to reinvigorated customer 
 service. In the coming months, EPA will implement a comprehensive 
 outreach at the Administrator's behest to strengthen ties with its 
 constituents state and local governments, private sector 
 organizations, and the general public. Their input will yield the 
 best concrete plans to boost customer satisfaction.
<p> Improving relations with outside sources must include a drive to 
 empower partners. By decentralizing its programs and regulations, 
 injecting competition wherever applicable, and exerting leverage on 
 market forces, EPA can create openings for collaboration with the 
 larger community focused on environmental protection. Working 
 together, each accomplishes more.
<p> 
 Looking Forward

<p> EPA is already implementing several recommendations reshaping its 
 environmental goals and regulatory process.
<p> Administrator Browner recognizes that genuine change depends not just 
 on policy <H3>Actions</H3> but on the culture underlying them. To realize the 
 agency's new vision, the Administrator and her management team will 
 not only lead implementation of the present proposals, but will also 
 ensure that the EPA continues its employee outreach efforts. Public 
 forums, surveys, and focus groups will become agency mainstays. EPA 
 has established an NPR implementation steering committee made up of 
 senior management and members from EPA's internal NPR team. This 
 group will provide a focal point for future suggestions and a means 
 to guarantee monitoring and accountability as well. EPA will continue 
 to reinvent itself even as it comes closer still to fulfilling its 
 mission.

<H2> Executive Summary</H2></A>
<P>
<P>      The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides a 
 coordinated federal response to natural and man-made disasters. In 
 its early years, FEMA's focus was on the national security concern 
 with preparedness for nuclear war. Since 1989, however, peaceful 
 relations with the former Soviet Union, coupled with recent natural 
 disasters (the Loma Prieta earthquake and Hurricanes Hugo, Andrew, 
 and Iniki), have prompted a reexamination of the federal government's 
 role in emergency management. 
 
<P>      FEMA's appropriated budget for fiscal year 1993 is $827 million, 
 of which $292 million is for disaster relief. Disaster costs over and 
 above regular funding levels are covered by supplemental 
 congressional appropriations. For example, in fiscal year 1992, 
 Congress appropriated nearly $3 billion in additional funding for 
 FEMA operations in response to Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. FEMA 
 currently has 2,719 full-time employees working out of headquarters 
 offices in Washington, D.C., 10 regional offices, and other special 
 facilities. 
 
<P>      Primary responsibility for disaster response rests with state 
 and local governments; the federal role supplements that of the 
 states and localities. Currently, when a disaster overwhelms state 
 and local communities, FEMA coordinates the responses of 26 federal 
 agencies and the Red Cross. A Federal Response Plan assigns each 
 agency a lead or support role in carrying out 12 enumerated emergency 
 support functions. 
 
<P>      The NPR believes that to serve FEMA's customers most 
 effectively, the agency should define its basic mission more clearly 
 and organize around it. FEMA's basic role should be to serve as the 
 federal government's coordinator of assistance for state and local 
 governments overwhelmed by disaster, and as a catalyst for 
 development of comprehensive state and local emergency management 
 systems that emphasize loss control and prevention. 
 
<P>      The NPR report examines FEMA's recently adopted all-hazards 
 approach to emergency management. It also discusses measures needed 
 to improve the quality of FEMA's service to its customers. 
 
<P>     Clear criteria need to be developed for disaster declarations to
 help conserve federal resources. Federal disaster relief processes
 should be designed to increase state and local incentives for
 mitigation (i.e, the use of zoning, building codes, and other damage
 reduction measures). NPR recommendations would allocate costs more
 directly to risks, increase efficiency by creating incentives to
 mitigate disasters, and introduce performance measures into grant
 awards for mitigation and preparedness. 
 
<P>      Managerial changes are needed to create a more cohesive, 
 results-oriented work force at FEMA. Reforms include development of 
 the technical and teamwork skills of the agency's political and 
 career personnel to prevent the internal turf battles that have 
 weakened it in the past. 
 
<P>      For the first time in its history, FEMA is headed by an 
 emergency management professional, the former head of emergency 
 management for Arkansas, James Lee Witt. The new director has 
 designated the entire agency as a reinvention laboratory and 
 appointed an executive-level team to provide leadership for the 
 renewal efforts. He has met with and written to FEMA's employees and 
 its major external customers (state emergency managers and others) to 
 discuss his vision for the agency. 
 
<P>      Director Witt has emphasized the effectiveness of a 
 comprehensive risk-based, all-hazard national emergency management 
 system that addresses preparedness, mitigation, response, and 
 recovery. To that end, FEMA is developing legislation, new policies, 
 and organizational plans to invigorate the agency with a refocused 
 mission.

<H2>
   FEMA01: Shift Emphasis to Preparing for and Responding to the 
Consequences of All Disasters</H2> 
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p> 
<P>      The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) primary 
 functions fall into two broad categories: 
 <p>
<p>---preparedness for military attack (i.e., continuity of government, 
 civil defense, and state and local preparedness for a large-scale 
 military emergency), and 
 <p>
 <p>---response to natural hazards (i.e., preparedness, mitigation, 
 response, and recovery by all levels of government). 
 
<P>      During the early and mid-1980's, FEMA focused on the national 
 security function of enabling the U.S. government to function after a 
 massive nuclear attack. Preparing for that uncertain eventuality has 
 detracted from the agency's ability to effectively perform its major 
 responsibility of managing the federal government's preparation for 
 and response to natural disasters. With the end of the Cold War, this 
 country's defense strategy has begun to shift from preparing for a 
 major nuclear attack to dealing with smaller attacks by foreign 
 aggressors. From an emergency response point of view, the impact of a 
 small-scale nuclear attack is very similar to that of a natural 
 disaster, and entails similar response procedures (such as evacuation 
 plans, securing safety and medical attention, and attending to basic 
 human needs like food and shelter). 
 
<P>      Yet, in spite of the similarity of the responses to these two 
 types of events, FEMA's two-track approach--address preparedness for 
 nuclear attack (which is partly classified), and preparedness for 
 natural disaster (which is unclassified)--has diluted its 
 effectiveness in properly preparing for, mitigating, and responding 
 to disasters. 
 
<P>      The tension between its national security and disaster response 
 missions occurs in part because agency directorates do not 
 communicate well with each other. For example, during Hurricane 
 Andrew, employees of the State and Local Programs and Support 
 directorate, frustrated at working practically around the clock, 
 charged that employees in the National Preparedness directorate did 
 very little to help. The latter said that they were never asked.[1] 
 
<P>      NPR found that, in some cases, employees have been told not to
 talk to people outside their units on projects. The serious
 communication problems among the agency's internal units are
 intensified by classification restrictions in the agency's national
 preparedness programs.  
 
<P>      In November 1992, an agency review board found that part of the 
 internal communications problem was caused by the classification 
 restrictions. To correct this, the board recommended a reduction in 
 the number of positions with security clearances from nearly 1,900 
 (1,501 top-secret clearances and 381 secret clearances) to 
 approximately 300.[2] As of August 1993, the agency had 1,582 top-
 secret clearances and 365 secret clearances. 
 
<P>      The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) agrees with 
 the agency board that a dramatic reduction in security clearances 
 will significantly improve internal communications.[3] FEMA's new 
 director has indicated that under his plan to consolidate agency 
 activities, fewer employees will continue to have classified 
 responsibilities. 
 
<P>      Most of the National Preparedness Directorate's resources seem 
 to be spent on ensuring the continuation of civilian government in 
 the event of a nuclear war, through what are known as the enduring 
 constitu-tional government programs. The directorate also supports 
 ongoing studies through war gaming, computer modeling, and other 
 methods. 
 
<P>      A review is needed to determine how national security concerns 
 fit into FEMA's current and future mission. Consensus exists among 
 Congress, the General Accounting Office, NAPA, and the agency's 
 director that its resources and emphasis should shift from national 
 security and nuclear preparedness to all-hazards preparedness 
 (including preparedness for natural and man-made disasters). 
<P> 
<P><b>Actions</b>
<P> 
<P> 
 1. FEMA should continue to shift emphasis to preparation for and 
 response to the consequences of all disasters. 
 
<P>      FEMA should redirect the efforts of its employees and resources 
 to preparing for and responding to all hazards. Strong Clinton 
 Administration support will be required to change the direction away 
 from the emphasis of the 1980's. 
 
<P> 2. The director of FEMA should review the agency's classified 
 responsibilities and ensure that they do not detract from its 
 unclassified mission of general disaster preparedness. As part of 
 that review, the director should ensure the maintenance of a single 
 point of contact to manage the scaled-down enduring constitutional 
 government programs. 
 
<P>      The director should submit a report on his review to the 
 President by the end of fiscal year 1994. The national security 
 component of FEMA's mission has dominated the agency for a very long 
 time. The dual nature of the agency's mission, the confusion about 
 its identity, the division of resources, and the communications 
 barriers that exist in the agency are the most important factors in 
 its shortcomings. 
 
<P>      With the reduced threat to this country of nuclear attack by the 
 former Soviet Union and its successor nations, enduring 
 constitutional government programs (the former continuity of 
 government programs) are being scaled back. The director should 
 ensure the maintenance of a single point of contact to manage these 
 programs. It is vital, however, that the agency's classified 
 activities do not threaten or interfere with its main focus on the 
 unclassified mission of preparing for all hazards.  
 
<P>  3. FEMA should sharply reduce the number of security clearances.

<P>  Fiscal Impact

<P>      Shifting FEMA's focus to its unclassified activities would have 
 minimal fiscal impact, but would permit the agency to respond to 
 disasters more effectively.

<H2>  FEMA02: Develop a More Anticipatory and Customer-Driven 
Response to Catastrophic Disasters </H2>
<p> 
<P> <b> Background</b>
<P> 
<P>      In 1989, Hurricane Hugo demonstrated that federal efforts are 
 needed in extraordinary disasters to assist in the information-
 gathering and needs-assessment processes. The ability to respond 
 swiftly and efficiently to such catastrophes can dramatically affect 
 the quality of aid provided to disaster victims.  
 
<P>      After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, however, the Federal Emergency 
 Management Agency (FEMA) was criticized for waiting too long to act 
 and for making inaccurate damage assessments. FEMA waited for local 
 and state officials to assess damage and identify needs for federal 
 response assistance. Studies of disaster response efforts during the 
 hurricane by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the National 
 Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), and FEMA's Inspector General 
 found that the immediate needs of victims, as well as the need of the 
 general public for a competent presence in the midst of the 
 destruction, went largely unmet.[1] 
 
<P>      Under federal law in the Stafford Act, FEMA cannot act until a 
 state governor asks for help in responding to a catastrophe. This 
 inability to act before a governor asks for aid has played a part in 
 impeding quicker responses to disasters by the agency. 
 
<P>      FEMA has also interpreted the Stafford Act in the past as a 
 restriction on its mobilization and pre-positioning of resources 
 before a disaster declaration. The agency did little during the 
 several days of warning leading up to Hurricane Andrew to position 
 federal staff, equipment, and supplies for immediate movement to the 
 disaster area. Although a FEMA staff member was present at the Dade 
 County Emergency Operations Center the day after the hurricane, that 
 person did not have the capability or resources to carry out initial 
 response operations and to establish the federal presence required in 
 such a large disaster.[2] 
 
<P>      FEMA's field arrangement may also affect its capacity to provide 
 disaster assistance. FEMA operates through the standard federal 10 
 region structure, which is based on population, not risk, even though 
 some regions have relatively no history of disasters. The 10 regional 
 offices also do not focus on anticipated threats in their respective 
 areas. When a disaster does occur in a region, the agency flies in 
 experts from other areas to help out.[3] 
 
<P>      Reducing FEMA regional offices is under consideration by 
 Congress. Senator Barbara Mikulski recently introduced legislation to 
 reduce the number of regional offices from 10 to six, based on NAPA 
 and GAO recommendations. FEMA disagrees. The agency contends that 
 reducing the number of regional offices might impair vital links 
 between the agency and state and local governments. However, FEMA is 
 willing to examine the overall field structure to determine the most 
 effective and efficient way to respond to disasters and to carry out 
 its all-hazards emergency management responsibilities. 
 
<P>      The ideal federal role is the provision of emergency assistance 
 to state and local governments and disaster victims. Federal 
 involvement should be anticipatory. It should include the ability to 
 monitor, assess, advise, and provide aid to deal with natural 
 disasters at the earliest appropriate time. Good relationships with 
 governors, particularly in states where disasters happen more often, 
 would be improved if FEMA were organized to be more flexible and 
 responsive. 
 
<P>  
 
<P> <b> Actions</b>
<P> 
<P>  1. Where cost-effective, FEMA should establish rapid-response teams 
 to monitor catastrophes, assess damage, and advise governors and the 
 President. 
 
<P>      An early federal disaster response can prevent suffering and 
 save money. Where needed and desired by state governors, FEMA should 
 establish and dispatch rapid-response ground assessment teams to the 
 field. The teams' mission should include: (1) estimates of the nature 
 and extent of damage and probable relief needs; (2) advice to 
 governors and the President on appropriate action needed, either 
 before a disaster (when there is advance warning) or immediately 
 thereafter; and (3) planning for and prediction of the effects of 
 various disasters when the team is not actively engaged in assistance 
 efforts.[4] 
 
<P>      The teams should include personnel from FEMA and other agencies 
 with expertise on the particular type of disaster, as well as state 
 and local experts familiar with the pre-disaster condition. FEMA has 
 already issued a report on development of ground assessment teams and 
 aerial reconnaissance options. Rapid-response teams would increase 
 the agency's ability to speed initial estimates into the hands of the 
 governors and the President, so that an accurate assessment of the 
 situation can be made.  
 
<P>      FEMA is also working with the National Governors Association to 
 provide liaisons to work with governors when disasters strike. To be 
 most effective, the liaisons should work to establish relationships 
 with governors before disasters occur. 
 
 
<P>  2. Where cost-effective, FEMA should mobilize and pre-position people 
 and supplies in anticipation of catastrophes. 
 
<P>      Modern technology facilitates the prediction of some potential 
 catastrophes. Without some movement of assets and supplies during 
 this critical warning period, however, rapid federal assistance in a 
 large disaster is impossible. The mobilization and pre-positioning of 
 people and supplies would improve FEMA's ability to prepare for and 
 respond quickly to a catastrophe. Confusion exists, however, about 
 the legality, and with it the cost effectiveness, of pre-positioning 
 supplies. Legislation should be enacted to clarify that FEMA can pre-
 position supplies for use in an emergency. 
 
<P>      Positioning supplies and staff close enough to the site of a 
 disaster, but out of harm's way, is still a logistical problem. It is 
 also no assurance that those resources will be put to use, since 
 predicted events may not occur. 
 
<P>      In 1992, after one devastating typhoon, Guam appeared to be in 
 the path of a second, Typhoon Brian, with predicted winds of 160 
 miles per hour. Based on the likely damage to Guam, FEMA sent people 
 and supplies to Hawaii. By the time Typhoon Brian hit land, however, 
 its winds had subsided to 35 miles per hour. Pre-positioning, 
 therefore, should only occur when a catastrophe can be predicted with 
 a reasonable degree of reliability.  
 
 
<P>  3. FEMA should reexamine its field structure in relation to the 
 agency's mission. 
 
 <P> The agency should consider a structure consistent with:
 
<P>  ---the agency's mission and goals,
 
<P>  ---Workload appropriate to the location, and
 
<P>  ---cost effectiveness.
 
<P>      The examination should evaluate the need for FEMA's regional 
 offices and all field structures, including satellite offices, 
 antenna fields, and storage facilities. 
 
 
<P> <P>  4. FEMA should establish regional centers of excellence.
 
<P>      The current situation in which all regional offices mirror each 
 other's capabilities is redundant and wasteful. The regional office 
 best suited to deal with a particular type of disaster should be the 
 lead center for such disasters. 
 
<P>      For example, the regional office in California could develop a 
 center of excellence specializing in earthquakes, while the Georgia 
 office could establish one focused on hurricanes. Experts could be 
 flown to a disaster area in regions without a center of excellence 
 corresponding to the particular disaster involved. 
 
<P>      The centers would encourage employees to take ownership of and 
 excel in a specific area, and result in more economical use of 
 resources. The concept could be adopted without compromising the 
 agency's all-hazard policy, since regional offices would still be 
 able to engage in the mitigation and preparation activities required, 
 regardless of the particular threat. 
<P>  
<P> <b> Fiscal Impact</b>
<P>  
<P>      The fiscal impact cannot be determined at this time, although 
 long-term savings should be realized from more effective disaster 
 mitigation through rapid-response teams and pre-positioning of 
 supplies and resources. Operating costs should be reduced by more 
 efficient use of field resources through regional restructuring and 
 centers of excellence.

<p><H2>FEMA03:  Create Results-Oriented Incentives to Reduce the costs of a Disaster</H2>
<P>  
<P><b>Background</b>
<P> 
<P>      Americans traditionally help one another when disaster strikes, 
 but policies and practices of the government and others tend to 
 discourage important self-help measures. This country's response to 
 catastrophic events relies to a great extent on federal assistance to 
 state and local governments, whether or not those governments have 
 tried to reduce the effects, including the costs, of such disasters. 
 The ready availability of federal funds may actually contribute to 
 disaster losses by reducing incentives for hazard mitigation and 
 preparedness. 
 

 <P><b>Federal Criteria and Disaster Costs.</b>
<P> 
<P>      The Stafford Act defines  the process that triggers most federal
 disaster assistance other than assistance for crop losses. The criteria
 for disaster declarations are vague. The law defines only two
 categories of presidentially declared disasters: emergencies and major
 disasters. 
 
<P>      When the costs of a disaster exceed the resources of state and 
 local government, a governor can ask the President to declare a major 
 disaster.[1] Once the President determines that the event causes 
 damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster 
 assistance, the affected area becomes eligible for a wide range of 
 assistance coordinated by FEMA. 
 
<P>      At least 13 federal agencies, including FEMA, provide a 
 combination of services, technical assistance, grants, and low-
 interest loans for disaster response and recovery. FEMA's Disaster 
 Relief Fund pays between 75 and 100 percent of the costs of immediate 
 emergency services, public facilities repair, and assistance to 
 individual families.[2] 
 
<P>      Decisions about federal disaster relief are not constrained by 
 immediate budget considerations. Most funds for disasters in the 
 recent past have been provided by supplemental appropriations, which 
 are exempt from federal discretionary spending limits.[3] Although 
 California has levied special taxes to defray the costs of disaster 
 assistance, the federal government has not, and disaster relief has 
 added to the deficit. 
 
<P>      Over the 10-year period from the beginning of fiscal year 1983 
 to the end of fiscal year 1992, annual obligations for FEMA's 
 Presidential Disaster Relief Fund averaged $668 million a year in 
 constant 1992 dollars, much of it deficit-financed. Congress provided 
 $2.9 billion in supplemental FEMA disaster relief funds for 
 Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992.[4] The FEMA share of disaster 
 assistance for the 1993 floods in the Midwest will be at least $1.7 
 billion.[5] 
 
<P>      The system as a whole encourages state and local elected 
 officials to ask for maximum federal disaster assistance. Requests 
 have increased approximately 50 percent over the last 10 years. Even 
 minor emergencies have been awarded full compensation. The federal 
 government expects to pay 17 states and the District of Columbia a 
 total of $126 million for the costs of snow removal for emergency 
 transportation after the March 1993 storms, even though snow is a 
 regular, recurring event in many of the affected states. 
 
<P>      To prevent the federal government from becoming the states' 
 first-line resource in every emergency, objective criteria are needed 
 to replace political factors affecting decisions about disaster 
 declarations and the ensuing response. These criteria should be 
 accompanied by efforts before catastrophe strikes to limit the costs 
 afterward--a better alternative than limiting aid to suffering 
 families and communities after a disaster hits them. 
 
<P>      Insurance and Mitigation. The devastation caused by recent 
 floods in the Midwest highlighted the need for communities to 
 recognize and plan for risk. Adequate insurance can reduce the need 
 for government assistance and speed recovery; dams and levees can 
 limit the extent of flooding; clearing floodplains and elevating 
 buildings can minimize structural damage when disasters occur. 
 
<P>      Unfortunately, the floods also demonstrated that the country is 
 not taking maximum advantage of available mechanisms to ameliorate 
 the effects of disasters. While it will take time to isolate the most 
 effective flood mitigation measures for the Midwest, the area 
 graphically illustrates the nation's lack of adequate insurance 
 against disasters. 
 
<P>      Less than 15 percent of the people affected by the floods in the 
 Midwest had insurance against that risk, even though they live on a 
 recognized high-risk flood plain. Only 20 percent of all U.S. 
 homeowners at risk of flooding have flood insurance. People living in 
 a typical flood plain have a 26 percent chance of flood over the 30-
 year life of a mortgage. Although the risk of fire is much lower than 
 the risk of flood, 96 percent of homeowners in flood areas have fire 
 insurance. 
 
<P>      In communities participating in the National Flood Insurance 
 Program (NFIP), such insurance is mandatory for many people living in 
 designated Special Flood Hazard Areas.[6] Yet enforcement of that 
 requirement by mortgage lenders has been lax, and while 18,250 
 communities at risk of flooding participate in the program, 2,378 
 others do not. 
 
<P>      Beyond increasing insurance coverage, the already-high and 
 rising costs of disasters need to be reduced. The National Research 
 Council has estimated that the annual costs of disasters (of which 
 FEMA bears only part) now average $20 billion a year.[7] The total 
 direct and indirect losses from recent disasters have been even 
 higher: $45 to $60 billion in 1989 from Hurricane Hugo and the Loma 
 Prieta earthquake, and $30 billion from Hurricane Andrew.[8] By 
 August 1993 the direct losses from the floods in the Midwest were 
 estimated to be $12 billion.[9] 
 
<P>      This country is vulnerable to high disaster costs caused by 
 large numbers of natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, droughts, 
 floods, hurricanes, landslides, tornadoes, tsunamis or waves caused 
 by seaquakes or underwater volcanoes, volcanoes, and wildfires), 
 coupled with human factors that increase the effects of these hazards 
 (e.g., population growth; development patterns; the density and 
 complexity of housing, communications, and transportation systems; 
 and economic interdependence). These costs, however, can be 
 reduced.[10] 
 
<P>      It has been estimated that better construction could reduce the 
 costs of nine threats (i.e., earthquakes, expansive soil, riverain 
 floods, hurricane winds or storm surges, tornadoes, local floods, 
 local winds, and tidal waves) by 25 percent.[11] One expert estimated 
 that lack of compliance with building codes may have accounted for as 
 much as one-fourth of the $20 billion insurance bill for Hurricane 
 Andrew.[12] 
 
<P>      Earthquakes, in particular, threaten people and property in the 
 United States far more than they should. It is known that earthquake 
 risks extend throughout the United States, not just California, 
 albeit in widely varying degrees. For example, geologists predict 
 that a major earthquake is virtually certain to strike somewhere in 
 the eastern two-thirds of the country within the next 20 years.[13] 
 
<P>      Beyond the physical havoc wreaked by earthquakes, the financial 
 costs can exact a tremendous toll. A simulation of an earthquake 50 
 miles north of Memphis along the New Madrid fault line, centered in 
 northeast Arkansas and southwest Missouri, produced estimates that 
 insured losses alone could total $50-60 billion.[14] Another 
 simulation of a major earthquake in the Los Angeles area produced 
 estimated losses of $80 billion, attributable to direct costs of 
 property damage and personal injury, and indirect effects on the 
 economy.[15] 
 
<P>      The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP)--in 
 which FEMA, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological 
 Survey, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
 cooperate--has developed strategies to reduce earthquake losses 
 appropriate to the type of construction and level of risk. In 
 general, so-called seismic building codes add less than two percent 
 to the cost of new construction.[16] 
 
<P>      The benefits from earthquake mitigation can be quite dramatic. 
 One of the most powerful earthquakes of the century struck Guam on 
 August 8, 1993. Early reports indicated there were no deaths, few 
 injuries, and no homelessness because Guam used seismic 
 construction.[17] The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory estimates that 
 spending $4 million on reinforcement of its facilities prevented $50 
 million in damages from the Loma Prieta earthquake.[18]  
 
<P>      Nevertheless, with all this information available, too few 
 communities are preparing for earthquakes and other hazards. People 
 tend to discount the risks of earthquakes and floods in choosing 
 development sites. People like to live near the ocean, in spite of 
 hurricanes, tidal waves, and mudslides. The uncertainties or lack of 
 precision in assessing risks make it easier for short-term benefits 
 of economic development to overpower long-term costs when local 
 zoning and building codes are set. Communities fear losing business 
 to other communities if they imple-ment strong disaster mitigation 
 measures such as seismic building codes.[19] Mitigation has been 
 called the most neglected aspect of emergency management.[20] 
 
<P>      FEMA provides some funding for mitigation, but it is generally 
 thought that it is better for the federal government to create 
 incentives for mitigation rather than to pay for it directly. Various 
 approaches have been tried and suggested. 
 
<P>      One federal program cited for creating mitigation incentives is 
 the NFIP. Even though many households in floodplains do not carry 
 insurance, their communities have adopted building codes and 
 ordinances to mitigate flood damage as a condition of participation 
 in the program. If a community exceeds the federal standard, its 
 citizens receive a break in their insurance rates. The NFIP believes 
 that $569 million a year in flood damage prevention is attributable 
 to community compliance with its regulations. 
 
<P>      Some have suggested extending the NFIP model (i.e., combining 
 community standards of hazard mitigation with increased insurance 
 coverage) to other hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes in 
 order to reduce disaster costs and the financial vulnerability of the 
 federal government.[21] The insurance industry estimated that legally 
 required universal earthquake insurance would have reduced the need 
 for federal disaster assistance in the 1987 Whittier Narrows 
 earthquake by 38 percent.[22] 
 
<P>      Others have proposed incorporating additional hazards like 
 earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis into the basic coverage 
 of homeowners policies. Still others have suggested funding 
 mitigation from a share of insurance premiums.[23] 
 
<P>      Earthquake (or all-hazards) mitigation could also be increased 
 by expanding the requirements imposed on federal agencies in 
 Executive Order 12699. This presidential order directs agencies to 
 incorporate cost-effective seismic safety measures in new buildings 
 owned, leased, assisted, or regulated by the federal government. The 
 order could be expanded to include buildings with federally insured 
 mortgages within the meaning of assisted buildings. Because the 
 federal government is forced to pay heavily for disasters, direct 
 expenditures on mitigation (grants, tax credits, tax exemptions) may 
 save federal money over time.[24] 
 
<P>      Several considerations affect the search for a new federal 
 policy. Land use and construction requirements are determined by 
 states and localities. Implementing construction requirements is 
 complicated by other factors: most builders are not engineers, many 
 localities do not have enforcement staffs, and risks vary within 
 regions in unpredictable ways.[25] Premiums for risk-based natural 
 hazards insurance can substantially increase home insurance costs. 
 Cost is one reason people do not voluntarily insure against known 
 risks.[26] The appropriate relationship between government and 
 private insurers must also be considered. 
<P>  
<P><b>Preparedness.</b>
<P>
<P>      Beyond mitigation, preparedness reduces the cost of disasters that
 cannot be prevented. For example, quick protection of threatened
 facilities saves replacement costs and reduces interruptions of 
 normal economic activities. Like mitigation, however, local
 governments--which are in the best position to act quickly--often
 do not treat disaster preparedness as a high priority.[27] 
 
<P>       FEMA currently encourages state and local preparedness through 
 training and emergency management exercises, and by state matching 
 grants that directly fund state and local emergency preparedness. The 
 effectiveness of current federal preparedness programs could be 
 improved by using performance measures that encourage states to use 
 federal funding efficiently for the most productive emergency 
 management activities. 
 
<P>      States could use civil defense funds to prepare for natural 
 disasters. However, former FEMA management officials and some states 
 have narrowly interpreted a 1981 amendment to the Civil Defense Act 
 of 1950, which provided that these funds may be used to prepare for 
 other hazards, to the extent that such use is consistent with, 
 contributes to, and does not detract from attack-related civil 
 preparedness. 
 
<P>      Civil defense funds (approximately $100 million annually) could 
 be put to better use if all states developed a comprehensive all-
 hazards response capability, and prepared better for the disasters 
 they consider to be the greatest risk--hurricanes in the Southeast 
 and gulf coastal areas, earthquakes in California, and floods and 
 tornadoes in the Midwest, for example. It would be appropriate for 
 states' emergency management plans to reflect the respective risks, 
 but states contend that FEMA has not encouraged them to redirect 
 their plans from civil defense. FEMA should proceed with its 
 concentration on all-hazards preparation, but it needs to make it 
 clearer that states have the flexibility to tailor individual 
 approaches to local problems. 
 
<P>      FEMA should incorporate guidance on targeted all-hazards 
 preparedness in the new grant application materials now under 
 development. In addition to allowing more flexibility, federal 
 preparedness assistance can also be improved by linking grant amounts 
 to a state's success in disaster preparation. The General Accounting 
 Office has noted that problems and weaknesses identified during 
 emergency training exercises and drills are not corrected.[28] Tying 
 grant award amounts to measures of preparedness would increase the 
 efficiency and effectiveness of FEMA's preparedness programs. 
 
<P>      The federal government should be a resource for information 
 about the tools needed for hazards mitigation and disaster 
 prevention.[29] It should offer incentives to the states to mitigate 
 disasters and to prepare for those that cannot be prevented. Federal 
 funding, for both advance mitigation of and preparation for 
 disasters, should be tied to the effectiveness of state and local 
 programs. FEMA should focus on outcomes and keep states informed 
 about their progress. An effective system should define and 
 appropriately respond to different levels of disaster. Insurance 
 should be used whenever possible. 
<P> 
<P><b> Actions</b>
<P> 
<P>  1. FEMA should develop objective criteria for declaring emergencies 
 and major disasters. 
 
<P>      To reserve federal disaster assistance for situations of clear 
 need, FEMA should develop objective indicators to define the 
 emergencies and major disasters for which federal disaster relief is 
 now authorized. Such indicators should take into account both the 
 disaster itself and state capabilities for meeting the costs of the 
 disaster. Distinctions should be made between the need for immediate 
 federal services during the emergency, and other methods of financing 
 response and recovery. 
 
<P>      These criteria should be established and agreed to by FEMA, the 
 White House, other agencies, and state and local governments. Because 
 Congress has objected to attempts to introduce this type of change by 
 regulation alone, FEMA should work with Congress to develop disaster 
 criteria and determine whether legislation is advisable. 
 
<P>      Use of objective criteria within the framework of existing law 
 would depoliticize the process of declaring disasters. Advance 
 knowledge of assistance that will and will not be forthcoming from 
 the federal government will enable states and localities to prepare 
 and implement their own disaster relief measures more effectively. 
 
 
<P>  2. FEMA should enforce existing flood insurance requirements 
 applicable to people living in high-risk areas. 
 
<P>      FEMA should develop cost-effective proposals for enforcement of 
 requirements for mandatory flood insurance in order to reduce the 
 need for disaster assistance. The agency should evaluate proposed 
 legislation under consideration by Congress which would require that: 
 
<P>  ---lenders and federal agencies not waive the mandatory purchase 
 requirement for flood insurance for any purpose, nor provide any 
 amount of financial assistance without enforcing the mandatory 
 purchase requirement; 
 
<P>  ---certification of the mandatory purchase requirement be made by 
 lenders on each mortgage sold on the secondary market to government-
 sponsored portfolio purchasers, such as the Federal National Mortgage 
 Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; 
 
 <P> ---lenders escrow flood insurance payments if taxes, insurance, and 
 other items are escrowed, and authorize lenders to pay insurance 
 premiums and fees owed from an account; 
 
 <P> ---appropriate federal banking agencies review lending portfolios of 
 respective insured depository institutions as part of scheduled on-
 site examinations to ensure compliance with flood insurance purchase 
 requirements, and report such findings to Congress annually; and 
 
<P>  ---penalties be imposed on lenders for failure to require flood 
 insurance in Special Flood Hazard Areas.[30] 
 
<P> 3. The administration and Congress should explore incentives to 
 expand insurance coverage against natural hazards and increase 
 mitigation. 
 
<P>      Increased insurance coverage against loss from natural disasters 
 is desirable. The Administration, in partnership with Congress and 
 the states, should evaluate legislative proposals that increase 
 insurance coverage for property and casualty losses against natural 
 disasters, while creating incentives for mitigation. 
 
 
<P> 4. Grants for mitigation and preparedness should fund preparedness 
 for the greatest risks. 
 
<P>      FEMA should implement a competitive, prioritized grant award 
 process, including performance measures not now included in the 
 process, so that all awards encourage and reward states that prepare 
 for the highest risk. 
 
 
<P>  5. FEMA should propose comprehensive federal policies that reduce the 
 total cost of disasters and minimize federal costs of disaster 
 assistance. 
 
<P>      The development of objective criteria for disaster assistance, 
 and increased mitigation proposed by the NPR, will help to encourage 
 greater levels of mitigation and protection against uncompensated 
 disaster losses. But these are only part of the solution. 
 
<P>      FEMA should lead a collaborative, interagency, intergovernmental 
 effort to develop a comprehensive strategy to increase mitigation and 
 equitably allocate the costs of mitigation and recovery. It is time 
 to make more productive use of the accumulating knowledge about risk, 
 disaster costs, and mitigation effects and costs. 
 
<P>      In the course of this policy development effort, FEMA should 
 involve other federal agencies that administer policies and programs 
 related to mitigation, preparedness, response to, and recovery from 
 natural and man-made disasters. The agency should also involve 
 members of Congress, representatives of state and local government, 
 the business community, insurers, and others affected by disaster 
 management policy. 
 
<P>      FEMA and its collaborating partners should seek the best 
 scientific and economic advice. It should sponsor public conferences 
 to cast broadly for creative policy solutions, involve the general 
 public in the debate, and forge a general consensus. 
 
<P>      The recommended policy initiative should include an examination 
 of the effects of all levels of government, business, and individuals 
 on disaster costs, and how the costs are distributed. The effort 
 should clarify interdependent responsibilities. 
 
<P>      The goal is improved federal policy. Policies that allocate the 
 costs of risks to those who bear the risks are believed to be most 
 effective in increasing risk avoidance. FEMA should examine the 
 effectiveness of a wide range of options, including the following 
 identified during the NPR review: 
 
<P>  ---increasing the match rate for disaster assistance to states with 
 effective mitigation and preparedness; 
 
<P>  ---creating additional distinctions among levels of disasters for 
 determining the amount of federal aid; and 
 
<P>  ---using insurance or loans to cover more of the disaster costs of 
 state and local government. 
 
<P>      Within a year and a half of this report, FEMA should submit a 
 comprehensive plan, including proposed executive orders or 
 legislation designed to reduce the cost of disasters. 

<P> 
<P><b>Implications</b>
<P>
<P>      Improved mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery will 
 reduce the suffering and economic loss of disasters. The foregoing 
 proposals are complementary and aim to reduce the total cost of 
 disasters by encouraging mitigation and by clarifying state 
 responsibility for disaster costs. 
<P> 
<P><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<P> 
<P>      Savings from reducing and reallocating the costs of disasters 
 from the federal government will be substantial, although data upon 
 which to base good estimates are not available.

 Prepared Pursuant to the Request of the Subcommittee on Policy 
 Research and Insurance of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban 
 Affairs, Committee Print 102-15 (Washington, D.C.: Congressional 
 Research Service, October 15, 1992). For the period from 1977 to 
 1990, about two-fifths of nonagriculture federal disaster relief 
 funds went to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) programs; 
 two-fifths to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and to the 
 Farmers Home Administration (FHA), primarily for low-interest loans; 
 and one-fifth to other agencies. The SBA provides loans to repair 
 businesses and homes; appropriations are needed to cover interest and 
 defaults equaling about a third of their total loan amounts. The FHA 
 provides loans to repair farm buildings. Other agencies have smaller 
 programs directly related to their missions. For example, the 
 Department of Education funds school repairs. Tax deductions for 
 disaster losses also help cover disaster costs. 
 
<P>  3. The regular appropriation process has provided $292 million for 
 the Disaster Relief Funds in fiscal 1992 and 1993. Disaster relief 
 requirements have exceeded that, and Congress has made supplemental 
 appropriations of emergency funds.

 Disasters (Washington, D.C., February 1993), p. 4. 
 
 <P> 5. Washington Post (August 7, 1993), p. A1. Accounting for disaster 
 relief costs is complicated by the fact that funds other than FEMA 
 funds also provide disaster relief. The $5.7 billion figure for the 
 Midwest floods includes an appropriation of $2.3 billion for crop 
 losses as well as funds for other agencies. There are other programs, 
 such as the Food Stamp Program, which may not require special 
 disaster appropriations if funds are available within existing 
 ceilings. The proportion of disaster assistance going to expenses of 
 state and local governments, or to expenses of individuals, varies by 
 disaster. The highest portion of disaster aid for the Midwest floods 
 will go for public response and recovery efforts. The public 
 assistance share of disaster relief ranged from 75 percent to 42 
 percent of annual disaster relief costs between 1988 and 1992.

 is mandatory for loans made by the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
 the Federal Housing Administration, the SBA, and institutions 
 regulated by federal agencies such as the Office of Comptroller of 
 the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

<P><H2>FEMA04: Develop a Skilled Management Team Among Political
Appointees and Career Staff </H2>
<P>  
<P><b>Background</b>
<P> 
<P>      The Federal Emergency Management Administration's (FEMA's) 
 success in implementing its new, all-hazards mission will require the 
 commitment of capable and committed leaders. FEMA has been criticized 
 in the past for a lack of leadership--a deficiency linked to the 
 number and quality of political appointments, the lack of a well-
 prepared corps of career executive managers, and inadequate 
 integration of the two groups into a cohesive leadership team.[1] 
 FEMA needs to continue steps underway to address these management 
 problems, which were addressed in a recent study by the National 
 Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and confirmed in staff 
 interviews. 
 
<P>      FEMA has eight posts designated to be filled by presidential 
 appointees subject to Senate confirmation. The agency director faces 
 the challenge of molding a coordinated executive team from political 
 appointees who get their jobs through an independent appointment 
 process involving five separate Senate committees. For years, FEMA 
 has suffered as political appointees have defended their own 
 directorates (e.g., the U.S. Fire Administration, State and Local 
 Programs and Support, National Preparedness, and the Federal 
 Insurance Administration) from the agency head's efforts to shape 
 FEMA as a whole.[2] 
 
<P>      There are 14 other senior political positions in the agency, 
 jobs that can be filled without the use of competitive civil service 
 procedures. Its critics in the past have viewed the agency as a 
 political dumping ground. Pending legislation would convert most of 
 FEMA's political positions into career slots.[3] 
 
<P>      In 1989, the National Commission on the Public Service, known as 
 the Volcker Commission, noted that a large number of political 
 appointees can actually weaken political control because of problems 
 in selecting and retaining experienced political sub-cabinet 
 officers.[4] To improve recruitments for political positions, the 
 Volcker Commission recommended that criteria be developed for 
 qualifications of political nominees. It suggested that these 
 criteria include managerial and substantive experience, as well as 
 loyalty to and philosophical compatibility with the President.[5]  
 
<P>      Few would argue that effective recruitment needs to be followed 
 by appropriate on-the-job training, but NAPA also noted deficiencies 
 in developmental activities for both political and career executives 
 in FEMA. Career paths for civil servants have been confined to 
 individual subunits, contributing to a parochialism within work 
 groups and lack of overall agency cohesion. 
 
<P>      Staff interviews support the need for better planning for 
 executive development activities, and for technical and cross-program 
 training. The agency's Executive Resources Board is a developing a 
 vision statement describing what its career leaders should be like; 
 it is also identifying ways in which to ensure that leadership 
 development opportunities are not overlooked in the press of the 
 agency's daily business.[6] 
 
<P>      Before the current director arrived at FEMA, the acting 
 director--a career civil servant who has worked in several 
 directorates--dispatched four senior executives from the headquarters 
 office to serve on temporary assignments as regional directors. The 
 participants have praised this move as a step that should be 
 repeated, with similar exchanges throughout the ranks and between 
 FEMA directorates. Such cross-training develops the broad experience 
 and working relationships needed to manage successfully FEMA's array 
 of programs and interagency contacts. 
 
<P>      Political appointees would also benefit from on-the-job 
 preparation for their tasks.[7] Orientation programs and performance 
 agreements can help strengthen their understanding and implementation 
 of the agency's mission. 
 
<P>      FEMA also needs to improve the working relationship between its 
 political and career staffs as part of its developmental efforts. In 
 a discussion of leadership, the Volcker Commission observed that the 
 quality of the career-political relationship is more important to 
 government efficiency and effectiveness than who fills the respective 
 positions.[8] 
 
<P>      Political appointees must articulate their goals to the career 
 staff and enlist the aid of the career members of the Senior 
 Executive Service in the execution of their plans. Career personnel 
 must be willing to participate as members of the agency team with the 
 political leadership to make these plans succeed. The FEMA director 
 can lead by ensuring that rewards for each group are linked to the 
 success of the working relationship between political and career 
 employees within and across agency directorates. 
<P> 
<P><b>Actions</b>
<P> 
<P>  1. Through organizational restructuring and reordering of priorities, 
 all agency directorates should be responsible to the Director for 
 fulfilling the primary agency mission of disaster response. 
 
<P>      Current directorate organization emphasizes separate activities 
 at the expense of FEMA's overall mission. Political appointees at the 
 top of those units have, in the past, focused on those separate 
 activities, and have related and responded to different congressional 
 committees with jurisdiction over those areas. Charging all 
 appointees with a common agency mission is an essential first step in 
 the development of the effective, all-hazards emergency management 
 organization that FEMA seeks to become. 
 
 
<P>  2. The director of FEMA should select and develop capable and 
 cohesive executive leaders for the agency. 
 
<P>      The new director has expressed his intent to examine FEMA's 
 mission and organization.[9] This should include the identification 
 and implementation of technical and managerial selection criteria for 
 political appointments. The agency is currently developing an 
 orientation program for incoming regional administrators, and should 
 develop a similar program for other political appointees. These and 
 other steps, such as performance plans that hold executives 
 responsible for implementing the mission articulated by the director, 
 would strengthen the cohesiveness of FEMA's leadership. 
 
 
<P>  3. The director of FEMA should institute a staff career development 
 program. 
 
<P>      FEMA should implement a program of career development that gives 
 staff the technical skills and broad experience needed to ensure the 
 agency's success in managing its complex network of intergovernmental 
 responsibilities. Staff at all levels should expect to be moved 
 between headquarters and field posts and across functions for career 
 development purposes. 
 
<P>      FEMA should update its training needs assessment and factor 
 agency needs into development plans for employees. The agency should 
 use those provisions of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act that 
 authorize job rotations in state and local governments and 
 universities during federal career service. Exchanges with state and 
 local emergency managers and across FEMA directorates will build 
 skills and working relationships necessary for the implementation of 
 FEMA's comprehensive emergency management mission. 
 
<P> 
<P><b>Implications</b>
<P> 
<P>      Investments in FEMA's leadership should improve the agency's 
 effectiveness in meeting the goals for which it was created in 1979. 
<P> 
<P><b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<P> 
<P>      The purpose of these recommendations is to make FEMA better able 
 to accomplish its mission. Professionalism in the executive ranks 
 would increase effectiveness of agency operations and potentially 
 improve responses to disasters, with resulting savings that cannot be 
 estimated at this time.

<P><H2>Agency Reinvention Activities</H2>
<P>  
<P>      Much can be done by governments, organizations, and individuals 
 to prevent or reduce disaster losses and resulting human suffering. 
 Saving a life can be as simple as knowing where to go when a tornado 
 warning is issued. A 25-cent bolt can keep a bookcase from falling on 
 a child during an earthquake. People can learn the proper action to 
 take when disaster strikes, buildings can be located and constructed 
 properly, and emergency management and relief organizations can be 
 trained and equipped to help people and protect property rapidly and 
 effectively. 
 
<P>      These examples illustrate the basic components of comprehensive 
 emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and 
 recovery. People are suffering unnecessarily from disasters because 
 there has been a lack of emergency management leadership at the 
 national level. The need to provide that leadership is driving the 
 renewal of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The 
 following section outlines FEMA's goals for its future direction. 
 
<P>  
<P><b>Vision</b>
<P>  
<P>      A renewed FEMA is needed to generate enthusiasm, energy, 
 guidance, and support for a nationwide commitment to the protection 
 of U.S. citizens from natural and man-made hazards. A partnership 
 involving FEMA, other federal agencies, state and local governments, 
 and private and volunteer organizations can educate the nation's 
 citizens to protect themselves, their families, their homes, and 
 their businesses before, during, and after a disaster strikes. 
 
<P>      Structures can be built according to improved codes and located 
 out of harm's way. Governments and private organizations can develop 
 effective plans, necessary resources, and rigorous training for 
 disaster response, and communities can be prepared for recovery and 
 reconstruction after a disaster. 
<P> 
<P><b>Mission</b>
<P> 
<P>      The first step in FEMA's renewal process has been to redefine a 
 new mission that realistically incorporates all risks and threats, 
 expressed as follows: 
 
<P>  ---The mission of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is to 
 provide the leadership and support to reduce the loss of life and 
 property and protect our institutions from all types of hazards 
 through a comprehensive, risk-based, all hazards emergency management 
 program of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 
 
<P>      The mission stresses an agency leadership and management role
 that focuses on reducing risks and helping victims of disasters, 
 regardless of the cause. FEMA will provide both leadership and 
 support to federal agencies, state and local governments, and private 
 volunteer organizations involved in disaster relief, as well as 
 direct assistance to disaster victims. 
<P> 
<P><b>Organization</b>
<P> 
<P>      FEMA has designed a new organizational structure that aligns 
 resources more effectively, integrates program activities, 
 centralizes common or redundant functions, improves program delivery, 
 and shifts the use of national security capabilities to domestic 
 disasters, while maintaining the ability to respond to national 
 security emergencies. The new structure was designed with input from 
 FEMA employees, union representatives, and management teams. The new 
 organization supports the redefined mission of FEMA, guided by staff, 
 members of Congress, and others. 
<P> 
<P><b>Major Policies</b>
<P> 
<P>  The principles and goals driving FEMA's reinvention include: 
 
<P>  ---Accomplish the renewal of FEMA and ensure participation by agency 
 employees in the renewal process. 
 
<P> ---Establish a nationwide culture of people helping people through a 
 national emergency management partnership. 
 
<P>  ---Emphasize mitigation to reduce risks to people, property, and 
 communities from various hazards. 
 
<P>  ---Establish a risk-based, all-hazards approach to emergency 
 management. 
 
<P>  ---Develop a federal, state, and local approach to rapid assessment 
 of disaster situations and damage. 
 
<P>  ---Maintain close working relationships with other federal agencies 
 in all phases of comprehensive emergency management. 

<P> ---Strengthen and maintain working relationships with states. 
 
<P>  ---Promote flexibility and performance in state and local emergency 
 management programs and minimize administrative burdens. 
 
<P>  ---Establish a quick and effective administrative dispute resolution 
 program for assistance claims. 
 
<P>  ---Promote comprehensive training and disaster exercise programs for 
 all levels of government, private agencies, and other organizations. 
 
<P> ---Empower employees with responsibility and authority and encourage 
 innovation. 
 
<P>  ---Support the United Nations International Decade for Natural 
 Disaster Reduction. 
 
<P>  ---Seek opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA programs. 
 
<P>      In a project already under way, the National Oceanographic and 
 Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and FEMA will announce a joint 
 effort to improve communications before, during, and after 
 emergencies. The NOAA system will be used to relay warnings for all 
 types of disasters, and to provide victim assistance after an event 
 has occurred. Such warning and assistance information will be sent 
 from selected NOAA transmitter sites and received on battery-powered 
 radios turned on by the transmitted signal. 
 
<P>      A one-year pilot program will be conducted in Dade County, 
 Florida, in cooperation with the State of Florida and the National 
 Committee on Property Insurance. The insurance industry is donating 
 $10,000 for the pilot project to buy NOAA Weather Radio receivers for 
 Dade County hospitals, schools, and other critical facilities. 
 Activities will be undertaken to provide these radios to low-income 
 families. The overall goal is for every family and institution to 
 have a radio, with batteries as necessary.

<p><H2> Executive Summary</H2>
<p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is not a large 
 organization. With a direct budget of $210 million a year and about 
 19,500 full-time employees, it's a far cry from the Health and Human 
 Services and Defense Departments, with their multi-billion dollar 
 budgets and huge payrolls. Nevertheless, GSA controls or influences 
 about $45 billion in agency purchases.
<p> 
<p> But GSA, established in 1949 out of recommendations from the first 
 Hoover Commission, suffers from fundamental flaws in its operation, 
 from the contradictory nature of its tasks to the monopoly it enjoys 
 over services provided to federal agencies. In this report, the 
 National Performance Review (NPR) outlines a series of dramatic 
 changes that the Clinton administration, in general, and GSA's 
 administrator, in particular, will make in GSA's roles and 
 operations. It also describes nine reinvention laboratories that GSA 
 established at Vice President Gore's request.
<p>
<p> GSA's administrator will better separate the agency's policymaking 
 activities from its delivery of services, thus reducing confusion 
 within GSA over its different roles and improving performance in both 
 areas. Through changes in regulations, legislation, and 
 administrative actions, the administrator also will free agencies to 
 purchase services outside GSA, while GSA will create competitive 
 enterprises with which to compete for business. Once the agency is 
 competitive, the administrator will consider such options as 
 providing one-stop shopping, reducing overhead, streamlining the 
 organization, and improving the management of telecommunications all 
 to improve its effectiveness and customer service.
<p>
<p> In addition, the administrator plans to suspend GSA's acquisition of 
 net new office space and courthouses, and push aggressive lease 
 negotiations for existing and new leases. With an ad hoc committee of 
 the President's Management Council that he will convene, GSA's 
 administrator will develop recommendations on how to cut procurement 
 spending 5-10 percent a year without cutting products or services. 
 Finally, the Office of Management and Budget's director will transfer 
 activities unrelated to GSA's central mission, such as transportation 
 audits, to other agencies.
<p> 
<p> As for GSA's reinvention laboratories, regionwide laboratories in 
 Philadelphia and Denver have blanket authority to waive GSA rules and 
 regulations, while employees seek fresh ways to accomplish their 
 work. An interagency fleet consolidation lab hopes to quickly bring 
 together the fleets of the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Energy 
 Department, representing more than 4,000 vehicles. In another lab, 
 volunteers, communities, and environmental and energy concerns have 
 developed a telecommuting center for federal employees.
<p> 
<p> Through its automatic data processing support services lab, GSA hopes 
 to test new ways to give federal customers the support of private 
 sector information technology. A commercial products acquisition lab 
 will reduce procurement paperwork for customer agencies and 
 centralize billing. A local telecommunications lab is designed to de-
 monopolize local telecommunications services in Kansas City, 
 Missouri.
<p>
<p> With its governmentwide electronic mail lab, the GSA will help 
 provide a common directory and a "Help Desk" to answer user 
 questions. An office products regional commodity center will provide 
 new ways to give the federal community office supplies, paper, and 
 packaging products. Finally, a time and attendance lab will replace 
 manual time card procedures with an electronic input system.

<HR>
<H2>GSA01: Separate Policymaking From Service Delivery and Make the 
 General Services Administration A Fully Competitive, Revenue-Based 
 Organization</H2>
<p>
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
<p> The General Services Administration (GSA) was established in 1949 as 
 a result of recommendations from the first Hoover Commission; its 
 authority is derived from the Federal Property and Administrative 
 Service Act. When created, GSA was intended to regulate the various 
 administrative services under its purview and only to provide those 
 services directly when it was more economical to do so.(1) GSA now 
 not only develops and oversees governmentwide policies and standards, 
 it is also the primary provider of many of the government's supplies 
 and services.
<p> 
<p> GSA is responsible for acquiring, storing, distributing, and 
 disposing of personal property and supplies, and for acquiring, 
 managing, and disposing of real property. The Department of Defense 
 (DOD) has similar responsibilities for defense-related activities. 
 Over the years, GSA, DOD, and other agencies have further divided 
 responsibilities for various supply management functions, and other 
 civilian agencies have also received authority to acquire, manage, 
 and dispose of real property.
<p>
<p>GSA is organized into four major service organizations and a 
 headquarters that includes the office of general management and 
 administration (GM&A), the Inspector General, and the Office of 
 FTS2000 (which until recently was part of the Information Resources 
 Management Service). GM&A comprises the Office of the Administrator; 
 the Associate Administrator for Acquisition Policy; the Board of 
 Contract Appeals; and the normal complement of staff offices. The 
 four services (each of which conducts operations and develops and 
 enforces governmentwide policy) and their areas of responsibility 
 are:
<p> 
<p>---the Federal Supply Service (FSS), which is responsible for federal 
 supply management;
<p>
<p> ---the Public Buildings Service (PBS), which is responsible for 
 general purpose space to house the federal government;
<p> 
<p>---the Federal Property Resources Service (FPRS), which is 
 responsible for real property disposal; and
<p>
<p>---the Information Resources Management Service (IRMS), which is 
 responsible for information processing and telecommunications.
<p>
<p> Geographically, GSA is organized into a central office headquartered 
 in Washington, D.C., and 10 regions, including the National Capital 
 Region (NCR).(2) The regions are responsible for providing services 
 to federal agencies and (in most cases) enforcing policies developed 
 by the central office. The regional headquarters' offices are in 
 Washington, DC; New York; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Chicago; Kansas 
 City; Fort Worth; Denver; San Francisco; and Auburn, WA. GSA full-
 time employment (FTE) for the central office and regions totalled 
 19,502 in fiscal year 1993.
<p>
<p> In fiscal year 1994, GSA plans to obligate about $11 billion, of 
 which only $210 million (two percent) is from direct appropriations. 
 GSA's fiscal year 1994 budget request allocates resources as follows:
<p> 
<p> While GSA's direct budget of $210 million is relatively small, GSA 
 directly controls or indirectly influences agency spending--through 
 multiple awards schedules, building rental costs, telecommunications, 
 and information resources--of about $45 billion.(5) Quite a 
 difference.

<p>
<p> The overwhelming majority of GSA's expenses are paid by its customers 
 through reimbursable and revolving funds. GSA has arranged its 
 financial structure so that most of its staff functions (the Office 
 of the Administrator, the finance and budget offices, and the General 
 Counsel, for example) are largely reimbursed by the various services; 
 that overhead is in turn charged to GSA's customers. The concept of 
 cross-charging or inter-divisional charging has its basis in 
 attempting to provide business units or divisions with as close to 
 their own Profit and Loss (P&L) statements and balance sheets as 
 possible.(6) The idea is that this will drive them to optimize their 
 profitability.

<p>
<p> Although cross-charging is widely practiced in private business, even 
 the most sophisticated companies can and have been burned by the 
 process. This usually occurs when the cross-charging (usually known 
 as allocations) becomes so complex that the origins of the costs (or 
 expenses) become lost. This, combined with the fact that in most 
 cases those charged the costs have little or no authority over them, 
 leaves large elements of cost uncontrolled. In one recent example at 
 a major corporation, allocations became so complex that not only 
 operating management but also top management lost control.
<p> 
<p> If this can happen in private business where real profits and losses 
 are at stake and cash must come from profits or private capital 
 markets, then it is clear that cross-charging can cause serious loss 
 of control in government--no matter how well intentioned the managers 
 are.
<p> 
<p> In GSA's case, cross-charging is especially troublesome because the 
 prices GSA charges its customer agencies are not subject to the 
 market disciplines resulting from competition. The "excess margins'' 
 are used for two purposes: (1) to cover GSA's operating expenses, and 
 (2) to build up reserves--in the case of the Public Buildings 
 Service, to build up a Federal Buildings Fund with a current balance 
 of $4.5 billion.
<p> 
<p> Since most of GSA's customer "revenues'' are not now subject to 
 competition, there is a classic case of inelastic prices, with little 
 incentive to reduce costs.
<p>
<p> Recently, GSA has taken steps to provide its customers some freedom 
 of choice and authority to make management decisions. GSA has:
<p> 
<p> ---instituted a building delegation program transferring management 
 responsibility for single-tenant buildings to the agency occupying 
 the building;
<p>
<p> ---made it easier for agencies to buy supplies from sources other 
 than the Federal Supply Schedules;
<p> 
<p>---encouraged the establishment of cooperative administrative support 
 units to simplify the use of common administrative support services;
<p> 
<p>---implemented the use of a purchase card that allows simplified 
 procurement of supplies; and
<p> 
<p> ---delegated authority to agencies to procure information technology 
 products and services.
<p> 
<p> In managing FTS2000, GSA recognized the value of customer input by 
 establishing an Interagency Management Council, composed of agencies 
 using FTS2000, to provide advice on management and technical issues. 
 A number of other organizations have been created to elicit customer 
 input on GSA services, such as the Public Buildings Service's Real 
 Property Executives Advisory Committee and four Federal Supply 
 Service Interagency Committees-- on Travel Management, Transportation 
 and Traffic Management, Supply Management, and Aircraft Policy.
<p>
<p> 
<p><b>Reinvention Laboratories</b>
<p>
<p> As a central management agency, GSA plays a unique part in other 
 agencies' reinvention efforts. GSA took an early leadership role to 
 help other agencies unfetter their reinvention laboratories by 
 providing a list of personnel designated to assist in clarifying and 
 waiving GSA regulations. GSA also gave other agencies the authority 
 to waive Federal Acquisition Regulations for the reinvention labs. 
 These actions underscore GSA's active support for the reinvention 
 process throughout government.
<p> 
<p> GSA has established nine reinvention laboratories of its own. They 
 are:
<p> 
<p> ---regionwide laboratories in Philadelphia and Denver,
<p>
<p>---interagency fleet consolidation,
<p> 
<p> ---telecommuting,
<p> 
<p> ---ADP support services,
<p> 
<p> ---commercial products acquisition,
<p> 
<p> ---local telecommunications,
<p> 
<p> ---governmentwide electronic mail,
<p> 
<p> ---office products regional commodity center, and
<p> 
<p> ---time and attendance.
<p>  
<p><b> Need for Change</b>
<p>
<p> 
<p> 1. Conflict Between Policymaking and Service Delivery. The General 
 Accounting Office (GAO), the Senate Government Affairs Committee, and 
 others maintain that the current GSA organization, which places 
 responsibility for development and enforcement of governmentwide 
 policies with its service organization, has led to confusion--both 
 inside GSA and with its customers--over GSA's primary role, has 
 caused insecurity within GSA over its policymaking and oversight 
 responsibilities, and has contributed to GSA's "lackluster 
 performance in both areas."(7)
<p> 
<p> As long as policymaking and operational responsibilities are combined 
 within the same organization, there will be a tendency for 
 operational demands to supersede strategic policy considerations. 
 Requiring service delivery organizations to oversee and enforce 
 agency compliance with policies and regulations also interferes with 
 service delivery and the development of good customer relations.
<p> 
<p> State and foreign governments have found that the most effective way 
 to resolve the conflict between policymaking and day-today operations 
 is to separate the two functions.(8) GAO has emphasized that, 
 especially in a decentralized environment, it is critical that 
 policies be sensible and flexible and that they be accompanied by 
 consistent and knowledgeable guidance.(9) This suggests that GSA 
 should separate its policymaking functions from its service delivery 
 organizations and reorient oversight and enforcement to concentrate 
 on providing advice and results-oriented evaluations. GSA should also 
 serve as a clearinghouse for information on the various services it 
 provides, providing a central database to encourage the exchange of 
 information and reduce duplication of effort.
<p> 
<p> Unfortunately, policy organizations often lose sight of the full 
 impact their policies have on the field organizations that actually 
 perform the work of the government. One way to mitigate this problem 
 would be to establish personnel policies ensuring that people serving 
 in policy organizations have had prior field experience and that they 
 return to field activities from policy assignments. Another solution 
 would be to develop policies and oversight processes in collaboration 
 with affected federal agencies and field activities.
<p>  
<p> 2. Monopolistic Service Delivery. A basic tenet of the National 
 Performance Review is that agency heads and line managers are 
 intelligent, honest people capable of making good decisions on how to 
 allocate resources to best accomplish their missions. The existing 
 system of overly complex and detailed laws, rules, and regulations, 
 combined with centralized controls and decisionmaking, interferes 
 with a manager's ability to exercise initiative and balance resources 
 to fulfill agency needs. To correct this problem, and to better hold 
 managers accountable for mission accomplishment, full authority and 
 responsibility for all the resources needed and used must clearly and 
 unambiguously rest with the manager.
<p> 
<p> Present management policies often require managers to use a single 
 source (whether in their own agency or in a central management agency 
 such as GSA) to obtain needed resources. Such policies usually allow 
 a third party to control the resources a manager uses, to usurp 
 management resource decisions, or to control an agency management 
 process. These policies improperly dilute the authority and 
 responsibility of the line manager (and in many cases, the agency 
 head), thereby spreading accountability for mission accomplishment 
 among people not responsible for results. This significantly weakens 
 the ability of oversight agents (including the President and 
 Congress) to evaluate responsibility for program successes and 
 failures, and contributes to a misplaced emphasis on monitoring the 
 use of inputs rather than on results.
<p> 
<p> Examples of controls GSA exercises over other agencies include:
<p> 
<p> ---the Public Buildings Service monopoly over the price, amount, 
 location, and quality of agency space;
<p> 
<p> ---mandatory use requirements in the Federal Supply Schedules;
<p> 
<p> ---controls over disposition of personal and real property exercised 
 by both the Federal Supply Service and the Federal Property Resources 
 Service;
<p> 
<p> ---the requirement for the Information Resources Management Service 
 to review and approve agency automatic data processing (ADP) 
 acquisitions; and
<p> 
<p> ---the mandatory requirements for agencies to use FTS2000 for long 
 distance telecommunications service or IRMS contracts for local phone 
 service.
<p> 
<p> GSA has made some recent improvements in its service operations. 
 However, it must now recognize that the system of centralized 
 controls and monopolistic services does not allow agencies to meet 
 today's challenges and opportunities. It is not enough that GSA try 
 to become a better monopoly; true change will not occur until 
 agencies are free to choose where and how they spend their money. GSA 
 must become a fully competitive source for agency business and 
 further reinvent itself according to the principles that serve as the 
 basis for the National Performance Review, especially:
<p> 
<p> ---empowering employees (and, in GSA's case, customers);
<p> 
<p> ---delegating authority and responsibility;
<p> 
<p> ---replacing regulations with incentives; and
<p> 
<p> ---exposing federal operations to competition.
<p> 
<p> Many of the recommendations in the NPR Accompanying Report 
 Reinventing Support Services directly affect GSA's organization and 
 operations. Those recommendations, when implemented, will help 
 improve GSA's service delivery, free GSA's customers, and transform 
 GSA into a competitive service organization. For GSA to have the 
 management freedom it needs to become competitive, the Office of 
 Management and Budget (OMB) must revise its policies and allow GSA--
 along with other federal agencies that provide competitive, fully 
 reimbursable services--to be free from full-time equivalent (FTE) 
 personnel controls.(10) OMB must also revise other budgetary 
 restrictions (such as scoring rules) that interfere with good 
 decisionmaking.(11) This will help GSA optimize its ability to 
 compete. Management success and accountability would then be 
 determined by GSA's customers, not by arbitrary controls.
<p> 
<p> There may be occasions where the interests of the government--in 
 terms of meeting agency mission requirements at reduced overall 
 costs--may be better served by agencies working together or using a 
 common service, rather than acting independently. In those instances 
 where agencies agree that the preferred course of action is for GSA 
 to act as a mandatory service, the service should be managed like a 
 regulated utility, with a board of overseers comprising customer 
 agencies who would oversee GSA's policies, rates, operations, and 
 service delivery for that service.(12)
<p> 
<p> 3. Functional Transfers. Over time GSA has become responsible for 
 providing administrative support for activities that might more 
 properly be assigned to other agencies. Two of these are:
<p> 
<p> ---Indian Trust Accounting Office--This office provides accounting 
 services related to the adjudication of Indian Tribal claims against 
 the government. Its activities are directed by the Department of 
 Justice (DOJ), which is the exclusive user of the services.
<p> 
<p> ---Transportation audits--GSA is required to conduct post-payment 
 audits of all transportation bills submitted to the government.(13) 
 Recoveries from overcharges are used to pay audit costs. Any excess 
 receipts are returned to the Treasury, which results in agencies 
 losing use of funds that would otherwise be available for agency 
 programs. GSA has demonstrated that the technology now exists to 
 audit transportation bills prior to payment. By reviewing bills 
 before payment, erroneous payments will be avoided and funds will 
 remain available to the agency conducting the audit. Agencies using 
 the transportation services, rather than GSA, should conduct the 
 prepayment audits and gain the associated benefits.
<p> 
<p> In fiscal year 1995, 65 people and about $5 million would be shifted 
 from GSA if the activities discussed above were transferred to other 
 agencies.
<p>   
<p> 4. Acquisition of New Real Property, Supplies, and Services. GSA 
 plans to spend about $800 million a year in the next five years 
 acquiring new federal office space and courthouses. At the same time, 
 federal employment will be reduced by at least 252,000; the 
 Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) continues to sell property at 10 
 cents to 50 cents on the dollar; private office vacancy rates are 
 running in the 10-25 percent range; one NPR issue paper would make 
 significant changes in the ways agencies demand, and GSA supplies, 
 real property assets; another set of recommendations would examine 
 the mission, size, structure, and locations of Department of Housing 
 and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture 
 field offices; and federal courthouses continue to be built to overly 
 expensive, inefficient design standards.(14) All of these factors 
 suggest that it may be wise to reconsider the scope of GSA's current 
 building acquisition program.
<p> 
<p> Similarly, the changes that are occurring in the federal workforce, 
 agency organizations, and government procurement systems suggest that 
 there may be opportunities to achieve efficiencies in acquiring goods 
 and services--that is, the government should be able to reduce 
 procurement costs while still buying the goods and services that it 
 needs.(15)
<p> 
<p><b> Actions</b>
<p>
<p>1. Separate policymaking and oversight from service delivery and fund 
 policymaking from direct appropriations.(1)
<p> 
<p>By April 1994, the GSA administrator should clearly separate 
 governmentwide policy and oversight functions from the GSA service 
 delivery organizations (FSS, PBS, FPRS, IRMS, and FTS2000). This 
 would:
<p>
<p> 1. improve GSA's ability to manage both policymaking and service 
 delivery;
<p>
<p> 2. help eliminate the use of regulatory authorities to promote 
 centralized services; and
<p>
<p>3. make it easier for GSA to develop proper service relationships 
 with its customers.
<p> 
<p> GSA should always develop policy guidance in consultation with other 
 federal agencies. That guidance should be in the form of flexible 
 broad guidelines, rather than rigid rules. GSA should refocus its 
 oversight and enforcement activities to emphasize leadership and 
 results-oriented evaluations. To ensure that the flexibility and 
 authority being granted by GSA to the agencies is passed on to line 
 managers, GSA's evaluations of other agencies should include a review 
 of the restrictions imposed by those agencies on their line managers.
<p> 
<p>By April 1994, the GSA administrator should establish personnel 
 policies to ensure that employees assigned to policy organizations 
 have prior field experience (whether in GSA or in other agencies) and 
 that they return to field assignments after service in the policy 
 organizations.
<p> 
<p> The GSA administrator and the OMB director should ensure that all of 
 GSA's governmentwide policy and oversight functions are fully funded 
 by direct appropriations and are not underwritten by charges to GSA 
 customers. GSA and OMB should work together to establish staffing and 
 funding levels that would allow GSA to fulfill its policymaking and 
 oversight responsibilities.
<p>
<p> 2. Allow agencies to choose whether to purchase GSA services, and 
 fund GSA service delivery from customer revenues.(1)
<p> 
<p>The GSA administrator should transfer authority, revise regulations, 
 and develop legislation so that GSA's customers--whether they use 
 real property, communications services, supplies, computers, or 
 disposal services--have the freedom to choose where they do business.
<p> 
<p> GSA should create competitive enterprises to compete as service 
 providers to other federal agencies.16 Federal agencies will be 
 required to procure services from a single source only if there is a 
 demonstrable advantage to the government as a whole. If agencies and 
 GSA agree that monopoly service would both meet agency mission 
 requirements and be more beneficial to the government, the GSA 
 operation providing the service must be guided by a board of 
 overseers comprising GSA customers using the service. The board of 
 overseers would approve policies, oversee operations, evaluate 
 service delivery, and set rates (including overhead charges).
<p> 
<p> All GSA service operations should be fully paid for through customer 
 revenues. The GSA administrator should ensure that there are no 
 cross-subsidies between different accounts within or between the 
 services.
<p>
<p> 3. Transfer activities not related to GSA's central mission to other 
 agencies.(2,3)
<p> 
<p> ---Indian Trust Accounting Office. By October 1995, the OMB director 
 should transfer this office to the Department of Justice (DOJ).
<p>
<p>---Transportation audits. By October 1993, the OMB director should 
 submit legislation eliminating the requirement for post-payment 
 audits. Until Congress passes that legislation, the GSA administrator 
 should further encourage agencies to conduct prepayment audits by 
 increasing its delegations.
<p>
<p> 4. Suspend acquisition of net new office space and courthouses.(1)
<p>
 The GSA administrator should place an immediate hold on GSA's 
 acquisition (whether by construction, purchase, or lease) of net new 
 office space, reduce and rescope new courthouse construction, and 
 begin aggressive lease negotiations for both existing and new leases. 
 These actions will enable GSA to save at least $450 million per year 
 over the next 5 years.  
<p> 
<p> 5. Reduce procurement spending.(1)
<p>
<p> The GSA administrator should convene an ad hoc committee of the 
 President's Management Council to develop specific recommendations to 
 reduce procurement spending 5 to 10 percent per year from current 
 levels without reducing products or services. The committee should 
 provide its recommendations to the Vice President by December 1994.
<p>
<p> 6. Improve GSA service delivery.(4)
<p>
<p> As GSA is made a fully reimbursable, competitive organization and as 
 the recommendations contained in the NPR Accompanying Reports 
 Reinventing Support Services and Reinventing Federal Procurement are 
 implemented, the GSA administrator should consider the following 
 opportunities to improve effectiveness and customer service:
<p>
<p> ---Implement one-stop shopping. Ensure customer requirements are met 
 simply and quickly by establishing account executives to provide a 
 single face to the customer and act as facilitators with other GSA 
 offices.
<p>
<p> ---Reduce overhead. Examine the distribution of personnel between 
 staff offices and line operations (in both the central office and the 
 regions) and between headquarters and field activities. Additional 
 opportunities may exist to put more people to work directly serving 
 agency customers.
<p>
<p> ---Streamline the organization. Determine whether some functions 
 performed at the central office might be eliminated or transferred to 
 one of the regions, whether the number of regions should be reduced, 
 and whether the present organization best serves its agency 
 customers.
<p> 
<p> ---Improve telecommunications management. Return FTS2000 to IRMS as 
 soon as practical. FTS2000 was separated from IRMS to focus greater 
 management attention on telecommunications. However, the management 
 problems appear to have been resolved and long distance 
 telecommunications services in the Office of FTS2000 and the 
 information technology services in IRMS are increasingly 
 interconnected. The two offices should be reunited organizationally.

<H2> Recommendations From Other NPR Accompanying Reports That Affect GSA</H2>
<p> 
<p>The following recommendations from other issue papers would have a 
 significant organizational or resource impact on GSA.
<p> 
<p> SUP01: Authorize the executive branch to establish a printing policy 
 that will eliminate the current printing monopoly.
 
<p> The recommendations in this issue paper would grant GSA authority to 
 establish executive branch printing policy.
<p>  
<p> SUP03: Improve distribution systems to reduce costly inventories.

<p> This issue paper requires that GSA (and other agencies) maintain 
 depots only when there is an overriding national security interest or 
 an economic advantage over commercial alternatives.
<p> 
<p> SUP04: Streamline and improve contracting strategies for the Multiple 
 Award Schedule program.

<p> This issue paper contains a number of recommendations that would, 
 among other things, eliminate mandatory requirements for the Multiple 
 Award Schedule program and change synopsis and order limitations for 
 information technology procurements.
<p> 
<p> SUP05: Expand agency authority and incentives for personal property 
 management and disposal.

<p>This issue paper would give agencies the authority to dispose of 
 agency-owned vehicles and remove GSA as the monopoly service 
 provider.
<p>
<p> SUP06: Eliminate the monopoly that will devolve personal property 
 management authorities.

<p> This issue paper would allow agencies to dispose of their own excess 
 or surplus property and use GSA's disposal services as a matter of 
 choice, rather than a mandatory requirement.
<p>
<p> SUP08: Give customers choices and create real property enterprises 
 that promote sound asset management.
<p> Among other things, the recommendations in this issue paper would 
 make substantial changes in GSA's Public Buildings Service by 
 granting agencies the authority to choose their sources of real 
 property services, creating competitive real property enterprises and 
 centers of expertise within GSA, and improving GSA's management of 
 the government's real property assets.
<p>
<p>PROC08: Reform Information Technology (IT) procurements.

<p> The recommendations in this issue paper would significantly increase 
 the delegation of ADP procurement authority and waive GSA-mandated 
 requirements and alternatives analyses for small dollar commercial 
 automatic data processing acquisitions.

<p>
<p><H2>Agency Reinvention Activities</H2>
<p>
<p> President Clinton's creation of the National Performance Review as a 
 means to reinvent government presented a unique opportunity for GSA 
 to further its efforts to increase innovation and excellence and to 
 deliver more responsive, cost-effective service to its customers. On 
 March 15, 1993, GSA formed a Performance Review Council, comprising 
 representatives from GSA business areas and regions, to address Vice 
 President Gore's priorities for reinventing government. The Council 
 began with an agencywide call for ideas to make GSA more effective 
 and to save taxpayers money.
<p> 
<p>Many of these ideas were woven into an "Agenda for Action,'' which 
 represents GSA's initial planning efforts to capture the spirit of 
 entrepreneurial governance. It identifies opportunities for GSA 
 leadership to respond to information age challenges in the workforce 
 and workplace and identifies systemic problems--involving 
 governmentwide rules, regulations, and systems--that must be solved 
 to create a government that works better and costs less.
<p> 
<p> When, on April 9, Vice President Gore asked GSA to establish an 
 agency reinvention team and designate reinvention laboratories, GSA 
 acted quickly to do so. The laboratories are described below.
<p>
<p><b> Reinvention Laboratories</b>
<p>
<p> Regionwide Laboratories: Philadelphia and Denver. 
 These reinvention laboratories are designed for regionwide 
 implementation, encompassing all activities within the region. They 
 encourage employees to take a fresh look at the ways they accomplish 
 their work, with an eye toward removing any impediments placed on 
 them. The regions have been given blanket authority to waive GSA 
 rules or regulations.
<p>
<p><b> Interagency Fleet Consolidation Lab.</b> 
<p>This reinvention laboratory is designed to rapidly consolidate Army, 
 Air Force, Coast Guard, and Department of Energy fleets, consisting 
 of over 4,000 vehicles, into the GSA's Interagency Fleet Management 
 System (IFMS), resulting in savings to taxpayers of over $1 million 
 annually. In addition, it will avoid repeating lengthy cost/benefit 
 studies that consistently have demonstrated these consolidations are 
 substantially beneficial to everyone.
<p>
<p><b>Telecommuting Lab. </b>
<p>The lab brings together volunteers, communities, environmental and 
 energy concerns, and intergovernmental cooperation to aid federal 
 employees traveling long distances between home and Washington, D.C.
<p>
<p><b>Automatic Data Processing Support Services Lab. </b>
 This reinvention laboratory is designed to test three new ways of 
 providing federal customers with private sector information 
 technology (IT) support. The first will move GSA to a support role, 
 allowing customer agencies to deal more directly with vendors; the 
 second will expand IT support services to interested state and local 
 governments; the third will give customers greater choice by making 
 multiple vendors available for the same services.
<p>
<p><b>Commercial Products Acquisition Lab. </b>
<p> This reinvention laboratory is designed to provide an electronic 
 ordering and billing interface among agencies, GSA, and vendors for 
 certain high-demand commercial products. It will reduce procurement 
 paperwork for customer agencies, centralize billing for all parties, 
 and enhance GSA's inventory control.
<p>
<p><b>Local Telecommunications Lab. </b>
<p>This reinvention laboratory is designed to demonopolize local 
 telecommunications services in Kansas City, Missouri, and allow open 
 competition for dial tone services, including provisions for expanded 
 optional support, such as cable management and video services.
<p> 
<p><b>Governmentwide Electronic Mail Lab.</b> 
<p> This reinvention laboratory is designed to establish governmentwide 
 electronic mail between certain federal agencies, including a common 
 directory and a "Help Desk'' to respond to user questions.
<p>  
<p><b>Office Products Regional Commodity Center.</b> 
<p> This reinvention laboratory is designed to establish new ways of 
 providing office supplies, paper, and packaging products to the 
 federal community. The lab will test fundamental changes to 
 contracting and will implement statistical process control techniques 
 to isolate supplier problems before manufacturing begins. Customer 
 agencies will benefit by greater on-time delivery of high-quality, 
 low-cost products.
<p>  
<p><b>Time and Attendance Lab. </b>
<p> This reinvention laboratory is designed to replace manual time card 
 procedures with an efficient and secure electronic input system. This 
 will reduce labor-intensive paperwork and save time for federal 
 employees.

<H2>Department of Housing and Urban Development</H2>
<p>
Executive Summary
<HR>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the federal 
agency primarily responsible for housing programs, enforcement of 
fair housing laws, and improvement in the quality of life in the 
nation's cities, towns, and villages. More than 10 million Americans 
benefit directly from HUD's single-family mortgage insurance and 
housing subsidy programs. Millions more benefit directly and 
indirectly through HUD's other major programs, such as community 
development block grants. 
<p>
The department has approximately 13,500 employees--3,500 in its 
Washington headquarters and 10,000 in its 10 regional offices and 70 
area offices across the country. HUD's fiscal 1992 budget was $25 
billion.
<p>
HUD was established as a cabinet-level agency in 1965, charged with 
the broad mission of both creating and maintaining decent, affordable 
housing and stable communities. This action was a consolidation of 
the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and U.S. Housing Authority 
which were created in 1934 and 1937 respectively.
<p>
The National Performance Review (NPR) analysis indicates that HUD's 
most pressing problems and the greatest opportunities for improvement 
are in management of public housing and asset management and 
disposition.
<p>
While only 24 of the nation's more than 3,000 housing authorities are 
classified as troubled, these authorities account for 18 percent of 
all public housing units. Collectively, they receive more than 30 
percent of all public housing operating subsidies, consume more than 
25 percent of all future modernization funds, and have an average 
vacancy rate of 13 percent. 
<p>
NPR recommends a comprehensive five-point program to reinvent the 
nation's public housing program. Particular focus is given to the 
need to cut red tape to get improved results. The program includes 
the devolution of control to local public housing authorities (PHAs) 
with an established performance record and a cooperative effort of 
federal and local officials and public housing tenants to eliminate 
unnecessary HUD requirements. It also includes a hard-hitting 
targeted HUD initiative to resolve the problems of the relatively few 
troubled PHAs. HUD should also be authorized to use new construction 
and modernization funds to develop demonstration models. These models 
give public housing tenants market powers and freedoms by creating 
mixed-income developments that fund portable tenant subsidies. With a 
portable subsidy, an assisted tenant becomes a paying customer rather 
than a dependent beneficiary of public housing. HUD should be allowed 
to authorize sale of existing public housing units when the proceeds 
could guarantee replacement of the units in greater numbers with 
enhanced housing options for public housing tenants.
<p>
HUD also faces the overwhelming and worsening tasks of managing 
problem loans and disposing of foreclosed properties. The key to 
doing so is to use public-private partnerships that use market 
dynamics to achieve results in managing and disposing of real estate 
assets. HUD staff will measure performance rather than administer 
through government bureaucracy and red tape--steer rather than row.
<p>
The current inventory of multifamily units is approximately 48,000 
units and growing. Assuming no change in policy, HUD would require an 
additional $6.5 billion in budget authority to process this 
inventory. HUD needs more flexibility to address management and 
disposition of formerly subsidized housing projects--especially 
authorization to use portable rental subsidies, rather than the 
presently required project-based subsidy procedures, for tenants in 
buildings to be sold when they would be more cost-effective for HUD's 
overall mission.
<p>
Nearly $1 billion in HUD-coinsured loans are already in default, and 
existing audits indicate that billions more in defaulted loans are 
expected. HUD also has an inventory of more than 90,000 single-family 
loans, valued at about $3.3 billion, about half of which are not 
current. Last year, approximately 17,000 new loans were taken into 
HUD's inventory, and only 1,700 were resolved through foreclosure.
<p>
Finally, HUD should develop a Loss Mitigation Program for early 
intervention with FHA-insured homeowners in financial difficulty.
<p>
HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros has been aggressive in making HUD 
reinvention a central theme in his management of the department. 
Reinvention labs are underway through the experimental use of sales 
of HUD's inventory of single-family properties in cooperation with 
nonprofit organizations and their communities, as well as in 
innovations in public housing management, affirmative marketing, a 
homeless initiative in the nation's capital, and a community 
partnership against crime.
<p>
The most important past, present, and future commitment of taxpayer 
funds through HUD is represented in the outstanding portfolios of: 
1.4 million public housing units, 2.2 million privately owned units 
assisted under contract by HUD, $378 billion of outstanding FHA 
insurance, and $12 billion of real estate and loan assets held by 
HUD.
<p>
The HUD NPR review focused primarily where the money is--in these 
outstanding portfolios. Some of the NPR recommendations will lead to 
specific, measurable financial benefits. Those savings are expected 
to be $602.0 million in budget authority and $424.9 million in 
outlays from 1994 through 1999.

Recommendations and Actions

<P>
<h2>HUD01:  Reinvent Public Housing</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
When the federal public housing program began in the 1930s, it was 
hailed as an enlightened response to squalid living conditions of the 
waves of European immigrants crowded into unsafe, privately built 
tenements in cities across the country. The program represented a 
partnership between federal, state and local governments, with the 
federal government providing construction and (later) operating 
subsidies, as well as comprehensive and detailed regulations 
concerning how tenants were to be selected and projects operated. 
States assisted the federal government in enforcing compliance with 
federal regulations, and local public housing authorities (PHAs) 
operated the housing projects.

<p>By the 1970s, public housing had come to symbolize all that was wrong 
with the traditional approach to social problems. Inflexible, 
universal standards set in Washington combined with local political 
and social realities frequently led to construction of large, high-
rise projects in the worst sections of urban centers. The size and 
architecture of these projects--often dictated by well-motivated 
federal regulations--added to the stigma of living in the projects. 

<p>Even now, rigid federal management rules limit the ability of 
managers to apply common sense; for example, prohibiting in some 
instances provision of air conditioning even when it is most needed. 
Finally, inflexible rent rules based on income give residents who 
achieve working-class income status strong incentive to move out of 
public housing. As a result, many housing projects are inhabited by 
an overwhelming majority of single-parent families on public 
assistance. 

<p>The statutory mandate that no public housing unit can be demolished 
unless replaced, one-for-one, with other public housing makes it very 
difficult to get rid of inefficient units. Site and neighborhood 
requirements, design requirements, and rules enforcing a 
concentration of the very poor make it difficult to construct 
replacement public housing as required by the one-for-one rule. While 
the benefits of income mixing are generally recognized, local 
officials are virtually prohibited from achieving that objective in 
most public housing because of the way the program is presently 
structured.

<p>Problem PHAs suffer from politicized staffing and other locally 
created inefficiencies, along with federal limitations. Although 
these problem PHAs are very limited in number, their difficulties are 
seemingly intractable and detrimental to all efforts in low-income 
housing. HUD needs to take strong remedial action. 
<p>
During the 1980s, innovative state and local governments, frustrated 
by virtual abandonment of the federal government's commitment to 
affordable housing for the poor, began to experiment on their own 
with new models of developing, designing, financing, managing, and 
owning low-income housing. These models included use of public-
private partnerships to develop housing, use of community-based 
nonprofit organizations to manage and/or own housing, and direct low-
income family ownership of housing. Successful efforts tailored 
housing to the unique characteristics of the community in which it 
was built and minimized use of strict, centrally developed 
regulations. Flexibility was essential to the programs' success. 
Transfer of decisionmaking to the lowest possible level was key.
<p>
HUD did begin to respond to the need for rethinking its management of 
public housing resources with a new program called HOPE (which aimed 
to sell public housing to tenants interested in and capable of buying 
their apartments). However, the public housing program still suffers 
from excessive regulation and centralization. For example, HUD field 
staff spend substantial amounts of time annually reviewing and 
approving detailed budgets from local PHAs even though those reviews 
have no impact on federal funding decisions.
<p>

<b>Actions</B>
<p>
1. HUD should establish demonstration projects that dramatically 
devolve control of public housing to local PHAs with histories of 
sound management, and provide the required ongoing operating 
subsidies subject only to the local PHA meeting a series of 
performance targets.
<p>
The devolution, which is an extreme form of delegation, would start 
on a demonstration basis with volunteer PHAs to create procedures and 
standards for measuring performance. Individual demonstrations will 
vary, but all federal rules will be open for waiver so long as HUD 
can successfully measure performance in providing long-term 
affordable housing to those federally targeted as being most in need.
<p>
HUD will require legislative authority for the Secretary to waive 
statutory requirements for the purpose of carrying out specific, 
well-monitored demonstrations. All such waivers, and the results of 
demonstrations, should be reported to Congress.
<p>
In these demonstrations of significant devolution of operating 
authority, PHAs will be free to develop unique, flexible approaches 
of their own. For example, funds could be provided to tenants as 
portable subsidies for use in public housing or in privately owned 
units. Funds could also be used in cooperation with a local nonprofit 
or other entity to create or purchase new housing using non-
traditional management techniques.
<p>

2. HUD should work closely with local PHAs, their national 
organizations, public housing tenant representatives, and state and 
local government officials to eliminate unnecessary HUD requirements 
and procedures.
<p>
The requirement for annual budget review is a good example. HUD 
should seek to identify those rules and regulations that could be 
eliminated and those that could be more effectively administered at a 
level of government closer to the customer. As part of this effort, 
HUD will replace its detailed procurement and operating manuals and 
design and site-selection requirements, instead using performance 
measures and annual ranking of local PHAs to encourage better service 
and greater accountability. HUD will also work with Congress to 
develop an alternative to the current rent rules, which create strong 
disincentives for working families to remain in public housing.
<p>

3. HUD should be authorized to target new construction and 
modernization funds to both HUD and locally developed demonstration 
models that seek to provide choices to public housing tenants, 
including the option to use their housing subsidies to move to units 
outside of public housing.
<p>
Some of the new funds would go to demonstrations that HUD develops. 
The rest would be awarded to local PHAs and governments on a 
competitive basis, funding a wide array of models that seek to 
achieve a better income mix and to empower public housing tenants 
with portable assistance, thus applying a market discipline on 
project managers. Similar demonstrations should be established using 
funds already allocated for new construction and modernization. 
Demonstrations should also occur in some existing public housing not 
receiving modernization funds.
<p>
Legislation would be needed to authorize HUD to waive appropriate 
statutory restrictions to implement the demonstrations with maximum 
flexibility.
<p>

4. HUD should make a hard-hitting, targeted effort to resolve the 
severe difficulties of those few public housing agencies identified 
as problem PHAs.
<p>
Use of an outside team of experts from the public housing industry 
for a new look should result in wide-ranging recommendations. 
Recommendations may include putting services now handled by the PHA 
out for bid by private companies, non-profit organizations, or 
neighboring PHAs. HUD should use all of its leverage with these 
agencies to incorporate the recommendations into a specific 
memorandum of agreement enforceable by HUD.
<p>

5. HUD should be permitted to authorize sale of public housing units 
with flexible requirements for replacement housing. 
<p>
The criteria for this authorization would be limited to times when 
sale prices are high (relative to the benefits currently received by 
existing tenants), so that sales proceeds could guarantee long-term 
replacement housing in greater numbers and with improved tenant 
options. The key would be that the replacement arrangement would 
provide a superior guarantee of a long-term housing resource as 
opposed to that which would be available from the project to be sold. 
A combination of mixed-income development and endowed portable 
subsidies may be an option in some cases. For example, the sale price 
might be sufficiently high to permit establishing an investment fund, 
the interest of which could permanently fund portable subsidy 
assistance. This approach would replace, where appropriate, the 
relatively rigid current rule of one-for-one replacement of public 
housing with new public housing as a prerequisite to sale or 
demolition of public housing.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Elimination of excessive and unnecessary regulations and transfer of 
operating authority to localities should reduce the cost of 
administering the public housing program at the federal level and 
apply a greater percentage of subsidy dollars at the local level. 
Intelligent deregulation will also enable HUD to use its limited 
staff resources to generate more effective low-income housing policy 
and better protect our substantial subsidized low-income housing 
stock.
<p>
It is envisioned that demonstrations of devolution of program 
authority would be experimental in nature and require regulatory and 
statutory waiver authority which would likely exceed that resulting 
from the general streamlining of public housing regulations and 
handbooks outlined in Action 2.
<p>
Directing new construction and modernization appropriations to 
federally and locally initiated demonstrations should begin to 
transform public housing from its image as the provider of high-rise, 
deteriorating projects. Its new image will be as the facilitator of 
innovative, mixed-income, community-managed or tenant-owned 
affordable housing, tailored to the local environment.
<p>
Unlike conventional public housing, mixed-income, market-oriented 
developments, implemented as part of the recommended demonstrations, 
will not raise the same negative stereotype--that public housing 
harms neighborhoods. The greater acceptability of demonstration 
public housing developments, combined with waivers of restrictive 
rules governing placement and construction of new public housing, 
will facilitate use of the existing backlog of unused new 
construction funds. Facilitating new construction of public housing 
should result in tearing down some of the worst old projects, whose 
demolition has been blocked by a lack of replacement public housing 
and the rigid rule of one-for-one replacement of public housing 
units.
<p>
If these changes are implemented, public housing tenants will receive 
better housing for the same rent and at the same level of public 
subsidy. Local communities will benefit from the improved 
environment, in that crime in public housing is likely to decrease 
and tenants will have a much better chance of living productive 
lives. The newly constructed public housing will also become a 
neighborhood benefit rather than a symbol of deterioration and crime. 
State and local governments will benefit by being better able to 
target the federal housing assistance they receive to local needs. 
HUD will benefit by using its existing resources to better serve its 
customers, construct new affordable housing that is truly a long term 
asset, and free up staff.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
At a minimum, these recommended changes would substantially reduce 
the waste of housing assistance and staff time spent on the 
construction, rehabilitation, and operation of housing that does not 
work and on regulations that do not achieve any meaningful 
objectives. While it is not possible to quantify specific dollar 
savings at this point, it is reasonable to assume that the reduction 
in unnecessary and often counter-productive regulations will actually 
cut the cost of maintaining public housing while providing a higher 
level of housing services to the tenants. New construction, designed 
to meet community needs and standards, should be less expensive per 
unit to construct and require lower maintenance costs compared to the 
centrally dictated, often undesirable projects constructed 
previously.

<h2>HUD02:  Improve Multi-Family Asset Management and Disposition</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has an 
unmanageable and still growing workload of problem multifamily loans 
and foreclosed properties. Management and disposition of these loans 
and real estate are hampered by outdated practices and restrictive 
and unrealistic statutory rules. Additional staff is not a practical 
alternative. The problems are different for subsidized projects and 
for market-rate rental apartment buildings and loans secured by such 
apartment buildings.
<p>
Market-rate rental properties and mortgage loans owned by HUD are 
those HUD-held assets that do not have statutory mandates concerning 
their use, other than the mandate to protect taxpayer resources and 
the financial viability of the appropriate insurance fund. These 
assets should receive separate treatment from subsidized housing 
projects and loans on subsidized housing projects. The market-rate 
properties and loans should be considered as primarily financial 
assets, and their value should be maximized by efficient asset 
management and disposition.
<p>
As with all of its asset disposition, HUD is traditionally geared to 
manage and sell these assets in-house, with primarily government 
staff and governmental decisionmaking. Negotiating compromises and 
restructures, selling or securitizing (a complex form of selling) 
loans returned to performing status, and managing and selling 
foreclosed collateral are functions performed best by skilled 
business persons with their own money at risk and a direct financial 
stake in the outcome. A comparable environment cannot be created 
within a governmental context. Loans owned by HUD because of the now 
defunct co-insurance program (and other such loans that may be 
coming) are particularly appropriate for use of new public-private 
techniques.
<p>
HUD should consider a variety of alternatives including bulk sales, 
securitization, and contract management. HUD should identify the 
alternative that best turns over management of business 
decisionmaking for market-rate assets to the private sector with the 
least discount in the financial return to HUD. The most likely 
candidate is probably a public-private limited partnership 
arrangement. Several large-scale transactions, appropriate as models 
for HUD, have recently been closed by the Resolution Trust 
Corporation (RTC).
<p>
HUD multi-family loan and real estate assets involving subsidized 
units have extra complications hindering use of pure, private sector, 
asset-value-maximizing mechanisms. In recent years, Congress has 
tightened requirements for HUD to sell foreclosed multi-family 
housing properties that are classified as formerly subsidized. Sales 
may only be for long-term use as subsidized housing. Current 
requirements are that 15-year project-based rent subsidies must be 
attached to 100 percent of the units to maintain the buildings as 
subsidized housing projects for 15 more years.
<p>
HUD estimates $6.5 billion more in rental assistance funds would be 
needed over a five-year period to permit selling the current 
inventory of HUD-held and foreclosure properties classified as 
formerly subsidized. Properties are being held in HUD inventory with 
a continuing decrease in their value. The result is a large federal 
public housing stock. The restrictions on sales also make it 
difficult for HUD to maintain timely payment compliance because 
borrowers are aware that HUD cannot afford to foreclose. It is 
important that HUD gain some relief from these statutory restrictions 
on sale and demolition of HUD-held, formerly subsidized properties.
<p>
HUD has proposed modifications of the statutory requirements for 
disposition of multi-family properties. Those proposals, if adopted, 
would help ease HUD's management and fiscal problem. While reducing 
the present statutory obligation, the HUD proposals still keep the 
goal of maintaining many of these units as affordable housing with 
15-year HUD subsidies. The HUD proposals shift some subsidy funding 
from 15-year commitment of appropriated rental subsidy to 15-year 
rent restrictions and occupancy requirements to achieve essentially 
the same effect. Any reduction in rent resulting from rent and 
occupancy restrictions would, presumably, be funded by HUD through 
reduced sales price of the real estate. That will shift costs from 
appropriated rental subsidies to reduced return to the insurance 
fund. Altogether, the HUD proposals, if enacted, will greatly help in 
reducing costs, moving the HUD inventory and encouraging more income 
mix in the buildings after sale.
<p>
The HUD proposals will still result in a large percentage of the 
apartments sold being assisted with subsidies tied to the units, 
i.e., not portable subsidies. Non-portable subsidies tend to protect 
the building owner at the expense of the tenant who loses the benefit 
of the portable subsidy. Subsidies tied to the unit also tend to be a 
more expensive way of delivering value to the tenant and thus are 
expensive to the taxpayer. If HUD could freely use portable subsidies 
to assist those tenants presently receiving assistance (without 
obligation to the building or the unit per se) HUD could, in many 
cases, provide more desirable assistance to tenants, encourage income 
mix, and have a more beneficial impact on surrounding neighborhoods 
at lower cost than under the HUD-proposed legislation. In addition, 
that flexibility to replace project-based subsidies with portable 
subsidies after foreclosure would greatly increase HUD's leverage in 
dealing with poor managers of assisted private housing and borrowers 
on HUD-insured loans.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should identify those market-rate rental apartment buildings 
and HUD-held loans secured by such apartment buildings as primarily 
financial assets and should maximize the present value financial 
return in disposition. 
<p>
These assets, which do not involve formerly subsidized housing, 
specifically include the large volume of apartment building loans and 
real estate flowing to HUD as a result of a co-insurance program that 
has now been phased out.
<p>

2. For the identified financial assets, HUD should use the best 
practice models of public-private partnerships for management and 
disposition of problem loans and real estate, as opposed to working 
those assets with in-house staff. 
<p>
Several models for wholesale transferring of problem loan and real 
estate assets have been developed by the private sector and by the 
federal agencies dealing with financial institutions. The RTC has 
made extensive use of bulk sales, but the best practice models are 
the public-private partnerships also developed by RTC. Partnership 
models can be expected to achieve up to 25 percent better yields than 
the bulk sales. The partnership structures used include limited 
partnerships and security arrangements.
<p>

3. Statutory restrictions on HUD disposition of multi-family 
properties held as a result of FHA insurance programs should be 
relaxed; HUD should be authorized to assist affected tenants with 
portable subsidies (as opposed to assistance tied to the project or 
unit) when appropriate.
<p>
Lower-income tenants should be protected through portable subsidies 
when appropriate. Portable subsidies are appropriate when the 
objectives of assisting and empowering tenants, encouraging income 
mix, and causing a favorable impact on surrounding communities can 
most efficiently be achieved by that means. When portable subsidies 
are used for tenants, properties may then be managed and disposed of 
through public-private partnerships for maximum financial yield to 
the insurance fund.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Using state-of-the-art public-private partnerships would release HUD 
staff from the detailed work of asset management and disposition. 
Partnerships with private entrepreneurs will bring highly skilled 
business persons with positive financial incentives to the business 
of working out problem assets. For those assets which HUD may treat 
as primarily financial assets, financial return would be maximized.
<p>
Releasing restrictions on HUD property disposition would assist HUD 
in dealing with the major buildup of HUD's portfolio of formerly 
subsidized real estate, which is diminishing in value under 
government management. HUD would also have increased leverage to 
negotiate with and/or discipline borrowers not meeting their 
obligations.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The above recommendations will not result in immediate reduction of 
government appropriations or budgeted outlays, but, because these are 
the major areas of HUD financial investment and operations, improved 
efficiency would have significant long-term impact on the cost to 
taxpayers of operating HUD.

<h2>HUD03:  Improve Single-Family Asset Management and Disposition</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA), is insuring more than $375 
billion of real estate loans.(1) HUD is often required to pay an 
insurance claim to the lender and either take over the insured loan 
(i.e., take an assignment of the loan) or take ownership of the real 
estate that was collateral for the loan. As a result, HUD has an 
overwhelming, and worsening, task in managing problem loans assigned 
to it and in disposing of the real estate it owns. In recent years, 
the workload--especially for loan management and real estate 
disposition--has been increasing while HUD staff is shrinking. 
Increased staff is unlikely; nor is it the best way to deal with an 
essentially business--not government--function like management and 
disposition of problem assets (loans and real estate).
<p>
Legally, HUD is required to defer foreclosure and take assignment of 
home mortgages when it appears that the default was due to 
circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and it may be possible 
to return a homeowner's loan to a performing status within a three-
year period. During that time HUD may temporarily reduce or forgo 
mortgage payments.
<p>
About one of five single-family defaulted loans goes to HUD 
assignment rather than to immediate foreclosure. This creates an out-
of-control workload and forces difficult personalized judgments on 
lower-level HUD staff. HUD has more than 90,000 such loans, valued at 
about $3.3 billion. About one-half are in default. Last year, about 
17,000 new loans were taken in by HUD by assignment, and only about 
1,700 were resolved through foreclosure.(2) The portfolio is thus 
building at a great rate. The loans are serviced in-house, which 
further strains HUD systems and staff capabilities. Loan servicing is 
a commonly available contract service performed by the private sector 
for competitively set prices. Private companies operating in a 
competitive market can normally provide a business service (like loan 
servicing) more efficiently than a government staff, which is 
protected from the rigors of competition.
<p>
Single-family homeowner loans held by HUD require two very different 
kinds of attention. The first, decisions as to forbearance, requires 
determining whether a homeowner is having only a temporary financial 
difficulty--not of his or her own making--and is thus deserving of 
federal assistance. The homeowner may be assisted by deferring 
payment of money due. These are individualized, somewhat subjective 
decisions of a social service character. Social service-oriented 
nonprofit (or, perhaps, for-profit) private organizations can usually 
handle such issues with more flexibility and sensitivity than can 
government staff. That is especially so when the government staff is 
stretched too thin.
<p>
The second kind of attention needed, the task of working assets, is 
very different. Working assets is the effort to maximize financial 
return from the $3.3 billion of loans and loan-derived real estate, 
to protect the FHA Fund and indirectly the taxpayer. It requires 
quick, tough business decisionmaking. For defaulted loans, legal 
process should be put in place quickly and loan workouts, 
compromises, or foreclosures and sale accomplished quickly with a 
focused money-making orientation. This is a suitable task for a 
business organization with its own money at risk and a clear profit 
motive tied to maximizing the net return from the assets. This is not 
as suitable a task for salaried government staff working from 
government rules and handbooks.
<p>
It is not likely, in any event, that HUD will be able to staff 
appropriately for this task--either in numbers or in appropriate 
skills. A totally new approach is required. A public-private 
partnership, organized to maximize the value of the assets entrusted 
to it, would work well for part of the job: working the assets. A 
directly relevant model partnership has been used by the Resolution 
Trust Corporation (RTC), an organization established to dispose of 
assets from failed savings and loans. The RTC partnership model was 
used for about $4 billion of loan and real estate assets in two 
recently closed transactions (with First Nationwide Bank for the 
problem assets of Columbia Savings and with Brazos Asset Management 
for the problem assets of New West/American Savings). These Asset 
Management and Disposition (AMD) Partnerships were structured 
essentially as 80/20 limited partnerships in which the private 
partner holds a 20 percent interest in net proceeds and has full 
management control of all business decisionmaking as General Partner. 
The government is a Limited Partner with an 80 percent interest. The 
government has sufficient oversight authority to protect its 
interest, but cannot interfere in day-to-day business decisionmaking. 
The AMD partnership agreement is carefully constructed to ensure that 
the private General Partner has its financial interests aligned with 
the government Limited Partner and will maximize its financial return 
only by maximizing the return to the government.
<p>
An AMD partnership would not be a good vehicle for helping homeowners 
work through temporary financial difficulties to meet their mortgage 
obligations. That kind of task can be contracted out to nonprofit 
organizations (or other contractors) using temporary financial 
assistance to help with mortgage payments (at no more cost than the 
comparable deferral of mortgage payments now taking place). The State 
of Pennsylvania has successfully done so with nonprofit organizations 
such as ACTION Housing in Pittsburgh.
<p>
The HUD assignment and forbearance program has as its primary purpose 
the provision of assistance to homeowner borrowers. It is reasonably 
expected that the program will have some cost. In some circumstances, 
especially when a loan has just become delinquent, it may actually be 
a money saver, rather than a cost, for the loan insurer to provide 
some temporary mortgage assistance rather than to pay a mortgage 
claim and then collect on the delinquent loan. Some private mortgage 
insurers use such early intervention with homeowners developing 
financial problems in a conscious business effort of loss mitigation. 
HUD has no such program.
<p>
The single-family loans in question are primarily insured under the 
FHA Mutual Insurance Fund, which is structured to be actuarially 
sound--that is, self-funded without requiring appropriations. Even 
though appropriations are not required, managers of the fund in HUD 
are not freely permitted to make any and all businesslike 
expenditures, even when they determine such expenditures to be cost-
effective. For example, HUD would require authority to make temporary 
mortgage payments for FHA-insured borrowers.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should be authorized to use the Mutual Insurance Fund for any 
cost-effective expenditure needed to maximize the value of the fund, 
including all expenditures recommended through the actions below.
<p>

2. HUD should undertake programs designed to mitigate losses.
<p>
In order to mitigate losses and prevent unnecessary foreclosure, HUD 
should continue to implement programs such as their Nationwide Pre-
foreclosure Sales Program. In addition, HUD should continue to take 
action that will both encourage flexibility in the execution of 
forbearance agreements and encourage deeds in lieu.
<p>

3. HUD should contract out loan servicing for the single-family loans 
for which it accepts assignment.
<p>
Loan servicing is a common business function that is not an 
appropriate task to be performed in-house by a government agency.
<p>

4. HUD should dispose of assigned single-family mortgages.
<p>
HUD should continue to sell assigned mortgages along the line of the 
recently concluded sale of over 15,000 assigned mortgages in five 
pools, and the sale of ten land development mortgage loans. The 
Department should also bid out 20 percent General Partnership 
interests in four to six AMD limited partnerships for managing and 
disposing of pools of assigned loans. HUD should undertake the 
necessary rule making and obtain the services of a financial advisor 
so that a program of periodic loan sales can be undertaken.
<p>

5. HUD should contract with qualified nonprofit or other 
organizations to administer a financial assistance program for 
temporary help with mortgage payments for HUD-held mortgages and for 
such mortgages that have been transferred to the above-described AMD 
partnerships.
<p>
Contractors will work with borrowers to help them keep their homes to 
the extent feasible and within the funding limits provided. 
Contractors will have access to the standardized AMD partnership 
databases and receive appropriate notices from the AMD partnerships 
so that resources can be efficiently applied. Assistance payment 
limits and criteria should be for a more limited period than three 
years and be statutorily authorized (explicitly replacing the consent 
decrees now limiting HUD).
<p>

<b>Implications</B>
<p>
By dividing the two very different tasks (helping financially 
strapped homeowners and maximizing financial return on problem 
assets) between two different types of public-private structures, HUD 
can:
<p>
--- maximize financial return from assets, thus protecting taxpayers 
and making resources available for housing;
<p>
--- provide efficient, structured assistance to temporarily strapped 
homeowners with appropriate Congressional authorization and fund 
control;
<p>
--- take care of a massive workload problem without increasing HUD 
staff; and
<p>
--- streamline HUD operations in a difficult, staff-intensive area, 
which should facilitate consolidation of functions and offices and 
thus produce long-term administrative savings.
<p>
<b>Fiscal Impact</B>
<p>
An efficient Loss Mitigation Program developed experimentally using 
statistically valid samples of HUD's massive portfolio will reduce 
costs overall and greatly reduce the number of loans requiring FHA 
payoff under its insurance obligations.
<p>
The FHA funds in which these expenditures and savings or losses take 
place at present are self-funded and do not show explicitly in the 
federal budget. Savings to the FHA funds which should occur from the 
above management reforms will be substantial compared with the 
present situation, which is inherently wasteful.

<P>
<h2>HUD04:  Create an Assisted Housing/Rent Subsidy Demonstration Project</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
The private owners of apartment projects constructed under the 
Section 8 New Construction and the Substantial and Moderate 
Rehabilitation programs have high rental income from HUD payments 
under their Section 8 assistance contracts. The above-market rents 
were part of the HUD program design. Some of those long-term 
contracts are now reaching the end of their terms with many more 
ending over the next decade. When those contracts end, the only funds 
available to make mortgage payments will be from rental at market 
rents (unless Congress appropriates more funds to continue above-
market rent payments from HUD).
<p>
Many of these projects have FHA-insured mortgages in amounts 
significantly greater than the amount that could be justified by the 
inherent value of the real estate collateral. When the Section 8 rent 
assistance ends, HUD may face default on FHA mortgages. On the other 
hand, continuing Section 8 rent payments in excess of market values 
of apartments would only benefit project owners and private holders 
of FHA-insured mortgages (which may be at rates much higher than 
current mortgage rates and are, almost certainly, at rates higher 
than government borrowing rates).
<p>
The problem for HUD is made more complex by the negative tax 
consequences of mortgage forgiveness through negotiation or 
foreclosure for limited partner project owners. Such forgiveness of 
debt may be treated as income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
That may tend to make owners more inclined to lobby actively for 
continued subsidy support and/or to litigate foreclosure.
<p>
Many privately owned Section 8 assisted-housing projects have 
management problems similar to public housing. Tenant preference 
policies intending to concentrate scarce assistance resources to the 
most needy have resulted in concentrating the most needy into 
assisted-housing projects. The result is a lack of positive role 
models for youth and increased stigmatizing and resentment of project 
living. The very benefit intended for tenants is diluted by the 
reduced value and comfort of the housing development.
<p>
These tenants in HUD-assisted projects cannot achieve the position of 
a market-rate tenant (or Section 8 certificate or voucher-assisted 
tenant) who is a paying customer with the empowerment residing in 
that status. While the tenant in an assisted project can complain 
about deteriorating conditions, he or she cannot effectively "vote 
with the feet'' until the residence is so bad that its market value 
is lower than the assisted tenant's monthly payment. At that point, 
comparable bad housing is available at the same cost in the private, 
unassisted market.
<p>
This lack of leverage by the tenant in a HUD-assisted project creates 
a cushion for even well-intentioned property managers, permitting 
them to avoid many hard decisions, such as firing less-than-
satisfactory maintenance staff or evicting disruptive tenants. 
Arguably, this is a key ingredient leading to the deteriorated state 
of much of the stock of public housing and assisted privately owned 
housing.
<p>
Some of the problems of HUD-assisted housing may be improved by 
shifting to market rents and providing tenants portable subsidies. 
The empowered tenants, who can move with the subsidy, will bring a 
market discipline to property managers, who will have to serve the 
paying customers. This will improve the efficiency and responsiveness 
of management, give more options to tenants, and, if some tenants do 
move out and are replaced by market-rate tenants, the stigma and 
negative effects of the low-income housing project will be 
ameliorated.
<p>
The needs of assisted tenants and the future problems of over-
mortgaged projects are such that reasonable and flexible 
experimentation on a voluntary and negotiated basis would seem 
appropriate. This may produce some alternatives that could improve 
conditions for some tenants and be consistent with long-term goals of 
preserving the affordable housing stock. Indications are that some 
property owners would like to stabilize their projects by moving to 
market-rate rental with portable subsidies for the needy if the 
projects are viable and the interests of partners are respected.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. On a demonstration basis, HUD should be authorized to conduct 
negotiated restructuring of assisted-housing projects.
<p>
HUD should have flexibility in negotiating the restructured projects, 
but each should be consistent with the following goals:
<p>
--- long-term opportunities for affordable housing should be 
preserved;
<p>
--- present and future tenants assisted by the project should have 
improved living conditions and have the ability to move with the 
value of their housing assistance;
<p>
--- HUD costs should be reduced, or at least not increased; and
<p>
--- the rights and legitimate interests of property owners and 
participants in HUD programs should be respected.
<p>

2. Demonstrations should include allowing project rents to float to 
market rates with tenants receiving their assistance in a portable 
format (like portable Section 8 certificates) to make up the 
difference between tenant contribution and the market rent.
<p>
A tenant will be permitted to take the value of the portable 
assistance and use it in any other unit of his or her choice. Funding 
of the portable assistance will come from conversion of some of the 
project-based Section 8 payments presently obligated to the project.
<p>
For the renegotiated project to be viable at market rents, the 
outstanding mortgage will have to be written down (reduced) to an 
amount supportable by the net operating income of the project. The 
written-down mortgages will be paid off and/or refinanced by HUD if 
to do so would be in the financial interest of the government, or HUD 
could continue to make an incremental payment on the outstanding 
mortgage with part of the continuing Section 8 project-based funds.
<p>
If an assisted tenant should leave a project with his or her portable 
assistance, the owner would be free to rent to an unsubsidized tenant 
at market rent. That would result in no income increase to the owner 
or diminution of the number of assisted tenants. The one assisted 
tenant who moved would simply be living in a different apartment 
because of personal preference.
<p>

3. If, over time, the market value and/or net operating income of the 
project improves because of better management or because of a better 
environment through improved income mix, the owner and manager should 
receive some of the benefit.
<p>
Most of the benefit, however, should flow to HUD to finance higher 
portable assistance payments for tenants living in the project and 
more portable assistance for tenants living out of the project.
<p>

4. Each demonstration should be structured so that HUD payments for 
the project, the obligations of the owner, and assistance to tenants 
would continue for at least as long as under contracts outstanding at 
the start of the demonstration.
<p>
Section 8 costs would not be permitted to exceed those that would 
otherwise have occurred without the demonstration. Also, no 
additional benefits would flow to the project owner unless 
accompanied by additional benefits to assisted tenants. Funding for 
assistance after current contract periods end would be available on 
the same basis (under the new arrangement) as for other expiring 
Section 8 projects.
<p>

5. HUD should work with IRS to explore ways to deal with competing 
public objectives of the tax code and housing programs.
<p>
For example, donation of a project to a nonprofit with mortgage 
write-down thereafter might meet the needs of project owners to avoid 
negative tax benefit recapture problems while still meeting public 
interests in tax collection and provision of low-income housing.
<p>

6. These demonstrations should be real experiments in modified 
approaches to assisted housing.
<p>
There should be a substantial research element structured to track 
tenant satisfaction, operating costs, neighborhood impact, project 
and HUD image in the community, and overall cost/benefit of HUD 
expenditures. The demonstration should be large enough to be 
statistically valid and should have comparable control units for 
comparison. Assisted housing is a major public activity and 
expenditure, and an important purpose of this demonstration would be 
to advance the state of the art.
<p>

7. HUD should seek legislation to shift multifamily projects from 
above market to market rents while protecting the existing tenants.
<p>
The legislation should enable HUD to restructure the debt at the time 
of contract renewal whenever possible and fiscally preferable. The 
renewals under the current rent formula should only be permitted if 
those rents are no greater or only slightly above the actual market 
rents. All other contracts should be renewed with the rents being 
changed to a budget-based formula with sufficient revenue to operate, 
probably with a restructured debt.
<p>
HUD should have the authority to reuse any Section 8 units that are 
not renewed and to convert some of these units to tenant-based 
subsides. HUD should also be able to use recaptured authority from 
current contracts for either project-based or tenant-based subsidies, 
as appropriate. 
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
For the project owner, mortgage financing would be established at a 
supportable level without the uncertainty of potential foreclosure 
resulting from HUD failure to continue subsidies. HUD would be freed 
of the obligation to either maintain subsidy payments at high rent 
levels to the project owner or face a mortgage default. HUD would be 
able to continue subsidies on a market-rent, portable-subsidy basis, 
which is clearly better for the tenant and would result in a better 
tenant income mix, improve the value of the property for the long 
run, and ease management problems and costs.
<p>
The most important beneficiaries would be the assisted tenants. They 
would be empowered to deal with property management as would any 
equivalent market-rate tenant. As tenant income mix improved 
conditions in the development, assisted tenants would have an 
improved environment and lose much of the housing project stigma as 
they became indistinguishable from unassisted tenants in the same 
development.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The demonstration activities should have no net fiscal impact. The 
full amount of Section 8 assistance funds that would otherwise have 
been spent under present contracts should be expended for tenant 
assistance. The benefit to tenants and neighborhoods, and thus the 
return on the taxpayers' expenditure, should be substantially 
improved.
<p>
Although HUD will have to pay off and write down insured mortgages to 
make outstanding mortgages reflect market values, that would merely 
recognize insurance fund losses already incurred. A loan that is 
viable only because HUD is making above-market rent subsidy payments 
is already a partial loss to HUD. In addition, if the interest rate 
on the loan is higher than the government borrowing rate, it may be a 
cost saving to recognize the loss and refinance the loan, paying off 
the amount not being amortized by the market income of the property.

<h2>HUD05:  Establish a New Housing Production Program</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
From the 1930s through the 1970s, the federal government was a major 
force in stimulating the production of single- and multi-family 
housing through a variety of means. These include direct financing, 
loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies, mortgage insurance, 
development of secondary markets, and tenant subsidies and favorable 
tax treatment. However, over the last 12 years, the federal role in 
housing production has been reduced, leaving a number of specific 
housing needs unmet.
<p>
For example, many renters find affordable housing difficult to come 
by and must devote a high proportion of their income to housing 
costs. Private sector, multi-family housing production in the last 
decade was concentrated at the high end of the market. Although that 
market has softened, rents in newer projects remain out of reach of 
most renters. Thus, while multi-family vacancy rates are high in some 
areas and in some markets, affordable rental housing remains very 
scarce, especially in gateway cities with large low- and moderate-
income populations.
<p>
Similarly, in the last 12 years, home ownership rates for younger 
households (age 25 to 39) declined sharply. While lower interest 
rates increase affordability, down payment and closing cost 
accumulation remains difficult with income growth lagging and rents 
high as a proportion of income.
<p>
Notwithstanding these needs, HUD has retreated from a significant 
role in housing production over the past 12 years. On the multi-
family side, a HUD privatization initiative of the early 1980s--
coinsurance--left the agency with billions of dollars in losses and 
made it wary of multi-family production programs. Coinsurance was 
designed to speed processing of multi-family mortgage insurance 
applications. Under coinsurance, the private lender was delegated 
most of HUD's underwriting functions in exchange for assuming a 
portion of the insurance risk. However, the program did not give the 
lender adequate incentives to minimize risk; instead, the program 
encouraged lenders to use inflated appraisals and underwrite more 
projects to generate fees. By the time HUD shut down the program in 
1990, the department estimated that its losses would be in the 
billions of dollars. Other multi-family insurance programs remained 
on the books, but, whether by design or mismanagement, processing of 
insurance applications slowed to a trickle.
<p>
In the current budgetary environment, FHA will never have the 
resources it needs to underwrite significant amounts of insurance and 
oversee its portfolio of insurance-in-force on a loan-by-loan basis. 
It will have to rely on third-party delivery systems to be effective. 
In fact, such partnerships may provide opportunities for innovation. 
However, as HUD learned from the coinsurance debacle, third-party 
delivery systems must be carefully designed so that the agency can 
effectively monitor the program and its partners have an incentive to 
minimize the government's risk.
<p>
Congress had these concerns in mind when it enacted Section 542 of 
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which authorized 
HUD to conduct risk-sharing demonstrations with state and local 
housing finance agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) 
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. These 
entities offer safer partners with which to experiment because--
unlike private lenders--as governmental or quasi-governmental 
entities, they are unlikely to disappear, leaving HUD liable. These 
demonstrations must be a high priority for HUD to help it define a 
new role for itself in multi-family housing production.
<p>
HUD also has failed to encourage the movement of capital into multi-
family production. In fact, very limited funds are available from 
investors for multi-family housing. In the single-family area, HUD 
has encouraged standardization of mortgage products and borne the 
risk while gaining experience from which the private sector could 
learn to underwrite similar risks. Thus, an efficient secondary 
market in single-family mortgages and mortgage-backed securities has 
been developed, but no comparable market in multi-family mortgages 
exists yet.
<p>
On the single-family production side, recent legislative and policy 
decisions may have had the effect of reducing FHA's share of single-
family loan origination. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund is 
the self-sustaining mutual fund that provides basic FHA single-family 
mortgage insurance. In 1990, actuarial studies suggested that the 
business written each year during the early 1980s was unsound and was 
rapidly depleting the surplus that the fund had built up during the 
1970s. 
<p>
In response, the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 
1990 legislated a number of reforms, including a risk-based premium 
structure and increased down payment requirements. These changes 
reduced the affordability of FHA insurance to those most in need of 
credit enhancement and, at the same time, made FHA insurance less 
competitive with private mortgage insurance, driving stronger 
borrowers and those refinancing to other products. This may have 
contributed to a significant drop in FHA's market share from 13 
percent in 1990 to 5.6 percent in 1992 (based on the dollar volume of 
business including refinancing).
<p>
As HUD reduced its role in housing production, state and local 
governments and the nonprofit sector have tried to fill the gap, 
creating innovative programs to develop housing and revitalize 
neighborhoods. While there may never again be federal funds on a 
massive scale, federal investment can be the catalyst for significant 
change when various forces are targeted at one area. Such a 
coordinated effort should be driven by the initiative and creativity 
of local partners familiar with local conditions. The FHA has not 
played this catalyst role effectively in the past, but it has the 
capacity to provide housing credit, a key component in economic 
revitalization of declining neighborhoods.
<p>
There is, therefore, an important role for HUD to play in housing 
production; however, HUD does not have all the tools it needs to play 
that role. Getting back in business in today's rapidly changing and 
complex marketplace will require yet greater financial and management 
sophistication. The reliance on third-party delivery systems implicit 
in each of these production initiatives only increases the importance 
of having sophisticated tools to manage risk. The FHA is one of the 
nation's largest financial institutions and its activities affect 
crucial segments of our economy, yet it lacks the financial and 
management systems and skills of its private sector counterparts. The 
HUD Inspector General has warned repeatedly that FHA lacks automated 
systems and internal controls sufficient to oversee its financial 
assets. Federal regulators would never permit a private sector 
financial institution to operate as the FHA has operated. Federal 
resource constraints have prevented the Federal Housing Commissioner 
from making all of the investments in automation, systems, and skills 
that could produce significant savings.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should stimulate multi-family housing development through 
risk-sharing with housing finance agencies. 
<p>
FHA should implement the risk-sharing demonstrations with housing 
finance agencies and GSEs authorized by Congress last year and use 
these programs as models for developing other third-party delivery 
systems with sufficient controls and incentives to protect the 
government's interests.
<p>

2. HUD should stimulate multi-family housing production by helping to 
develop a secondary market for loans on multi-family properties.
<p>
FHA, working with the GSEs and the private capital markets, should 
develop further the secondary market in multi-family mortgages and 
mortgage-backed securities. This effort will require providing the 
private sector with more information so that it can analyze products, 
working with the GSEs and the private sector to determine where FHA 
credit enhancement will have the greatest impact in expanding access 
to credit, and working to standardize investment terms and 
documentation. FHA might also consider moving from insuring 
individual loans to insuring pools of risk. FHA will need to use the 
expertise of the private sector in building the tools and models to 
underwrite this type of risk.
<p>

3. Legislation should be enacted to authorize FHA to improve access 
to capital and assist moderate-income, first-time home buyers in 
high-cost areas.
<p>
Police, fire-fighters, teachers, and other moderate-income workers 
would benefit from legislation increasing the FHA insurance loan 
limits. In addition, Congress should authorize a single-family risk-
sharing initiative like the multi-family risk-sharing demonstrations 
authorized last year. On the single-family side, FHA and state and 
local governments could help moderate-income buyers in high-cost 
areas by sharing the insurance risk on loans up to the conforming 
loan limit set by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) 
and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association (FHLMC) (about 
$203,000). For example, FHA could insure a loan of up to the FHA loan 
limit and the state or local agency would insure the remainder of the 
loan amount.
<p>

4. Legislation should be enacted to authorize FHA to work in 
partnership with local governments and nonprofits striving to 
revitalize decaying neighborhoods by making special terms available 
for FHA-insured mortgages in those areas. 
<p>
Specifically, FHA should make a no-down-payment option available for 
loans targeted to first-time home buyers with incomes below 115 
percent of median family income. This should be available in 
communities where coordinated affordable housing programs are being 
carried out, state or local agencies are targeting programs, 
nonprofit and community development corporations are making 
investments, or private lenders are doing community reinvestment 
activities. Under such a program, the insured loan amount could equal 
100 percent of the value of the property; closing costs could be 
provided through other government, nonprofit, or seller 
contributions; and front-end mortgage insurance premiums could be 
deferred until sale.
<p>
Certain controls would be necessary to protect the government's 
interest while the impact of the program is assessed. For instance, 
the total number of loans insured under the program should be 
limited; prepurchase counseling should be required; and the mortgage 
amount should be capped at the lesser of $75,000 (or 75 percent of 
the FHA mortgage limit if that is greater) or 100 percent of the 
property value. Such a program would permit FHA to develop experience 
working with various kinds of partners in revitalization areas. This 
will help the FHA to determine how federal credit enhancement can 
best be leveraged with other local programs to help turn around 
decaying neighborhoods and help those with the greatest need.
<p>

5. HUD should make cost-effective investments in professional 
financial  management. 
<p>
HUD should be given the resources to make cost-effective investments 
to improve FHA's automated systems and internal controls, develop the 
financial and technical skills of FHA employees and attract private 
sector expertise, and take advantage of new workplace technologies.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Housing Finance Agency (HFA) multi-family risk-sharing will reduce 
the labor-intensive underwriting and project monitoring demands on 
FHA staff and is a cost-effective way of dealing with severe resource 
shortages. Effectively, HUD staff resources used to focus on program 
development and control will be leveraged with the capacity of the 
HFAs, and the result will be a greater capacity to stimulate 
production. At the same time, by building solid relationships with 
state and local HFAs--laboratories for innovative financing--risk-
sharing could be the first step to developing other creative 
partnerships targeted to meet the needs of individual states or 
communities.
<p>
Development of a secondary market in multi-family mortgages that will 
bring more capital into multi-family lending is critical to the 
future of rental housing production. Developing an actuarially sound 
insurance product for risk pools would be an important step in the 
evolution of FHA from a retailer to a wholesaler and would represent 
a more efficient use of government resources. At the same time, by 
working with the private sector to develop the necessary models and 
expertise and share databases, FHA would develop relationships with 
new parts of the industry that could produce other innovative ideas 
to meet market needs.
<p>
Raising the single-family loan limits would provide the benefits of 
FHA-insured mortgages to a wider income-range of first-time home 
buyers and to those in areas with high housing costs who are 
struggling to make home ownership affordable. The no-down-payment 
program can serve as a laboratory in which FHA develops relationships 
and learns how successful local revitalization partnerships can work. 
At the same time, the credit opportunities that the FHA could bring 
to declining neighborhoods could leverage additional investments and 
be the catalyst for coordinated revitalization efforts.
<p>
Cost-effective investments in expertise, systems, and technology are 
necessary to transform FHA into a modern financial institution with a 
social purpose and the business tools to get the job done.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
A multi-family risk-sharing demonstration program could be 
administered within the current budget for the FHA credit subsidy 
programs. Expansion of the program could require additional resources 
to be determined after there is some experience with the program.
<p>
Development of a secondary market in multi-family mortgages could 
assist in HUD's sale of some of its own multi-family note inventory 
to the financial markets. Developing these innovative products would 
take staff resources, but over time these efforts would reduce HUD 
note-servicing workloads, freeing staff to more effectively monitor 
its loan portfolio and prevent loss.
<p>
The MMI fund (single-family loans) is actuarially sound. Increasing 
the loan limits may have a positive impact on the fund's balance 
sheet. The no-down-payment program may or may not entail additional 
credit subsidy requirements in the future, but whether there will be 
a need and its extent if any can only be ascertained after some 
experience with the program.
<p>
Investments in systems, technology, and skills are the sort of steps 
that private sector organizations make to improve the productivity of 
their operations and ultimately will produce a more cost-effective 
product. These steps would require additional appropriations in the 
short-term.
<p>
Since its creation during the Depression, the FHA has served not only 
to strengthen the nation's housing stock, but also to spur employment 
in the crucial construction sector. Thus, each of the production 
initiatives has the additional benefit of stimulating economic 
growth, which would produce tax revenues. These fiscal gains cannot 
be accurately predicted.

<h2>HUD06:  Streamline HUD Field Operations</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) organizational 
structure has been widely criticized by the General Accounting Office 
(GAO), the HUD Inspector General, and its customers for 
fragmentation, lack of accountability, and overlapping authority 
among headquarters, the 10 regions, and the 70 field offices.
<p>
Five assistant secretaries at headquarters in charge of policy and 
program development rely on 10 substantially independent regional 
offices to implement their programs. The 10 regional offices, which 
report directly to the secretary, create confused administration and 
promote a lack of coordination and accountability. The expansion from 
six to 10 regional offices occurred to comply with a directive from 
then-President Nixon for all federal agencies to standardize at a 10-
region field organization.
<p>
Currently, workload among the offices varies widely. For example, the 
New York regional office monitors 238,000 units of federal public 
housing while the Seattle regional office monitors 30,000 units of 
public housing.1
<p>
Approximately 10,000 of HUD's 13,500 employees are in the field. With 
the advanced degree of automation in recent years and the delegation 
of many application processing and loan monitoring activities to 
private vendors, there is a very real opportunity for HUD to 
streamline its field office structure. The emergence of state 
governments as important partners in the government's effort to 
provide affordable housing and the potential use of public-private 
partnerships for large-scale asset disposition contribute to this 
modernization trend.
<p>
An ideal field structure would match workforce with workload and 
delegate work to states and private vendors or public-private 
partnerships where possible and economical. It would also delegate 
authority to the lowest feasible level and centralize and automate 
back-office functions such as loan monitoring and dormant program 
supervision wherever possible. The structure should be responsive to 
the assistant secretaries who are accountable for operating programs. 
The structure should be flexible so that different HUD functions can 
be managed in the most economical mode for each function. HUD is not 
alone among federal agencies in having an oversized and outdated 
field structure. 
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should participate in the multiple agency field office 
restructuring effort. 
<p>
In that context, HUD should develop a five-year action plan to 
eliminate duplicative and burdensome layers of review and consolidate 
and streamline various departmental functions. The current level of 
review at the regional offices should be shifted to the field 
offices. Regional offices should continue to provide certain 
necessary functions such as coordination between the field offices 
and headquarters. However, most functions and staff should be shifted 
to the field offices.
<p>

2. Program field staff should report more directly to responsible 
program assistant secretaries. 
<p>
Each office should have a director whose function would be to 
represent the department, oversee secretarial priorities, and 
administer the office. Each assistant secretary should be free to 
organize his or her field functions efficiently, with emphasis on 
consolidation of functions to the extent feasible. For example, the 
Assistant Secretary for Housing may find it necessary to have some 
functions widely dispersed across the nation, but to have another 
function--say, multi-family property disposition--managed out of only 
three offices for the whole country.
<p>

3. HUD should accelerate the privatization of single-family insurance 
application processing and asset management and centralize lender 
monitoring. 
<p>
This would, possibly, eliminate the need for up to 29 of the smaller 
offices.
<p>

4. HUD should continue to delegate specific grant award 
decisionmaking to the states and localities, as is the case with the 
Community Development Block Grant Program and the new HOME Investment 
Partnerships program.
<p>
Responsibility for dormant programs such as the Urban Development 
Action Program (UDAG) and 236 subsidy programs should be centralized 
under the appropriate assistant secretary's office in Washington, 
D.C.
<p>

5. No one should be laid off as a result of this office 
consolidation. A full attrition program should apply in the field 
until an appropriate level of staffing is achieved.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
HUD's field structure will be greatly simplified. Personnel and 
overhead savings will be achieved as the agency moves from a three-
tiered, 80-office structure to a two-level structure with a smaller 
number of offices, staffed on a differential basis dictated by 
workload.
<p>
HUD, its constituents, its customers, and the general public will 
benefit from these changes, as the cost of doing HUD business will 
decrease, the appropriate levels of staff skills will be established 
for field office functions, and accountability of program assistant 
secretaries will be maximized. HUD employee assignments will become 
more interesting and the development of career ladders will be 
facilitated. Money will be saved as the number of field offices and 
field personnel decline through attrition.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
Budget estimates are based on a 15 percent total reduction in the 
current field staff of more than 10,000 to a 1999 level of 8,500. 
Average 1993 total full-time equivalent (FTE) cost is estimated at 
$50,000, with a compounded annual four percent rate of increase. 
Budget authority reductions are computed at $35,000 per FTE 
compounded at four percent.
<p>
These are budget estimates based on assumed attrition. HUD will 
require flexibility in introducing the field restructuring. HUD has a 
growing workload, is severely underautomated and has already been 
reduced by 4,500 FTEs during the last 12 years.

<h2>HUD07:  Refinance Section 235 Mortgages</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
Under the Section 235 Program, qualified homeowners have their 
monthly mortgage payments reduced by the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). HUD makes a monthly interest reduction 
payment to the lender on behalf of the homeowner. That lowers the 
homeowner's effective interest rate and, thus, monthly payment. The 
effective interest rate for the homeowner is set based on the income 
of the homeowner. Obviously, the higher the interest rate being 
charged by the lender, the greater HUD's interest reduction payment 
to lower the effective rate. Many of the home mortgages covered by 
this program were taken out during the high-interest periods of the 
late 1970s and often have interest rates in double digits, with some 
as high as 18 percent.
<p>
It would clearly be in HUD's financial interest to replace the high-
interest loans by refinancing with new lower-interest loans. That 
would reduce the HUD interest reduction payment. For example, if a 
homeowner has a $50,000 loan for 25 years on which payments are made 
as though the loan was at 5 percent interest, the homeowner's 
payments would be $292.30 per month. If the loan was actually made at 
a 14 percent interest rate, the lender will require a monthly payment 
of $601.88. The difference of $309.58 must be made up with the HUD 
interest reduction payment. If that loan were replaced by a loan at 8 
percent interest, the payment to the lender would be $385.91 and the 
HUD interest reduction payment would be $93.61, a reduction of 
$215.97, or 70 percent. The longer HUD waits to refinance, the 
smaller will be the savings.
<p>
Arranging refinancing is a time-consuming process. A new lender must 
be found, forms filled out, the property appraised, repairs made if 
required by the lender, and the title checked and cleared if 
additional liens have arisen. The homeowner has little or no 
incentive to refinance because refinancing does not change the 
effective payment for the homeowner. The lender collecting the high 
interest certainly has no desire to refinance. HUD, however, is 
losing large amounts of money by making large interest reduction 
payments on high-interest rate loans compared to replacing the loans 
with current, lower-interest rate loans.
<p>
HUD has a severe shortage of staff for its workload, and the steps 
needed to refinance these small transactions (if not done by the 
homeowner) are staff intensive compared with many other high-dollar 
problems which HUD must also address. HUD has thus found it difficult 
over the years to accomplish very much of the refinancing needed. The 
function seems ideally suited for an incentive contract in which the 
return to the contractor would be based on a percentage of the 
calculated savings to be achieved by HUD from refinancing, after 
subtracting out all of the costs of refinancing to HUD. The 
contractor would have sufficient incentive to undertake all the
<p>
needed steps: finding a new lender, getting the forms filled out, 
arranging appraisals and repairs and getting the homeowner to sign 
the documents. The homeowner will need to be given enough financial 
incentive to provide information and execute documents.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should be given flexibility to induce profitable refinancing 
of Section 235 Program loans by paying whatever contract costs and 
incentive payments to Section 235 borrowers may be cost-effective.
<p>
For example, it might be productive to let a contract in which the 
contractor shares in a percentage of the net benefit to HUD. The 
contractor might find it advisable to pay one borrower a large 
incentive fee to cooperate while another loan (with a smaller net 
return expected) might only justify a very small incentive payment to 
the borrower. All such payments should be allowed.
<p>

2. HUD should issue one or more incentive contracts to private 
companies. 
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
This flexible incentive contracting approach will make effective use 
of the private sector to rid HUD of a long continuing embarrassment 
and reduce avoidable costs to the taxpayers by taking advantage of 
current favorable interest rates.
<p>

Fiscal Impact
<p>
Annual savings are derived from estimating the total annual subsidies 
provided on currently outstanding loans that have mortgage rates 
above 10 percent and an average of 10 years remaining. Future costs 
were also projected on an annual basis assuming those loans are 
refinanced at an interest rate of 8 percent. The difference between 
the projections at current rates and the projections at the 8 percent 
refinanced rate is the projected savings. The total potential savings 
are reduced to reflect a 30 percent commission to the private sector 
company(ies) conducting the refinancing program, some of which would 
be provided to owners as a refinancing incentive.

<h2>HUD08:  Reduce Section 8 Contract Rent Payments</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<P>
Under the Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation and New Construction 
Programs, HUD enters into annual rental contracts with multi-family 
housing owners. The program also provides that owners of assisted 
housing can receive annual rent adjustments (increases) to keep pace 
with inflation. Initially, these increases were automatic, based on 
HUD's annual housing costs surveys, consumer price index data and 
other factors. Specifically, Section 8 (c)(2) of the National Housing 
Act amended provides that:
<p>
(1) The assistance contract shall provide for adjustment annually or 
more frequently in the maximum monthly rents for units covered by the 
contract to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in 
the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or, if 
the Secretary determines, on the basis of a reasonable formula; and
<p>
(2) Adjustments in the maximum rents as provided shall not result in 
material differences between the rents charged for assisted and 
comparable unassisted rents, as determined by the Secretary.
<p>
Throughout the 1980s, HUD attempted to enforce this comparability 
provision by conducting surveys of rents for comparable non-assisted 
units to determine whether rents resulting from application of the 
Annual Adjustment Factor (AAF) satisfy the comparability provision. 
The statute prohibits HUD from using the results of a comparability 
study to reduce rents when it finds that comparable market rents for 
similar unassisted housing are below the AAF-adjusted levels. In such 
instances, HUD can only hold rents constant. The AAF generally 
provides owners with larger increases than might be attributable to 
their actual increases in costs, due to such factors as the fixed 
nature of debt service and other costs.
<p>
The comparability provisions have been challenged by several owners 
and, although some lower courts have been supportive of HUD's 
authority in this regard, appellate decisions have greatly 
complicated the issue. The Ninth Circuit Court, in Rainier View 
Associates v. HUD, upheld the plaintiffs in a case which challenged 
HUD's authority to base rent increase decisions on comparability 
studies. The plaintiffs claimed that HUD is not permitted to use any 
method other than rent increase factors based on a reasonable formula 
to adjust rents. The initial District Court decision said HUD could 
perform comparability studies but lacked uniform national 
instructions. The Ninth Circuit overruled the lower court.
<p>
Partly in response to this case, Congress passed Section 801 of the 
HUD Reform Act of 1989 which: (1) provides for partial retroactive 
payments and prospective contract rent determinations where 
comparability studies affected rent increases in the past, and (2) 
recognizes HUD's authority to base rent increases on comparability 
studies but requires the department to develop regulations for their 
future use. HUD imposed a moratorium on all comparability studies 
until regulations were published which, as of this date, has not been 
accomplished.
<p>
In April of this year, another court interpreted the comparability 
provision as reaching far beyond HUD's past practice. The U.S. Claims 
Court in Park Village Apartments v. The United States ruled that 
comparability studies must also be used to increase rents above the 
adjusted AAF rent following a request from an owner for a 
comparability study, and a finding that comparable rents are above 
the adjusted AAF rent.
<p>
In May of this year, the Supreme Court finally settled the issue of 
HUD's authority to use comparability studies in Alpine Ridge v. HUD. 
In that case, the Court ruled that HUD can use comparability studies 
to assist in determining Section 8 contract rent levels. However, the 
court also ruled that owners could still, on an individual basis, 
challenge the results of a HUD comparability study.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should be given legislative authority to discontinue its use 
of comparability studies to determine annual contract payments.
<p>

2. HUD should be given legislative authority to base its annual 
contract rental rate increases on actual increases in costs to the 
owners, not on the more broadly based housing costs index and 
comparability methods.
<p>

3. HUD should be given legislative authority to require owners to 
document and justify all operating costs, so that requested increases 
to cover certain costs, e.g., taxes and fuel, can be offset, if 
appropriate, against known reductions in other costs, such as debt 
service or maintenance.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
By using a budget/cost-based method that limits annual rent 
adjustments to narrower, justifiable increases in operating costs, 
rather than a broader housing costs index within metropolitan areas, 
future year costs will reflect smaller rates of increases. This will 
result in lower actual outlays than would have occurred under the 
Annual Adjustment Factor/Comparability methods.
<p>
The cost/budget-based method will also permit better use of staff 
resources. HUD staff will no longer be required to develop, publish, 
and implement the AAF programs. It will also eliminate the time 
required to conduct comparability studies, support findings, and 
process appeals and potential litigation. Staff needed to perform all 
of the foregoing activities would far outweigh the staff time needed 
to review budgeted rent increase requests, especially in light of the 
effort underway to automate the budget review process and have the 
owners submit their requests electronically.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The costs of implementing comparability studies under the various 
court opinions that permit owner requests and challenges to 
comparability methodology would, in all probability, exceed any 
savings. It is a potential legal and administrative morass that would 
drain substantial HUD budget and personnel resources during a period 
when HUD is already seeking to do more with less. Assuming that the 
index-based annual rent increases have averaged three percent in the 
past, a reduction of one-half of a percent would yield the following 
savings.

<h2>HUD09:  Consolidate Section 8 Housing Certificates and Vouchers</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<p>
HUD low-income housing activities are most identified with programs 
like public housing through which eligible families are housed in 
housing projects. The projects are either publicly owned--for 
example, public housing--or owned by private developers under 
contract with the government, such as projects built through the 
Section 8 New Construction Program. In the jargon of low-income 
housing, these are project-based low-income housing subsidy programs. 
HUD also manages tenant-based low-income housing programs. In these 
programs, the assisted tenant chooses an apartment in the private 
rental housing market, and a HUD-funded subsidy is paid directly to 
the private landlord to make up the difference between the tenant 
rent contribution and the actual rent of the apartment.
<p>
The two major HUD tenant-based subsidy programs, the Section 8 
Certificate Program and the Section 8 Voucher Program, are very 
similar in concept and operation. Both programs allocate assistance 
to local public housing authorities (PHAs), which provide rental 
assistance to tenants. Both programs use the same tenant eligibility 
and PHA waiting list. The program differences are primarily 
procedural. 
<p>
In addition to the general advisability of combining similar programs 
to simplify administration, there is at least one substantive 
difference requiring attention: the voucher program shopping 
incentive. The certificate program pays the difference between a 
required tenant contribution (calculated by HUD formula) and the 
actual rent charged, up to a maximum for the area (the Section 8 Fair 
Market Rent, or FMR). The tenant cannot use an apartment that rents 
above the FMR and the tenant has no savings if the actual rent is 
below the FMR.
<p>
The voucher program makes a similar calculation of what a tenant 
should be able to afford and uses the same rental data as the FMR to 
calculate a theoretical rent cost. The difference between these 
amounts is the subsidy payment made on behalf of the tenant. The 
tenant can choose an apartment with a rent higher than the FMR and 
make a higher tenant contribution. A tenant with a certificate is not 
permitted to rent an apartment with rent above the FMR, even if the 
tenant is willing to pay the additional cost. The voucher tenant also 
has an incentive to shop for an apartment with a lower rent because, 
subject to some limits, the tenant gets the full benefit of the rent 
reduction. The HUD assistance stays the same as for a higher-cost 
apartment. This reduction in the contribution of the tenant, below 
the level which the HUD formula determines to be affordable to the 
tenant, can be viewed as an excess payment by the government, which 
should be recaptured in whole or in part.
<p>

<b>Action</b>
<p>
The voucher and certificate programs should be combined into one 
program with one set of rules. 
<p>
The shopping incentive should be eliminated to provide a savings to 
taxpayers. Other differences between the two programs should be 
individually reviewed in light of the extensive experience to date to 
select the best features of each.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Data on the certificate and voucher programs show similar patterns of 
rental incidence below the maximum FMR despite the shopping incentive 
built into the voucher program. It is to be expected, therefore, that 
the pattern would continue for the combined programs and that tenants 
would not search out higher-rent apartments and thus reduce the 
savings expected for the taxpayer. If that does appear to happen, HUD 
should, in the future, experiment with shopping incentives with 
benefits shared between the tenants and taxpayer.
<p>
In addition to savings from abolishing the shopping incentive, 
administrative procedures and regulations could be combined, reducing 
some of the bureaucratic program overhead.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The merger of the two programs will generate up to $130 million in 
outlays savings over the 1995 to 1999 period. While not reducing the 
agency's budget or spending levels, these savings will enable PHAs to 
provide housing assistance to many additional eligible persons, 
without increasing agency expenditures.

<h2>HUD10:  Reduce Operating Subsidies for Vacancies</h2>
<P>
<b>Background</B>
<p>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides 
subsidies to public housing authorities (PHAs) and Indian housing 
authorities (IHAs) to assist in funding the operating and maintenance 
expenses of their owned buildings in accordance with Section 9 of the 
U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended. The program was created in the 
late 1960s to cover the difference between the actual costs of 
running projects and rent collections. Filling this gap was essential 
to help maintain services and provide minimum operating reserves.
<p>
Subsidies are provided under the Performance Funding System (PFS), a 
formula-based system that assists most PHAs as if they were operating 
at a 97 percent occupancy rate. It takes into consideration 
activities that may reduce the actual occupancy rate, such as 
disposition, demolition, conversion, and modernization.
<p>
The problem with the current system is that PHAs with high vacancy 
rates for extended periods of time, beyond what can be reasonably 
attributed to acceptable delays in occupancy, have little incentive 
to aggressively address their vacancy problems. They can maintain the 
status quo and still continue to get full operating subsidies, based 
on a 97 percent occupancy rate, although HUD does have the ability to 
make selected small adjustments based on individual cases. Failure to 
fill vacant units means that fewer eligible tenants are served and 
leads to a continuing cycle of unit deterioration. Too often, vacant 
units become safe havens for those involved in crime and drug abuse. 
The result is an increasingly dangerous and unhealthy environment for 
those poor residents and their children remaining in the project who 
have no other housing alternative.
<p>
At the end of fiscal year 1992, about 100,000 of the nation's 1.4 
million public housing units were vacant, a national vacancy rate of 
about 7 percent--i.e., an occupancy rate of 93 percent. HUD provided 
subsidies based on a PFS formula which is premised on a 97 percent 
ideal occupancy rate. Budget outlays in fiscal year 1993 for 
operating subsidies are expected to total $2.4 billion for the 1.4 
million PHA/IHA units under management, or about $1,800 per unit per 
year.(1)
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. HUD should establish an agency goal of achieving an average 97 
percent occupancy rate in units owned and managed by public and 
Indian housing authorities, by the end of fiscal year 1999.
<p>

2. HUD should reduce annual operating subsidies to PHAs and IHAs with 
consistently high vacancy rates possibly by reducing the per-unit 
subsidy for vacant units to 50 percent of the subsidy level for 
occupied units.
<p>

3. HUD should enter into contractual agreements with those PHAs 
receiving reduced subsidies, which should include proposed PHA action 
plans to reduce vacancy rates and measurable performance goals and 
milestones.
<p>

4. HUD should restructure its PFS formula to provide for increasing 
levels of operating subsidies tied to the achievement of occupancy 
level targets.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
Beginning in 1989, efforts were made to raise the acceptable full 
occupancy level to 98 percent and reduce operating subsidies for 
vacant units to only 20 percent of occupied unit levels. Congress 
expressly prohibited the implementation of these proposed 
regulations. However, the proposed actions contemplate only reducing 
subsidies possibly to one-half of the subsidy level for occupied 
units. This level recognizes that there are still costs associated 
with vacant units, such as normal maintenance, heating costs, 
security, and repair of vandalism damage. These reductions would be 
assessed on those PHAs that might be characterized as low-performing 
agencies that have not taken the aggressive action necessary to 
reduce vacancy rates.
<p>
By changing the subsidy depending on how successful PHAs are at 
raising their occupancy rates, this policy provides a financial 
incentive to encourage PHAs to take action to increase occupancy. The 
financial incentive to PHAs to get their house in order and lower 
their vacancy rates should increase the available stock of affordable 
housing, reduce the public housing waiting lists, and produce some 
reduction in the numbers of poor families currently living in 
shelters and other facilities for the homeless.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
In fiscal year 1993, HUD-projected outlays for operating subsidies 
totaled $2.4 billion. The national average occupancy rate for the 1.4 
million units of public housing was 93 percent. Assuming that the 93 
percent occupancy rate held through 1994, during which the design and 
implementation of the new subsidy reduction program could take place, 
reductions could commence at the beginning of fiscal year 1995. As 
PHAs with unacceptably high vacancy rates make progress, the overall 
occupancy rate is projected to increase each year, until it reaches 
97 percent in 1999. 
<p>
The projected six-year savings cannot be estimated at this time. 
Savings associated with a proposal similar to this were included in 
the President's budget request for fiscal 1994.

<h2>Agency Reinvention Activities
</h2>
<P>
<b>
Getting HUD in Order</B>
<p>
The reinvention efforts at HUD began almost as soon as Secretary 
Cisneros arrived. In response to reports prepared by the Inspector 
General, the General Accounting Office, and Price Waterhouse about 
serious gaps in basic management and financial systems, the Secretary 
created task forces to address three of the most prominent management 
deficiencies identified: data systems, internal controls, and 
resource management. These task forces are headed by the Deputy 
Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Assistant Secretary 
for Administration, respectively. The mission of these task forces is 
to ensure the necessary oversight, develop early warning systems, and 
restore confidence in HUD's accountability.
<p>
The Data Systems Task Force has already made progress in two areas. 
First, it has redirected the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification 
System to focus on developing Section 8 budget estimates and meeting 
program needs. Second, the task force is developing a new plan to 
have a departmentwide administrative accounting system in place by 
October 1, 1994. The Internal Controls Task Force has developed a 
plan to redesign the control structure by integrating HUD's control 
program with the department's program delivery, budget formulation, 
and execution processes.
<p>
Resource management efforts are focusing on short-term staffing needs 
as well as redesigning processes in the long-term. The Training Task 
Force is co-chaired by the Deputy Director of Personnel and the 
president of the local union. The Training Task Force recommended the 
following actions that are currently being implemented: (1) establish 
capabilities for distance learning, such as through satellite 
communications; (2) develop a pilot program making available the same 
learning to intermediaries; (3) establish a permanent infrastructure 
in the Office of Training to be connected to a HUD Academy; and (4) 
increase offerings of hard skills courses, either by HUD or outside 
groups.
<p>

<b>Grassroots Participation</b>
<p>
In addition to the work of these task forces on management issues, 
the Secretary developed five values to establish a mission statement 
for the department. These values define how HUD seeks to accomplish 
its mission:
<p>
--- a commitment to community,
<p>
--- a commitment to support families,
<p>
--- a commitment to economic lift,
<p>
--- a commitment to strengthen individual rights and 
responsibilities, and
<p>
--- a commitment to reduce spatial separation by race and income.
<p>
Rather than hire additional consultants to conduct further review of 
the department, the Secretary decided to seek input from the 
department's employees on these values, as well as how the agency 
could radically change the way it does business. In March 1993, 100 
employees, chosen from various offices and positions within the 
agency, met for the first of several work sessions. At the 
Secretary's request, some of the nation's top urban experts were also 
on hand to share their vision of a reinvented HUD.
<p>
On March 26, 1993, Vice President Gore attended a subsequent session 
to evaluate the department's mission, values, and culture, with a 
focus on redesigning the department to be more mission-oriented and 
customer-driven. The Vice President helped launch an energizing, 
bottom-up internal review of the department.
<p>
As the next step in that review, from April to May, teams of 
headquarters staff members held sessions at headquarters and traveled 
to regional and field offices to conduct agencywide discussions about 
how to improve HUD. All 13,000 employees were given the opportunity 
to participate in these sessions. Employees were enthusiastic 
participants and offered suggestions on topics ranging from 
consolidation of programs to a request for cross-training. Many 
employees remained past regular business hours to participate in 
these discussions and later submitted hundreds of written 
suggestions.
<p>
To obtain the input of constituent groups, similar sessions were held 
in selected locations throughout the country. These sessions provided 
a representative sample of the concerns and recommendations of those 
who work with the department and those served by the department. 
HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research undertook a 
departmentwide effort to identify statutory and regulatory barriers 
to the efficient and effective implementation of the department's 
programs. Following the internal effort to identify barriers, HUD 
also used a series of focus groups conducted by teleconference to 
gather input from constituent groups regarding statutes and 
regulations perceived to be an impediment to HUD's delivery of 
services.
<p>
Employees have expressed their appreciation for participating in the 
Reinventing HUD sessions, noting that their direct involvement has 
given them a chance to share their concerns and ideas as well as to 
learn more about the agency. The sessions with employees have already 
improved morale by giving them a voice and providing an opportunity 
to learn about other aspects of the department. The sessions with 
constituent groups have also given disparate groups an opportunity to 
interact with each other and allowed agency personnel to concentrate 
on ways in which they can all work toward common goals.
<p>
In response to employee requests for more information, the Office of 
Public Affairs has established a way to send a daily HUD message out 
to the entire agency. Sent via computers, fax machines, and hand 
delivery, The Focus is disseminated throughout the agency, to the 
press, and to community groups. The Focus gives a brief synopsis of 
key events and important issues of the day.
<p>

<b>Management Excellence Team and Policy Redesign Project</B>
<p>
In response to the National Performance Review and to analyze the 
volumes of recommendations provided by employees and constituents, 
the Secretary created two teams. The Management Excellence Team is 
reviewing issues related to the management infrastructure. This team 
reports to the Deputy Secretary and the Assistant Secretary for 
Administration. The Policy Redesign Project is reviewing the content 
of programs, possible simplification of regulations, and potential 
need for new legislation. This team reports to the Assistant 
Secretary for Policy Development and Research.
<p>
A total of 30 career civil servants are currently detailed to these 
teams on a full-time basis. The team members include managers, 
bargaining unit employees, and union representatives from field 
offices and headquarters.
<p>
Thousands of suggestions have been reviewed by the two teams. 
Catalogues of the recommendations that pertain to internal HUD issues 
have been prepared by the teams. The catalogues include suggestions 
about working conditions, labor/ management relations, and short- and 
long-term policy issues. After consultation with union officials, the 
overwhelming majority of these recommendations will be implemented 
shortly. Highlights include using forms of participatory 
decisionmaking, giving field offices more flexibility, and abolishing 
the sign-in/out system.
<p>

<b>Reinvention Labs</b>
<p>
Single-family Property Disposition.
The single-family Property Disposition Sales Initiative is testing a 
new approach to selling properties in economically distressed areas 
to nonprofits and local authorities. HUD-owned homes are being sold 
to these groups at a discount, which reflects savings to the 
department from expedited sales. The homes are rehabilitated by 
nonprofit groups and resold to low- and moderate-income families, 
many of whom are first-time buyers. The program started at the end of 
May and continued through August 13 and already has resulted in 
signed contracts for the sale of more than 170 homes from the 
agency's Richmond and Chicago inventories, surpassing its goal of 
selling 100 HUD-held houses. This initiative has accelerated property 
disposition, helped in the formation of special partnerships between 
the department and key community groups, and furthered the 
department's objectives of creating home ownership opportunities and 
rebuilding communities. The department plans to offer this new sales 
approach nationwide in fiscal year 1994 after publishing appropriate 
regulatory changes.
<p>

Reinventing Public and Indian Housing's Regional and Field Operation. 
This results-oriented lab in the Chicago Regional and Illinois field 
offices is designed to test and evaluate staff performance in 
servicing and monitoring housing authorities. The lab has already 
realigned staff roles to eliminate redundancy, improved oversight and 
technical assistance, and engaged in problem-solving partnerships 
with housing authorities, resident groups, and community and interest 
groups.
<p>

<b>Community-wide Affirmative Marketing Initiative. </b>
<p>
Cook County, Illinois, has been selected to test HUD's Community-wide 
Affirmative Marketing Initiative. This reinvention lab will put into 
practice HUD's value to end spatial segregation by race, income, and 
class. The lab seeks to create greater awareness by the lender, 
developer, real estate brokers, and other housing industry 
representatives of their responsibilities under various civil rights 
laws. For the first time, HUD will work with these groups to 
publicize and market affirmatively all fair housing assistance 
available in the community.
<p>

<b>D.C. Homeless Initiative.</b>
<p> 
The department has initiated a creative partnership with the District 
of Columbia government to develop a comprehensive strategic plan to 
deliver a continuum of care to end a person's homelessness. HUD will 
use the D.C. initiative as a laboratory to determine what policy 
tools and programs are most helpful to local governments in providing 
needed services to homeless persons. The initiative will bring 
together federal and local governments, the private sector, the 
foundation community, nonprofit groups, the homeless, and 
neighborhoods to review barriers in the establishment of homeless 
programs, participate in the development of the strategic plan, and 
play a role in its implementation. The continuum of care to be 
established will offer a full range of transitional and permanent 
housing options and supportive services to homeless individuals and 
families.
<p>

<b>Community Partnerships Against Crime.</b>
<p>
The public housing authorities in Richmond, Memphis, and New York 
City were selected to participate in HUD's Community Partnerships 
Against Crime lab. HUD is working with the housing authorities, other 
community organizations, and residents to develop creative strategies 
for the abatement of crime and drug activity. HUD has waived 
regulations and identified flexible methods to implement new 
strategies. This team concept leverages resources and provides 
services previously not available. This successful approach is being 
recorded by HUD and the local communities for use in a national 
videoconference to be held in December.
<p>

<b>Creating New Partnerships</b>
<p>
Over the past six months, HUD has begun to develop strong 
partnerships with such disparate groups as nonprofit organizations, 
the private sector, foundations, labor leaders, and others. Three 
partnerships stand out.
<p>
First, HUD received $100 million to support innovative partnerships 
with private pension funds for the construction and/or reconstruction 
of low-income housing. The funds will help HUD demonstrate a model 
for marrying federal assistance with pension fund financing. The AFL-
CIO Investment Trusts have expressed particular interest in this 
partnership.
<p>
Second, HUD is seeking $200 million to establish an Innovative 
Homeless Fund. The Fund will allow HUD to undertake comprehensive 
initiatives with cities that commit to addressing the full continuum 
of care from emergency shelter to permanent housing.
<p>
Third, HUD is requesting $25 million to invest in the National 
Community Development Initiative, a successful foundation-driven 
effort that supports capacity-building for community development 
corporations. 
<p>

<b>Next Steps</b>
<p>
HUD's goal is to energize the department to carry out the functions 
for which it was created. HUD will strengthen the department's 
traditional role of providing a decent, affordable home in a healthy 
living environment for every American family. HUD will also put the 
urban development component back into HUD and will create working 
partnerships with community organizations, local leaders, private 
business, and governments at all levels.
<p>
HUD has indicated that it is committed to revolutionizing the way it 
does business. While change is already underway, the agency 
recognizes that radical change requires a long-term effort. The 
announcement of the NPR recommendations and the measures that the 
department has taken are only initial steps. With the continued 
participation of employees and constituents, HUD will ensure it works 
the way a government agency ought to work and is a partner for 
community improvement.

<Title>The Intelligence Community</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>The Intelligence Community</H2>
<p>
<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<p>
<HR>
<P>

The year 1991 will go down in history as the year the Soviet Union 
collapsed and the Berlin Wall was torn down. The Cold War had been won.
<p>
Intelligence played a critical role during the Cold War, preventing 
escalation to a "hot war" and preserving hope for people who struggled 
for freedom. But the events as we entered the 1990s signaled a 
fundamental change in the world for which the Intelligence Community was 
created.
<p>
The Intelligence Community (often referred to as the Community or the 
IC) is a federation of 13 Executive Branch agencies and organizations 
whose core was established by the National Security Act of 1947. A U.S. 
intelligence capability in peacetime reflected a commitment to prevent 
another surprise like Pearl Harbor by keeping an eye on developments 
like the continuing Soviet military build-up after World War II. The Act 
recognized the need for both civilian and military intelligence 
elements. These elements work closely with the National Security 
Council, whose mission is to advise the President with regard to 
integration of domestic, foreign, and military threats to national 
security.
<p>
The IC workforce is composed of civilian and military personnel who are 
part of the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) or Tactical 
Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). The Director of Central 
Intelligence (DCI) heads the Intelligence Community at large, as well as 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
<p>
Today the IC faces a world in which challenges to national security are 
less well known and less predictable, and those involved are less likely 
to behave by the gentlemanly rules of the Cold War. Intelligence work 
has become more difficult and dangerous. Despots, arms dealers, 
terrorists, drug traffickers, and ancient rival groups require different 
resources and different approaches.
<p>
At this same time the IC faces drawdowns in resources. It can no longer 
afford to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Risk management, rather than 
worst-case scenarios, must drive the setting of priorities and 
allocation of resources.
<p>
The DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense have just completed joint 
reviews of functions covered by NFIP and TIARA. These reviews track for 
the first time the results and costs of intelligence issues across 
elements of the Community. More remains to be done. The first and 
perhaps most important finding of the National Performance Review (NPR) 
is that there must be an overarching vision for the IC. The members must 
come together as a team working toward common goals and must realign 
resources and functions to make the Community most effective in a post-
Cold War environment.
<p>
The second major finding of the NPR is that the Community and its 
customers must redefine and re-energize their relationships. The 
customer must become an active partner. Too often in the past, the 
customer accepted whatever the Community provided, not questioning 
capabilities or the Community's assessment of his or her needs and their 
priority. Potential customers either did not know of the possible role 
of intelligence or were put off by the burden of dealing with highly 
classified information. One new model is emerging in the IC's work with 
a panel of environmental scientists who are studying the use of 
classified imagery for environmental purposes.
<p>
The Community must develop new collection strategies and serve new 
customers. The demand for actionable intelligence is surpassing the need 
for reflective analytical pieces. New ways to coordinate collection 
strategies must be found to deal with complex multidimensional issues. 
Finally, collection must be better focused. In the current fiscal 
environment, it is crucial to balance the potential of less expensive 
collection disciplines while maintaining essential capabilities in 
expensive technical collection systems.
<p>
The relationship between collectors and analysts must mature as the 
Community's relationships with its customers develop. Concern about 
politicization of intelligence cannot be allowed to get in the way of 
open communication among customer, analyst, and collector. The 
Intelligence Community, working as a team, can ensure that alternative 
views are presented so that the customer can make informed choices.
<p>
The Community can enumerate many examples of its efforts to pull 
together as a team, particularly in support of military operations. The 
Joint Intelligence Center (JIC), created during the Gulf War, has become 
the standard response to military crises. The JIC has evolved into a 
permanent National Military Joint Intelligence Center with full IC 
participation. While the IC cannot afford a JIC for every user, various 
levels of IC integration into civilian policy organizations   and 
military commands clearly enhance the value of intelligence to the 
customer and strengthen the Community through the dynamic feedback 
process.
<p>
One of the best ways to get more for the intelligence dollar and 
preserve key capabilities while downsizing is to share infra-structure. 
In addition, intelligence professionals must see themselves as partners, 
not representing competing interests, with common goals and a shared 
ultimate customer--the President of the United States. To that end, the 
NPR has made a number of recommendations that cross organizational 
boundaries and will provide more meaning to the concept of an 
Intelligence Community.
<p>
Finally, the Community should ensure that each IC agency performs a 
thorough review of its internal systems and processes. The National 
Performance Review looked only at Community issues. An NPR-like   review 
at the agency level, with team members from elsewhere in the Community, 
can help each agency challenge conventional wisdom and push the envelope 
of its thinking. The bottom line is to get the stakeholders involved in 
change and to provide objectivity for the benefit of the whole 
Community.
<p>
The recommendations and actions proposed in this report should yield 
some indirect, long-term savings. However, since those savings would be 
very difficult to calculate and, in any event, could not be shown in an 
unclassified report, no savings estimates were developed.

Recommendations and Actions
<p>
<H2>INTEL01:  Enhance Intelligence Community Integration</H2>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The end of the Cold War and pressing domestic issues have created a 
strong mandate for changing the degree to which the elements of the 
Intelligence Community (IC) must act as a team. The need for a system of 
checks and balances and the diverse sets of customers, which resulted in 
a federation-like structure in 1947, are still important today. However, 
if it is to be a responsible player in government, the Community must 
find ways to share resources, be more efficient and effective, and 
reduce overhead. Without those changes, the Community will not be able 
to address the complex issues it faces. It will also not be able to 
respond to the speed of change in the world. And perhaps most important 
in today's fiscal environment, it will not be able to respond 
intelligently to downsizing.
<p>
<p>Integrating Community activities is made more difficult because the 
Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense have been on 
different budget systems, processes, and schedules. The Community has 
taken steps to begin an integrated approach to strategic planning, 
programming, and budgeting. The crucial concept here is integration 
rather than centralization. The goal is not to build big central 
bureaucracies. Rather, it is to create common frameworks in which the 
elements of the IC can pursue their departmental and national 
intelligence roles. A framework is especially important for the smaller 
players in the IC who are imbedded in Cabinet-level departments. In 
FY93, the intelligence arm of the Department of State lost a small but 
vital $2 million for a computer upgrade. The Community must be able to 
make the case for the smaller, as well as the larger, players.
<p>
<p>The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Deputy Secretary 
of Defense broke new ground in the spring of 1993 by jointly reviewing 
intelligence programs covered by NFIP and TIARA (Tactical Intelligence 
and Related Activities). The joint NFIP-TIARA reviews, and the guidance 
for fiscal 1995 flowing from those reviews, are steps toward an 
integrated way of thinking among Community members. The Intelligence 
Community today lacks sufficient integrated information on which to 
judge the value of existing or proposed programs or to make significant 
cross-program analyses. The NFIP also lacks an effective mechanism for 
tracking the execution of funds. The joint NFIP-TIARA reviews need to go 
further and tackle the issue of execution oversight. Until this happens, 
the Community will not be able to identify what it really spends on such 
areas as information management, IC products, and training.
<p>
<p>The next step needs to be the establishment of a common set of 
definitions, procedures, and schedules for planning, programming, and 
budgeting processes. The overall planning process should identify and 
integrate unique competencies of all organizations and encourage 
programs to use these competencies across the Community when 
appropriate. Foreign language capability is a good example. 
<p>
The Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) has employees covering 
82 languages. Because language capabilities, particularly at an advanced 
fluency, are hard to come by, FBIS employees are frequently "borrowed" 
within CIA for special translation or operational support. The National 
Security Agency (NSA) also has a corps of linguists, but has different 
analytical needs. Linguistic requirements throughout the Community vary 
dramatically in terms of required levels of expertise and contextual 
focus, but with foreign language being a  precious commodity in the 
intelligence business, it is important to know what is in the 
Community's skills inventory. The National Security Education Act, plus 
tracking competencies Community-wide, constitutes a two-pronged approach 
to a vital skills issue.
<p>
The Community needs a strong decisive senior body much like the board of 
directors of a corporation. The current IC Executive Committee (EXCOM) 
is not perceived that way. The IC EXCOM should establish priorities and 
policies for the collection and production of intelligence, provide 
guidance on the relationship between tactical and national intelligence, 
and ensure IC compli-ance with the policy direction of the National 
Security Council. Finally, it should have a communications strategy for 
ensuring that the employees of the IC clearly under-stand the basic 
framework of Community policy.
<p>
Much of the problem is cultural. For the most part, employees do not 
consider their job to include a larger role of being part of the overall 
intelligence team. In fact, agencies typically compete for new programs 
and budget allocations. Even organizations that are supposed to be 
Community-focused do not have a clear sense of identity. As a result 
their role is not perceived clearly. 
<p>
A case in point is the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Centers.  
All are located at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and headed by 
CIA officers with nominal representation from IC elements. Most are 
imbedded in CIA organizational structures. As a result, the centers have 
become a lightning rod for animosity around the IC. Fundamental 
questions about purpose and intent, role in the Community, and 
apparently parallel organizations elsewhere resulted in conflicting 
answers even among very senior officers. The operational accomplishments 
of the centers and the quality of their analytical products tend to get 
lost in the debate over their role. The senior group commissioned 
recently by the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to do a 
zero-based budget review of the centers is a step in the right 
direction.
<p>
The Community aspect of a Center (whether it is fully integrated staff, 
one-stop shopping for Community customers, or a CIA element with 
Community liaison representatives) needs to be understood by the 
employees of the center, its customers, and the members of the 
Community. 
<p>
Centers are not the answer to all multi-disciplinary problems. The 
recommendation in the proposal just approved by the DCI for a national 
intelligence needs (requirements) process will eliminate overlapping 
activities and improve coordination. While this proposal will create 
"issue leaders" and "issue teams," it will not create the overhead of 
establishing a center. The proposal should be implemented.
<p>
A proactive campaign to give visibility to the DCI's Community role (as 
distinct from his hat as the Director of CIA) is necessary in beginning 
to build an integrated culture. The DCI's recent town meeting at the 
National Reconnaissance Office and his visit to NSA are beginning steps. 
The DCI needs to visit the organizations that make up the Community on a 
periodic basis.
<p>
A Community public affairs strategy is also needed. Important 
constituencies in this country have misperceptions about what 
intelligence is and why it is necessary today and in the future. The CIA 
gets much of the credit and blame for a wide range of accomplishments 
and perceived sins of the entire IC. Even users of intelligence have 
major misunderstandings of the role and capabilities of intelligence as 
well as who the players are. Over-classification, lack of communication 
among IC elements, and the slow review and declassification of 
historical documents compound impressions of an unresponsive 
organization. 
<p>
The Community has done well in responding to crises. It has demonstrated 
an agility and flexibility completely antithetical to bureaucracy when 
faced with a Balkan or Somalian crisis. Enhanced Community integration 
presents new opportunities to deal creatively with a host of issues, 
administrative as well as substantive, whether they become crises or 
not. Once again the challenge is cultural. The intelligence professional 
of the future must be able to move in and out of different alliances of 
colleagues depending on the issue.
<p>

<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>

1. The DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense should hold a visioning 
conference to determine the Intelligence Community's mission in the 
post-Cold War world.
<p>
Participants would include other high-level decisionmakers in the IC as 
well as the National Security Council. The group would expand on the 
work already underway by the DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense to 
develop an integrated approach to strategic planning, programming, 
budgeting, and evaluation. Such an approach would be consistent with the 
spirit of the Government Performance and Results Act. It would be 
carried out with an eye to cost savings and downsizing while preserving 
core competencies.
<p>

2. The DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense should strengthen the 
IC/EXCOM by holding periodic principals-only meetings to address 
fundamental policy issues and strategic direction. 
The outcome of these meetings should give Community employees a sense of 
vision and direction. It should also strengthen the concept of working 
together as a team to accomplish the Community's fundamental mission.
<p>

3. The DCI should review the contribution of Intelligence Centers to the 
goal of better Community integration and execution processes. 
Some of the global issues the Community faces would respond to a better 
integrated Community approach. If a Center is the organizational 
structure chosen, the Center's mission, staffing, leadership, and 
product must reflect the Community.
<p>

4. The DCI should direct the development of a public affairs strategy 
that includes educating the public on the intelligence profession. 
Agencies also should consider sharing speakers' bureaus to implement a 
more coordinated approach to the public.
<p>
The general public's knowledge of intelligence is often gleaned through 
James Bond movies and Tom Clancy novels. The Community owes the public a 
more realistic picture of what tax dollars are paying for and why 
intelligence is important in a democracy today and in the future.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>

<p>
Professionals in the intelligence business are a special breed of very 
talented, dedicated federal employees. Each is affiliated with an 
element of the Community, but a more coherent and focused approach can 
be brought to bear on the increasingly complex and wide-ranging set of 
issues faced by the Community, by increasing the value placed on 
intelligence as a profession. This can be achieved without degrading the 
important role each individual plays within his or her agency. 
Downplaying turf issues and encouraging collaboration will enhance the 
products available to the customers and develop a broader based cadre of 
intelligence professionals.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>

<p>
An integrated Community strategy will deliver an intelligence capability 
that, dollar for dollar, delivers a better value and perhaps some 
savings to the taxpayer. Intelligence is somewhat analogous to life 
insurance--one often questions the amount that one needs.

<p>

<H2>INTEL02:  Enhance Community Responsiveness to Customers</H2>
<p>

<b>Background</b>
<p>
The Intelligence Community (IC) is often perceived as not satisfying the 
needs of its customers (civilian and military policy, strategic, and 
tactical decisionmakers) with useful, timely, and unique intelligence. 
There are numerous reasons for this: inadequate or nonexistent 
intelligence access; redundant reporting vehicles; lack of understanding 
of customers' needs; and lack of understanding of IC capabilities.
<p>
While the IC's customer base continues to broaden, the IC has not 
determined how best to serve some of the new, non-traditional customers. 
It also has not marketed its product to potential new customers who are 
players in post-Cold War national security issues. During the Cold War 
period, the customer base was dominated by the principal players in the 
national security community, such as the Department of Defense and 
military services, the Department of State, and the National Security 
Council, who were engaged in the machinations of the Cold War. Recently, 
however, new customers, such as industry, law enforcement agencies, and 
other non-traditional customers such as the Departments of Labor and 
Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have become 
increasingly important.
<p>
The Congress and the American public, two other stakeholders in the IC 
product, continue to question whether the IC is worth the money it 
receives. While the relationship with the intelligence oversight 
committees is much better than with the Congress at large, some members 
still see the IC as a Cold War anachronism and a potentially lucrative 
source of savings. Congress often views the intelligence agencies as 10 
to 13 separate voices and not as a Community. The IC does not 
effectively counter this impression. In the same vein, the majority of 
Americans are not aware of the unique peacetime role the IC has in 
protecting them from political, military, economic, and even 
environmental harm. Public misperceptions of intelligence activities 
influence the IC's relationships with its customers. 
<p>
The current process of determining intelligence customers' needs, 
translating these into collection requirements, and producing 
intelligence is a jumble of loosely connected processes. These processes 
are disjointed within the IC and are confusing to the customer. In 
addition, the Community is not fully able to anticipate shifts in needs 
and to quickly respond in those inevitable instances when a need has not 
been foreseen. Finally, there is no systematic way by which the 
Intelligence Community can measure its performance in meeting these 
needs or systematically follow up on lessons learned.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>

<p>
1. The DCI should appoint a customer advocate, or ombudsman. 
The ombudsman would serve as an impartial observer, facilitator, and 
commentator on Community products and procedures in support of the 
customer. With a small staff, the ombudsman would have access to all 
products, maintain continuous contact with the customer on issues of 
satisfaction, and serve as an arbiter of issues on customer support. The 
ombudsman tasks for the first year would include the following:
<p>
--- Lead an IC team in the development of measures of customer 
satisfaction and effective IC performance. This should lead to an 
aggressive IC program of performance assessment, performance 
improvements, and IC accountability.
<p>
--- Conduct a series of forums for customers with like needs, where 
those needs can be closely coupled with the capabilities of the 
production community. This would lead to better understanding of 
customer needs and the ability of the IC to meet those needs.
<p>
--- Orchestrate the development of a program for educating customers 
about the capabilities and limitations of the IC. Using videos, 
handbooks, and personal interaction, enable each customer to have a 
basic understanding of how to interact with the system.
<p>
--- Develop a one-week forum for newly appointed executive assistants, 
the access points to the IC's senior leadership customers, to explain IC 
capabilities and the importance of feedback from senior policymakers to 
the IC. 
<p>
The ombudsman's objective would be to achieve Communitywide cultural 
orientation to the customer and not to be just an evaluator of customer 
satisfaction. If real or perceived satisfaction of IC performance by the 
customer community were achieved, there would not be a need for such an 
ombudsman. The DCI and his Executive Committee should reevaluate this 
position in two years to determine if it needs to exist or if a new 
approach is warranted. 
<p>

2. The DCI should establish a process which continuously tracks the 
needs of the IC customer. 
<p>
The process should be simple to implement and to understand. The IC 
currently has a plan in the works and should evaluate this proposal to 
see if it meets the above requirements. Part of this new plan involves 
the appointment of IC issue managers. These managers will be appointed 
from the National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) in the National 
Intelligence Council (NIC) and the directors of DCI centers. The NIC 
should be directed to facilitate the interaction among policy analysts 
and NIOs, Defense Intelligence Officers, and SIGINT (Signals 
Intelligence) National Intelligence Officers to strengthen the feedback 
process. 
<p>

3. The Community Management Staff should explore the feasibility of IC 
integrated service teams for larger customers with growing intelligence 
needs and provide the teams with electronic connectivity to IC producers 
and their databases. 
<p>
These teams would be able to provide the necessary services to ensure 
that customers are getting their needs satisfied. They would also ensure 
optimum feedback to the IC. To handle the intelligence needs of smaller 
organizations that cannot sustain a fully integrated team, a separate 
office should be established in downtown Washington, D.C..
<p>

4. The Community Public Affairs Office should jointly develop programs 
to inform the general public about the value of the services provided by 
the IC. 
<p>
Since current public affairs offices speak only for their individual 
agencies, IC public affairs offices should be tasked to coordinate 
policies and programs for the Community. These programs should inform 
the public about successes that can be discussed without revealing 
sensitive sources and methods. They should also explain the intelligence 
process and how intelligence agencies are held accountable in an open, 
democratic society. This would lead to better public acceptance of 
intelligence during periods other than war or conflict. The strategy for 
this objective should be developed by the beginning of fiscal 1994.
<p>

5. The DCI should establish an integrated Community congressional 
liaison office. The newly established office should develop a Community-
wide congressional strategy by January 1994. 
<p>
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Office of Congressional Affairs 
plays a nominal role for the DCI with regard to IC business. This level 
of IC effort is inadequate in today's environment. An integrated IC 
office would help provide a single voice in dealing with Congress by 
coordinating the IC's relations with Congress. Since Congress is a 
principal interface between the American public and U.S. Government, 
this office could ultimately help in educating the public about the 
benefits of the IC. In addition, this office would allow the individual 
agencies to reduce the size of their congressional liaison offices.
<p>

6. The new Intelligence Community Intelligence Systems Board should 
create a multimedia information handling architecture for the IC and its 
customers. 
<p>
Customers must be able to "pull down" IC products when they need them, 
in a format they can use. Therefore, the architecture should place an 
emphasis on desktop publishing, electronic dissemination, video, 
electronic imagery dissemination, and the development of user-friendly 
databases. It should be completed by the end of fiscal 1994. Full 
electronic connectivity (voice, video, data, imagery, and 
teleconferencing) should be established among IC analysts and managers 
by fiscal 1998. By the year 2000, it should be established with all 
intelligence customers. Multi-level security is a goal that must be 
pursued to achieve viable interoperability. Continued investment in 
research and engineering for multi-level security solutions are 
essential. (Refer to INTEL04 for more detail on information management 
recommendations.)
<p>

7. The National Intelligence Producers Board should establish, by the 
end of fiscal 1994, a single, unified, tailored IC series of products 
for high-level customers of national intelligence. 
<p>
These would replace the numerous summary publications currently 
confounding our senior customers. (These would not necessarily replace 
departmental products for Cabinet-level customers.) Virtually all hard-
copy executive intelligence summaries should be eliminated by the year 
2000.      The Board should develop a plan that will provide tailored 
electronic IC summaries to the customers instead. The integration of 
MAGIC (CIA's electronic dissemination pilot system) and the Joint 
Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (the Defense Intelligence 
Agency's system) should be examined with the option to use these 
multimedia dissemination systems as a starting point.
<p>

8. Production managers should encourage the use of the lowest practical 
level of classification for IC products.
Implications
<p>
In an environment of diminishing resources, accomplishing this set of 
recommendations will facilitate meeting future challenges of an unstable 
world and an ever-more-demanding and diverse customer base. DCI 
leadership is needed to set policy for customer focus and move the IC 
toward greater integration. It will also demonstrate the willingness to 
move into a new age of customer support.
<p>
The establishment of customer forums and service teams and the 
undertaking of customer training programs will enhance the link between 
the customer and the Intelligence Community. It will also ensure the 
customers' needs are understood and met. This improved understanding of 
customer requirements will make account-ability measures easier to 
formulate. The establishment of an Intelligence Community- wide forum, 
where intelligence needs are connected directly to collection and 
production, will ensure the desired results are obtained. Customer 
feedback will enable elimination of duplication in production.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
Most of the actions above may require some additional resources. Some 
savings will be realized by integrating various support and analytic 
activities. Full electronic connectivity will also eventually result in 
some cost avoidance. Reduction, and eventual elimination, of hard-copy 
products will result in some cost savings over the very long haul, but 
not without some up-front investment.

<H2>The Intelligence Community</H2>
<p>


<H2>Intel03:  Reassess Information Collection to Meet New Analytical Challenges</H2>
<p>

<b>Background</b>
<p>
At its most fundamental level, the Intelligence Community (IC) exists to collect information of relevance 
to national security interests and to analyze its significance for policymakers. The President and other 
senior U.S. policymakers determine the requirements that establish what information is to be collected. 
Those requirements are then further refined by others further down the line. This goes all the way down 
to the level of the military officer in the field or the intelligence analyst at the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA).
<p>
With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the nature of old threats has 
changed and new threats have arisen. Intelligence requirements have changed accordingly. The 
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons is now a greater threat to national interests 
than the launch of strategic nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. Many have argued that we 
should make better use of intelligence to support our international economic competitiveness.
<p>
An explosion in the amount of information available for collection and analysis is challenging existing 
information processing capabilities. Without an all-source workstation and sophisticated research and 
analytical tools, intelligence analysts run the risk of being swamped with information. The flood of 
information also raises questions about where collection efforts should be focused, both substantively and 
in terms of technical versus non-technical means. While collection by national technical means--imagery, 
signals intelligence, and other technical systems--remains vital to protecting our national security 
interests, the Gulf War highlighted its limits and underscored the need to increase human intelligence 
(HUMINT) collection. At the same time, technical collection will continue to require large budgetary 
allocations in order to meet the challenge of the development of ever-more-sophisticated technology 
worldwide.
<p>
Although the IC is best known for its collection of clandestinely acquired material, it also collects 
information overtly through the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS). FBIS collects and 
translates information broadcast on foreign radio and television and published in foreign newspapers and 
magazines. Clandestine collection needs should be determined on the basis of gaps in the information 
available through "open sources." Open-source material includes information available to the general 
public or to a subset of the public through subscriptions or professional associations.
<p>
Some have argued that the IC should not be in the open-source collection business. Increasing budgetary 
constraints do not allow the Community the luxury of serving as a second-layer collector of open-source 
material that is already being collected by the private sector. Access to open-source material must be 
ensured, however, as its loss would damage analysis and potentially increase clandestine collection needs 
and costs.
<p>
The Community produces a myriad of products that inundate policymakers with more information than 
they could possibly process or need. The IC has come under pressure to eliminate duplication in its 
production. At present, five daily executive products are produced by the IC: the President's Daily Brief 
(CIA), the National Intelligence Daily (CIA with IC-wide input), the Secretary's Morning Summary 
(Department of State), National Military Joint Intelligence Center Daily (Defense Intelligence Agency 
[DIA] with input from other IC members), and the SIGINT Digest (National Security Agency).
<p>
Part of the duplication problem is the result of a "publish or perish" system. In some parts of the 
Community, analysts are promoted on the basis of the quantity of their product, sometimes over the 
quality. Another part of the problem stems from the large number of analysts often devoted to working on 
the same issue. For instance, there are thousands of analysts at CIA, DIA, and the intelligence arms of the 
individual military services, many of whom are doing duplicative work in the military area. Worse yet, 
without a skills bank, the IC does not even know who is doing what.
<p>
However, efforts to eliminate all duplication risk eliminating competitive analysis. Opponents of one, 
giant IC-wide analytical agency point out that the present diversity "keeps all the players honest." This 
means that the risk of a single "cooked," or slanted, product misinforming policymakers is virtually 
eliminated. Thus, while redundancy should be eliminated in the interest of cost savings, care should be 
taken to maintain diversity.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>

<p>
1. The Foreign Broadcast Information Service and the Open Source Coordination Office should 
reexamine the mission of FBIS.
<p>
Its role as a collector of materials published or broadcast in foreign media should be maintained as the 
material collected is vital to analysis. However, it is time for a systematic review of its business areas and 
customer needs. FBIS has already begun this process with a review of its field collection network and its 
products.
<p>

2. The HUMINT program manager, in coordination with the National Intelligence Collection Board, 
should diversify HUMINT collection to cover new issues and areas where technical collection is 
becoming less productive. 
<p>
The technical training of case officers should be improved to enable them to operate in a technologically 
advanced world. In addition, an effort should be made to accelerate diversity by recruiting a more 
ethnically diverse work force, which would blend better into non-European parts of the world. The CIA 
Directorate of Operations (DO) strategic plan addresses these concerns, but over the long term, IC risks 
significant intelligence gaps until the goals are achieved.
<p>
In certain parts of the world, where much information previously available only covertly is now available 
overtly, consider-ation should be given to decreasing the covert HUMINT and increasing the foreign 
service corps representation. Embassy reporting officers often are not able to devote as much time as they 
ideally should to overt collection because their time is occupied with administrative duties.
<p>

3. The new Intelligence Community Systems Board should create a multimedia information handling 
architecture for the IC to facilitate real-time communication between analysts and collectors here and 
abroad in the interest of pin-pointing collection gaps and weaknesses. 
<p>
Collectors cannot operate in a void. While the requirements process is designed to provide a collection 
framework, it must be fine-tuned on a regular basis to keep up with a rapidly changing world. This fine-
tuning is best achieved through regular contacts between the field and home.
<p>
The best way of improving communication is through electronic connectivity. For example, the barriers 
to communication between the DO and the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) at CIA are defined primarily 
by technology. At present, instant communication is limited to secure telephone links. A system must be 
designed to permit electronic communication between the DI and the DO; the Bureau of Intelligence and 
Research (INR) in the Department of State and embassy political and economic officers; and DIA and 
Defense attaches. A recom-mendation for such a communication channel between INR and the embassies 
was made in the Department's State 2000 report, but has not been implemented.(1)
<p>
Improved communication would sharpen reporting and eliminate redundancy. On occasion, there is an 
overabundance of reporting on one issue and a lack on another. Rectifying such a problem in a timely 
manner is difficult under the current system. Better connectivity would help.
<p>

4. The IC Executive Committee should act on recommendations of ongoing reviews of classification 
policies and source identification.

<p>The IC Joint Security Commission and Presidential Review Directive (PRD) 29 are looking at 
problems that arise from over-classification. Problems with over-classification abound in the Community.
On a related issue, to the extent possible, sources should be identified with sufficient clarity to make the 
information they relay valuable to analysts and policymakers. Intelligence is more valuable to users when 
they know who the source is and can then account for biases that individuals may have.
<p>

5. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) should take the lead to integrate political, economic, and 
military analysis. Cross-fertilization should be increased by bringing IC analysts together to work on a 
particular issue more frequently, as is done on National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs). 
<p>
Integration and cross-fertilization would improve the quality of analysis and decrease redundancy in 
production. Theoretically, the coordination process should ensure that integration occurs both within the 
individual agency and at the Community-wide level. Political, economic, and military analysis are often 
done in exclusion of each other. This results in extra products being written to correct faulty analysis in a 
previous product. 
<p>
Cross-fertilization is important to eliminating redundancy and ensuring that the entire Community's views 
have been conveyed to policymakers. More products should identify the entire spectrum of IC positions. 
This would ensure that policymakers do not receive finished intelligence that has been skewed on the 
basis of the biases of one agency or watered down to accommodate the views of all. Such analyses would 
present the facts, followed by the    divergent interpretations, when they exist, identified according to 
agency. All IC products also should state where there are gaps in intelligence.
<p>

6. The NIC should strengthen its role in conceptualizing analytic issues facing the Community, 
encouraging the development of alternative analyses, and improving the perception of it as a Community 
body rather than CIA.
<p>
Changes should be made in the NIC's structure. Although it brings together analytical assets from all 
intelligence agencies to prepare major intelligence estimates, it is perceived as a CIA institution. The 
NIC should have a core support staff similar to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made up of those assigned from 
the agencies to serve the entire IC. It should bring into its organization specialists in banking, 
immigration, disease, climate, and law enforcement procedure. It should also move away from its 
emphasis on political-military issues. As a group com-posed of insiders from and outsiders to the IC, the 
NIC is able to inform policymakers of the value intelligence brings to analysis.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>
<p>
The proposed recommendations would better enable collection to evolve with changing requirements and 
technological advances, better serving the customer. Integration would improve across the Community--
between collectors and analysts, across the "INTs," and among analysts--helping to reduce redundancy 
and duplication and to produce a better product. A restructured, strengthened NIC would help the 
Community work through new analytical challenges facing it.
<p>
The intensity of focus on collection systems over the past several decades has not been replicated by 
research and development of analytic tools and new database capabilities. Billions of bits of information 
are disposed of each day without ever being processed for possible value. There are capabilities being 
developed that could enable the extraction of valuable information, and more importantly, the 
development of user-friendly databases, without requiring human interaction. More resources must be 
expended in this arena, even at the expense of new collection systems.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>

Savings would accrue from reductions in redundancy in production and subsequent downsizing of 
personnel in analytical and collection areas. There also could be savings if HUMINT collection were 
increased at the expense of technical systems.

Recommendations and Actions
<p>
<p>
<H2>INTEL04:  Integrate Intelligence Community Information Management Systems</H2>
<p>
Information management activities within the Intelligence Community (IC) lack system interoperability, 
do not adhere to a common set of standards, and operate without an integrated communications strategy. 
This environment leads to a proliferation of redundant efforts, inadequate support to IC customers, and a 
spiraling and unaffordable cost of doing business. The Community's business is information. Without 
immediate and aggressive action, the status quo in its management of information will result in the 
equivalent of bankruptcy. 
<p>
The historical autonomy between elements of the Community has led it to the current crisis in 
interoperability and the lack of information integration throughout the Community. Operating under rules 
developed in the 1970s, managers bought non-integrated computers, developed non-integrated software, 
and were surprised during Operation JUST CAUSE in Panama, when these systems, purchased and 
developed independently, were not compatible. Moreover, there is no precise accounting of the amount 
the Community spends on information technology. Performance measurement, management decisions, 
and congressional oversight will continue to be extremely difficult until this situation can be remedied.
<p>
Acquisition rules must also be changed. An approach needs to be considered that emphasizes software 
libraries, portable to any architecture, and a design methodology that allows for purchase or lease of 
commercial equipment currently available. A stipulation that the equipment be replaced according the 
Internal Revenue Service depreciation schedules should be added.
<p>
Each agency and/or functional discipline presently "owns" multiple dissemination systems. The 
continued operation of multiple systems is duplicative and very costly. With new advances in technology 
and the availability of increased bandwidth, the integration or elimination of many of these systems is a 
possible alternative.
<p>
One of the objectives for Community information integration should be a common communications 
network that connects a global information grid accessible by all customers. This requires a close 
relationship between the information and communications suppliers to ensure that the communications 
architecture supports the data load and accommodates global access. Interoperability also allows 
decisionmaking to be pushed down to lower levels, sometimes eliminating layers of management.
<p>
Finally, security procedures should be redesigned to accommodate Communitywide information systems. 
The current fragmentation and proliferation of security procedures forms a barrier to the integration of 
any IC effort. Issues of both information security and technical security must be addressed. In addition, 
the current state-of-the-art in multi-level security is not adequate for the most sensitive information. The 
Joint Security Commission is examining this issue.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Secretary of Defense should replace the Department 
of Defense's (DOD's) Intelligence Systems Council (ISC) with an IC organization chaired by the 
Executive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Intelligence).
<p>
The ISC is a DOD forum for the review of current and planned intelligence information systems, with 
membership extended to the Community Management Staff (CMS), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 
and the State Department. The new joint IC body--to be called the Intelligence Systems Board (ISB)--
would be chartered to ensure integration of infor-mation and interoperability of intelligence systems 
Communitywide. It would be empowered to develop, implement, and monitor the Community's 
information architecture; develop and establish Community standards; review and validate current and 
future information system needs; and direct reallocation of resources to ensure interoperability 
throughout the Community.
<p>
The organization should have full-time technical staff to support it. This staff would be responsible for 
the development of Community technical standards and development of a transition plan with costs and 
milestones.
<p>

2. The new Community ISB should impose an immediate moratorium on all new Community information 
management initiatives or upgrades to current systems until a transition plan is developed and basic 
standards agreed upon. Waivers may be granted by the DCI/Deputy Secretary of Defense based on valid 
justification. 
<p>
This would keep the Community from wasting money on making plans or building systems that do not 
meet the future Community standard and thus would be unable to operate within the Community 
architecture.
<p>

3. The new Community ISB should establish a Dissemination Working Group to act as the focal point for 
the receipt, review, and validation of all Intelligence Community dissemination needs. 
The group should report to the Community Intelligence Systems Board and be composed of members 
from each component and/or functional area within the IC. It should review dissemination activities 
within each collection discipline and develop a Community dissemination strategy across the functional 
disciplines.
<p>

4. The new Community ISB should establish a way to identify, track, and evaluate management 
information within the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) and Tactical Intelligence and 
Related Activities (TIARA) budget framework, so that appropriate Community and congressional 
oversight of these costs is easy to accomplish. 
This framework would provide visibility into comparable efforts across the Community.
<p>

5. The new Community ISB also should continue significant emphasis on the development of multi-level 
security.
<p>
Multi-level security--which is needed to enable the management and distribution of information at 
different security classifica-tions (top secret, secret,...) over common networks--must remain a high 
research  priority for government, industry, and academia. It remains a highly complex problem without a 
short-term, all-encompassing solution in sight.
<p>

<b>Implications</b>

<p>
Whenever the term "integration" is used within the Intelligence Community, it immediately triggers 
alarm systems within the component activities. Implementing change in any culture is a difficult task at 
best. Any efforts to cross intelligence disciplines and agencies will face substantial resistance. It is 
essential to the Intelligence Community's survival to implement the recommended actions to integrate the 
Community into a smoothly functioning whole. 
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>

<p>
A shared strategy for information integration that includes all activities within the Intelligence 
Community has a tremendous potential for long-term resource savings. The creation of an information 
management architecture and a common set of standards will provide the Community with a viable 
mechanism to determine the appropriate allocation of future resources, including the elimination of some 
programs. It will also permit the implementation of more efficient and less costly systems for doing 
business. For example, pushing decisionmaking down to the lowest level is possible with robust 
information systems and can result in the reduction of management layers. It also introduces savings 
inherent in a more open and competitive environment that can take full advantage of the technologies and 
standards of the commercial sector.
<p>
The establishment of a Community information focal point and a technical arm for information standards 
development will result in some savings. This also holds true for establishing a moratorium on new starts 
or upgrades until the architecture is in place. An estimate cannot be determined at this time. The 
integration of interdisciplinary dissemination systems also will result in savings over the long-term. 
Further savings are likely to accrue from the implementation of changes in security procedures 
recommended by the Joint Security Commission.

Recommendations and Actions
<p>
<H2>INTEL06:  Merge the President's Intelligence Oversight Board with the 
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board</H2>
<p>

<b>Background</b>
<p>
Current efforts to provide oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) 
may be traced to the mid-1950s. It was at this time that the President's 
Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities was established 
by Executive Order. This board was reconstituted as the President's 
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) by John F. Kennedy. The 
primary purpose of the PFIAB was, and remains, assessing the quality of 
the U.S. intelligence effort. Understandably, the PFIAB has taken a low 
profile.
<p>
The President's Intelligence Oversight Board (PIOB) was created in late 
1981 by Executive Order 12334. The PIOB is the direct descendent of the 
Intelligence Oversight Board, formed in 1976 by Gerald R. Ford. The Ford 
administration established the Intelligence Oversight Board to address 
concerns that there was no office specifically charged with ensuring 
that U.S. intelligence efforts are legal and proper. In short, the PFIAB 
addressed the quality of intelligence efforts, but did not evaluate the 
appropriateness of those activities. In the words of Executive Order 
12334, which created the most recent version of the PIOB, its purpose 
was "to enhance the security of the United States by assuring the 
legality of activities of the Intelligence Community." 
<p>
The PIOB is composed of three private citizens appointed by the 
President and has remained traditionally bipartisan. While not a 
requirement, until recently most members of the PIOB were chosen from 
the PFIAB membership. Since 1981, the PIOB has had a full-time staff 
consisting of a counsel and one management security officer. The counsel 
conducts the day-to-day business of the board. Consultants and special 
counsel have been used in the past, but on an unpaid basis. The staff is 
detailed from other agencies, and detailees are paid by their home 
office. The PIOB budget request for 1994 is $76,000, primarily for 
travel, rent, telephone, and supplies and equipment. Board members are 
unpaid. 
<p>
The functions of the PIOB include:
<p>
--- Informing the President of any intelligence activities believed to 
be in violation of the Constitution or any law, order, or directive.
<p>
--- Forwarding to the Attorney General reports of intelligence 
activities believed to be unlawful.
<p>
--- Reviewing the internal guidelines of each member of the Intelligence 
Community.
<p>
--- Reviewing the oversight practices and procedures of the Intelligence 
Community inspectors general and general counsels.
<p>
--- Conducting investigations to carry out these functions. 
<p>
At one time the Intelligence Community (defined here as the Central 
Intelligence Agency and elements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of 
Treasury, and the Department of Energy) was required to submit quarterly 
reports to the PIOB. This requirement is no longer in effect. However, 
the board and the Intelligence Community have maintained the quarterly 
reporting system. This voluntary reporting appears beneficial both to 
the agencies and the President. The need to report to the board on a 
regular basis encourages each organization to improve its own oversight 
mechanisms. In addition, the President is also served by having an 
independent body review activities that may be questionable. The PIOB is 
under no pressure to support particular constituents. However, it is to 
ensure that the President is advised of their independent evaluations of 
the suitability of any proposed operations. 
<p>
An analysis of current operations and past history seems to indicate 
that a separate review board is not necessary. As noted above, many 
members of the PIOB have been selected from the PFIAB. In this sense, 
the PIOB has been very much like a subcommittee of the PFIAB. 
<p>
The oversight function of the PIOB appears to be an extension of the 
functions of the PFIAB. In other words, the PIOB was chartered to ensure 
that the legality of intelligence activities was considered by an 
independent body in addition to the evaluation of their quality by the 
PFIAB. The effectiveness of the PIOB lies in the access of its members 
to the President. They have the right and the duty to report to the 
President any intelligence activity they consider inappropriate under 
the Constitution and the laws of the United States. In the past, this 
access to the President has not been diminished for members of the PIOB 
who are also members of the PFIAB. 
<p>
Therefore, terminating the PIOB and assigning its functions to the PFIAB 
would not interfere with the review and oversight role intended for PIOB 
members. The independent oversight function in terms of the legality of 
intelligence activities can be carried out by a standing subcommittee of 
the PFIAB as well as by a separate board. The essential requirement is 
that the PIOB members understand their function and have access to the 
President. 
<p>
Another factor to consider is that the PIOB has created a sensitivity to 
the requirement for the Intelligence Community to be self-policing. 
Quarterly reporting to the PIOB serves as an internal check. For 
example, one manager reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
Office of the General Counsel has increased its oversight function 
exponentially since the PIOB reporting requirements began. Merging the 
PIOB into the PFIAB would not directly affect these reporting 
requirements. There would be a technical change in the recipient of the 
reporting--a standing subcommittee as opposed to a separate board--but 
the impact on agencies would remain the same. They would still be 
required to report to an outside entity that they know has direct access 
to the President. 
<p>
In summary, the PIOB is a separate board created for a specific purpose, 
but it can function just as well as a subcommittee of the PFIAB. 
<p>

<b>Action</b>
<p>
The President should issue an Executive Order to terminate the PIOB and 
assign its functions to a standing subcommittee of the PFIAB.
Implications
<p>
The elimination of the PIOB would not cause any decrease in oversight of 
the Intelligence Community. It would serve to strengthen oversight by 
combining this function in one entity--the PFIAB. Having one board 
clearly responsible for all aspects of intelligence oversight gives 
increased importance to that function. It is clear that having two 
presidential boards overseeing the Intelligence Community has caused 
confusion in the past. The elimination of the PIOB staff should result 
in the elimination of a certain amount of duplication. The PFIAB should 
require full-time counsel if it is to perform the assigned functions of 
the current PIOB. The support staff functions can be assumed by the 
present PFIAB staff. 
<p>

<b>Fiscal Impact</b>
<p>
The fiscal impact of eliminating the PIOB is slight and cannot be 
specifically estimated. Since members serve without compensation, there 
would be no savings associated with their termination. The staff is 
detailed, and their salaries would continue to be paid. In effect, the 
PIOB counsel would move to the PFIAB. A portion of the PIOB's $76,000 
annual operating budget could be saved by combining its administrative 
costs with those of the PFIAB. Staff, other than the counsel, employed 
by the PIOB may return to their home agency. This may not be a direct 
cost savings, but is certainly a more effective use of scarce personnel 
resources.
