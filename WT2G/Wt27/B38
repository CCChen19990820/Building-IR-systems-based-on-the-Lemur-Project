Objective:  To experimentally measure the deposition efficiency of ultrafine
particles in the nasal and oral airways of 10 human adults.  The effects of
particle size and respiratory flow rate on the nasal and oral efficiency were
examined using different sizes of particles under conditions that simulate
breathing patterns.
<P>
Methodology:  A passive procedure in which the aerosol was drawn up through the
nose and mouth of breath-holding subjects at two flow rates: 10 liters per
minute (l/min) and 20 l/min.  The particles were of polystyrene latex or silver
3, 8, 20, and 150 nanometers (nM) in size.  The subject sat in a chair in front
of the exposure apparatus.  After being fitted with a nose and mouth tube, the
subject breathed filtered air and practiced holding his/her breath for 30
seconds.  During the time of breath-holding air was drawn through the nose and
out of the mouth.  Subjects who could not perform breath-holding were eliminated
from the study.  There were no risks associated with the study.  There were no
health benefits to the participating subjects.

Objective:  Investigate gender differences in carboxylesterase levels in human
nasal tissue smears in response to atmospheric pollution.
<P>
Methodology:  Human nasal cytology smears are provided by Clinician, Dr. Lillian
Calderon, National University of Mexico, Mexico City.   Dr. Calderon collected
these samples as part of an ongoing histopathological examination of adults
living in polluted atmospheres (Mexico City).  Control samples were collected in
a port city with good air quality.  The smears were fixed immediately after
collection, the slides were coded, and they were sent to the Inhalation
Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI).  The smears were then processed using
standard techniques for immunoreactivity to carboxylesterase.  The presence of
the enzyme suggests that the individual was exposed to environmental toxicants.
There was no risk to the patients.

isotope of lead (210Pb) in the skulls of former uranium miners as a metric of
cumulative exposure to radon and its progeny during their mining years.
Methodology:  The measurements will be done in the whole-body-counting facility
at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI).  The subjects are
recruited from the University of New Mexico Epi Cog uranium miners cohort.  The
subject sits in a chair and the 210Pb emissions are collected with a detector
over 1 hour.  There is no risk to the subject.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is the development and use of new technologies for
the study of brain tumors.  The focus is on development of advanced emission
tomography imaging modalities as well as further development of magnetic
resonance imaging techniques.  This study hopes to lead in the development of
effective brain tumor treatment programs.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects with confirmed brain tumors are given radio-tracer enhanced positron
emission tomography (PET) scans before and 18 months after radiation therapy.
As part of this procedure, patients are given both a venous and an arterial
catheter for the administration of the radiotracer [fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG-18)].

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To evaluate the efficacy of the positron emission tomography
(PET)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18) modality in demonstrating epileptogenic foci
in patients who are being evaluated for epileptic surgery.  The current trial is
aimed at determining: (1) whether high-resolution PET studies are better at
detecting epileptogenic foci and localizing the cerebral cortex, and (2) the
metabolism of epileptogenic foci.  The benefit of this study to the subject and
future individuals with epilepsy:  specific therapeutic benefits to the subjects
include selection of subjects who will be surgical candidates and localization
of the epileptogenic focus for operation.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm and another may be placed in the radial artery of the hand
on the other arm.  The venous catheter will be used to inject the radiotracer
and the arterial catheter will be used to collect blood samples to verify the
rate at which the radiotracer is cleared from the blood.  After a half-hour
uptake phase, subjects are asked to empty their bladder to keep the radiation
exposure to the bladder as low as possible.  Subjects are then positioned in the
PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets and padding in order to make
them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not move during the scan, which
may last between 60 and 120 minutes.  Selected subjects may receive a second PET
scan after surgery.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Hypoxia in human tumors is thought to represent a major obstacle to tumor
control with radiation therapy.  Reoxygenation of the tumor during therapy is
thought to play an important role in determining the effectiveness of radiation
treatment.  This protocol is designed to evaluate the radiotracer fluorine-18
fluoromisonidazole, which preferentially labels hypoxic tissues.  Specific aims
include evaluating fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole as a hypoxic cell tracer;
determining the presence and fraction of hypoxic cells in human tumors and
correlating this with tumor size and histology; quantifying the reoxygenation of
tumor during the therapy selected by the personal oncologist; and comparing the
response of hypoxic and non-hypoxic tumors to various therapies.  Detection of
hypoxic tumors may directly benefit subjects by giving their personal physicians
more information on which to base therapy selection.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm to inject the radiotracer.  A second venous catheter is
placed in the other arm to allow for periodic small blood withdrawals to confirm
radiotracer clearance.  After a half-hour uptake phase, subjects are asked to
empty their bladder to keep the radiation exposure to the bladder as low as
possible.  Subjects are then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician
provides blankets and padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.
Subjects may not move during the scan, which may last as long as 180 minutes.
Subjects are scanned once before and once during or after tumor therapy.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To combine positron emission tomography (PET)-Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose
modality with neuropsychological techniques to observe abnormalities in cerebral
function for subjects with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).  The study will involve
subjects with ages ranging from 5 years to adulthood.  This study will assess
any differences in cerebral metabolism in subjects with neurological
complications of SCD who undergo exchange transfusion to 50%, 10%, and 0% sickle
cell hemoglobin (HBS) levels.  Other goals include: evaluation of relationships
between cognitive function and regional cerebral metabolism and the effects of
pharmacological manipulation of fetal hemoglobin levels on regional cerebral
metabolism.  Benefits to the subject may include determination of significant
neurological deficits and/or abnormalities.  This study may benefit society by
increasing our understanding of cerebral metabolism and neurological function to
individuals with SCD.
<P>
METHODOLOGY

Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm to inject the radiotracer.  After a half-hour uptake phase,
subjects are asked to empty their bladder to keep the radiation exposure to the

as long as 90 minutes.  Children who have difficulty remaining still during the
scan may receive sedation, based on the judgement of their personal physician.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To determine the physiological threshold for perceived visual and neuromuscular
sensations due to oscillating magnetic fields.  The current trial is aimed at
determining the threshold for neuromuscular stimulation and visual phenomenon
induced by oscillating magnetic fields at varying frequencies; it also tests a
hypothesis that oscillating magnetic fields below the threshold for stimulation
of visual phosphenes will cause a change in melatonin release.  Societal
benefits may improve our understanding of disease and the ability to diagnose
and treat future individuals.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects will either be involved in one of two protocols focusing on either (1)
neuromuscular stimulation of the head, abdomen, and wrist using a whole body
gradient coil for the head and abdomen and a smaller solenoid coil for the wrist
or (2) on visual phosphene production and melatonin blood level changes using a
hard coil.
<P>
For the neuromuscular stimulation protocol, a solenoid coil will be placed over
the forearm which will be wrapped in foam pads in order to keep the forearm in
the center of the coil.  Pulses will be administered at different frequencies
and threshold measurements will be made in 5 repetitions with no shielding
followed by 5 repetitions with a cylindrical Faraday shield placed between the
coil and the subject.  The entire sequence will be repeated 5 times.  The
patient will then be placed in a whole body gradient coil positioned to achieve
maximum field in the abdomen with the same sequence of repeated stimulations as
for the forearm stimulation.
<P>
For the visual phosphene production/melatonin blood level change portion, a
catheter will be placed in a vein to obtain blood samples at different stages of
an experiment similar/identical to the first protocol.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To evaluate the efficacy of the positron emission tomography
(PET)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18) modality in detecting the presence and size of
primary and metastatic prostate cancer.  The LBNL procedures are to be applied
twice, once during the initial visit, then two to four months following this

<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
A urinary bladder catheter will be placed to remove from the bladder any
activity which might interfere with the image of the prostate.  Then, a catheter
will be placed in a vein in one arm to inject the radiotracer.  Subjects are
then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets and
padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not move
during the scan, which may last as long as 120 minutes.  A second scan will be
performed two to four months following the initial scan to evaluate progression
of the disease for subjects off therapy or therapeutic response for subjects who
are receiving therapy.  The subject will be followed for 3 years to evaluate the
outcome of therapy with the study's analyses.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To apply the positron emission tomography (PET)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18)
modality to determine the neural mechanisms underlying attention in humans.  The
current trial uses normal adult subjects and those who have suffered from
cerebral infarctions.  PET imaging will be used while subjects perform an
attentional task using a computer monitor.  This study may benefit the subjects
by allowing their physicians to use MRI and PET imaging to diagnose their
illnesses.  This study will benefit society by increasing our understanding of
the brain in controlling visual attention.  This may also assist people who have
had strokes or other brain injuries.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are positioned in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and may
not move during the scan, which lasts approximately 30 minutes.  Subjects are
offered water before their PET scan begins.  A catheter will be placed in one
arm to inject the radiotracer and to collect blood samples to verify the rate at
which the radiotracer is cleared from the blood.  After a half-hour uptake
phase, subjects are asked to empty their bladder to keep the radiation exposure
to the bladder as low as possible.  After injection, the subjects will maintain
visual fixation on the central fixation point of a video display monitor for 20
minutes.  Subjects are then positioned in the PET scanner, for as long as 45
minutes, during which time they may not move.  Subjects will be asked to to
participate in a second PET scan 1 to 4 weeks after the first.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To determine the physiological threshold for disturbance of the
serotonin/melatonin system due to oscillating magnetic fields.  Specifically,
this proposal is to determine the threshold for a change in nocturnal melatonin
release by oscillating magnetic fields.  The hypothesis being tested is that
oscillating magnetic fields can stimulate the pineal in the same fashion as
visible light.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Human subjects will be involved in 4 or 5 separate studies (given at least 1
week apart) which will last overnight.  A venous catheter will be placed for
periodic blood sampling (3 cc) to determine blood melatonin levels throughout
the night with a minimum of light (~100 lux) and in such a manner to disturb the
subject as little as possible.  At 1:00 AM the subject will be exposed to:
<P>
        a)      In the first study, 15 minutes of bright light (~2000 lux - equivalent to a
brightly lit office);
<P>
        b)      In the control (second) study, the subject's head will be placed in a

order to remove from the bladder any activity which might interfere with images
of the rectum and sigmoid colon.  Subjects are then positioned in the PET
scanner, where the technician provides blankets and padding in order to make
them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not move during the scan, which
may last as long as 60 minutes.  Every six months following these scans for an
additional year, then annually for 2 more years, the subject may be asked to
return for additional PET scans.  Every 6 months for 4 years or until death,
telephone interviews and clinical visits will be conducted with the subjects to
evaluate their outcome.  Copies of any summaries of patient care, visits, or

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To evaluate the effectiveness of cancer treatment with heavy charged particle
beams.  The LBNL treatment phase of the project was discontinued after closure
of the Bevalac in 1992; currently the project has been extended to allow
follow-up of patients already treated.  Societal benefits may include a better
understanding of treatment options for individuals with cancer and a better
understanding of the associated risks and side effects.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Human subjects involvement includes follow-up of subjects already treated.  The
subject pool includes those treated at LBNL and at other Northern California
Oncology Group sites.  During the last year a new study for treatment of ocular
melanoma was begun at the University of California at Davis (UCD) Crocker
Cyclotron; subjects treated as part of that project will also be followed under
this study.  Follow-up includes gathering data from existing records as well as
from post-treatment specific examinations.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
Treatment of ocular melanoma patients with protons using the Crocker Cyclotron
at UCD.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
No additional risk accrues to the subjects from participation in the follow-up
study.

TITLE: Metabolic and Kinetic Basis of LDL Subclass Patterns and Effects of
High-Carbohydrate Diet (collaborative study with Hellerstein of University of
California, San Francisco)
<P>
OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to understand where the different density
subclasses of lipoprotein come from and why their patterns differ among subjects
with different risks for atherogenesis. With better understanding of the
underlying principles, better diagnostic tools may be formed for the treatment
of persons with lipoprotein disorders.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Prospective subjects are classified by lipid subclass pattern; if they meet
certain criteria, they are assigned to various dietary studies.  Blood samples
and tracer studies are used to assess subject's response to varying diet.
Dietary studies, tracer studies, and blood drains take place at the
collaborating site and are reviewed and approved by that Institutional Review
Board.

TITLE: Postdrandial Chylomicron Clearance After an Intravenous Fat Load
<P>
  OBJECTIVES
<P>
 The objective of this study is to examine the mechanisms underlying changes in
lipoprotein and chylomicron levels. This will aid in the formation of better
diagnostic and treatment tools for conditions involving atherogenesis, the
development of arterial plaques.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Control subjects and individuals with specific blood plasma lipoprotein profiles
will have their chylomicron clearance rate determined by consuming a high-fat
meal after an infusion of synthetically produced chylomicron particles.  Blood
is then drawn by common clinical venipuncture and analyzed.

INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Subjects will include normal controls and those with any of three inherited
blood lipid abnormalities.  Subjects on lipid lowering medication will be asked
to abstain for six weeks prior, at no significant risk to the patient due to the
short duration.  All will be injected with a solution of laboratory-created
chylomicron particles and given a high-fat milkshake to consume; the clearance
rate will be determined by sequentially sampling blood over the following 90
minutes.  Both the chylomicrons infusion and venipuncture carry a remote risk of
infection.

TITLE: Effects of a High-Fat Meal on the Lipid Composition of Lipoprotein
Subfractions in Pattern A and Pattern B Subjects
<P>
OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to investigate possible differences in the
postprandial lipemia of subjects with Type A and Type B lipoprotein profiles
and, in turn, examine that relationship with respect to the incidence of
coronary arterial disease (CAD).  Type B subjects, characterized by the
predominance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles, increased
triglyceride levels, and reductions in high-density lipoprotein have a
three-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction, but little is known of the
role of different responses following eating.  This information will aid in the
formation of better diagnostic tools and treatment regimes for people with
increased CAD risk.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects in this study receive a high-fat meal (milkshake) followed by a
collection of blood by routine venipuncture.  The results of the blood lipid
analyses are then evaluated in light of the subject's clinical and familial
history of CAD.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
A standardized high-fat milkshake will be taken orally.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Subjects will have blood drawn for the Type A/B screening.  On the day of the
study, the subjects, who have fasted 12 hours, have a blood sample taken, then
consume a high-fat milkshake.  Four hours afterwards, blood will be drawn and a
second milkshake consumed.  Blood will be drawn again four hours later.  The
blood drawing process, via venipuncture, carries a small risk of bruising and a
remote risk of infection.

This research is concerned with growth control of human breast cells and
relationship of differentiation with transformation.
<P>
Human milk contains a small number of living cells which have been sloughed off
from the breast tissue during the secretory process.  These sloughed cells are
isolated from human milk samples and studied to gain an insight into the events
taking place within the breast tissue.
<P>
Subjects are asked to provide information relating to their general health, age,
race, and birth of their child.  They express one or more samples of breast milk
using their own equipment in the privacy of their home.  As subjects are
performing this process on a regular basis, no risk directly related to the
research is anticipated.

The investigator's goal is to determine the morphological, biological, and
biochemical properties associated with normal, atypical, and malignant mammary
epithelial cells.  Such studies will elucidate mechanisms of human
carcinogenesis and aid clinicians in the early detection of breast cancer.
<P>
The research will use portions of residual tissues from medical procedures such
as aspiration of cysts, mammary biopsies, reduction mammoplasty, or mastectomy.
Residual tissues from other sites (e.g., skin, cervix) may also be obtained.
Samples are identified by patient number and donor location and may be
accompanied by medical history data.
<P>
Collection of the samples poses no additional risk to the subject.  Samples are
only obtained from subjects who have given permission for the research use of
their tissues.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To demonstrate the value of quantitative information on specific coronary flow
fields in patient diagnosis and management.  To determine the influence of drugs
and ischemic events on the sensitivity of rubidium as a flow marker to be sure
that the myocyte and capillary membranes do not have an extraction markedly
different from that of normal tissues at equivalent flow values.  Secondly, we
wish to determine how well we can actually quantitate flow by kinetic analysis
for the time course of activity in the ventricle blood pool and regions of the
myocardium using non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) methods
developed during the last 10 years in our laboratory.  Societal benefits from
this research may include earlier detection of coronary artery disease in the
future.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Two injections of 60 mCi are planned with allowance for a 3rd injection if
necessary.  Patients will receive constant monitoring of blood pressure and EKG
while under doses of vasodilators, adenosine and dipyridamole.  Aminophylline
will be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole, if necessary.  Before and
after the use of the vasodilators, PET scan imaging studies will be done.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
Rubidium-82 as a radiotracer.  Vasodilators adenosine and dipyridamole.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
PET scan risks include: venous catheter (bruising, faintness); radiation
(equivalent to back x-ray).  The risk of using vasodilators is that common to
their clinical use as diagnostic aids (temporarily lowered blood pressure
possibly causing dizziness, flushing, headaches, and/or mild chest pain similar
to angina).

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Utilize  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)
on patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multi-infarct
dementia to understand the longitudinal effects of these conditions on cerebral
metabolism.  Develop a new serotonin-based radiotracer which will provide a
measure of the presynaptic degeneration in these cases; correlate the
presynaptic degeneration with behavioral changes.  The new tracer will also be
used to investigate serotonergic degeneration in these diseases.  Societal
benefits may include a greater understanding of dementing illnesses.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm and another will be placed in an artery or vein of the hand
on the other arm.  The venous catheter will be used to inject the radiotracer
and the arterial (or other venous) catheter will be used to collect blood
samples to verify the rate at which the radiotracer is cleared from the blood.
After a half-hour uptake phase, subjects are asked to empty their bladder to
keep the radiation exposure to the bladder as low as possible.  Subjects then
watch a video display terminal on which words are presented.  A delayed word
presentation is used to determine the duration of subjects' memory.  Subjects
are then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets
and padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not
move during the scan, which may last 60 to 90 minutes.  Subsequently, the
subjects may be placed in an MRI scanner for 2 scans totaling approximately 30
minutes.
<P>

<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS

arterial catheter is to be placed, lidocaine is used to provide local anesthesia
before placing the catheter.
<P>
MRI scan risk includes: discomfort associated with lying still in an enclosed
space.
<P>
SPECIAL NOTE
<P>
The number of subjects participating in this protocol is reported under
"Longitudinal SPECT and PET Studies of Dementia" (LBNL-88-073-H02).  These
subjects were not studied separately for "Cerebral Chemical Patterns in
Alzheimer's Disease", therefore, the number of subjects reported under this

To evaluate the efficacy of the positron emission tomography
(PET)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18) modality in combination with
neuropsychological techniques to assess cerebral function abnormalities in
subjects with Alcohol Dementia (AlcD) and Korsakoff's syndrome (KS).  The

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to examine psychophysical effects of interior
lighting, to gain a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the
effects, and to estimate the consequences for lighting-design practice.  A
particular interest within this study is the effect of video display terminal
use under the interior lighting conditions being studied.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Separate studies utilizing various methods will be performed to answer several
research questions.  These studies will include various lamps and lighting
conditions, but none that emit harmful levels of ultraviolet light.  Subjects
will be exposed to light of varying intensity and/or spectral composition,
during which visual and mental tasks will be administered.  Some sections of the
study include defocusing.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
There are no known long-term risks to subjects exposed to acute conditions of
interior lighting with the lamps and intensities used.  The defocusing procedure
may cause mild discomfort and headache similar to that experienced during a
routine eye exam.  Even without this procedure some patients may experience some
"visual fatigue" or other symptoms from a visual task.  Subjects have the
opportunity to end their participation, if they wish, at any time.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  positron emission tomography (PET)
on patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multi-infarct
dementia to understand the longitudinal effects of these conditions on cerebral
metabolism.  Develop new radiotracers which will provide a measure of the
presynaptic degeneration in these cases; correlate the presynaptic degeneration
with behavioral changes.  The new tracer will also be used to investigate
serotonergic degeneration in these diseases.  Societal benefits may include a
greater understanding of dementing illnesses.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm and another will be placed in an artery or vein of the hand
on the other arm.  The venous catheter will be used to inject the radiotracer
and the arterial (or other venous) catheter will be used to collect blood
samples to verify the rate at which the radiotracer is cleared from the blood.
After a half-hour uptake phase, subjects are asked to empty their bladder to
keep the radiation exposure to the bladder as low as possible.  Subjects then
watch a video display terminal on which words are presented.  A delayed word
presentation is used to determine the duration of subjects' memory.  Subjects
are then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets
and padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not
move during the scan, which may last 60 to 90 minutes.  Subsequently, the
subjects may be placed in an MRI scanner for 2 scans totaling approximately 30
minutes.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To clarify the mechanisms through which subcortical lacunar infarction may lead
to cognitive impairment and dementia using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
quantify features of lacunae, high resolution positron emission tomography (PET)
to measure cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRglc) and neuropsychological
tests.  Benefits to the subjects may include the diagnostic utility of these
imaging techniques, as well as the neuropsychological testing.  Societal
benefits may include a better understanding of dementia and cerebrovascular
disease.
<P>

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships of fatal and
nonfatal coronary heart disease and stroke to lipoprotein subfractions and other
risk factors.
<P>
This is an epidemiological study of 1,961 men and 423 women whose plasma total
cholesterol, blood pressure, height, weight, tobacco use and lipoprotein
profiles were studied between 1954 and 1957.  The vital status and history of
coronary heart disease and stroke in this cohort will be evaluated through state
and national mortality surveillance systems, public records, medical reports,
hospital records, autopsy reports, and telephone interviews with cohort members.
<P>
The total living cohort numbers approximately 2,100; in FY 95-96, emphasis is
being placed on recontacting the approximately 400 surviving female members of
the cohort.  The subjects had blood samples drawn at Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory between 1954-1957.  The current involvement of all members of the
cohort is limited to periodic questionnaires and follow-up of medical records.
Each new access to medical records requires fresh consent from the subjects.

The investigator discontinued the IRB approval for this Research Career
Development Award project in January 1995, because funding had expired.
<P>
The objective was to study the correlation and relationship, if any, between
various exercise, weight-loss and diet treatment regimens for coronary heart
disease to existing data of plasma lipid concentrations, lipoprotein profiles,
and specific plasma enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.   The interaction with
human subjects was limited to retrospective analysis of data collected as part
of other studies referenced elsewhere in this database:  "The National Runner's
Health Study" (LBNL-91-107-H01),  "Lipoprotein Subfractions and Coronary Heart
Disease During 25-Year Follow-Up"  (LBNL-88-107-H07), and "Metabolic and Genetic
Origins of Lipoprotein Subclasses"  (LBNL-79-106-H02).  The number of subjects
and the risks to which they were exposed, if any, are described as part of these
projects.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to continue the investigation and development of
stereotactic heavy charged particle Bragg peak radiosurgery of arteriovenous
malformations (AVM) and pituitary cancers.  It is hoped that review of AVM
patient medical records and inquiries into the current health status of these
persons will increase understanding of the effectiveness and benefits of AVM
radiosurgery therapy.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Medical records are reviewed regarding the 840 subjects who received treatment
at LBNL between 1954 and 1982. In a second phase, surviving patients and/or

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Since the Bevatron's closure in 1992, there has been no arteriovenous
malformation (AVM) treatment facility.  The objective of this study is to permit
LBNL researchers to consult Loma Linda Medical Center in the establishment of a
stereotactic proton-treatment facility for AVMs.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
No subjects will be treated at LBNL.  LBNL researchers will act as consultants
to researchers and staff at Loma Linda Medical Center.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
LBNL involvement is limited to consulting on project development, patient
selection, and treatment planning.  No subjects are exposed to a risk at or
through the actions of LBNL researchers as all evaluation and treatment
procedures are carried out at the Loma Linda Medical Center under their
IRB-approved protocol.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To provide an ultimate understanding of the anti-atherogenic role of plasma HDL
(high density lipoprotein) by defining how HDL structure and metabolism affect
intravascular and extravascular cholesterol redistribution.  This aim is being
achieved by the use of model and native lipoprotein particles to define the
physical-chemical and metabolic bases for speciation of nascent and plasma
apolipoprotein-specific high density lipoproteins; by examination of the
remodeling analogs of nascent HDL resulting from their interaction with plasma
lipoproteins and how phospholipid species, cholesterol, and lipolysis-derived
products may modulate the remodeling process; and by the use of apo-specific
analogs to nascent HDL and plasma apo-specific HDL to determine the influence of
compositional factors on cholesterol efflux from cells.
<P>
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Human serum collected under another project (LBNL-79-106-H02) is used as the
source for isolation of lipoproteins, proteins and enzymes used in the research
described above.  In donating blood under the source project, the subject
experiences the risks common to clinical venipuncture (possible bruising, remote
chance of infection).  The Alameda-Contra Costa County blood bank serves as an
additional source of blood plasma.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to clarify the contributions of reduced cellular
deformability to increased red cell destruction in various human hemolytic
disorders and to define the biochemical and structural basis for the
deformability changes.  Another objective is to develop a detailed understanding
of red cell membrane physiology as it relates to red cell function in vivo
through biophysical characterization of normal and pathologic red cells.  In so
doing, a greater understanding of sickle cell disease and potential treatment
regimes may be developed.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Blood samples for analysis are obtained by venipuncture.  Some samples are
obtained from blood donors with sickle cell or other thalassemias. The samples
are then analyzed.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
None.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Human subject involvement is limited to the donation of blood for analysis via
routine clinical venipuncture, which carries with it small risks of bruising or
bleeding and a remote risk of infection.

The investigator proposes to examine the difference(s) in diet and lipoprotein
metabolism in previously overweight or naturally lean men and women who run or
live sedentary lifestyles.  The goal is to better understand the relationship
between lipoprotein metabolism and weight set-point.
<P>
Responses to a survey and analysis of diet records will be correlated with the
results of clinical blood testing.  Laboratory tests will include standard
lipoprotein and cholesterol screening, including for some subjects a separately
approved post-heparin lipase activity test.
<P>
The risks involved are those common to routine clinical venipuncture (bruising,
slight chance of infection) and to the clinical use of the post-heparin lipase
activity test (same as venipuncture; very rarely, allergic reaction).

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to investigate hippocampal metabolism in
schizophrenia, bipolar affective, and panic disorder, seeking to localize
functional abnormalities.  The study proposes to test whether an altered
regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose uptake in the anterior hippocampal
region correlates with positive and/or negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  The
effect of  two common anti-psychotic agents (remoxipride and haloperidol) on
hippocampal glucose metabolism will also be examined.  This study will aid in
the development of better diagnostic and treatment tools for patients with these
and related disorders.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Controls and patients are studied using radiotracer-enhanced  positron emission
tomography (PET) scans; cognitive challenges may be given during the tracer
uptake phase.  Patients are tested both on and off medication; the medication
status of the subjects is under the direction of their personal physician.
Treatment agents are neither administered nor withdrawn as part of this study.
A urine sample is obtained before each PET scan to confirm the drug status of
the subject.  Controls receive one PET scan; patients may recieve up to 4 scans
but no more than 2 in any 12 month period.
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their PET scan begins.  A catheter will be
placed in a vein in one arm and another will be placed in an artery or vein of
the hand on the other arm.  The venous catheter will be used to inject the
radiotracer and the arterial (or other venous) catheter will be used to collect
blood samples to verify the rate at which the radiotracer is cleared from the
blood.  After a half-hour uptake phase, subjects are asked to empty their
bladder to keep the radiation exposure to the bladder as low as possible.  The
cognitive challenge, if any, is given during the uptake phase.  Subjects are
then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets and
padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not move
during the scan, which may last 60 to 90 minutes.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
Patients are administered a radiotracer for the purpose of the PET scan.  The
PET scan entails radiation equivalent to a back x-ray.   If an arterial catheter
is to be placed, lidocaine is used to provide local anesthesia before placing
the catheter.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To evaluate the efficacy of the Positron Emission Tomography
(PET)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18) modality in combination with
neuropsychological techniques to assess cerebral function abnormalities in
subjects with Alcohol Dementia (AlcD) and Korsakoff's syndrome (KS).  The
current trial is aimed at defining brain regions which show impaired function in
these subjects.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects are offered water before their study begins.  A catheter will be placed
in a vein in one arm and another will be placed in an artery or vein of the hand
on the other arm.  The venous catheter will be used to inject the radiotracer
and the arterial (or other venous) catheter will be used to collect blood
samples to verify the rate at which the radiotracer is cleared from the blood.
After a half-hour uptake phase, subjects are asked to empty their bladder to
keep the radiation exposure to the bladder as low as possible.  Subjects are
then positioned in the PET scanner, where the technician provides blankets and
padding in order to make them as comfortable as possible.  Subjects may not move
during the scan, which may last 60 to 120 minutes.  Subsequently, the subjects
may be placed in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner for 2 scans.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
PET scan risk includes: venous catheter (bruising, faintness, blood clot [1%]);
arterial catheter (bruising, pain, faintness); radiation (equivalent to back
x-ray).   If an arterial catheter is to be placed, lidocaine is used to provide
local anesthesia before placing the catheter.
<P>
MRI scan risk includes: discomfort associated with lying still in an enclosed
space.

The objective of this study is to collect self-reported and medical history data
as a basis for testing for correlations between various conditions (e.g., lung
cancer and heart disease), running activity, and smoking history.
<P>
The study hopes to achieve this goal through the distribution of up to 500,000
questionnaires to active runners.  Questionnaires are distributed to the readers
of Runner's World magazine and to participants in long-distance running events.
The investigator does not contact individuals who do not respond to the initial
survey.  The survey asks questions about exercise level, diet, weight, and
personal habits.  Subjects are also asked to sign a release for access to their
medical records.  If the release is signed, the investigator sends a separate
request to the physician's office where the relevant information is abstracted
by the physician or his staff and returned to the investigator.  These items
include results of any recent blood tests for cholesterol and lipoprotein
levels.
<P>
The subjects participation is limited to completing the survey and allowing
access to existing medical records.  The only risk to the subject is potential
loss of some personal privacy.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the size,
distribution, and concentration of environmental tobacco smoke particles indoors
with the aim of providing a more accurate means of estimating the lung dose of
these pollutants for various exposure settings.  In so doing, better regulations
and guidelines may be developed around the management of environmental tobacco
smoke, which is classified as a Class A carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Fully informed volunteer smokers are requested to smoke normally in the Indoor
Air Quality Research House.  Built-in instrumentation is utilized to measure
particle concentration and size distribution under controlled but realistic
situations.  The resulting data is used only to validate a "smoking machine"
developed by the research group.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
Cigarette smoke is inhaled by the subjects.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
A limited number of subjects who already smoke are being asked to smoke several
cigarettes in a test room to serve as a check for the automatic smoking machine
developed by this research group.  The subjects are already aware of the risks
of their smoking habit.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to investigate whether inducible nitric oxide
production from neutrophils and macrophages plays a role in the development of
periodontal diseases.  This study will also test the hypothesis that inducible
nitric oxide production is important in bacteriocidal activity.  This
information will aid in the management of patient cases involving periodontal
diseases.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Leukocytes and neutrophils are collected from human subjects by either rinsing
the mouth with saline, from blood (venipuncture), or from surgical drain fluid
obtained during surgeries conducted at the University of California, San
Francisco.  Human leukocytes and neutrophils are assessed for production and
induction of nitric oxide; both leukocytes and neutrophils will be tested under
normoxic, neutral, hypoxic and acidic conditions in vitro.  Normal samples are
contrasted to samples from subjects with periodontal disease.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
There is no risk to subjects rinsing with saline.  Venipuncture risks include
bruising, faintness, and a remote chance of infection.  The drain fluids are
surgical discards and cause no additional risk to the patient.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to continue the characterization of rheological
and adherence properties of sickle cells and define the biochemical and
structural basis for the observed alterations in these properties.  In so doing,
the study will aid the development of better diagnostic and treatment tools for
patients with the sickle cell condition.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Blood samples for analysis are obtained by venipuncture.  Some samples are
obtained from blood donors with sickle cell or other thalassemias.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
None.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Human subject involvement is limited to the donation of blood for analysis via
routine clinical venipuncture, which carries with it small risks of bruising or
bleeding and a remote risk of infection.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To assess the effectiveness of gemfibrozil on blood cholesterol and
triglycerides and determine if it is effective in reducing specific subclasses
of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or increasing specific subclasses of high
density lipoprotein (HDL) in high risk lipoprotein patterns in subjects with
mild triglyceride elevation and low levels of high-density lipoprotein levels.
In a second phase of the study, the efficacy of gemfibrozil and niacin in
combination is tested on the atherogenic lipoprotein distribution in patients
with combined hyperlipidemia.  Both phases hope to contribute to the development
of better treatment for elevated cholesterol.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Blood samples (for LBNL analysis) were drawn at another site, where the study
was conducted.  For each subject, twelve samples are analyzed over the course of
thirty weeks of the study.  The samples are studied with the use of gel
electrophoresis.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
LBNL involvement is limited to analysis of blood serum samples.  No additional
risk to subjects is incurred by LBNL analysis of samples.

This study has two specific aims: to estimate the effects of high level exercise
and reduced adiposity on blood lipoprotein apolipoproteins and circulating
triglyceride levels; and to test whether the effects of adiposity and exercise
on lipoprotein concentrations are genotype dependent.
<P>
The study utilizes a national survey ("The National Runners Health Study,"
LBNL-91-107-H01) to identify identical twins with discordant cardiovascular
activity levels.  The researcher has developed a population of such twins who
are willing to participate in the study.  Participation consists of completing
an additional questionnaire and having blood drawn when the volunteer enters the
study and after two years as a follow-up.  Serum samples are obtained by routine
venipuncture through either the subject's own physician or through a local
lipoprotein screening program.  The risks are those common to clinical
venipuncture (bruising; the slight chance of infection).

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to provide training in the assessment of risk of
carcinogenesis associated with protons and HZE* exposure to humans during
extended space missions.  This study will benefit space missions personnel, as
well as providing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying
carcinogenesis.  A novel feature of this project is the utilization of data and
discard tissues from patients previously treated for cancer with similar
particle beams.<BR>
*HZE= particles with high [H] atomic numbers [Z] and high energy [E].
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Cell cultures are established from the discarded lenses of patients who
developed cataracts subsequent to helium or heavy-ion cancer treatments.  The
existing medical records of subjects are examined to determine the radiation
dose to the lenticular volume (lens of the eye).  The cell cultures are then
used as an in vitro model for evaluating the effect of heavy-ion exposure on the
eye, which provides a better understanding of the potential risks of exposure on
the eye, and provides a better understanding of the potential risks of exposure
to similar radiation associated with extended manned space missions.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
There are no additional risks associated with this follow-up stage.  The
subjects were previously treated for cancer with heavy ions under experimental
protocols (such as LBL-75-102-H01) and are routinely contacted for medical
record follow-up as part of the study.  Cataract surgeries are medically
necessary procedures performed at the University of California at San Francisco;
subjects sign a surgical consent form that informs them that residual tissues
from the surgery may be used for medical research.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To test the hypothesis that mutant forms of Apolipoprotein-AI (apo AI) are less
effective in constructing the high density lipoproteins which protect against
atherosclerosis.  All experimental work is with cells in culture.  Human serum
collected under another protocol (LBNL-79-106-H02, "Metabolic & Genetic Origins
of Lipoprotein Subclasses") is used as the source of lecithin:cholesterol
acyltransferase (LCAT).  The purified LCAT is used to determine if the high
density lipoproteins (HDL) formed by mutant cells in culture are acted upon the
same as HDL from normal cells.  Societal benefits may include the provision of
additional evidence that the release of lipid from cells to free-apolipoproteins
is a physiologically significant process in that mutations within apo AI which
interfere with HDL assembly have clinical presentations.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Human serum collected under another protocol is used as the source of
lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, an enzyme used to test for high density
lipoprotein activation.  The extracellular assembly of HDL particles will be
assessed, and the structure and function of the different particles compared.
These characterizations will proceed in series:  1) quantification of the extent
of apolipoprotein lipidation, 2) determinations of the sizes and chemical
compositions of nascent-HDL particles, 3) examination of the efficiency of
mutant apo AI to promote cholesterol efflux from cells, and 4) investigations of
the ability of mutant-HDL to activate LCAT.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
None.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
This study does not present any additional risks to human subjects.  (It uses
blood collected under another protocol.)

OBJECTIVES
<P>
To study a statistically observed relationship between the frequency of the E4
allele of the apolipoprotein gene E4 (APOE4) and Alzheimer's disease.  Frequency
of APOE4 will be correlated with previously collected data from subjects with
Alzheimer's disease (AD).  The technique that will be used is isoelectric
focusing (IEF).  Societal benefits include opportunities for future
pharmacologic interventions from linking varied phenotypes to one or more
genetic abnormalities.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
A single 10-cubic centimeter (cc) blood sample will be taken from each patient
through the arterial line which is already in place for the positron emission
tomography (PET) study.  This is in addition to the 125 cc which will be drawn
as part of the PET study (see LBNL-88-073-H02, "Longitudinal PET & SPECT Studies
of Dementia").  For patients who have completed their PET study, venipuncture
will be performed.  The sample will be taken to the laboratory of Dr. Ronald
Krauss, where IEF will be performed.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of hormone
replacement on blood cholesterol and triglycerides to determine if it is
effective in reducing specific classes of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or
increasing specific subclasses of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in
post-menopausal women.  While it is known that women on estrogen replacement
therapy have a reduced risk of atherosclerosis, this research seeks to
demonstrate the mechanism by which this risk reduction is achieved by studying
the same women both on and off estrogen therapy.

<P>
LBNL involvement is limited to analysis of serum samples from the study.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS

To study the correlation and relationship, if any, between a low fat diet and
the pattern of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses, and the relationship
of the response of the different apolipoprotein isoforms (genetic variants of
lipoproteins among individuals) to changes in dietary fat intake.
<P>
The data used for this study were collected under another project entered in
this database, "Genetic Influences on Dietary Fat Response" (LBNL-92-106-H04).
Under that study subjects are asked to fill out an informational questionnaire,
to adhere to a specific diet and, during the term of the study, to submit
periodically to venipuncture for collection of blood for the lipoprotein
analysis.  The research involves no risk other than that characteristic of
routine venipuncture (bruising, slight chance of infection).  Use of the data
from the study cited above does not increase the risk to subjects as the data is
supplied anonymously.  Subjects were informed in advance that their data might
be used for several studies and by different investigators.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to develop techniques and instrumentation to
automatically identify specific molecules associated with cancer in human breast
tissue specimens.  This study will aid in the development of diagnostic tools
and case management for patients with breast cancer.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
The specimens are derived from tissue discarded following pathological
examination.  The samples are then examined using molecular, biological, and
optical microscopic techniques.  The results are evaluated in relation to
information from the patient's medical record.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Because the specimens are collected at another site for another purpose, this
study poses no additional risk to human subjects.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Individuals in populations who are occupationally or accidentally exposed to
ionizing radiation are being followed by collaborators for possible health
effects of their exposure.  A correlation is drawn between the aberrant cells or
chromosomes measured in blood samples and the amount of radiation exposure
experienced by the donors to determine the dose response and sensitivity of the
samples.  These data will benefit persons who have experienced long-term
exposure to ionizing radiation and will help determine the effect of such
exposures.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Human blood samples will be obtained by contractors of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) at sites throughout the U.S. as well as in Tibet and Lithuania.
Samples are sent to the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), where
the samples are fixed with formaldehyde or methanol-acetic acid.   These samples
are then labeled with either monoclonal antibodies or DNA probes by in situ
hybridization.  Each sample is then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or
fluorescence flow cytometry at LBNL.  The samples are then returned to UCSF
where they are correlated with epidemiological life-style information and
reported to NCI.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES
<P>
None.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF AND RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
No samples are drawn at either UCSF or LBNL.  The principal investigator on this
project holds a joint appointment with LBNL and UCSF.  Any samples received at
UCSF which are identified with the subject's name are coded at UCSF before being
sent to LBNL for analysis.  No additional risk to subjects is incurred by LBNL's
analysis.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The objective of this study is to determine the effect of human environment
changes on the occupants of office buildings. This research will lead to
improved knowledge about the causes of office workers' acute symptoms of ill
health and the effectiveness of various procedures in reducing symptoms.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Building occupants will receive a short information sheet on the project and
will be asked to complete questionnaires once or twice per two weeks.  Over the
course of six to twelve weeks, modifications will be made in the environment of
a particular group of workers, e.g. increase/decrease of ambient temperature,
increased rates of outside air ventilation, upgrading air filters, etc. The
questionnaires will inquire as to perceived qualitative differences in the work
environment.

To show that the evaluation of real-time sodium concentration in living tissues
is possible through the use of a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique.
Images generated with this new technique, called "short and long T2 imaging"
will be compared to standard MRI images.  In vivo sodium level fluctuations may
be significant in heart disease and other conditions involving muscle
contraction.
<P>
The risks of MRI include the possibility of discomfort associated with holding
the arm still for a long period of time.  The new technique poses no more risk
than standard MR imaging.

The IRB approved "Human Sperm Chromatin and Chromosomes" protocol provides
human sperm interphase pronuclei for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
mapping on the Human Genome Project.  Sperm-derived pronuclei provide a unique
resource of highly decondensed, very extended chromatin for high-resolution
ordering of cosmids by FISH and the generation of distance estimates between
cosmids.  These data are used to construct a metric backbone that greatly
facilitates mapping efforts on human chromosome 19.
<P>
 Sperm donors are drawn from an in-house donor pool (under the direction of Dr.
A. Wyrobek, BBRP) or from personal contacts of LLNL employees, e.g. husbands or
friends of employees.  Confidentiality is maintained by the contact person.
Fresh semen samples are collected in a sterile plastic container by donors on a
pre-scheduled day and delivered to the lab.  The sample is diluted with a
special egg-yolk buffer and stored overnight in a refrigerator.  The next day
the sample is washed, and sperm cells are isolated and co-incubated with oocytes
from golden hamsters.  After 2-3 hours, the eggs are washed free of sperm and
incubated overnight.  The following morning they are fixed on microscope slides
at stages when the chromatin is in an extended form characteristic of interphase
nuclei.  Any remaining sperm cells are discarded under regulations pertaining to
biohazards.
<P>
Sperm pronuclear interphases are hybridized with nick-translated cosmids, which
are subsequently detected with fluorescent signals through the microscope
(standard FISH techniques).  These studies do not involve exposure of human
subjects to radiation or chemicals, nor do they involve the establishment of
cell cultures, reproductive studies or genetic engineering.  There are no known
risks in collecting a sperm sample.

Objective:  The objective of this research is to determine the frequency and
molecular character of genetic alterations (mutations)  that can be detected in
the lymphocytes of humans.  This information has the potential in the future to
aid studies to identify types of mutations that are associated with exposures to
toxic agents, and thereby aid surveillance of populations for genetic
consequences of exposure to toxic agents. In this study the goal is to
understand the mutations that occur in the DNA of people that are healthy and
have no unusual exposures to radiation or chemicals. The gene studied is the
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene; mutations of this gene in
lymphocytes do not affect the health of the person, but do reflect genetic
changes that have occurred.  By understanding the frequency and molecular nature
of genetic changes that occur as a part of normal life, in this study, changes
that occur in people exposed to chemicals or radiation may be identified, in
future studies.
<P>
Methodology.  Each subject recruited for this study was asked to read the
Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights, sign a Consent Form, and complete a
personal health questionnaire, either by phone interview or on a paper copy,
prior to donating blood for this study.  This information identified whether the
person had exposures that disqualified them as donors (due to exposures to known
toxic agents outside the scope of the study) and determined whether they fall
into the study groups of interest (smokers and nonsmokers, but not former
smokers).
<P>
        White blood cells were isolated from peripheral blood samples and cultured in
the laboratory under conditions that select for the growth of mutant cells.
These mutant cells were propagated to large numbers and then frozen.  The RNA
and DNA of these cells were extracted and analyzed to detect the genetic
alteration responsible for the mutant character of the cells. On occasion due to
scheduling conflicts, cells from samples were frozen and cell culture performed
at a later date.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects.
<P>
Procedures:
<P>
        Up to 50ml of heparinized blood per donation were collected by medical
professionals.
<P>
        The identity of subjects recruited by collaborators at other institutions was
never given to the Livermore scientists. The identity of subjects who were
recruited at Livermore was coded on blood samples and all derived materials in
the laboratory so that donor identity was not accessible from observation of any
materials in the laboratory or publications. The code is maintained by Irene M.
Jones and kept in a file drawer in her office, which is locked during
nonbusiness hours.
<P>
        There was no exposure of subjects to radiation, radioactive substances, or
chemical substances.
<P>
Risks.  The risks of participation in this study were limited to those of
venipuncture, i.e. temporary pain, bruising and/or soreness of the affected
tissue or surrounding tissue, formation of scar tissue, infection, and fainting,
as noted in the consent form.

A. Objectives
<P>
Cleanup workers for the Chernobyl accident which occurred in 1986 were exposed
to moderate amounts of ionizing radiation.  To detect early biological effects
of radiation exposure on these individuals, peripheral blood samples are
obtained and analyzed for cytogenetic and somatic mutations in lymphocytes and
erythrocytes.  In addition, peripheral blood samples are obtained from spouses
and children of such workers to determine whether germinal mutations are induced
by radiation exposure by detection of such mutations in DNA from children with
detailed comparison to parents.
<P>
B. Methodology
<P>
Our method for accomplishing these goals is to simultaneously obtain
genotoxicity measurements using four different analytical techniques on blood
samples from approximately 1,000 individuals, including people who were exposed
to ionizing radiation as a result of the accident at the nuclear power plant in
Chernobyl, Ukraine, in April-May 1986 and their progeny.        
<P>
Data from the four areas of research will be used in two ways.  For each
individual assay of somatic cells, a dose-response from ionizing radiation will
be generated by comparing the analytical results with physical dosimetry and
with immediate biological dosimetry that was performed by the Soviet medical
scientists in 1986, shortly after the Chernobyl accident.  This should provide a
means for interpreting each of the bioassays for its capabilities as a
monitoring biodosimeter for similar radiation exposures (both sensitivity and
precision will be determined).  In addition, the combination of measurements
from the four different research areas will allow an overall effect of exposure
of each individual to be determined.  A weighted sum of these effects will be
derived, and in the future this may serve as an individual dosimeter for dose,
an indicator for higher susceptibility to damage, and an estimator for that
individual's risk to develop cancer.    
<P>
C. Ionizing Radiation, etc.
<P>
None
<P>
D. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
1. Procedures<BR>
 The exposed individuals are being studied for the frequency of mutations at the
glycophorin A locus by analysis of red blood cells in flow cytometry.  The
lymphocytes of these same individuals are screened for the frequency of
chromosomal anomalies and mutations at the HPRT locus.  This requires that
lymphocytes be cultured in vitro to obtain metaphase chromosomes for the
cytogenetics and also to detect HPRT mutant lymphocytes, which become resistant
to thioguanine poisoning.  Using these three assays, it should be possible to
relate the level of radiation exposure as obtained by physical dosimetry to
three different somatic cell endpoints.
<P>
2. Risks<BR>
The risks to the individual from the drawing of the blood sample are bruising at
the site of venipuncture and minor infection.  These are unlikely events.  Any
adverse effects will be treated by the appropriate Russian health service.

The objectives of this work are to provide peripheral blood for cytogenetic
analyses, which will include calibration, validation, and quality control for
laboratory purposes.  In addition, metaphase chromosomes will be utilized for
mapping genes, and developing or evaluating potential new cytogenetic methods
that require human peripheral blood cells.  The subjects' involvement is limited
to phlebotomy (less than 50 ml total volume), followed by tissue culture to
obtain metaphase chromosomes from the peripheral lymphocytes.  Subjects also
complete a questionnaire inquiring about lifestyle factors that may be useful
for interpreting the results of our validation and quality control analyses.  No
ionizing radiation or chemicals are administered to these people as part of this
project.  The risks to the subjects are those associated with venipuncture, and
include temporary pain, bruising and/or soreness of the affected tissue or
surrounding tissue, formation of scar tissue, infection, and fainting.

a) Objectives
<P>
This is a research effort aimed at measuring the mechanical properties, chemical
and composite structure, and resistance to demineralization in dentin, the
mineralized hard tissue beneath the enamel in teeth. Characterization of dentin
will lead to improved adhesion and bonding of restorations and improved clinical
treatment of caries.
<P>
b) Methodology
<P>
We have developed several new technologies to explore the mechanical behavior of
dentin in its fully hydrated state. Chief among these is the development of a
nanoprobe scanning force microscope that allows measurements of hardness and
modulus of the constituent materials of dentin with nanometer spatial
resolution. In addition, three-dimensional x-ray microscopy/x-ray diffraction is
giving us information on how the measured properties are controlled by the
structure and chemistry of the dentin, and on how these properties are altered
due to age and disease.
<P>
c) Ionizing radiation: none
<P>
d) Involvement of human subjects
<P>
Teeth to be used in this study will be selected from those planned for
extraction in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) dental and oral
surgery clinics. The teeth must be noncarious and unrestored. After collection
the teeth will again be screened for potential environmental or dental
influences, such as tetracycline treatment during development, which is evident
in the enamel. Participation will be voluntary and no specific subject
population will be sought. Patients who appear in the oral surgery clinics will
be asked if they wish to participate. Patients will be paid $15.00 for
participation.
<P>
There is no risk to human subjects as a result of this study.

The ability of the respirator to prevent leakage of outside contaminants into
the breathing air will be measured by placing a human subject wearing a
respirator in a test chamber containing a challenge atmosphere of air with one
or more of the following added:  2000 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur
hexafluoride gas, 2000 ppm of Freon 12 gas, 20 milligrams per cubic meter
(mg/m3) polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) aerosol, 20 mg/m3 of calcium carbonate
aerosol, 20 mg/m3 of aluminum oxide, or 20 mg/m3 of polystyrene latex. These
chemicals have been determined to be safe for respirator testing. The subject
may be in the test chamber for up to 45 minutes while performing a variety of
exercises and movements. Occasionally, subjects are asked to walk/run on a
treadmill.
<P>
The ability of a respirator to provide sufficient breathing air of an adequate
quality to its wearer will be determined in addition to its ability to prevent
faceseal leakage.  The sufficiency of breathing air will be determined by
measuring the differential pressure between inside the facepiece and the
atmosphere.  The quality of the air will be determined by measuring the oxygen
and carbon dioxide concentrations inside the facepiece when applicable.  Oxygen
and carbon dioxide concentrations as well as the subject's heart rate will be
measured continuously and monitored by the experimenter to ensure the safety of
the human subject. The subject's respiration rate will also be recorded.
Conditions for terminating the tests will be: oxygen concentration below 16%,
carbon dioxide concentration above 5%, heart rate above 90% of cardiac reserve
at any time, heart rate above 80% of cardiac reserve for more than one minute,
or at the request of the subject for any reason.
<P>
These tests will provide a better understanding of existing respirators. They
will also assist in the development of new and improved respirators and will
provide workers with a greater selection of respiratory protection devices and
hopefully with greater protection from hazardous atmospheres.

A. Objectives
<P>
Determine the sensitivity of the GPA-based somatic mutation assay and the
chromosome painting translocation analysis assay for measuring the amount of
ionizing radiation exposure of individuals who are exposed to low doses over
extended periods of time.  Since the British Nuclear Fuels, LTD. (BNFL) workers
have had very good physical dosimetry, the results of this study will be used as
a standard for future uses of these two biodosimetric techniques.
<P>
B. Methodology
<P>
Individuals are selected from a BNFL listing of its workers and asked if they
will donate small amounts of blood to this research study.  The selected workers
include those that have been exposed to at least 50 cSv of ionizing radiation as
well as matched controls.  During the next year, approximately 75 such workers
will be sought.  The samples will be serotyped for MN blood group antigens and a
1 ml aliquot will be sent to LLNL for the glycophorin A-based assay. In
addition, the cytogenetics laboratory at BNFL will prepare fixed lymphocytes
from each sample for chromosomal analysis, and send these fixed lymphocytes to
LLNL.

A. Objectives
<P>
   The glycophorin A (GPA) human mutation assay is being extensively used for
studies of genetic damage in human populations with exposure to potentially
mutagenic agents. Blood samples from agricultural workers exposed to pesticides
or herbicides and matched unexposed control individuals will be used to
determine if occupational exposure to pesticides or herbicides produces an
elevated frequency of mutant-phenotype red cells in exposed individuals.
<P>
B. Methodology
<P>
   Coded blood samples from  both exposed workers and matched controls will be
provided by Dr. Vincent Garry, Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and
Pathology, University of Minnesota. Samples will be collected by Dr. Garry, or
his staff, and coded aliquots will be sent by express mail to LLNL. The blood
samples will be serotyped for the MN blood group. Samples from individuals with
MN phenotype will be tested at LLNL using the glycophorin A mutation assay to
determine if exposed workers have elevated frequencies of variant red blood
cells compared with matched controls.

A. Objectives
<P>
   Blood samples will be used for the development and application of a new assay
for somatic cell mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) locus detected in human
reticulocytes. A reticulocyte-based mutagenesis assay has a number of potential
advantages over our current erythrocyte-based GPA assay. These include a rapid
response and increased sensitivity to acute exposures to genotoxic agents, and
the potential for molecular characterization of the mutations responsible for
the variant phenotype reticulocytes detected by the assay. Thus, the
reticulocyte project should provide important new capabilities for studying the
human risk from exposure to genotoxic agents and for studying the molecular
nature of fetal mutations.
<P>
B. Methodology
<P>
   Blood samples  (5-15 ml)  from volunteers at LLNL will be obtained by
standard venipuncture done by members of the LLNL Medical Department. Similar
samples of cord blood collected by outside collaborators will be refrigerated
and sent to LLNL within one week of collection. All samples will first be M,N
typed to identify which samples are of blood type MN, as the assay can only be
performed on samples of this blood type.  Centrifugation or immunomagnetic
selection procedures will then be used to obtain samples enriched in
reticulocytes. The enriched samples will be fixed, labeled with monoclonal
antibodies and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The flow
cytometer data will be used to calculate the frequency of variant phenotype
reticulocytes in each sample. For some samples, flow sorting will be used to
purify variant reticulocytes for molecular analysis of messenger RNA in these
cells.
<P>
C. Ionizing Radiation, Radioactive Substances, or Chemical Substances
<P>
None
<P>
D. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
   Blood samples will be used for the development and application of a new assay
for somatic cell mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) locus detected in human
reticulocytes. Blood samples from LLNL volunteers and cord blood samples will be
used for the development of this new assay system. After the assay is developed,
it will be applied to samples from unexposed individuals and from individuals
that have been exposed to ionizing radiation or mutagenic chemicals. These
samples will be provided by outside collaborators that have access to
populations of exposed individuals.
<P>
   Samples will be obtained from two sources. Samples from unexposed volunteers
at LLNL are currently being collected for the erythrocyte-based GPA assay (IRB#
91-102, R. Langlois, P.I.). Samples of cord blood will be obtained from The
Children's Hospital, Denver, CO.
<P>
   Samples from outside collaborations will be encoded by the collaborator, so
the names of the participants will not be known by anyone at LLNL. Samples from
LLNL volunteers will be encoded by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Richard
Langlois, and all data and records will use code numbers only.
<P>
   Blood samples are obtained by standard venipuncture procedures, and it is
expected that the subject will be able to function normally immediately.

Genome mapping is a nationally funded project with strong links to the medical
community. Livermore's Human Genome Center mapping work is recognized worldwide.
Many researchers working on specific diseases have established collaborations
with the Center. Some examples of disease whose genes are localized to
chromosome 19 include myotonic dystrophy, familial hypercholesterolemia,
dominant autosomal stroke, and a form of diabetes.
<P>
As a part of this project, human blood samples are obtained specifically to
culture lymphocytes and produce chromosomes on microscope slides for physical
mapping. Prior to obtaining samples, all donors sign an informed consent form
and they receive "The Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights." A small sample
(5-10 ml) of venous blood is drawn at the LLNL medical facility from volunteers.
Risk to the donor is minimal, but may include local bruising or fainting. Blood
donors are not subjected to any in vivo procedures, nor to any procedures
associated with in vitro fertilization, long-term cell culture or genetic
engineering.
<P>
Blood samples are coded before culturing, and all data linked to sample codes.
Blood is cultured for two days, and lymphocyte chromosomes harvested.
Chromosomes are used as "target" templates for determining order of
fluorescently labeled markers used as probes. Data are scored directly from
coded microscope slides.

a.  Objectives:
<P>
The objectives of this research are to develop new methods for detecting
aneuploidy in human sperm using multi-probe  fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) and image analyses for automation.
<P>
b.  Methodology:
<P>
A small amount of human semen is smeared onto glass slides and is analyzed for
sperm aneuploidy by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using chromosome
specific DNA probes.
<P>
c.  Ionizing Radiation, Radioactive Substances, or Chemical Substances:
<P>
No person is exposed to these substances for the purpose of our study.  Most of
the men used in this study are healthy normal men. For validation of our assays,
we also utilize a small number of archived semen samples provided by cancer
patients before, during and after they have been treated with drug and/or
radiation therapies.
<P>
d.  Involvement of Human Subjects:
<P>
1.  Men are invited to be volunteers for providing semen samples and some choose
to participate in our studies.  Samples are delivered to the laboratory and all
samples are coded to protect the confidentiality of the donors.  Either frozen
or fresh samples are used as dictated by the requirements of the specific
laboratory methods.
<P>
 2.  There is no known risk to the semen donors.

A) Objectives
<P>
   The glycophorin A (GPA) human mutation assay was developed at LLNL, and this
assay is now being extensively used for studies of genetic damage in human
populations with exposure to potentially mutagenic agents and populations that
are potentially unusually susceptible to mutational damage. Thus, the GPA assay
provides an important approach for studying the human risk from exposure to
genotoxic agents. Blood samples from normal donors are required both for quality
control, and for defining the distribution of GPA variant frequencies in
unexposed individuals for comparison with individuals with potential mutagen
exposure.
<P>
B) Methodology
<P>
   Blood samples (5-30 ml)  from volunteers at LLNL will be obtained by standard
venipuncture done by members of the LLNL Medical Department.  All samples will
first be M,N typed to identify which samples are of blood type MN, as the assay
can only be performed on samples of this blood type.   Blood samples will be
fixed, labeled with monoclonal antibodies and propidium iodide, and analyzed by
flow cytometry. The flow cytometer data will be used to calculate the frequency
of variant phenotype erythrocytes in each sample.
<P>
C) Ionizing Radiation, Radioactive Substances, or Chemical Substances
<P>
None
<P>
D) Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
   Blood samples will be obtained from normal donors in the LLNL employee
population for use in the glycophorin A (GPA) assay for somatic cell mutations
in humans. Samples from normal donors will be used for instrument calibration,
for quality control tests on assay performance, and as test samples for
modifications of the GPA assay method. Assay data from normal donors will also
be combined with data from other normal donors to provide information on the
distribution of variant cell frequencies in unexposed individuals.
<P>
   Each donor will be assigned a code number by the principal investigator, Dr.
Richard G. Langlois. Subject names will be known only to him and appropriate
laboratory personnel. Data obtained from individual subjects will be referred to
only by the code number so that the identity of donors will be protected.
<P>
   Blood samples are obtained by standard venipuncture procedures, and it is
expected that the subject will be able to function normally immediately.
Possible risks and discomforts that may result from the procedure are considered
unlikely but include:
<P>
        a.  Temporary pain<BR>
        b.  Bruising and/or soreness of the affected tissue or surrounding tissue<BR>
        c.  Formation of scar tissue<BR>

Objective:
<P>
       Hair can be a biological sample that reveals chemical exposures in
humans.  Incidental inhalation and ingestion of particles over extended periods
of time may result in the formation of a diagnostic chemical fingerprint in hair
samples.  Methods will be explored to ascertain routine whether chemical
exposures in the work environment can be revealed through ultratrace analysis of
human hair samples.
<P>
Methodologies:
<P>
        Human hair from individuals known to have been exposed to chemicals in the
workplace will be analyzed.  New analytical methods will be developed to assay
for ultralow levels of certain organics (e.g., high explosives) and specific
elements (e.g., actinides).
<P>
        The focus of the hair analysis program centers first on reviewing the
literature concerning the extraction of target analytes in laboratory-fortified
hair samples.  Several approaches will be reviewed in detail, for example,
enzymatic digestion, organic solvent extractions, and mild acidic extractions.
Depending on the harshness of the extraction, solid phase extraction (SPE) may
be proposed as a partial method to clean up the extracts.  Every extraction
technique will be evaluated on its efficiency and ease of use.
        The work also includes the development of a laboratory protocol for organic
extracts of hair that will either pre-concentrate the sample prior to analysis
or evaporate the sample to dryness and then derivatize the isolated compounds
and elements.  It will be proposed to analyze each sample utilizing gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS).  We will recommend equipment that is readily available to
most analytical chemistry laboratories.
<P>
        The use of matrix assisted laser desoption and ionization (MALDI) mass
spectrometry will be evaluated for sectional hair analysis.  Because hair grows
at approximately 1 cm/month, it may be used to detect a history of chemical
exposures.  We plan to review the application of  MALDI-MS for hair analysis of
HE and actinide incorporation.   MALDI-MS will enable us to precisely focus
laser power on a selected portion of a hair strand utilizing a miniaturized
video camera with newly designed laser optics to monitor the ionization points
on the hair shaft.  The ions created should allow an ion trap mass spectrometer
(with MS/MS option) to detect target species.  We will consider in our studies
the level of concentration of chemicals in the hair and at what level the target
species must be present in order to be seen with MALDI-MS.  Most of the
preliminary work will be performed with laboratory-fortified hair samples.
<P>
Ionizing Radiation:
<P>
        No radiation experiments are anticipated in these studies.  Only hair samples
from individuals who work with radioactive materials will be utilized in these
studies.  No human experiments are anticipated.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:
<P>
        1.  Hair samples from selected volunteers will be obtained for these studies.
Typically hair is obtained during routine hair cuts at the local barber shops.
The hair samples are placed in suitable containers and collected for analysis.
<P>
        2.  There is very little risk of injury in obtaining hair samples.  The
information obtained following the analysis is kept confidential and only
available to selected researchers as coded data.  No names are associated with
the analytical chemistry findings.

Background:
<P>
Breast cancer kills a U.S. woman every 12 minutes.  Overall, 24% of breast
cancer patients in the U.S. die from the disease.  When detected early, only 5%
die.  Conventional mammography is a powerful tool, but approximately 25% of the
detectable breast cancers are missed.  Most of these are missed by oversight.
<P>
Objectives:
<P>
We are developing computer algorithms to reduce oversight.  Secondary objectives
of the research are to investigate methods of compressing or reducing digital
mammograms for storage and improved methods of softcopy image display.
<P>
Methodology:
<P>
Archival film mammograms are digitized using LLNL's unique digitizing
technology.  These digital images are then computer processed.  The main thrust
of this work is to find and highlight suspicious regions.  These regions are
highlighted for diagnosis by a radiologist.  Initially, results are evaluated by
comparison to a skilled mammographer.  Final performance will be measured by
mammographer performance with and without computer assistance.
<P>
Ionizing Radiation:
<P>
Archival mammograms are used for this work.  Human subjects are not exposed to
ionizing radiation.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:
<P>
A few images are accepted from those offered directly to the LLNL research team
by volunteers.  In these cases, volunteers give their informed consent and names
and other identifying information are obscured prior to digitization.
<P>
Human subjects are exposed to no risk from this study.

The objectives of this work are to understand the metabolic products of
heterocyclic amines produced from human liver extracts in a test tube.  Samples
are acquired in Australia and shipped here as frozen extracts.  Samples are
primarily normal tissues from cancer dissections taken under normal surgical
procedures for removal of cancerous tissues.  Researchers at LLNL never know the
identification of the individual, but do know the samples are HIV- and Hep
B-negative and whether the donor is a smoker or a nonsmoker.  The extracts are
incubated with carcinogens in a test tube and the metabolites are identified by
HPLC and LC/MS.  There are no risks imposed by these experiments beyond the
required surgery for the cancer.

Patients presenting to Health Services with symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
(CTS) and tendinitis will be recruited randomly by Health Services personnel to
participate in the study.  Heavy keyboard users (more than 4 hours per day)
involved with data entry and word processing will be eligible for the keyboard
trials.  These subjects will be asked to undergo a physical examination of the
neck and the upper extremities, which is commonly performed as part of the
medical evaluation.  Individuals with positive signs for CTS and/or tendinitis,
who then usually undergo the standard Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) testing,
will be asked to also simultaneously participate in the vibrometry testing.  A
medical questionnaire will be administered to identify various causes of CTS
and/or tendinitis.  CTS subjects will be randomized into 3 different groups
where they will be assigned to use different keyboards for a six month trial
period.  Selected subjects will be asked to participate in a laboratory based
experiment to measure their wrist deviation patterns using a video analysis
system.  They will be asked to type from a pangrammic text. Standard clinical
care will be given regardless of selection into the study.   We expect to study
approximately 50 subjects over the next year.

The objective of this project was to provide a community service to  medical
doctors in assisting cytogenetic evaluations.   Here, chromosome painting would
be used to find resolution to cytogenetics questions raised by cytogenetics
laboratories as to the chromosomal origin of small pieces of chromosomal
material found in the metaphase.
<P>
Methodology:  Metaphase slides prepared from a few (less than 5) blood samples
taken at other institutions were to be sent to LLNL for chromosome painting.
<P>
Principal Investigator claims no activity in FY 1995.  IRB protocol approval was
abandoned and the project was never used.  Project was officially closed upon
its expiration date of 5/19/95.

STUDY AIM/PURPOSE:
<P>
The purpose of this study is to see whether the "soluble" antigens of an
enteroviral autologous melanoma lysate, when injected into metastatic melanoma
and followed by cyclophosphamide, will produce a remission in the treated
metastatic lesions.
<P>
BACKGROUND:
<P>
There is extensive evidence in immunology that a normal suppressor branch of the
system exists to limit the magnitude and duration of immune responses.  It is
postulated that "melanoma vaccines" fail because the host is tolerized to
melanoma antigens.
<P>
In the past we have studied the effects of injection of a murine tumor lysate
prepared in tissue culture by infection with a murine enterovirus. This was
followed by the administration of cyclophosphamide.  Both allogeneic and
autologous mammary tumors in mice were studied.  Ninety percent of the
transplanted tumors were cured and significant remissions were obtained in 50%
of the spontaneous tumors. Since the "vaccine" was filtered through a 50 nm
Millipore filter and contained "soluble antigens" without aggregates and the
cyclophosphamide was given AFTER the antigen, the mechanism of action is thought
to be reversal of immune suppression. We believe that the cells involved with in
vivo immune suppression were stimulated to divide and were then destroyed with
cyclophosphamide.
<P>
FY'95 STUDIES:
<P>
In FY'95 we have studied 6 patients with metastatic melanoma to evaluate whether
or not the murine experiments can be repeated in man.  Melanoma tissue cultures
have been established from these patients.  We have demonstrated that human
melanoma cells in culture can be infected and lysed with the enterovirus,
poliovirus 1 (Sabin).
<P>
In 2 of the studied patients it has been possible to generate in vitro a
cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte response against their autologous melanoma cells
using peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cr51 microcytotoxicity assays were used to
make these determinations.   We have demonstrated in these 2 patients that a
melanoma lysate prepared with poliovirus 1 (Sabin) and filtered through a 50 nm
Millipore filter is immunosuppressive and prevents the in vitro generation of a
cytotoxic response.  Thus we are now ready to repeat the animal experiments in
man.  This will be done in FY'96.
<P>
PLANNED FY'96 STUDIES:
<P>
PATIENT ELIGIBILITY:  The patients must have multiple cutaneous or subcutaneous
melanoma metastases.  The patient must be immunologically competent.
<P>
TREATMENT PLAN:  Several of the multiple metastatic lesions will be removed
surgically.  The pathology and character of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
will be described.  Melanoma cell tissue cultures will be established and the
poliovirus lysate will be generated.
<P>
Several of the patient's remaining metastases will be injected with the
autologous poliovirus lysate followed in 24 hours with a single dose of
cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/M2.  Changes in the treated tumors will be followed
clinically.  Any evidence of tumor regression will be recorded.
<P>
In addition some of the treated lesions will be removed surgically for
evaluation and for comparison with pre-treatment biopsy data.  The number and
nature of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes will be evaluated. The secretion of
Interleukin-10 will be measured using RT-PCR methodologies.
<P>
If any evidence of a cytotoxic T-cell response in the treated tumors can be
demonstrated, it is anticipated that such reversal of immune suppression will
aid in the immunotherapy of metastatic melanoma with various tumor vaccines.

Objectives: The ultimate objective of this research is to develop and
experimentally validate algorithms which predict the absorbed dose following
topical application or dermal exposure to chemical substances of therapeutic and
toxicological interest.  The initial objectives of the experiments are: (a) To
measure, in vivo in man, the cutaneous uptake of a series of substituted phenols
following exposure to the skin.  (b) To quantify uptake by application of the
chemical 'spiked' with a very small amount of 14C (~nCi) and assessing the mass
entering the stratum corneum via repeated adhesive tape-stripping and analysis
of the strips for 14C.  (c) To alternatively quantify uptake by selecting phenol
derivatives of unique infrared (IR) spectroscopic characteristics and using
attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)
to again determine the quantity of chemical taken up into the stratum corneum
(once more, using the adhesive tape-stripping routine).  (d) To correlate the
results from the two methods and to demonstrate that they may be used
interchangeably.  (e) To compare the experimentally determined levels of
chemical within the stratum corneum at the end of the exposure period with those
amounts predicted by dermal uptake models.      
<P>
Methodology: Radiochemical Methodology: Aqueous solutions of the penetrants,
'spiked' with a very low level of 14C-radiolabel (~10 nCi) will be applied,
under occlusion, to the ventral forearms of the human volunteers.
Administration will involve saturation of a gauze pad (area = 20 cm2) with
approximately 1 mL of solution.  After application, the delivery system will be
covered with an adhesive, occlusive dressing and left in place for a defined
period of time, not to exceed 3 hours.  At the end of the exposure time, the
gauze is removed and the skin surface is carefully dried with cotton Q-tips.
Delivery system and Q-tips will be reserved for analysis.  After 10 minutes,
sequential layers of stratum corneum at the application site will be removed
using preweighed pieces of adhesive tape in the standard way.  Up to a maximum
of 20 tape-strips will be removed (this is sufficient to excise the entire
stratum corneum in most individuals).   The tape-strips will then be extracted
in methanol and taken to the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS) for
analysis of 14C.  Background levels will be assessed from tape-strips removed
from the contralateral, untreated forearm skin.  In this way, the concentration
profile of chemical across the stratum corneum, and the absolute amount taken up
into the membrane during the exposure period will be evaluated.
<P>
ATR-FTIR Technique:   ATR-FTIR is used to obtain spectral measurements of the
phenols in the skin of the human volunteers.  Prior to administration, a
pretreatment spectrum of each subject's stratum corneum will be recorded with
ATR-FTIR.  After exposure, sequential tape-stripping and spectroscopy will be
performed, thereby providing an alternative assay of the distribution of
chemical as a function of depth into the stratum corneum (weight of the
tape-strips again being used as a marker for position within the membrane).
Therefore, the 14C and IR determinations will be performed at the same time;
that is, the applied solution of chemical will be both "spiked" with
radioactivity and with a spectroscopic marker.  Assay of uptake by CAMS can be
utilized, then, as a further calibration of the spectroscopic measurements.
<P>
Radioactive and Chemical Substances: The chemicals chosen for the  study are a
series of phenol derivatives, which are commercially available both
14C-radiolabelled and (separately) with significant deuteration [with the
exception of cyanophenol, which possesses an inherently unique IR absorbance via
the -C(N) functionality].  Chemical doses are from 10-50 mg/mL.  Radioactive
doses are 10 nCi/mL.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  Human subjects  have an occlusive patch (2 X 9
cm) moistened with a 1-ml chemical solution (10-50 mg/ml) applied to their
forearm for periods up to 3 hours.  The application site is then serially
tape-stripped and analyzed for chemical penetration with ATR-FTIR.
Approximately 10 mg of outer skin tissue is removed from each human subject.
Little if no physical risk is posed to the human subject by this procedure.
Dose estimates for the application site and whole body are 0.134 rad/cm2 and
0.0075 mr.

Objectives
<P>
        We seek to develop novel methodologies for measuring human calcium (Ca)
kinetics. The development at LLNL of technology capable of measuring the very
long lived isotope of calcium, 41Ca (105 year halflife), at environmental
levels, enables this isotope to be added to the cannon of calcium isotopic
tracers. 41Ca tracer might be employed where others are precluded for
radiological, physiological and/or economic reasons, thus permitting unique
long-term studies of resorbing labeled bone and so-called continuous feeding
studies. Here, for the first time anywhere, we demonstrate the feasibility of
the continuous feeding approach with 41Ca.
<P>
<P>
Methodology
<P>
        The concentration of 41Ca in feces and urine obtained during and up to 6 months
after 15 days of consumption of 41Ca labeled orange juice with each meal was
measured to permit the calculation of various parameters of calcium metabolism.
In addition, supporting data and data for comparison were obtained by performing
a conventional stable isotope test  beginning on the 10th day of 41Ca
consumption. On that day the test involved the administration of stable calcium
isotopes IV and PO and blood draws. Excreta samples obtained that day and
subsequently were also measured for the stable isotopic tracers. After
appropriate preparation, the blood and excreta tracer isotope concentrations
were determined by mass spectrometry. Some feces were also measured for total
calcium and PEG marker concentrations.
<P>
Radioactive and Chemical Substances
<P>
        Over the course of 15 days the single subject ingested a total of 34 nCi of
41Ca @ 10-6 of total calcium in the form of the carbonate dissolved in orange
juice and 2.5 g/day polyethylene glycol as a fecal marker. 9.7 mg of 42Ca and
8.7 mg of 44Ca was administered IV and PO, respectively, having first been
tested for sterility and pyrogenicity.
<P>
Human Subject Involvement
<P>
        The subject provided urine and fecal samples and blood draws totaling 50 mL.
Excreta collections were spot collections except for a one day complete urine
collection and a 5-day complete fecal collection both beginning on the day of
the stable isotope test.
<P>
        The risks to the subject are those associated with the lifetime radiation dose
from the subsequent decay of 41Ca absorbed by bone. The original pre-experiment
dosimetry allowed for the ingestion of 40 nCi 41Ca of which roughly 10 nCi were
to be taken up. About 40% of this was to be incorporated into the stable bone.
It was anticipated that the remainder of the radiocalcium would be quickly
excreted from the body and would therefore not contribute to the subsequent
dose. The radiations as a consequence of decaying 41Ca have such short ranges
that essentially only target organs receive a radiation dose (approx.
&#194;Df=0.0059 g&#183;rad/mCi&#183;hr).  Assuming that the biological halflife
of the stable bone component (and therefore the effective radionuclide halflife)
is 50 years, and that the subject's survival following administration is 30
years, the anticipated cumulated radioactivity was 633 mCi&#183;hr and the total
average dose to the standard man 4 kg cortical bone was calculated to be 1 mrad
or 0.03 mrem/yr. For comparison, background radiation is approximately a factor
of 7000 greater. The essentially negligible dose can also be expressed in terms
of cancer risk: the relative risk of a 1 mrad dose to bone is a 0.001% increase
and the equivalent absolute risk is about 3 cancer cases per year per 10 billion
subjects. (The subject has previously been made surgically menopausal and
therefore there is no risk of a radiation dose to any fetus.) However, in
practice only 34 nCi 41Ca were consumed of which an estimated 9% was absorbed
into the body. Furthermore, as dietary Ca was about 1000 mg/day and bone calcium
absorption was measured to be less than 10 mg/day, compared to resorption of
about 100 mg/d, less 41Ca will have been incorporated into long term bone than
the original pre-experiment dosimetry had supposed. Consequently, the radiation
dose and attendant risks had previously been overestimated.

The aim of this study is to determine if two well-characterized mutagens that
are present in the human diet are metabolized similarly in humans and rodents.
This comparison is very important for determining if these compounds contribute
to the incidence of colon cancer in the western world since rodents have been
used to assess the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds.  This
comparison will help establish how the rodents used in cancer studies compare to
the human response and will thus increase the confidence in the human risk
assessments made using animals models.  This study is a collaboration between
LLNL, Dr. S Leveson (York District Hospital, UK) and Dr. C. Garner (University
of York, UK).
<P>
Human subjects will be given low amounts of 14C-MeIQx and PhIP
((2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline) and
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, respectively; 0.592 MBq/person)
that are naturally present in food.  The human subjects (a total of 10
individuals ages 40 - 70) will be patients at the York District Hospital
(Wigginton Road, York UK) with previously established colorectal cancer and who
are to undergo surgery to remove the tumors.  The samples we will use are colon
tissue samples removed during surgery and blood drawn prior to surgery.
Administration of the compounds, blood collection and surgery will be supervised
and carried out at the York District Hospital by Dr. S Leveson.  DNA will be
isolated in the laboratory of Dr. C Garner University of York (Heslington,
York).  Only the purified DNA will be handled and analyzed at LLNL.
<P>
Briefly,  human subjects who are colon cancer patients at the York District
Hospital, after being fully informed as to the nature of the study and after
giving consent to participate, will be administered either [14C]-PhIP or
[14C]-MeIQx in a gelatin capsule, per os, (2 - 6 g/kg; maximum activity 0.592
MBq/person) 6 hours prior to surgery.  One hour prior to surgery, blood will be
drawn (50 mls by vein puncture) to determine the circulating levels of PhIP or
MeIQx.  Colon tissue removed during surgery will be placed on dry ice and
immediately frozen.  The location and amount of tissue removed will be
determined by the surgeon but will principally be tumor tissue.  The frozen
tissue will be homogenized and the DNA will be extracted using phenol:chloform
followed by anion exchange chromatography at the University of York.  The
purified DNA will be sent to LLNL and analyzed for 14C-content by accelerator
mass spectrometry(AMS).  Likewise, blood removed 1 hour prior to surgery will be
dried and sent to LLNL for analysis of 14C content by AMS.  The levels of 14C
will then be used to calculate the amount of PhIP or MeIQx covalently bound to
the DNA of the colon or present in the blood.  The activity of 14C given to the
participants will be 3 x 10-3 mSv,  approximately 20-times lower than a chest
x-ray .  Further, the chemical dose will be approximately equivalent to what a
human receives from consumption of 1 - 10 hamburgers (2 - 6 g/kg body weight).
The human subjects will undergo the surgery whether or not they participate in
this study.

A.  Objectives
<P>
This research primarily focuses on hardware development of a new class of
biomedical sensor-micropower impulse radar (MIR).  MIR shows extremely good
promise as a heart muscle motion sensor that can be used with ECG equipment to
provide, for the first time, an easily obtainable stimulus-response pair.
Cardiologists have indicated that this information would save thousands of lives
yearly, particularly for cardiac arrest victims.  Additional studies on
respiration sensing may lead to a low-cost SIDS detector for home use.
<P>
Our work with MIR includes testing a novel, stealthy burglar alarm, and testing
a computerized speech recognition system based on direct sensing of vocal cord
vibrations with MIR.
<P>
B.  Methodology
<P>
The methodology to date has been non-existent since all activities and subjects
involve the Principal Investigator (PI) and immediate staff of professionals
experimenting on themselves for the sole purpose of improving the hardware.  A
defined methodology may be implemented next year as work progresses from
hardware development to structured data taken on subjects.
<P>
C.  Ionizing radiation, radioactive sources, and chemicals:  NONE
<P>
D.  Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
1.  The procedure involves holding a small plastic box containing a MIR near, or
in contact to one's fully clothed body, such as over the heart or Adams Apple,
and adjusting the equipment or recording electronic waveforms for computer
processing.  At this stage subject identification is not required or used.
<P>
2.  Tests by LLNL Hazards group show that the non-ionizing microwave radiation
from MIR is more than 1000 times lower than US IEEE standards for continuous
exposure of microwave radiation to a general population.  There are no risks,
even in the most extreme equipment malfunction scenario.

The objectives of this work are to quantify the frequency of cytogenetic damage
in healthy, unexposed people of various ages, and to relate this damage to
different genetic polymorphisms and lifestyle factors obtained by a
questionnaire.  The subjects' involvement is limited to phlebotomy (less than 30
ml total volume), followed by routine tissue culture of the blood to obtain
metaphase chromosomes and binucleated cells from the peripheral lymphocytes.  In
addition, a portion of each blood sample will be used to obtain DNA for analysis
of genetic polymorphisms.  Subjects also complete a questionnaire inquiring
about lifestyle factors that may be useful for interpreting the results of our
validation and quality control analyses.  No ionizing radiation or chemicals are
administered to these people as part of this project.  The risks to the subjects
are those associated with venipuncture, and include temporary pain, bruising
and/or soreness of the affected tissue or surrounding tissue,  formation of scar
tissue, infection, and fainting.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased exposure to
vegetables of the Crucifera family(cauliflower,broccoli and cabbage) results in
measurable improvements in factors which can affect carcinogenesis in man,
including the adduct induction of bile, mutagenicity of the urine and bile, and
prevention of the formation of DNA adducts.  Epidemiological studies have shown
a strong association between consumption of vegetables of the Crucifera family
and a reduced risk of cancer.  Animal studies have also suggested that these
vegetables may be protective where cancer is concerned.  Understanding if these
vegetables are effective preventative agents for colon cancer and how best to
consume these vegetables is critical to making recommendation on the use of the
diet in cancer prevention.  This study will specifically attempt to determine if
a set of Crucifera vegetables can influence measurable biomarkers that are used
to judge colon cancer risk in humans and thus will help determine if this set of
vegetables are the agents responsible for the protective effect noted in other
studies.  This study is a collaboration between Lenore Kohlmeier, Ph.D.
(University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Robert Sandler, M.D., M.P.H., John
Worzelmann, M.D, Dr. Jane Gallager (US Environmental Protection Agency), and Dr.
K. Turteltaub (LLNL).  LLNL's involvement in this study will be solely in the
analysis of DNA adducts present in the colon tissue samples.  Briefly, human
subjects (5 non-smoking males and 5 non-smoking females) 45 - 65 years of age
and free of thyroid function disorders, will be given isocaloric diets
reflecting the energy composition of the normal diet.  Five subjects (the
treated group) will be given 500 g Crucifera vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli,
and cabbage) added in fresh and cooked forms to the standard diet.  The other
five subjects will receive only the control diets.  Blood, urine, bile, stool
and rectal biopsy tissues will be collected during a physical examination and a
one night stay in the hospital will be required.  Tissue samples will be
collected by the physician; they will be frozen and sent to LLNL for analysis.
DNA will be purified using standard extraction protocols involving phenol
extraction and adduct analysis will be carried out using 32P-postlabeling.

The objectives of this work are to:  (1) validate the measured radiation doses
experienced by radiologic technologists; (2) provide an evaluation of the
possible range of exposures experienced by this well-characterized cohort of
143,000 radiological technologists; and (3) provide guidance on estimating
radiation doses for pioneering technologists in the 1920s through 1940s for whom
dosimeter measurements are not available.  Each subject provides a sample of
peripheral blood (~3 ml) which is cultured to obtain metaphase cells for
cytogenetic analysis.   The subjects received occupational exposure to X-rays,
but do not receive any radiation or chemical exposure as part of this study. The
risks to the subjects are those associated with venipuncture, and include
temporary pain, bruising and/or soreness of the affected tissue or surrounding
tissue, formation of scar tissue, infection, and fainting.

This project was canceled soon after receiving full IRB approval. No human
samples were obtained.  Our initial goal was to obtain peripheral blood samples
from Russian citizens visiting the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
These individuals would have served as controls for our Chernobyl Program
Project (Dr. Ron Jensen, P.I.), which was experiencing difficulty obtaining
suitable controls from Russia.  Peripheral blood would have been drawn for
analysis of background (i.e., control) levels of genetic damage, including
chromosome aberrations, HPRT mutations, and variants at the glycophorin A locus.
No ionizing radiation or chemicals would have been administered to these people
as part of this project.  Shortly after IRB approval was granted, we began
receiving suitable control samples from Russia, and the need for this project no
longer existed.

Objectives
<P>
        We seek to develop novel methodologies for measuring human calcium (Ca)
kinetics. The development at LLNL of technology capable of measuring the very
long lived isotope of calcium, 41Ca (105 year halflife), at environmental
levels, enables this isotope to be added to the canon of calcium isotopic
tracers. 41Ca tracer might be employed where others are precluded for
radiological, physiological and/or economic reasons, thus permitting unique long
term studies of resorbing labeled bone and so-called continuous feeding studies.
Here, having previously demonstrated the feasibility of the continuous feeding
approach, we attempt to do so again with a second subject in order to obtain
further data.
<P>
<P>
Methodology
<P>
        The concentration of 41Ca in feces and urine obtained before, during and up to
6 months after 15 days of consumption of 41Ca-labeled orange juice with each
meal will be measured to permit the calculation of various parameters of calcium
metabolism. In addition, supporting data and data for comparison will be
obtained by performing a conventional stable isotope test  beginning on the 10th
day of 41Ca consumption. That day the test will involve the administration of
stable calcium isotopes IV and PO and blood draws. Excreta samples obtained that
day and subsequently will also be measured for the stable isotopic tracers.
After appropriate preparation, the blood and excreta tracer isotope
concentrations will be determined by mass spectrometry.
<P>
<P>
Radioactive and Chemical Substances
<P>
        The single subject will ingest a total of 40 nCi 41Ca @ 10-6 of total calcium
in the form of the carbonate dissolved in orange juice. 2 g/kg 46Ca and 0.5
mg/kg 44Ca will be administered IV and PO, respectively, having first been
tested for sterility and pyrogenicity.
<P>
<P>
Human Subject Involvement
<P>
        The subject will provide urine, fecal and nine 3-mL blood samples. Excreta
collections will be spot collections except for a 3-day complete urine
collection and week-long complete fecal collection beginning on the day of the
stable isotope test.
<P>
        The risks to the subject are those associated with the lifetime radiation dose
from the subsequent decay of 41Ca absorbed by bone. 40 nCi 41Ca will be ingested
of which roughly 10 nCi will be taken up. About 40% of this will be incorporated
into the stable bone. The remainder of the radiocalcium will be quickly excreted
from the body and is assumed not to contribute to the dose. The radiations as a
consequence of decaying 41Ca have such short ranges that essentially only the
target organs receive a radiation dose (approx. &#194;Df=0.0059
g&#183;rad/mCi&#183;hr).  Assuming that the biological halflife of the stable
bone component (and therefore the effective radionuclide halflife) is 50 years,
and that the subject survival post administration is 30 years, the cumulated
radioactivity will be 633 (mCi) (hr) and the total average dose to the standard
man 4 kg cortical bone mass will be 1 mrad or 0.03 mrem/year. For comparison,
background radiation is approximately a factor of 7000 greater. The essentially
negligible dose can also be expressed in terms of cancer risk: the relative risk
of a 1 mrad dose to bone is a 0.001% increase and the equivalent absolute risk
is about 3 cancer cases per year per 10 billion subjects. (The subject has
previously been made surgically menopausal and therefore there is no risk of a
radiation dose to any fetus.)

A.      Objectives: Our primary objective is to gain an understanding of the genetic
and biochemical bases of the genetic disorders resulting from defects in the DNA
repair and transcription factor gene ERCC2 (trichothiodystrophy and xeroderma
pigmentosum group D) and why one disorder is cancer-prone and the other is not.
To achieve this objective, cells from trichothiodystrophy and xeroderma
pigmentosum group D patients and family members are used for genetic analysis of
the mutations in the ERCC2 gene and in studies of the DNA repair characteristics
of the cells. The data generated provide information that is useful both to our
research (greater numbers of patients increase our ability to identify commonly
occurring mutations and to correlate specific alterations in the protein with
the specific clinical presentation) and to the clinicians and families
(confirmation of diagnosis, information on degree of photosensitivity of the
cells, knowledge of specific mutations in that family useful for future prenatal
diagnosis).
<P>
B.      Methodology: We receive cultures of archived material established in other
laboratories (either clinical or research) along with case histories. We request
that no identifying information be provided to us. Patient confidentiality is
ensured by blacking out any identifying information received and, whenever
possible, duplicating the item and destroying the original. Once received in our
laboratory, a code designation is assigned (disorder name, number, and 2-letter
city abbreviation) and the samples are both grown for experimental use (e.g.,
survival curves, mutation analysis) and frozen for future studies. All
experimental notes and materials use only the code designation. The code
database (showing clinician names, their sample identification, and our
corresponding code designations), patient photographs, and any original
documents with blacked out identifying information that must be maintained are
kept in a locked file. Experimental results are then provided to the clinician
and are published. Publications typically include case histories (sometimes
referencing an already published case history) as well as experimental data. In
some cases, recognizable photographs may be included. In such cases, the
clinicians are co-authors and obtain consent for publication from the parents,
legal guardian, or patient, as appropriate to each case (the patients are
typically minors).
<P>
C.      Human subjects are not exposed to any chemical or radioactive substances or
ionizing radiation under this project.
<P>
D. Involvement of human subjects<BR>
        1.      Archived cell cultures from trichothiodystrophy and xeroderma pigmentosum
group D patients and family members are used for UV-survival studies, DNA repair
assays, and preparation of RNA and DNA samples for genetic analysis of the
mutations in the ERCC2 gene. No cell samples are collected specifically for this
project.<BR>
        2.      Since only archival materials are used, the only risks to which human
subjects are exposed under this project involve loss of privacy. Steps for
ensuring confidentiality are outlined in B above.<BR>

The objectives of this work are to understand the human susceptibility to the
cooked food containing carcinogenic heterocyclic amines.  Individuals will eat
normally cooked meat products, primarily chicken, and their urine will be
collected over a 10 hour time period.  Subjects will be exposed to food.
Unfortunately, cooked food contains 1-500 ppb of very potent carcinogens and the
subjects will be exposed up to 200 ug of compounds similar to PhIP
(2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) at a single meal.  Individuals
will undergo the risk of eating carcinogens, but no more than they do if they
are not vegetarians.

The objectives of this work are to determine whether the use of a fungicide
known as EBDC (ethylene-bisdithiocarbamate) is associated with genetic damage in
people.   Two cytogenetic assays are performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes
obtained from these people: sister chromatid exchanges, and translocations by
chromosome painting.  The assays complement each other, and should allow us to
determine whether EBDC is genotoxic in humans.  An aliquot of the blood is also
sent to a local hospital where levels of the thyroid hormones T3, T4, and TSH
are measured. The levels of these hormones are important because EBDC is
metabolized to ethylene thiourea, which causes thyroid and liver cancer in
animals.  The data may be used by NIOSH to make regulatory decisions concerning
the use of EBDC in this country.  Although the subjects may have been
occupationally exposed to EBDC, no ionizing radiation or chemicals are
administered to these people as part of this project.  The risks to the subjects
are those associated with venipuncture, and include temporary pain, bruising
and/or soreness of the affected tissue or surrounding tissue,  formation of scar
tissue, infection, and fainting.

Overview:
<P>
       This study measures various risk factors in pianists for overuse
injuries, also known as repetitive strain injuries (RSI's) or cumulative trauma
disorders (CTD's).  For the study, subjects will fill out a questionnaire,  and
then various measurements relevant to their piano playing will be made as
described later.  The measurements are not expected to cause any discomfort at
all and are essentially risk-free.
<P>
Context:
<P>
        Cumulative trauma disorders are the number one specific occupational health and
safety problem in the United States, according to National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  The incidence of occupational CTD's has
reached epidemic proportions, currently accounting for over 60% of all reported
industrial injuries.  CTD's affect workers in a broad range of industries,
affecting unskilled laborers and highly-trained professionals alike.
<P>
        The rapid increase in computer use in the workplace has resulted in an equally
rapid increase in the number of CTD cases resulting from their use, and computer
use is expected to continue to grow at an exponential rate.  Projections predict
a veritable epidemic of computer-related CTD's by the year 2000 unless
preventive measures are implemented.  Few of the currently available preventive
approaches have been well-documented.
<P>
        The current study evaluates the Taubman Approach to piano technique, which in
terms of its approach to CTD's is effectively a movement retraining approach.
Dorothy Taubman is a distinguished New York piano teacher whose approach to
teaching piano keyboard technique seems consonant with currently accepted
physiologic, ergonomic, and biomechanical principles.  Mrs. Taubman developed
her approach in order to help pianists play with more virtuosity by developing a
coordinate technique; however, it became evident that a coordinate technique
also can prevent or lead to reversal of injury.  Not surprisingly, therefore,
Mrs. Taubman and her faculty enjoy international reputations within musical
circles for being able to help injured musicians, the majority of whom suffer
from playing-induced CTD's.
<P>
        While CTD among musicians is in itself a matter of significance, this study is
undertaken primarily because of (a) the applicability of the biomechanics of
piano keyboard technique to computer keyboard technique, and (b) the
instrumentation available for force and impulse measurement in the piano, which
does not yet exist for computer keyboards. Documentation of the efficacy of the
Taubman Approach could represent a major breakthrough in the as yet unsuccessful
effort to lower the incidence of CTD.
<P>
<P>
Data Collection Techniques:
<P>
 a.     QUESTIONNAIRE  and EXAMINATION<BR>
All subjects will fill out a questionnaire in order to obtain demographic data,
to determine the subjects' Taubman experience, and to determine any history of
injury.  At his discretion, Dr. William A. Pereira, the Principal Investigator,
may perform a limited and directed physical examination to determine if there
are any signs of overuse injury.
<P>
<P>
b.      TAPE MEASUREMENT<BR>
Various standard bodily measurements will be made with a tape measure.  After
adjusting  and positioning a height-adjustable piano bench in front of the grand
piano, the height of the seat and of the subjects'  elbows above the floor will
be measured.
<P>
c.      PLAYING MEASUREMENTS<BR>
All subjects will play pre-distributed musical passages while being
simultaneously recorded in the following four ways:
<P>
        i.      MIDI<BR>
Subjects will be playing a Yamaha Disklavier&#174;, a full-sized grand piano
that has been equipped to electronically record (and play back) piano
performances.  MIDI is an acronym meaning Musical Instrument Digital Interface,
and the  Disklavier&#174; supports this recording and playback language.
<P>
        ii.     Dual Video Recording<BR>
Subjects will be videotaped from two angles, from above and from the right side.
<P>
        iii.  Wrist Angle Measurements<BR>
Subjects will have the angles of their wrist joints (flexion, extension, radial
deviation, ulnar deviation) recorded electronically, using the Greenleaf
WristSystem&#174;.  The subject wears a special glove onto which electronic
sensors are attached that do the recording.
<P>
        iv.     Electromyography (EMG) <BR>
Subjects will have the electrical activity of their forearm (flexors and
extensors) and shoulder (trapezius) muscles measured using a BioPac&#174;
surface electromyograph.  Disposable electrodes will be placed on the forearms
and shoulders.  Similar to EKG (electrocardiogram) recordings, the subject feels
nothing during the recording process.
<P>
Confidentiality:
<P>
        Subjects will be assigned numbers and the data obtained will be encoded.
Subjects' names will not be disclosed to anyone outside the research project,
and any publications arising from this study will be made without specific
references to subjects' names.

        Jet lag is a major problem affecting overseas travelers.  It is caused by a
disruption of the body's natural sleep-wake cycles.  A similar problem affects
shift work employees in DOE defense and civilian programs and private industry.
Properly timed exposure to bright light can prevent or ameliorate jet lag by
rapidly resetting the body clock.  The purpose of this project is to evaluate
the ergonomics/human factors interface of the Light Exposure Calculator.  This
product tells the traveler who crosses time zones at what times to seek exposure
to either light or darkness in order to combat jet lag.
<P>
        The research objectives include discovering users' reactions to the product,
how well users interface with the calculator, what obstacles prevent its correct
use, and how to help the manufacturer address these concerns.
<P>
        The evaluation will be carried out by providing a small sample of travelers
from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Health Services Travel Clinic with the
Light Exposure Calculator and with a questionnaire about their usage.
Researchers with the Ergonomics Research Program will report the results to
Synchrony, documenting findings.  The knowledge gained from this project will
help to enhance productivity among DOE-Defense Program employees involved with
business travel or shift work.

The goal of this project is to develop and validate improved procedures for
assessment of radiation-induced genetic damage.  These studies may lead to
procedures for a more accurate assessment of exposure in accidentally or
occupationally exposed individuals (a) to guide medical treatment or to
establish improved correlation between exposure and untoward medical
consequences, (b) to improve our understanding of the genetic consequences of
exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation and (c) to increase the sensitivity
with which low levels of radiation exposure can be assessed.  An essential
requirement for the use of biomarkers in exposure assessment and dosimetry is
quantification of the parameters that drive the overall uncertainty.  In the
simplest case (i.e., under conditions where aD defines the dose-response
relationship),  only three parameters must be known for biodosimetric
reconstruction of radiation dose to an individual: (1) the measured frequency in
the individual (Yi), (2) the background frequency (Yb), and (3) the slope (a) of
the calibration curve (Eqn. 1).  Under such conditions, uncertainties in these
three parameters will determine the overall uncertainty in the dose estimate.
<P>
                D       =       (Yi - Yb) / a                                                   (1)
<P>
We have already measured "a" for some radiations.  We are now measuring the Yb
in equation (1) for unexposed people.
<P>
Methodology:  Peripheral blood samples (~5ml) will be taken from volunteers or
during routine medical examination, cultured, and the lymphocytes spread onto
glass slides for analysis of chromosome aberration frequencies.  The principal
method for measuring chromosome aberrations will involve chromosome painting
technology.

Archived slides containing spreads of fixed human lymphocytes from 40
individuals exposed to Benzene will be sent to LLNL for chromosomal
translocation analysis using FISH.
<P>
The objectives of this project are:   (1) To determine the feasibility of
performing FISH on these archived materials and (2) to support the epidemiology
studies conducted by NIH on these individuals.  If (1) is successful, it will
facilitate retrospective dosimetry of chemical exposure to individuals where
slides have been prepared in the distant past.  These results can be directly
compared to cancer rates of those individuals from NIH epidemiology studies.  If
(2) is successful, NIH will be able to obtain biological doses to support their
on-going epidemiology studies.
<P>
Methodology:  (1) Archived slides containing metaphase spreads of fixed human
lymphocytes obtained from 40 individuals will be evaluated to determine if FISH
can be successfully performed on any of them.   FISH will be applied to the
slides using established standard protocol.  (2)  If FISH is successful, those
slides will then be subjected to translocation analysis using chromosome
painting to compare benzene exposure with chromosome translocation frequencies.
(3)  The procedure will then be given to NIH which will use it to measure
translocation frequencies in support of on-going epidemiology (past benzene
exposure) studies.
<P>
No human subjects are currently involved.  All materials are archived slides of
human metaphase spreads.

Objectives
<P>
        We seek to develop novel methodologies for measuring human calcium kinetics.
The development at LLNL of technology capable of measuring the very long lived
isotope of calcium, 41Ca (105 year halflife), at environmental levels, enables
this isotope to be added to the cannon of calcium isotopic tracers. 41Ca tracer
might be employed where others are precluded for radiological, physiological
and/or economic reasons, thus permitting unique long-term studies of resorbing
labeled bone and so-called continuous feeding studies. Here, having previously
demonstrated the feasibility of the continuous feeding approach, we seek to test
the utility of the approach by adding continuous feeding protocols to an
existing experiment at Creighton University - Raloxifene Effects on Bone
Remodeling Kinetics - that includes independent monitoring of the subjects'
calcium kinematics.
<P>
<P>
Methodology
<P>
        The concentration of 41Ca in feces and urine obtained before, during and 6
months after 15 days of consumption of 41Ca labeled orange juice with each meal
will be measured to permit the calculation of various parameters of calcium
metabolism. These will be compared with data generated by the raloxifene study.
<P>
<P>
Radioactive and Chemical Substances
<P>
        The 6 postmenopausal subjects will each ingest a total of 40 nCi 41Ca @ 10-6 of
total calcium in the form of the carbonate dissolved in orange juice.
<P>
<P>
Human Subject Involvement
<P>
        The subjects will provide no additional samples for this study. Instead, urine
and fecal samples generated for the raloxifene study will be also analyzed for
41Ca. These samples will be obtained during two 9-day stays in a metabolic ward
at Creighton University 6 months apart.
<P>
        The risks to the subjects are those associated with the lifetime radiation dose
from the subsequent decay of 41Ca absorbed by bone. 40 nCi 41Ca will be
ingested, of which roughly 10 nCi will be taken up. About 40% of this will be
incorporated into the stable bone. The remainder of the radiocalcium will be
quickly excreted from the body and is assumed to not contribute to the dose. The
radiations as a consequence of decaying 41Ca have such short ranges that
essentially only the target organs receive a radiation dose (approx.
&#194;Df=0.0059 g&#183;rad/mCi&#183;hr). Assuming that the biological halflife
of the stable bone component and therefore the effective radionuclide halflife
is 50 years, and that the subject survival post administration is 30 years, the
cumulated radioactivity will be 858 mCi&#183;hr and the total average dose to
the standard man 4 kg cortical bone mass will be 1.3 mrad or 0.04 mrem/yr. For
comparison, background radiation is approximately a factor of 5000 greater. The
essentially negligible dose can also be expressed in terms of cancer risk: The
relative risk of a 1.3 mrad dose to bone is a 0.0013% increase, and the
equivalent absolute risk is about 4 cancer cases per year per 10 billion
subjects.

        a.      Objective:
<P>
Micropower radar pulses will be directed at human subjects from behind walls and
other structures for the purpose of detecting and imaging the subjects and their
motion.  This type of radar imaging will provide the information necessary for
law enforcement or military personnel to ascertain the location and movement of
people in houses or buildings.  Safety of law enforcement personnel may depend
upon knowledge of a situation behind walls before surreptitious entry or hostage
rescue.  Such a device could be useful in these types of situations.  Initial
tests need to be performed to assess its capabilities.
<P>
        b.      Methodology:
<P>
1.  Define experiment and review with subject, and ascertain the exposure
levels.  These levels will depend on distance from the radar (no less than 10
cm).  Location of the experiments will vary in order to test different wall
types and thicknesses, but will be in areas where the radar complies with
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations.<BR>
2.  Explain that there is no direct benefit to the subject.<BR>
3.  Explain long-term benefit of experiment to subject: development of an
imaging array for military and law enforcement.<BR>
4.  Brief subject on proposed exposure levels, known safety standards and risks,
and source of expert information on exposure (see the consent form and
attachments).<BR>
5.  Inform subject of maximum possible exposure in the event of a worst case
equipment fault, and inform subject should a fault occur.  The worst-case fault
is described in the consent form.<BR>
6.  Inform subject that no special exertion is needed and that no discomfort
should occur.<BR>
7.  Obtain signed and dated consent form.<BR>
8.  Assign code to patient for data logging ID.<BR>
9.  Conduct experiment.  Generally, the experiment will involve placing the
subject on the opposite side of a wall from the radar, and using the detection
equipment to image his or her location and movement. <BR>
<P>
        c.      Ionizing Radiation, Radioactive Substances, or Chemical Substances:  None.
<P>
        d.      Involvement of human subjects:
<P>
Only the external dimensions of large objects (people) and their motion will be
scanned; imaging of internal body structure will not be performed in this
experiment.  Detection of cardio-pulmonary function will be attempted by
measurement of small external body motions.  In all cases, the radar transmitter
and receiver will not come in contact with the subject.  Tests will take place
at various locations/buildings on-site at LLNL.

Summary & Purpose:
<P>
        In three experiments to be conducted under this protocol, a single (1) human
subject will receive an extremely low total dose (&lt;250 nCi and &lt;1g)
involving two (2) 14C-radiolabeled chemicals (chloroform and trichloroethylene)
via dermal exposure to the forearm.  In each experiment, each of four
application sites will be sampled by a superficial shave biopsy that removes 1
to 5 mg (~2 mm2) of tissue from the outer skin layers.  The samples will be
analyzed for 14C-radiolabel uptake by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), a
highly sensitive technique allowing measurements of extremely small uptakes that
present a negligible health risk to the research subject.
<P>
        The project will provide critical human in vivo validation for a much larger
series of parallel data on dermal uptake of key environmental contaminants
(namely, certain chlorinated solvents and pesticides) to be obtained using an in
vitro method involving human cadaver skin.  These data are needed to accurately
assess human exposures to environmental chemicals through the dermal exposure
route.  The data obtained will be used to establish more detailed procedures to
be included in a future protocol applicable to nine additional subjects in a
second phase of AMS-based research on human dermal uptake of several
environmental pesticides via two additional dermal exposure media (soil and
household dust), which are of critical concern to the funding agency.
Chloroform and trichloroethylene were selected for use in Phase I because
results from these studies will be directly comparable to previous results we
have obtained using similar AMS and other procedures applied to skin in vitro
and hairless guinea pig skin in vivo.  In parallel with the experiments
involving a human subject under this protocol, we will be conducting similar
experiments using human cadaver skin in vitro (LLNL Protocol 94-118
[Certification of Exemption], Approved 19 Nov. 1994).  The present experiments
will allow the first direct comparisons of dermal uptake and its kinetics in
vivo using AMS methods applied to human skin tissue, thereby providing a firm
basis for extrapolating more easily obtained in vitro  AMS results applied to
human cadaver skin in setting safety standards for drinking water and hazardous
waste sites.  Such data cannot be obtained using only experimental animals, due
to (1) substantial interspecies variation in dermal permeability for chemicals
and (2) very limited data currently available upon which to base valid
animal-to-human extrapolations of in vivo dermal uptake of chemicals
specifically from soil, dust or water (the media of interest to the sponsoring
agency).
<P>
Potential Hazards:
<P>
        Each experiment will expose the volunteer to a total of 80 nCi plus &lt;1 g of
14C-radiolabeled test compound.  The subject will not be used for more than
three experiments, each separated by at least two weeks, and applications will
not be repeated at the same location on the subject.  The whole-body-equivalent
dose corresponding to the 3-experiment maximum 240-nCi exposure is estimated to
be approximately 0.5 mrem, or &lt;0.01% of the ~300-mrem U.S. average annual
exposure to ionizing radiation from natural background sources (National Council
on Radiation Protection (NCRP) and Measurements, 1987, Ionizing Radiation
Exposure of the Population of the United States, NCRP No. 93, NCRP, Washington,
DC).  The corresponding local dose to (a total of ~12 cm2 of) skin is estimated
to be &lt;500 mrem.  These experimental maximum doses correspond to upper-bound
estimates for total increased lifetime risks of 0.1 and 0.01 per million
respectively for cancer and for transmitting inherited disease.  Acute toxic
effects from the chemicals and doses to be used are not expected, and any
related cancer risk is considered to be negligible (all chemical doses to be
administered are below the corresponding acceptable daily intakes defined by
current, applicable California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
regulations (maximum applied doses = 0.35 micrograms/day for either compound,
for a total of 3 days separated by at least 2 weeks, which is &lt;10% of the
corresponding acceptable levels for daily intake over a lifetime).  In no case
will a particular application site on a subject be used if it exhibits any sign
of cut, abrasion, discoloration, or abnormality of any kind.

Air-supplied suits are used at Department of Energy facilities to protect
workers from radioactive materials that pose an inhalation and skin hazard.  All
air-supplied suits accepted for use at DOE facilities are subjected to testing
to determine the level of respiratory protection provided.  Testing to determine
whether aerosols will penetrate the suit and associated equipment is conducted
in a 16 cubic meter chamber.  A test atmosphere containing a di(2-ethylhexyl)
sebacate aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of approximately 0.5
micrometers and a concentration of 25 +/- 1.3 milligrams per cubic meter.  The
aerosol concentration is measured with a TSI Model 8587 laser photometer.
<P>
The subject will perform eight exercises: normal breathing, touching toes,
running in place, raising arms above the head, squatting, crawling, folding arms
across the chest, and torso twisting.
<P>
These exercises require approximately 15-20 minutes total per test.  Possible
risks include an exposure of the subject  to a 10% penetration of the test
aerosol into the suit.  There should be no health risks associated with a 10%
penetration.  The test is terminated at this level because a suit that leaks
that much is unacceptable.  Some persons who are sensitive to the sebacate may
experience mild skin irritation with prolonged contact to high concentrations.
The test subject may experience a feeling of claustrophobia.  Some test subjects
have reported a warm, clammy feeling within the suit. Physically, there are no
risks.
<P>
Tests are terminated upon test subject's request, operator's observation of
unacceptable test conditions (such as malfunction of the monitoring system, torn
suit, low pressure alarm from the self-contained breathing apparatus), or if the
penetration of the aerosol into the interior of the suit exceeds 10%.

The purpose of this project is to understand the biochemistry and physiology of
human red blood cells.  Blood used in this project (90-100 units) was purchased
from a local blood bank.  Experiments were conducted on isolated cells, and no
human subjects were directly involved.  Investigators at Los Alamos do not know
the identities of the blood donors.

Noninvasive neuromagnetic measures (along with electroencephalography (EEG)
readings in some cases) are recorded from the surface of the head with the goal
of identifying and characterizing multiple visual areas in the human brain.
Subjects view small stimuli on a TV screen while SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum
Interference Devices) record the magnetic fields evoked by the brain in response
to the stimuli.
<P>
Mathematical models are applied to these data with the goal of localizing each
of the neural generators in visual cortex which have contributed to the signals
at the surface of the head.  The locations of the sources, in head-centered
x,y,z coordinates, are located on the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
(anatomical brain images) to identify the cortical structures generating these
signals.  The long term goal of these studies is to map visual cortex, i.e., to
identify those regions which are processing color and medicating motion, as a
couple of examples.  There are no risks to the subjects.  Most of our subjects
are associated with the grant (i.e., PI, co-investigators, technicians, etc.).
<P>
These measures (magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography) are routinely
used in research and the clinic.  Magnetic resonance images are also acquired
for most of the subjects at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM.

OBJECTIVES:  The binding kinetics of fluorescent ligands to human neutrophils
and cell responses are studied by flow cytometry.
<P>
METHODOLOGY:  Neutrophils are isolated from freshly drawn anticoagulated human
blood.  The cells are isolated by centrifugation.  The cell preparations are
used in biochemical and biophysical characterization of the molecular pathways
of neutrophil activation.  Fresh blood is used because the properties of the
cells change dramatically if the cells age.
<P>
SUBSTANCES:  None.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF SUBJECTS:  Human subjects are volunteers.  An informed consent
document is read and signed by each donor.  The procedure involves routine
venipuncture of the arm and withdrawal of up to 50 milliliters (ml) of blood.
Risks are limited to minimal discomfort from drawing the blood sample.

Conducting this research in a safe environment prior to actual use or need is
necessary to assess the fit and protection these suits will afford personnel who
must wear them on jobs that often require them to enter environments where
hazardous materials are present.  Such research allows for a better
understanding of materials, suit construction, and design configurations of
suits that will afford the best protection for personnel.
<P>
For this test, a human subject will wear the suit in an atmosphere containing
di-(ethylhexyl) sebacate.  The penetration of the test agent into the interior
of the covering of the device will be measured with a TSI model 8587 laser
photometer as the subject carries out dexterity, simulated work exercise, and
standard exercise tests.
<P>
While wearing the suit and self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), the
subject will, in three test sessions, perform the following:  Dexterity tests
which include an eye test, reading, writing, manipulating small bolts and nuts,
and using a cylinder repair kit; simulated work tests, which include crawling,
sealing large drum containers, building a concrete-block wall, climbing a
ladder, and opening an overhead valve; and standard exercise tests which include
normal breathing, toe touching, flagging arms overhead, raising arms above the
head while looking upward, squatting, and crawling.
<P>
Risks include exposure of the subject to a 10 percent penetration of
di-(ethylhexyl) sebacate into the suit, which poses no health risk.  The test
subject may experience feelings of claustrophobia.  Some test subjects have
reported a warm, clammy feeling within the suit.  The tests are terminated upon
test subject's request, operator's observation of unacceptable test conditions
(such as malfunction of the monitoring system, torn suit, SCBA low  pressure
alarm, or if the penetration of the aerosol into the interior of the suit
exceeds 10 percent.  The test is terminated at this level because a suit that
leaks that much is unacceptable.

The objective of this research is to learn if people can be identified by video
images of their irises.  Conventional and custom pattern matching algorithms,
combined with standard statistical tests are used to determine whether people
can be identified by iris patterns.  The subject's eye is NOT touched because
the instrument (video camera) is located two feet away from the subject.
Standard video illumination is used.  No unusual illumination is used -- no
lasers, no ultraviolet (UV) light, no high intensity.  The situation is nearly
identical to camcorder video recording at home.  There are no known risks.  The
Bartas Iris Verification system is named for the French poet Signeur du Bartas
who first called the eyes the windows of the soul.

The objective of this study is to provide definitive verification of our
protocols for storing human blood by using in vivo measurements to quantify the
24-hour survival of red blood cells.  The Food and Drug Administration currently
requires that at least 75 percent of the transfused cells survive for at least
24 hours.
<P>
Blood donated by volunteers is stored using various protocols for varying
periods of time.  Before the blood is returned to the original donor through a
transfusion, the red blood cells are labeled with radioactive substances (51-Cr
and 99m-Tc), and excess radioactive materials are washed from the blood.
Several times during the first 24 hours following the transfusion, blood samples
are taken from the donor, and the survival rate of red blood cells is measured.
<P>
The radiation dose from this procedure will be about 10 millirems (much less
than a chest x-ray).  The procedure entails a measurable risk of bacterial
contamination, but this is virually eliminated by culturing the blood for
bacteria for several days before transfusion.  Blood is also tested for HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus) and for hepatitis B and C.
<P>
The risk of receiving the wrong blood is minimized through the use of careful
identification procedures and a limit on the number of transfusions to only one
a day.  In over 220 procedures, no bacterial or blood identification problems
have occurred.

IND 4041, Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Ca-DTPA) and IND
14603, Trisodium zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Zn-DTPA) are
investigational new drug  (IND)  applications which are administered by Oak
Ridge Associated Universities under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy,
Contract No. DE-AC05-76OR00033.  Both forms of DTPA have been widely used in the
U.S. and in Europe for many years as chelating agents  (agents that bind with
radioactive substances and are then excreted) following exposure to plutonium
and other heavy elements such as americium, californium, and curium.
<P>
Ca-DTPA is approximately 10 times more effective than Zn-DTPA for the initial
chelation of transuranic elements. Therefore, Ca-DTPA should be used whenever
larger body burdens of transuranics are involved.  Ca-DTPA is the drug of choice
for initial patient management of internal contamination with transuranic
elements unless contraindicated.  After approximately 24 hours, however, Zn-DTPA
is, for all practical purposes, as effective as Ca-DTPA.  This comparable
efficacy, coupled with its lesser toxicity, makes Zn-DTPA the preferred agent
for protracted therapy.  The effectiveness of chelation therapy is highly
dependent not only on the metal itself, but also on the chemical and physical
characteristics of the compound at the time of DTPA administration.  Because the
efficiency of chelation decreases with time, DTPA should be given within 6 hours
of exposure.
<P>
Personally identifiable bodily materials (blood and urine samples) are collected
to establish pre-treatment base-line levels (blood cell counts, blood and urine
nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinalysis, and urine radioassay).  During and
following treatment, personally identifiable bodily data are collected for
clearance rate determination (urine and fecal samples for bioassay and blood
assays).
<P>
No serious toxicity in human subjects has been reported as a result of over 600
Ca-DTPA administrations in recommended doses.  In addition, no serious adverse
effects have been noted as a result of over 1000 doses of Zn-DTPA in the
recommended dosage.  When given repeatedly, with short intervals for recovery,
Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA treatment may both cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills,
fever, pruritus, and muscle cramps in the first 24 hours.  The rate of adverse
effects, mostly minor as noted above, is approximately 2.7%.  Anosmia (loss of
the sense of smell) was observed in one individual after 123 g of Ca-DTPA over
twenty-seven months of therapy and possibly could have been related to zinc
depletion.  After 100 days of no further DTPA administration, the patient's
sense of smell began to return.  In one patient, long-term, low-dose combination
Ca/Zn-DTPA administration was begun using the following schedules: 1 g Ca-DTPA q
24 hr, 1 g Ca-DTPA q 12 hr, 1 g Zn-DTPA q 12 hr, 1 g Zn-DTPA q 8 hr, 1 g Zn-DTPA
q 12 hr, 0.5 g Zn-DTPA q 12 hr, 1 g Zn-DTPA q 24 hr, and finally 1 g Zn-DTPA
three times a week.  After 934 days of such administration, no adverse effects
were noted.
<P>
The chelating efficacy of both Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA is greatest when administered
immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating
in or available to the tissue fluids and plasma.  However, a post-exposure
interval  greater than 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective
action of Ca-DTPA. It is a general guide for DTPA therapy that treatment must be
specifically tailored for individual patients under the medical judgment of the
treating physician.  Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA generally can be thought of as two
components of transuranic decorporation therapy.  If there is any
contraindication to the use of Ca-DTPA, the same dose of Zn-DTPA may be
substituted.  We continue to monitor the use of Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA and the
incidence of adverse reactions through the REAC/TS DTPA registry.  Note: This
project combines several projects in the 1994 database: ORAU 47,52,55,64.

 Objectives of studies using human blood are to conduct in vitro exposures of
cells to radiation or chemicals to learn how genotoxic agents cause damage to
human chromosomes.  In other studies, cells are used to test experimental
variables that affect culture or freezing of material.  Standard laboratory
techniques are applied to expose cells in vitro.  The only "procedure" involving
the blood donor is the venipuncture to collect the blood samples.  As explained
on the consent form, the only anticipated risks are the minor discomfort
associated with the needle stick or, in very rare instances, minor bleeding at
the site of venipuncture.

ORAU - 61 The DTPA Registry Follow-up program
<P>
Since its inception, the DTPA registry has documented the case histories and, in
some cases, clinical data for 610 individuals who have experienced internal
contamination with actinides (radioactive elements such as actinium and
americium) and who subsequently received DTPA.  These 610 individuals were
treated with over 4500 doses of either Ca-DTPA or Zn-DTPA, either by intravenous
or intramuscular injection or by nebulizer administration.  The majority of
patients have received only a single dose, but one patient who experienced a
large exposure to a soluble isotope of americium (241Am) eventually received
over 1000 doses, without adverse side effects.  The DTPA registry is a unique
facility which documents the historical use of chelation therapy to remove
actinide contamination.

This is a Department of Energy registry to document workers who received equal
to or greater than 5 rem of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation.
<P>
a.  Objective:
<P>
 The current study is part of the larger epidemiologic study sponsored by DOE.
The purpose of the current study is to test the hypothesis that the risk of
death from lung cancer will be quantitatively related to uranium dust exposures
among workers that were employed for at least six months at any three uranium
processing or fabrication facilities.  Cases are identified using cause-of-death
information from death certificates already obtained from the state where the
death occurred.
<P>
b.  Methodology:
<P>
 The name and address of the hospital and/or confirming certifier found on the
death certificate is used in order to contact the hospital or certifier to
request information confirming the diagnosis and identifying the histology of
the lung cancer for the cases.  The importance to this study of the confirmatory
and histologic information is to eliminate misdiagnosed cases of lung cancer and
to investigate whether exposure to radiation alters the distribution of the
histologic type of lung cancer from that found in the general population.  All
abstracted data are used for statistical purposes only.
<P>
c. Involvement of human subjects:
<P>
 No direct human subject involvement.  Data are obtained from death certificates
and from hospital records.  Data furnished with individual identifiers are not
transmitted or redisclosed to other investigators for further use of any kind.
All death certificates and documents used to validate cause of death are
destroyed by shredding.
<P>
d. The IRB review includes an assessment of all existing and/or proposed contact
letters, telephone techniques, questionnaires, and consent forms used in the
death record followback investigations.  These were all deemed to be
satisfactory.  The privacy of the individual is protected.

ORAU - 63 The U.S. Radiation Accident Registry Follow-up Program
<P>
The U.S. Radiation Accident Registry is a unique facility containing clinical
data, accident descriptions and accident reconstructions for most of the famous
radiation accidents occurring since the Los Alamos-1 (LA-1) accident in 1945.
In addition, a large number of minor accidents and incidents are described.  The
REAC/TS Central Registry describes 1505 radiation cases involving 141,384
individuals and, therefore, is a valuable database for researchers interested in
the clinical aspects of case management as well as the various human factors
involved.  The U.S. experience as of June 1995 includes 234 accidents that meet
DOE criteria, involving 1309 persons.  Of these, there were 779 significant
exposures with 30 fatalities.  The non-U.S. experience comprises 147 accidents
involving 132,037 individuals, with 2106 significant exposures and 82
fatalities.  We continue to update the registry as we receive information on
accidents, either through professional contacts or through our function as a
World Health Organization  collaborating center.  Risks are limited to those
associated with routine health evaluation (e.g. drawing blood) and submission of
personal data that, while protected by the Privacy Act, is also subject to
access under the Freedom of Information Act.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the health status of a group of sheet
metal workers who worked in metal fabrication operations at the Oak Ridge Y-12
Plant between 1947 and 1988. Both morbidity and mortality will be examined with
special emphasis on those cause-specific cancer outcomes of expressed worker
concern and any outcome expected to result from known or suspected occupational
exposures encountered during metal fabrication operations.
<P>
A case series study design will be used.  The study population will be all
workers ever employed in the metal fabrication operations at Y-12 between May
1947 and December 1988.  Work histories will be used to identify these workers.
Non-radiation exposures will be identified through monitoring records and
interviews with knowledgeable workers.  From this information a telephone
questionnaire will be developed to collect information about cancer incidence,
medical and occupational history, and specific demographic and life-style
information.  The study subjects will be contacted by mail to ask them to
participate, with a telephone contact attempted for non-respondents.  Next of
kin will be contacted  if the study subject is deceased.  Death certificates
will be requested for those study subjects who have died.  The study population
will be matched against the Tennessee Cancer Reporting database to identify
incidence of cancer cases.
<P>
None of the study subjects will be exposed to ionizing radiation, radioactive
substances or chemical substances in the course of this study.
<P>
The human subjects are not exposed to any risks.

ORAU - 81 Prussian Blue IND Application
<P>
Prussian Blue is being proposed for use in decontaminating individuals who have
been accidentally exposed internally to the radioactive element cesium (137Cs).
<P>
An investigational new drug application (IND) for Prussian Blue is nearing
internal review and submission to the FDA should be completed within the next
three months.  Interested DTPA co-investigators will be surveyed regarding their
interest in becoming a co-investigator for insoluble Prussian Blue and this
drug, when approved for an IND, will be distributed to those collaborators who
have a significant potential for an accident involving 137Cs.  There is wide
agreement in the scientific community regarding the efficacy of this compound in
enhancing excretion of cesium, but the drug is currently available only in
Europe under the tradename RadioGardase.
<P>
Prussian Blue at approved dose levels may cause harmless staining.  No major
toxic or other side effects have been observed in humans based on limited use.
Available data suggest continued administration or overdosage may cause
constipation.  Privacy and confidentiality of data collected are assured by the
DOE System of Records to the extent possible under law.

Objectives are to define the range and variability in proliferative response of
human lymphocytes to in vitro exposure to beryllium salts.  This specific study
involves blood samples from control persons who have never been at risk for
exposure to beryllium in the work place.  Standard laboratory methods for
separating and culturing cells are used.  The only procedure that directly
involves the blood donor is the venipuncture that is used to collect the blood
sample.  The only risk anticipated is the minor bleeding at the site of the
venipuncture.

A.      Summarize the objectives and methodology of this research project.
<P>
                The overall purposes of the Y-12 Beryllium (Be) Workers Study, sponsored by
the U.S. DOE and conducted by the Center for Epidemiologic Research (CER) at the
Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) are to (1) investigate
variables that may contribute to interlaboratory differences in results from the
peripheral blood Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) for chronic beryllium
disease (CBD); (2) assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of
the peripheral blood LTT and other non-invasive procedures and their potential
use as routine screening tests for CBD; and (3) determine the prevalence of CBD
among current and former Be exposed employees at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant.
<P>
                The first two objectives are addressed under a research protocol.  The third
objective is addressed through an initial screening program and a subsequent
follow-up surveillance program, both designed to incorporate findings from the
research phase.  Several cases of CBD have already been diagnosed at the Y-12
Plant.  The screening program will be developed to identify other cases if they
exist, and those who are sensitized to Be, so that they may be placed under
medical surveillance and/or early treatment.  The rationale for the surveillance
program is based on the implied assumption that early detection of Be
sensitization or CBD among present and former Be workers will result in a more
favorable prognosis.
<P>
     (2)        Specify the number of human subjects involved each year.
<P>
                Approximately 1,000
<P>
        (3)     Describe the involvement of human subjects and the risks, if any, to which
they are exposed.
<P>
                All study participants receive a physical examination, chest x-ray, complete
blood count, and breathing test.  Blood for LTT is drawn at the same time as
that for the blood count.  There is little physical risk in drawing the blood.
In a few people slight pain and bruising may occur.  An infection from the
needle puncture is possible but rare.
<P>
                A small number of participants (2-5%) are referred for a definitive diagnosis,
including bronchoscopy, bronchial alveolar lavage, and lung biopsy.
<P>
                Discomfort from the bronchoscopy is modest and consists mainly of pressure in
the nose and some coughing until the bronchial tubes are numbed.  An intravenous
tube (iv) is in place during the procedure.  A minor risk from the IV may occur
if it slips out of the vein and fluid enters the tissues possibly causing pain
or allowing medication which is being injected through the tubing to leak and
cause inflammation.  Before the procedure, the study participant is sedated.  If
a person is extremely sensitive to the medication, they may enter a deep sleep,
in which case medication to counteract narcotics is required.  Bronchoscopy with
biopsy may result in bleeding in some people, possibly requiring hospitalization
for observation.  An additional risk of the bronchoscopy with biopsy procedure
is rupture of the outer lining of the lung resulting in an air leak, requiring
the insertion of a small tube to remove the air that escapes into the chest
cavity.  Other possible risks are development of fever, or rarely, development
of pneumonia.  Extremely rarely, a very sensitive individual could die from a
complication from the procedure (much less than 1%).  These risks are discussed
with the individuals prior to their undergoing the definitive diagnosis
procedures.
<P>
        (4)     List the chemical or radioactive materials, if any, that are used in the
study, and identify the route of exposure.
<P>
                None

a.   The overall hypothesis to be tested is whether occupational exposure to
inorganic mercury is associated with long-term adverse effects on the nervous
system.
<P>
b.  To evaluate the potential mercury-related long-term effects, we have
utilized a questionnaire, a neurological/medical examination, and a series  of
standardized neurological and neurobehavioral tests on the exposed workers and
their controls who were frequency matched for age, gender, work status (active,
terminated, or retired), and job title.
<P>
c.   None
<P>
d.  The number of subjects involved each year is 220.  The only risk in this
study is the risk associated with drawing blood.  Nerve conduction tests are
administered which may be slightly uncomfortable but do not pose a risk to the
study participant.  No chemical or radioactive materials are applied to the
human subjects in this study.

This study is a records based study to determine if there is a relationship
between the development of leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and central nervous
system tumors in children and their parents' pre-conceptual exposure to
radiation.  Children with any of the cancers listed above who were residents of
the counties surrounding the Oak Ridge nuclear complex between 1947 and 1991
were ascertained from hospital records and death certificates.  For each child
with cancer, four children of the same age and sex were selected from birth
listings to serve as controls. Employment records for the nuclear facilities in
Oak Ridge will be searched to find evidence of employment of the parents in this
industry.  Radiation exposure data for parents who worked at the facilities will
be abstracted for both case and control parents.  Statistical analyses will be
performed to determine what relationship, if any, pre-conceptual radiation
exposure has to subsequent development of certain cancers in the children.

The objective of this work is to retrieve and verify the death certificate (DC)
and code all causes of death on the death certificate for individuals identified
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR).  In addition,
information from questionnaires administered by ATSDR personnel will be coded
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD9-CM) codes for the individual's disease conditions and Bureau
of Census occupation and industry codes for his or her work history.  These data
will be maintained by ATSDR as part of The National Exposure Registry.
<P>
All records are sent to The Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) in
hard-copy and machine-readable form by ATSDR.  If retrieval of DCs is requested,
records will be submitted to the National Death Index (NDI) for identification
of the deceased individual.  Attempts will be made to retrieve a DC for each
person identified as dead.  A DC request will be made to the state in which the
person died.  The DC returned by the state will be verified as belonging to the
person for whom it was requested.  Once the DC has been verified, it will be
de-identified and sent to Medical Coding and Consultation Services, Inc.  (MCCS)
located in Rolesville, N.C. for nosologic coding of all causes of death to the
ICD9.  The codes returned from MCCS along with selected information from the DC
will be computerized.  All records will be returned to ATSDR as work is
completed.
<P>
Human subjects are not exposed to ionizing radiation, radioactive substances or
chemical substances as a result of this research.
<P>
There is no risk to human subjects.

This project uses fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques to measure
translocation rates among the chromosomes of human subjects who have potentially
been exposed to sources of industrial or accident-related radiation.  These
rates are used to estimate exposures received many years earlier such as in the
Chernobyl accident or those accumulated over a lifetime by radiation workers.
Blood samples obtained from populations of interest identified by National
Cancer Institute (NCI) are cultured in the laboratory and analyzed after the
application of "chromosome painting" techniques.  The only risk to subjects is
that involved in the drawing of a blood sample.  Limited numbers of samples are
also taken from control individuals.

A.      Objective
<P>
The purpose of this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is to
develop a radionuclide therapy treatment planning paradigm for patients
receiving Sn-117m DTPA, a radiopharmaceutical for palliation of the pain
associated with bone metastases.  The resulting product will be a software
package capable of computing radiation doses specific to individual patients.
<P>
NOTE - DOE funding is used solely for the purpose of analyzing and utilizing
patient data for the purposes of developing the treatment planning software.
The Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will be receiving and utilizing
patient data obtained by Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona, and will not be directly involved in subject
recruitment, care, treatment or followup.  Our use of these human data is no
different, philosophically or in practice, from our routine use of human data
for radiation dose estimations.  Identifiable patient data will be protected to
the extent allowable by law.
<P>
B.      Methodology
<P>
The treatment planning paradigm consists of estimating the radiation absorbed
doses to normal organs, including active bone marrow and metastatic lesions in
the skeleton of individual patients.  Radiation dose estimation for internally
deposited radionuclides requires mathematical models of a patient's anatomy and
of the temporal variation of the biodistribution and retention of the
radiopharmaceutical.
<P>
To develop patient-specific dose estimates, two issues must be addressed:
radiation transport modeling and biokinetic modeling.  The radiation transport
modeling will be performed by adapting preexisting anthropomorphic phantoms
(Cristy and Eckerman, ORNL/TM-8381/V1, 1987) for use in an electron/photon
transport code, MCNP-4A.  To address the second issue, we will develop a
biokinetic model of the activity uptake, retention, and washout in the various
normal organs, lesions and routes of excretion.  These data will be obtained
from scintigraphy of the Sn-117m-labeled radiopharmaceutical in the patients for
whom dose estimates are desired.
<P>
After mathematically modeling each patient's biokinetic data, the residence
times are easily determined by integration of the equations simulating the
biodistribution.  Using a version of the MIRDOSE3 software specifically modified
to estimate normal tissue and lesion doses, a dose estimate is calculated for
that individual.  From data describing maximum tolerated dose for normal
tissues, it is a simple matter to determine the largest amount of activity that
can be safely administered.  Additionally, we can provide a more detailed report
of the estimated active marrow dosimetry.  This is accomplished by reporting the
marrow dose in a new format:  a histogram of the fraction of marrow receiving a
certain amount of absorbed dose as a function of absorbed dose level.  From this
information, we may be able to estimate the fraction of the total marrow likely
to receive myelotoxic amounts of absorbed dose.
<P>
By predicting the maximum tolerable dose to normal tissues and the fraction of
marrow that may be suppressed, a scientific, systematic method of planning
radionuclide therapy with Sn-117m will have been achieved.
<P>
C.      Ionizing Radiation, Radioactive Materials, or Chemical Substances
<P>
Patients (after providing signed, informed consent) participating in this
project will receive one or more injections of Sn-117m DTPA, a
radiopharmaceutical.  Patients may also receive a baseline bone scan using a
Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceutical and one or more bone and chest x-rays.
Patients will not be exposed to ionizing radiation, radioactive materials, or
chemical substances, other than medications the patients are already taking at
their acceptance for participation in this project or those diagnostic imaging
procedures listed above, unless medically necessary.
<P>
D.      Procedures Involving Human Subjects
<P>
Upon giving informed consent, medical histories and physical examinations will
be obtained.  Patients will then undergo routine blood tests and bone and chest
x-rays (all routine for cancer patients).  After completion of these initial
assessments, patients will receive up to 35 mCi (most likely dose range 10-25
mCi) of Sn-117m DTPA via venipuncture.  Blood and urine samples will be
collected periodically over the next 6 months and scintigraphic images will be
obtained over the 7 days following administration of the Sn-117m DTPA.
Assessments of the duration and extent of pain relief will be verbally obtained
until the patient is lost to followup.
<P>
The risks associated with the clinical protocol are those of mild to moderate
myelotoxicity.  Drops in white bIood cell and platelet counts most likely will
occur, though the drops have not been severe enough to produce clinically
significant myelotoxicity in Phase I and II clinical studies.  Identifiable
patient data will be protected to the extent allowable by law.

a. To validate proposed cognitive workload metrics for regulatory review of
display navigation tasks that may be performed in advanced digital control
rooms.
<P>
b.  Testing occurred while participants were seated before a computer
workstation.  Participants performed an eyetracker calibration procedure with
the head supported in a chin rest.  The participants were given instructions and
briefed on all aspects of the procedure.  After a few practice trials, the
participants completed approximately 50 trials.  The trials involved repetitive
problem-solving tasks at the workstation.   Experimental sessions were
approximately 90 minutes in duration, during which time the participants were
debriefed.
<P>
c.  None.
<P>
d1.  Participants completed tasks at a computer workstation while their
performance was recorded.  Eye movements were recorded using an infrared beam
directed at the eye.  The amount of infrared illumination on the eye at a range
of 15 inches was 20% of the Health Education and Welfare (HEW)
 maximum permissible exposure according to vendor performance specifications.
<P>
d2.  Prolonged exposure to the infrared light in the eye could produce some
dryness.   Social risks are  minimized by not associating names with any of the
results from the study.    Participation was voluntary, and participants were
free to withdraw at any time.

a.  Current technology available to law enforcement agencies is very effective
at obtaining adult fingerprints from various surfaces, but the fingerprints of
prepuberty adolescents do not persist on surfaces.  This research will examine
the chemical composition of fingerprints and develop methods to detect the
smaller, and possibly different, residues from children's fingerprints.
<P>
b.  Standard methods of collecting sweat will be employed using water and/or
isopropanol treated swabs to remove material from the skin surfaces.  Also,
fingerprint and palmprint deposits on glass surfaces will be analyzed; these
will be collected by allowing the child to grasp the cleaned glass surface for a
few moments.  The contents and composition of the skin surface samples will be
examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, chemical fluorescence, direct
mass spectrometry, and standard analytical techniques.
<P>
c.  Isopropanol as a skin swab.
<P>
d1.  See item b.
<P>
d2.  None of the methods will employ invasive techniques.  Child identity will
be kept anonymous by coding the samples.

professionals at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Robotics and Process
Systems Division (RPSD).   Part of this research may require comparisons  of
alternative control and display methods.  Comparative testing will be done in
the form of realistic work sample tests.   Subjects for the comparative testing
will be volunteers drawn from the population of RPSD telerobot operators.

a.  To develop a cancer-specific tumor antigen using human tumor tissue, lymph
nodes, and white blood cells.  The portion of the work to be  performed at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) involves the use of mass spectrometry for
chemical characterization of peptides and proteins associated with normal and
tumor cells.  Samples of these peptides and proteins will be provided to ORNL by
researchers at Harrington Regional Medical Center (HRMC), Amarillo, Texas.

b.  This project is a collaborative effort centered at HRMC.  The investigators
at HRMC are operating under the approval of their local institutional review
board.  Samples received at ORNL will be coded so that the identity of the human
subject is not known to researchers  at ORNL.  Procedures to be performed at
ORNL involve performing mass spectrometric analysis of the samples received from
HRMC.
<P>
c.  None.
<P>
d1.  No direct interaction involving human subjects will take place at ORNL.

     The primary thrust of this research is to develop a fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms involved in radon-induced deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) damage, specifically those lesions implicated in the generation of cancer.
The effects of radon exposure on DNA and the molecular processes involved in
mutations will be analyzed for a number of cell types, including human cell
lines such as peripheral blood lymphocytes.  This project also conducts and
collaborates in studies relating to dosimetry, molecular mutagenesis,
cytogenetics and DNA damage and repair with researchers at Pacific Northwest
Laboratory (PNL) and elsewhere.  This project serves as a core facility for the
in vitro radon exposure facility.  Data from the in vitro system will be
compared with data from the  PNL microbeam facility, and this project will act
in support of the microbeam facility.  An understanding of the mechanisms
involved in alpha particle-induced DNA damage will strengthen the overall
understanding of processes involved in radiation-induced carcinogenesis.
<P>
     PNL's in vivo and in vitro radon exposure systems will be collaboratively
used to expose animals and to irradiate cell cultures for the mechanistic study
of chromosomal aberrations, mutations, and DNA strand-break production and
repair.  This project will also provide biological support to the PNL microbeam.
The resulting mechanistic data will ultimately be incorporated into oncogenic
models to facilitate extrapolation of high exposure rate and high exposure level
data, typically observed in worker exposures, to environmental levels of radon
exposure.
<P>
     Only blood will be drawn from the human subjects.  There are possible risks
of bruising at the site of needle puncture, the development of a hematoma, and
infection from the needle.

     The ultimate goal of this research is to demonstrate field-applicability of
a semi-portable, real-time monitoring instrument capable of characterizing human
tissue levels of volatile chemicals in waste-site cleanup workers at Hanford and
elsewhere in the DOE complex.  The development of this instrument will greatly
enhance ongoing efforts to improve the health protection of workers in the
field.  This research will provide the means of relating a quantitative
measurement of organic chemicals in the exhaled breath of a worker and the
associated health risk based on exposure/risk conversion factors determined by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
<P>
     The participating workers will pass through the system upon entry and exit
of the chemical hazards control zone.  Workers will be identified by
code-number, which will also be used to access a worker's data file containing
individual physiological characteristics--body weight and height.  Industry
standard chemical sensors will be placed on the workers to record chemical
exposures.  The time of stay in the control zone will be recorded, chemical
exposure will be analyzed immediately upon exit of the site using the chemical
sensor connected to a mass spectrometer, and the workers will breathe for 1-2
minutes into a breath-inlet system connected to a mass spectrometer.  Carbon
tetrachloride in exhaled breath will be identified and quantified.  The
concentration data in exhaled breath will feed into a physiologically-based
pharmacokinetic model to determine the worker's target tissue dose (the liver,
in the case of carbon tetrachloride) in terms of milligrams per kilogram of
tissue per day.  This information will be combined with existing methodologies
in risk assessment (conversion factors from exposure to dose to risk as
predetermined by EPA) to "instantly" determine the exposure/dose/risk of each
worker participating in the demonstration.
<P>
Risks:  This is a demonstration of an instrument to determine worker health
risk.  Workers will not be exposed to any chemical in any situation other than
their routine cleanup activities.  In theory, a slight risk of respiratory
infection could accompany the use of the breath-inlet device by several
different people.

The objectives of the Transuranium Registry are 1) to study the distribution and
dose of transuranium radionuclides in people occupationally exposed and 2) to
assess the effects of exposure on their health.  The methodology was to autopsy
the bodies of volunteers.
<P>
Individuals only participated after death, so exposures to anything is not
applicable.  All work has been done in Washington in recent years, so details
could be obtained from them as desired.
<P>
No risk to human subjects is involved although the distinction between living
and dead should be emphasized.

The objectives of this study were 1) to monitor former radiation workers for
early detection of any health problems; 2) to minimize, correct or eliminate any
problems; and 3) to determine if any correlations and subsequent radiation could
be observed with any exposures received while working at Rocky Flats.  The
methodology is to identify those workers who received the highest doses relative
to other workers or the population in general and monitor their health every 3
years.  Lung (and wound if applicable) counts as well as urine analysis for
radioactive species are performed as well as standard physical exams.  No human
subjects were exposed to any harmful substances or conditions in this study.
Obviously, however, all participants had been accidently exposed prior to and as
a condition for being included in the study.
<P>
Human subjects are not exposed to any risks, and in fact benefit from the free
exams and lab work.

The Rocky Flats Antibody Assay Program was designed to screen employees at the
Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site for exposure to beryllium, but also
has applications for determining exposures to other substances such as aluminum
and silicon.  Using vacuum deposition, the beryllium is coated onto
immunological microstick plates.  These plates are exposed to plasma, and the
immunoglobulia G (IgG) antibodies present on the beryllium coated microsticks
are located using a unique enzyme-linked immunosorbent microassay (ELISA).  This
methodology had been previously developed and validated for beryllium and is
being examined for the identification of silicon antibodies.  All individuals
indicating a desire to participate are tested for exposure to beryllium using
the ELISA methodology.  The only risk to human subjects from this screening
assay is the venipuncture, as used for regular medical laboratory testing, and
therefore, there is very little risk from this procedure.  Retesting is offered
periodically to current employees and former employees previously tested for
exposure to beryllium who were found to have elevated antibody titers compared
to a negative control population without previous exposure to beryllium.

The Rocky Flats Beryllium Health Surveillance Program (BHSP) was designed to
identify new cases of chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and beryllium
sensitization in individuals who have had the potential for exposure to
beryllium while employed at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site.  The
identity of nearly all employees of Rocky Flats (former and current) who had the
potential for exposure to beryllium has been established.  All individuals
indicating a desire to participate are tested for sensitivity to beryllium using
the peripheral blood Lymphocyte Proliferation Test, and given a chest x-ray.
The only risk to human subjects from the beryllium sensitivity screening is the
venipuncture, as used for regular medical laboratory testing, and therefore,
there is very little risk from this procedure.  Further medical evaluation to
determine the presence of CBD is offered to those identified as beryllium
sensitized or found to have suspicious lung pathology on chest x-ray B-Reader
examination.  Risks to human subjects from additional procedures undertaken by
two leading medical centers for the clinical evaluation of CBD (bronchoalveolar
lavage, bronchoalveolar lung biopsy) are on a voluntary basis, and are under the
guidelines established by individuals previously tested for sensitivity to
beryllium who were found to have normal test results.  Retesting is offered
every year to individuals who had a positive blind test for sensitivity to
beryllium that was not confirmed or who had an abnormal chest x-ray possibly
associated  with CBD.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the utility of a method developed by
the University of Utah for the ultra-sensitive analysis of plutonium-239 in the
urine samples from a set of occupationally exposed Rocky Flats workers. The
method was to analyze 1/2 of the sample by the new method and 1/2 by the
conventional method and to compare the results.  The subject's involvement was
only to submit the urine sample, at no risk to the subject.

a.  Development of a new ultrasound based scanner.
<P>
b.  Scanner is based on approved commercially available ultrasound machine and
will be used to define skin and bone surface geometry of human limbs (legs and
arms).  Scanner can be used for study of amputee limbs, limbs that have suffered
injury or disease and are completely encased in skin or sterile sheath, and
normal limbs.  Information gathered on the limb will be used for fabrication of
prostheses; in the case of the amputee, for refinement of the scanning platform
for diagnostic image generation; and for studies of comparative anatomy.
Uniqueness is use of ultrasound for high resolution three-dimensional images
similar in format to x-ray computed tomography without suffering hazards of
ionizing radiation.
<P>
d.  Individual places leg (or arm) into water bath, used as transmission medium
for ultrasound.  Tank that surrounds water houses the ultrasound probe which
takes images of the leg as the tub rotates around the leg.  Procedure lasts
approximately 20 seconds.  Energy levels and duration of exposure are below Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) limits and do not pose any known health risks.

Study to develop a mathematical retrospective exposure modeling method
appropriate for the variables at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico
(SNL/NM) and apply it to potential occupational organic solvent exposures.
Hypothesis is that in a diverse work environment with limited historical air
monitoring data, a mathematical exposure model can be developed to perform
retrospective exposure assessments resulting in significantly less
misclassification of study subjects, with respect to airborne exposure, than
semi-quantitative and qualitative models.  The study will include development
and application of three models that provide qualitative, semi-quantitative, and
quantitative assessments of occupational exposure to neurotoxic organic
solvents.  The exposure intensity values generated by all three models will be
used to establish cumulative exposures for the SNL/NM worker study population.
The data used to complete the models are existing aggregate data that were
collected for other purposes such as compliance air monitoring (exposure data
for groups of people, for example, those working in a certain laboratory during
a certain period).  The cumulative exposures values will be compared to similar
values from published epidemiology studies that look at sub-clinical neurotoxic
effects.  There are no risks to human subjects from actions taken in support of
this project.

Sticky foam prison scenario effectiveness human subject testing at Sandia
National Laboratories (SNL).  In April 1994, nine scenarios selected by the
American Correctional Association (ACA) and Florida Department of Corrections
(FDOC) were used to evaluate effectiveness of a sticky foam dispenser and sticky
foam (developed by SNL) for prison situations.  Five scenarios were cell-based
and four were day room-based.  Five general law enforcement type tests were also
conducted.  The seven SNL volunteers who participated in the effectiveness tests
were approved by SNL Medical Department prior to testing and received extensive
training prior to testing; all volunteers wore full protective suits and used
self-contained breathing apparatus during participation in the scenario testing.
Risks to humans include potential direct contact with sticky foam if the
protective gear were punctured or torn and physical exertion needed to conduct
vigorous activity or possible overheating while suited up in full protective
gear.

On-skin tests of sticky foam at SNL to determine the adherence strength of
sticky foam to human skin, to determine which hand cleaners recommended by SNL's
Industrial Hygiene Department would best remove sticky foam from skin, to
determine level of effort and time required to remove sticky foam from skin, and
to determine if any personal hygiene items available to prison inmates might
have a detrimental effect on the performance of sticky foam.  On-skin tests were
conducted on volunteer palms and forearms.  Twenty-four hours after these tests,
all volunteers were checked by SNL Medical Department for any signs of reaction
due to either the physical stress applied during the testing,  the sticky foam
exposure, or the commercial cleaners used in the testing.  Risks to human
subjects are those listed in the previous sentence.  Extensive literature
studies prior to testing indicated that the petroleum oils used in sticky foam
may contain materials known to cause cancer in animals following prolonged or
repeated exposure, but toxicological assessments indicated that the constituents
of sticky foam-283 deployed under normal, short-term conditions are essentially
non-hazardous to human skin.

Objective:  To develop and understand the sensor/human interface of a Personal
Status Monitor (PSM) for ambulatory patients that will record blood pressure,
heart rate, respiration, and core body temperature for routine patient
monitoring in hospitals, for outpatients, and for home care.
<P>
Methodology:  Vital signs will be measured at the superficial middle temporal
portion of the external carotid artery in front of the ear, or on an orbital
anterior auricular branch of this artery.  This artery is readily compressed
because it lies on bone.  Compression of the artery to determine blood pressure
requires a headband type platform to provide an opposing force, or an ear canal
platform where a squeezing force can be applied.  Either platform permits the
mounting of sensors for measuring other parameters, i.e., core body temperature,
which can be measured in the ear canal.  Other suitable sensor sites included in
the study are wrist and finger.  No electrical contact with tissue is required.
The desired vital signs can be determined with an infrared (IR) and red sensor,
a pressure transducer, and a temperature transducer.  Non-occlusive techniques
to indirectly determine blood pressure will also be explored.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  Subjects will be used to obtain measurement and
calibration data for the development of this project--only the basic concept has
been developed.  No known risk is involved with human subjects.  All techniques
use conventional measurement and control techniques,  e.g., compression of an
artery to determine blood pressure.

Objectives:  To evaluate technologies that may eliminate the capability of
someone using a police officer's firearm against the police officer.  A first
phase is to research requirements from proposed end users of the ultimate
product.
<P>
Methodology:  End users' expectations and opinions will be collected from a wide
demographic range of respondents through use of surveys and structured
interviews (following a script).  Subjects are persons involved with both law
enforcement and firearms.  Requests are initiated with management of pertinent
agencies for permission to gather information from individuals, such as patrol
officers, in that agency.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:   Individuals are contacted for information.  To
alleviate the concerns that the statements individuals make could in some way be
used against them (e.g., be detrimental to their career), several measures have
been implemented:  make subjects aware that answering all questions (including
demographic data) is optional and any question may be skipped; analyze collected
information in aggregate form; obtain written consent to use information from an
individual if the information could be directly associated with that person.
The collected data will be treated as confidential.  There are minimal risks to
the human subjects who participate in this project.

Objectives:  To collect human perception data (that does not exist in the vision
science literature) to improve, calibrate, and benchmark the performance of
machine vision and image classification algorithms.
<P>
Methodology:  Video images will be presented to subjects and subjects will
report what they perceive by responding to multiple choice questions.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  Subjects will view images on a video monitor and
describe what they see by typing responses on a computer keyboard.  The
responses will be tabulated by computer and stored with an identification code.
Response time will also be measured; uncertain responses (associated with longer
response times) often occur for image parameters at the important "transitions"
between two possible perceptions.  There are no known risks to the subjects.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has tasked Sandia National Laboratories
(SNL) to evaluate commercial state-of-the-art entry control technology devices,
and part of this task is to evaluate new and developing biometric identification
devices to determine their applicability for use in DOE sites.  Biometric
identification devices are capable of identifying a person based on some
measurable, unique characteristic of the individual.  Prototype device to be
evaluated uses the irises of individual eyes.  Verification of identity is
accomplished by matching the measured characteristic with a reference
measurement obtained from a previous enrollment.
<P>
Volunteers will be trained in the use of the device and will use it as often as
possible until a suitable database of transactions is established.  The number
of false rejects will be compared to the number of transactions.  Then all
volunteers' templates will be deleted from the device, and each volunteer will
try the device several times.  During this time, the volunteer's biometric data
will be compared against a database of 400 other user templates; researchers
will be looking for false accepts and will calculate error rate.
<P>
None of the published results will contain individual performance or
identification of any kind.  There are no known risks associated with the use of
the biometric identification device to be studied, and there are no known risks
in any of the study procedures.

Prototype devices to be evaluated use the unique characteristic of individual
facial images for biometric identification.  Both these systems acquire digital
images of people's faces, and verification of identity is accomplished by
matching the image with a reference image obtained from a previous enrollment.
Characterizing the performance of these devices in terms of error rates, length
of time required for verification, user acceptability, vulnerability to attack,
and identification of categories of people who might not be able to use these
devices is the purpose of this test.
<P>
Volunteers will be trained in the use of the devices and will use them as often

matches) will be calculated, and observations during the test and user surveys
following the test will address the other performance considerations.

None of the published results will contain individual performance or
identification of any kind.  There are no known risks associated with the use of
the biometric identification devices to be tested, and there are no known risks

Objective of this project is to reduce to practice a Sandia National
Laboratories (SNL) invention.  Details on the invention are considered to be
proprietary information that will be made available to the public after a patent
application is filed.  As many as 100 SNL employees will be accepted as
volunteer subjects.  They will be subjected to sound in a frequency range from
20 Hertz (Hz) to 50 kilohertz (kHz), and will provide speech samples to a
modified telephone handset.  All acoustic signal levels will be comparable to or
less than typical telephone volume levels.  There are no known risks to the
human subjects.

Objective:  Determine operating characteristics of commercially available
biometric identification devices used in entry control applications.  Devices to
be evaluated use one of the following characteristics:  voice dynamics, hand
geometry, fingerprint, or signature.
<P>
Methodology:  Each volunteer will be given a unique personal ID number (PIN) and
will be trained in the use of the device; then volunteers will each use the
device at least 20 times.  By analyzing the number of false rejects compared to
the number of transactions, first error level will be established.  Volunteers
will then be asked to use their biometric feature against other valid PINs, with
a resulting error rate calculation.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  There will be a single controlled database that
correlates PIN numbers to volunteers' names.  None of the published results will
contain individual performance or identification of any kind.
<P>
There are no known risks associated with the use of any of the biometric
identification devices, and there are no known risks to any of the study
procedures.

TITLE: "Pathogenesis of symptomatic versus silent myocardial ischemia". The PI
on this project is Heinrich R. Schelbert, M.D. No studies were performed during
FY95.
<P>
Patients, male or female, ages 21-75, from outpatient cardiology clinics at
Wadsworth Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) and UCLA Medical Center,
with stable coronary artery disease/angina, will be recruited to study the
pathophysiological differences between silent myocardial ischemic episodes and
symptomatic ischemic episodes. It has been established that frequent episodes of
silent myocardial ischemia exist in all subsets of patients with symptomatic
ischemia (otherwise known as angina pectoris) and represent 70% to 90% of all
ischemic episodes. Why myocardial ischemia remains silent in a person who also
has symptomatic episodes remains unknown. Possible causes include differences in
pain thresholds, defective warning signals, b-endorphin activity, duration of
ischemic episodes, myocardial hemodynamic demand and extent/severity of
ischemia.
<P>
Positron emission tomography (PET), with its unique ability to quantitate
metabolically impaired (ischemic) tissue, will be used for this study. About 20
patients per year will be studied.
<P>
Baseline clinical data will be obtained, including Holter monitoring to verify
preset criteria for the presence of symptomatic and silent ischemic episodes.
Baseline PET studies include blood flow using the radionuclides N-13 ammonia or
Rb-82 and metabolic imaging using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose. Hemodynamic variables
and catecholamine levels will be measured.
<P>
Mental stress tests will be done to provoke silent ischemia, and PET scans for
blood flow and metabolic imaging will be performed during an ischemic episode,
signaled by specialized Holters with on-line analysis. Two days later, the above
scan procedure will be repeated during symptomatic ischemia provoked by supine
bicycle exercise.
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within the guidelines for
permissible exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling.

TITLE: "Metabolic tissue characterization in patients with acute myocardial
infarction by positron emission tomography".  The PI on this project is Heinrich
R. Schelbert, M.D. No studies were performed in FY95.
<P>
 The benefit of the study is primarily directed toward medical science. The
study is expected to provide information on the metabolic pattern of infarcted
and ischemically injured myocardium in humans. An early differentiation between
viable and necrotic tissue during an evolving infarct will then allow better
definition of patients who will benefit from therapuetic interventions such as
angioplasty or surgical revascularization. For the individual patient, there
will be the benefit of assessing the severity and extent of disease which may be
important information for further management.
<P>
  For the study early after the acute infarction, the patient will be
transported from the UCLA Coronary Care Unit (CCU) to the UCLA Nuclear Medicine
Clinic where the positron tomograph is located. He/she will be escorted by a CCU
nurse and cardiologist or cardiologist fellow. The follow-up study will be
performed electively on an outpatient basis approximately 6 weeks later. For the
study later after an acute myocardial infarction, patients will be examined
first at the time of hospital discharge, 10-14 days post myocardial infarction
and then again at 3 months. Concurrent with the PET studies will be gated MRI
evaluation of the heart in terms of tissue characterization and regional
function. This protocol seeks to examine the predictive value of residual
metabolic abnormality as seen on PET for subsequent characterization. The study
will be performed jointly with the cardiology group at Cedars Sinai Medical
Center, where the gated MRI studies will be obtained. Both scintigraphic studies
include the injection of 82Rubidium, 18Fluorodeoxyglucose and 11Carbon
palmitate.
<P>
  During the 1st study, the patient will be continuously monitored
electrocardiographically, and hemodynamical monitoring will be performed
periodically. The cardiologist will be present throughout the stay of the
patient in the Nuclear Medicine Clinic. The scanner room is equipped with all
standard cardiac monitoring and emergency devices including defibrillator. The
additional risk to the patient by participating in the study is considered
minimal, since no intervention is involved which significantly stresses the
cardiovascular system. However, sudden arrhythmias can occur in patients with
acute infarct.  Therefore, care will be taken to continuously monitor the
patient.
<P>
  Patients' diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction must be established by ECG
and enzyme criteria. Hemodynamically and clinically unstable patients will be
excluded. Patients with life threatening dysrhythmias will not be considered.
Additionally, patients who are deemed unable to comprehend the context of the
study either due to the disease or drug intervention will be excluded. The
selection will be discussed with the referring physician of the patient and the
attending staff of the CCU.

TITLE: "Mapping dopamine receptors with F-18 fluorospiperone". The PI on this
project is Lewis R. Baxter, M.D.
<P>
This protocol uses a trace amount of a compound which binds specifically to key
sites in the brain that have been implicated in a variety of disease processes
involving mental illness and neurological disorders. Some of the illnesses that
affect these receptor sites include depression, schizophrenia, movement
disorders and behavioral abnormalities following head trauma. To measure these
receptors, we administer a trace amount of a radioactive compound into the
subject's vein while sampling blood from a vein or artery. While this is
happening, the subject is lying on a couch with his or her head in a large
machine (tomograph) that records the radioactivity from the compound as it
passes through the brain. These serial pictures plus the information about the
behavior of the compound in the blood allow for the precise and accurate
measurement of these receptors in the brain. Once known in normal subjects,
changes associated with diseases can be determined. Such information will
provide insights into the basic disorders as well as provide direction as to the
proper therapy of such patients.
<P>
Up to 20 normal volunteers will be recruited and 30 patients. Ages will be 18
and older.

TITLE: "Study of hemodynamics and metabolism with compounds labeled with
short-lived positron emitting radionuclides (heart)". The PI on this project is
Heinrich R. Schelbert, M.D.
<P>
The objective of these study protocols is to develop non-invasive techniques for
accurate and specific measurements of regional myocardial metabolism and blood
flow. This information will potentially be useful for early diagnosis and
acquisition of highly specific information that is of potential clinical value
for early disease detection, characterization of extent and severity of disease,
and patient management. These studies will include evaluation and measurement of
myocardial blood flow (with nitrogen-13 ammonia, rubidium-82 or oxygen-15 carbon
monoxide), myocardial fatty acid metabolism (with carbon(C)-11 palmitic acid),
and/or regional myocardial glucose utilization (with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose) as
well as of myocardial oxidative metabolism (with C-11 acetate). These studies
will be performed in normal volunteers and in patients with cardiovascular
disease (i.e., with coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease and/or
cardiomyopathy).
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within the guidelines for
permissible exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling.

TITLE: "Determination of local myocardial amino acid utilization in man by means
of N-13 labeled amino acids (and by single pass uptake) and positron emission
tomography". The PI on this project is Johannes Czernin, M.D. No studies were
performed in FY95.
<P>
This study is concerned with gaining a better understanding of how the heart
muscle uses amino acids. Radioactive amino acids, such as glutamate, glutamine,
and/or alanine, will be injected into patients and normal volunteers in order to
determine potentially different distribution of amino acids between normal and
ischemic myocardium. The usefulness of amino acids as an imaging agent for local
ischemia or locally disturbed amino acid metabolism will be studied using PET.
Early studies have indicated that amino acid levels in the myocardium vary in
patients with coronary artery disease. There have been some indications that
certain amino acids may be a protective agent on ischemic myocardium.
<P>
The study of amino acid metabolism may provide new insights into myocardial
amino acid utilization under both normal and ischemic conditions, which would be
useful in identifying metabolically altered segments of the heart.
After injection of a tracer amount of radioactive amino acid, heart scans will
be performed immediately in a series of images of a period of 20-30 minutes.
During this time, blood samples will be obtained.
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within permissible guidelines.
Additional potential risks include blood sampling.

We expect to study 50 patients with suspected cardiac disease and 20 normal
subjects, male and female. Ages will be 18 and order.

TITLE: "Noninvasive quantification of regional myocardial blood flow reserve and
glucose metabolism by myocardial imaging during dipyridamole or adenosine
hypermia". The PI on this project is Heinrich R. Schelbert, M.D.
<P>
The objectives of this research proposal include investigation of the effect of
maximal coronary artery vasodilation on regional myocardial blood flow and
metabolism in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease and in
normal volunteers. This research will attempt not only to investigate the
pathophysiology of maximal coronary artery vasodilation but also to determine
whether high-risk patients can be identified so that irreversible myocardial
damage can be prevented.
<P>
Significant coronary artery disease and myocardial disease remain undetected
until the occurrence of a catastrophic event such as sudden death or acute
myocardial infarction. Even when angina or congestive symptoms herald the
presence of significant disease, accurate, predictive diagnostic tools are not
currently available to determine which patients require immediate aggressive
intervention in order to prevent irreversible myocardial damage.
<P>
The quantification of myocardial blood flow, oxygen consumption and myocardial
metabolism in cardiac disease is of considerable clinical interest. Such
measurements are important in order to gain insights into disease mechanisms for
assessing diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. PET is the only technique at this
time which can noninvasively assess regional myocardial metabolism. Although
perfusion defects may be observed under conditions of rest, the detection of a
hemodynamic significant coronary artery lesion frequently requires conditions of
increased myocardial workload and hence, blood flow. Pharmacological coronary
vasodilation is an alternative to exercise. One pharmacological stress agent
proven in more than 1,000 patients with PET and thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging
for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is dipyridamole. Adenosine is a
relatively new potent coronary vasodilator with clear potential as a
pharmacological stress agent in cardiac imaging.  Its rapid onset of action and
extremely short elimination half-life suggest it may be superior to dipyridamole
in this regard.
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within the guidelines for
permissible exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling.

We expect to study 500 patients with proven/suspected cardiac disease and 100
normal subjects, male and female, ages 18 and older.

Gambhir, M.D., Ph.D., and Carl Hoh, M.D. No subjects were seen in FY95.
<P>
PET methods using the radioactive tracer known as F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
make it possible to construct images showing the use of sugar in different parts
of the brain. These images provide unique insights into normal brain function
and the disruption of normal brain function in disease states including
epilepsy, cerebral palsy, learning disorders, depression, and head trauma.
<P>
The basic procedure involves injection of a small amount of FDG into a vein in
the subject's arm. The subject rests quietly for 40 minutes while the sugar is
being taken up by cells in the body including those in the brain. After this
uptake period, images are collected for 30-60 minutes while the subject rests
quietly. When certain quantitative results are needed to interpret the images,
up to 50 cc of arterial or venous blood may be collected from subjects through a
small catheter placed in the subject's arm. (Cardiac imaging will be offered
only to the pediatric epilepsy patients with normal hearts. The heart images
will be made while the FDG injection comes to equilibrium during this 30-60
minute period.)
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within the guidelines for
permissible exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling.
<P>
Approximately 350 patients and 80 normal volunteer subjects will be studied over
the course of the protocol. Patients will be male and female, neonates and
older. Normal male volunteers will be age 18 and older.

TITLE: "Positron tomography: exercise induced cardiac ischemia".  The PI on this
project is Janine Krivokapich, M.D.
<P>
This study is designed to investigate non-invasively the hemodynamic and
metabolic effects which are elicited with stress-induced ischemia using positron
emission tomography (PET). Stress will be induced with exercise, with an
intravenous infusion of dobutamine, or with an intravenous infusion of
dipyridamole. The tracers will be used in various combinations to characterize
the acute and delayed effects of myocardial ischemia induced by stress on
metabolism. Insight into the metabolic characteristics of the stunned myocardium
should result.
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within the guidelines for
permissible exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling. We
expect to study 35 patients with known/suspected cardiac disease and 15 normal
volunteers, male and female. Ages will be 18 and older.

TITLE: "In-vivo measurement of regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism at
different cardiac workloads using tracers of blood flow and metabolism with
positron emission tomography".  The PI's on this project are Heinrich R.
Schelbert, M.D. and Johannes Czernin, M.D. No studies were performed in FY95.
<P>
This study investigates blood flow and metabolism at different cardiac workloads
in patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, patients with other
cardiac diseases, such as hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, will be
studied, and normal values determined in volunteers. Methods of increasing
cardiac workload and/or demand that will be utilized include exercise,
intravenous dipyridamole, dobutamine and pacing. Pacing will not be utilized in
normal volunteers. This study will provide improvement in the non-invasive
diagnosis and characterization of cardiovascular disease and better
understanding of the human heart's physiology and pathophysiology.
<P>
A baseline PET imaging study will be obtained following the first group of
injections of the tracers. Cardiac workload and/or demand will be increased by
exercise (walking on a treadmill or using a cycle ergometer), intravenous
dipyridamole, intravenous dobutamine or pacing, and a second study will be
obtained following the second group of injections of the tracers. The study may
include arterial or venous blood sampling.
<P>
Echocardiography will be performed during dobutamine stimulation in healthy
subjects as well as in patients with coronary artery disease, to evaluate
changes in regional wall motion induced by pharmacologic stress.
<P>
The protocol will be performed on 20 patients per year, both male and female,
age 18 or older, and 10 normal volunteers per year, both male and female, age 18
or older.
<P>
The tracer amounts of radioactivity used are well within permissible guidelines
for exposure. Additional potential risks include blood sampling, discomfort to
the patient due to rapid arterial pacing or mild chest pain in patients with
coronary artery disease.

leucine, phenylalanine, methionine, and/or nitrogen-13 leucine". The PI on this
project is Heinrich R. Schelbert, M.D.  No studies were performed in FY95.
<P>
The research plan is two-fold: The plan for the brain protocol will verify the
technique in normal subjects and will examine the usefulness and effectiveness
of the technique in patients with stroke and partial epilepsy to examine the
alterations in local protein synthesis due to these disorders. The research plan
for the heart protocol will explore the possibility of quantifying regional
rates of protein synthesis in myocardium with positron emission tomography (PET)
and labeled amino acids in normal subjects and in patients with heart disease.
<P>
Labeled amino acids will be injected into the subjects and imaging will be done
by PET. Blood samples will be withdrawn at intervals during the imaging process.
Risks to the subjects are minimal: the radiation dose is small and well within
prescribed limits; the tracer is a natural amino acid that is present in plasma;
and arterial and venous sampling has been done for years without complications.
<P>
70 patients and 30 normal subjects, male and female, will be studied. The age of
the epilepsy patients will be newborn up; others will be 18 or older.

TITLE: "Dopamine transport and storage measured with 4-[18F]
fluoro-L-metatyrosine". The PI's on this project are Jorge Barrio, Ph.D. and Sam
Gambhir, M.D., Ph.D.
<P>
The objective of this study is to perform in vivo quantitative measurements of
regional L-DOPA transport and storage in the brain of human subjects using
Positron Emission Tomography (PET), both in normal volunteers and patients with
certain neurological and psychiatric disorders.  Abnormalities in the dopamine
system with changes in dopamine receptor binding have been demonstrated in
animal models and human autopsy studies of many neurological and psychiatric
illnesses.  Over recent years, major institutions throughout the world have
developed radiopharmaceuticals to label precursors of dopamine in the living
human brain.
<P>
Initially, the use of 4-FMT will be directed at control subjects of both sexes
with ages greater than 19.  These subjects will provide a database for the
distribution, magnitude and range for quantitative values for 6-FMT in the
normal brain at various ages.  From this database, we will compare patients with
a variety of disorders, including epilepsy, Huntington's disease, tardive
dyskinesia, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dystonia,
affective disorders, schizophrenia, Gilles de La Tourette syndrome, obsessive
compulsive disorders, individuals exposed to toxins that may produce
Parkinsonian-like symptoms (e.g., MPTP, carbon monoxide, manganese), and others.
<P>
Thirty normal volunteers and thirty patients will be studied initially.

This project has attempted to map and isolate a gene for ataxia-telangiectasia
(A-T), a progressive neurological disorder that is also associated with
radiation sensitivity, immunodeficiency and cancer susceptibility.  The
frequency of A-T carriers is 0.5-3%.  A-T carriers may account for 5% of cancer
patients in the United States and 1 in 5 women with breast cancer.  A-T carriers
are also radiosensitive in vitro and MAY need less than conventional doses of
radiotherapy in the event of developing cancer.
<P>
Our laboratory mapped the gene to chromosome 11q22-23 in 1988, sublocalized it
by linkage analyses to a 500-kilobase region in 1994, and participated in its
cloning and analysis of mutations in A-T patients in 1995.  The earlier linkage
analyses involved DNA from blood specimens of more than 250 families from many
countries; the results of this genotyping were then correlated with the
phenotypes of family members.  The major laboratory work of the past few years
has not involved human subjects directly, but has involved the study of
anonymous DNA samples from genomic and expression libraries.  Now that the gene
has been isolated, we are attempting to characterize each family's mutations and
then to correlate the mutation sites with variations in the phenotypes.  The
latter will certainly involve returning to the referring physicians for further
clinical details.
<P>
Most bloods (5-20 milliliters) from A-T families are sent to our laboratory by
physicians in various countries, including the U.S., for genetic analyses.  This
work is provided at no cost to the families or to their insurance.  We analyze
the DNA or RNA extracted from this blood, or from cell lines derived from these
bloods on approximately 30 new families each year.  We also analyze the
radiation sensitivity of suspected A-T patients by an in vitro assay performed
on the patients' lymphoblastoid cell lines.
<P>
When samples are sent to our laboratory for research analyses, the Principal
Investigator immediately assigns a family number and individual family member
numbers.  From that time on, all references to that family, data analyses, etc.,
use only those numbers.  The individual identification names are included in the
computer database for cross-checking errors.  However, only the PI and the
biomath data processors have access to that information.  The original names are
only used when information is sent back to the referring physicians.  No
reference is made to these names in the event of publication or transfer of data
to a collaborating laboratory.  Cell lines are also coded.
<P>
From these and from previously studied families, we can identify many
individuals who are heterozygotes or carriers.  Most of these individuals know
that they are carriers, many having requested further information about their
cancer risk and radiation sensitivity which they learn from various brochures
and newsletters circulated by the families themselves.  In some families,
members of additional branches have requested that they be tested as well.  At
no cost to them, we try to meet these requests whenever possible and feasible.
<P>
One risk to members of families might be the psychological burden of learning
specifically that they are A-T carriers, since it already seems clear that such
individuals are at an increased cancer and radiation exposure risk.  On the
other hand, the benefit of knowing would be that these individuals would be more
closely monitored in the future for cancer and for  radiation exposure.  They
would also be alerted for child-bearing purposes.  At risk pregnancies can now
be monitored for prenatal diagnosis.
<P>
Our laboratory was the first to report prenatal testing for A-T in 1993.  This
is now being performed in several laboratories around the world.  We no longer
need blood from A-T families in order to perform genotyping; we have the
capability to perform these studies on mouth washings.  However, since this
procedure for DNA isolation has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, we have not yet incorporated it into our testing.
<P>
Another potential risk is insurance risk assessment.  So far this has not been a
problem.  Besides, an argument could be made that within the same families,
non-carriers will be at a lesser cancer risk than the general untested
population.  So, if individual data were not provided to insurance companies,
the summed risk for the family might not be significantly different than that of
the general population.  However, on an individual basis, this could later
become a problem.  Hopefully, with further understanding of the functions of the
A-T gene and the health status of A-T carriers, medical care for carriers and
affecteds will improve.  That is the potential benefit to all A-T families from
this research effort.
<P>
Once a family member has been identified as a carrier, we routinely provide free
advice, if requested, to these individuals and to their primary physicians
regarding their carrier status.  For example, a primary care physician or family
member may call to ask whether a planned tomogram is "safe".  The PI offers to
discuss the pros and cons of this with the carrier's physician.  A second
radiological opinion may be sought.  The indications for the radiological
procedure are reviewed with the physician.  In several actual cases, the
physicians recognized that the recommended procedure was not absolutely
necessary and, when they were alerted to the moderately increased
radiosensitivity of A-T carriers, they chose to use alternative procedures, with
the option to return to their original plan if needed.  The PI also provides
advice or referrals for second opinions at times of biopsies and genetic
counseling, all at no cost.  The families have been very appreciative - in the
U.S., Norway, England, Italy, Germany, Costa Rica, Kenya, and Australia.

a. Objectives
<P>
The experiments are designed to gain information about the way in which the
genetic material is arranged in chromosomes and the way in which radiation and
other damaging agents such as mutagens or carcinogens bring about these effects.
<P>
b. Methodology
<P>
Biochemical and biophysical experiments are carried out in laboratory cultures
of human blood lymphocytes that are obtained by simple venipuncture from people
whose cells are known to respond to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) so that their
chromosomes can be visualized in cytogenetic studies.
<P>
c. Exposure
<P>
Subjects are not exposed to any agents as a consequence of this research. The
subjects only serve as a source of a few milliliters(mL) of blood which can be
taken to the laboratory for treatment and subsequent study.
<P>
d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
The experiments are carried out in vitro on cultured human blood that only
serves as a source of G0 lymphocytes that can be stimulated to grow by the
addition of PHA to the cultures. Each culture requires 0.3 ml of freshly drawn
whole blood. Any given experiment will require between 3-20 ml of blood, which
is drawn into heparinized vacutainers. The blood is drawn by simple venipuncture
from the forearm of donors who are paid $10.00 for each donation. The blood is
usually obtained from scientists and technicians in the laboratory who are known
to have blood that responds well to PHA. Occasionally blood from people with a
known genetic defect in DNA repair is used. In no case are experiments carried
out on donors. All work is performed on the extracorporeal blood in tissue
culture.
<P>
The informed consent form points out that the only risk is that the needle stick
might possibly cause bruising or infection, but that this is highly unlikely. In
the 20 years this project has been going on there have been no adverse reactions
or complications.

a. Objectives
<P>
Patients with the clinically diagnosed diseases xeroderma pigmentosum (XP),
Cockayne syndrome (CS), or other sun-sensitive disorders, or normal volunteer
subjects will be asked to donate a 2-5 mm punch biopsy from the skin of the
inner arm. These are to be used for in vitro analysis of radiation sensitivity
DNA repair and DNA replication in order to identify the metabolic defects
involved in the various forms of the disease.
<P>
b. Methodology
<P>
Patients will be of all ages including minors; approval for minors will be
sought from parents. Volunteers will be obtained primarily from adult students
or scientific visitors immediately prior to departure from the laboratory, or
biopsies are sent from other institutions. Skin cultures are not established in
a laboratory in which the donor is currently working. Patients and volunteers
will be told that the procedure is for diagnosis of the disease or to obtain
normal control cultures.  Records of normal donors will only specify age, sex,
date of biopsy, and initials of donor. Private records will be kept identifying
XP and CS patients, including name, age, address, clinical conditions, etc., but
in all publicly distributed information (lectures, papers, etc.), XP cell
cultures are identified only by the code specified in Genetics, 79:215-225
(1975). All patients and donors at our institution will be given a copy of the
"Patient's Bill of Rights" and a consent form.
<P>
<P>
c. Exposure
<P>
The materials, if any, to which subjects are exposed or with which subjects are
treated in the study and the route of exposure to these materials:
<P>
          Material 1: xylocaine Exposure 1: subcutaneous
<P>
d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
Human subjects are only used as donors of skin biopsies. All work involving
radiation exposure and radioisotopes is done on cells cultured from these
biopsies. The biopsy procedure involves: 1) skin sterilization with alcohol rub,
2) local anesthetic (for skin biopsy) by subcutaneous Xylocaine injection, 3)
the excision of 2-5 mm skin punch with standard dermatological procedure, 4) the
small wound will be covered with a standard bandaid dressing and normal healing
allowed to proceed. Dermatological procedures are done by a qualified
dermatologist (Dr. J.H. Epstein, Dermatology Department, UCSF, or his designated
substitute).

     The objective of the research is the characterization of the structural and
functional basis of chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and the evaluation of the
potential use of genetic markers for the diagnosis of CBD risk.
<P>
     The methodologies used will primarily involve, 1) cell isolation and
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction from peripheral blood samples to create a
cell and a DNA bank from CBD patients and healthy beryllium-exposed individuals,
2) in vitro experiments of beryllium presentation to T-cells derived from CBD
patients to evaluate the role of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II
molecules and particularly of the HLA-DP Glu69 polymorphism, 3) DNA molecular
typing for the identification of the CBD-associated HLA-DP Glu69 polymorphism.
<P>
     Human subjects involved in this study will not be exposed to any chemical
or radioactive substances or ionizing radiation.  Human subjects involved in
this study will be asked to undergo  venipuncture for in vitro
beryllium-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation testing (Be-LPT) and DNA studies.
Subjects with abnormal Be-LPT will undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) for diagnostic purposes. Those who
are diagnosed as CBD cases will undergo a second bronchoscopy with BAL.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from whole blood and
used in in vitro experiments of antigen presentation and generation of
beryllium-specific T-cell lines and clones. Genomic DNA will be isolated from
whole blood and used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with
primers specific for HLA-DP exon 2 and analysis of the PCR product by
hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes and direct PCR sequencing.
Study data (genetic testing data and the Be-LTT data from CBD patients and
beryllium-exposed controls transmitted to the P.I.) are stored in secured files
and locked in cabinets in a locked room in the Principal Investigator's
laboratory in Modena. Dr. Wiedemann at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(Cleveland, OH) will be responsible for safeguarding clinical data.
<P>
     Risks of participation in the first part of the study will be limited to
minor pain and bruising from blood drawing. Risks of bronchoscopy with BAL and
TBB are rare (fewer than 5% of all procedures) and consist of soreness of nose,
transient fever, mild bleeding, and bronchospasm. Pneumonias are very uncommon
(fewer than 1%) and death occurs in fewer than 0.001 percent of all
bronchoscopies.

19a. Objectives
<P>
The objective of the study is to obtain data, on dose-ranging as well as
clinical efficacy and safety, on the use of dynamic cooling during pulsed laser
treatment of PWS.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
This is a single center, open study to explore dose response relationships of
dynamic cooling at varying cryogen spurt durations during pulsed laser exposure,
and to determine safety and efficacy in treated patients having PWS.  Subjects
will be recruited from an on-site population of approximately 250 previously
laser-treated or previously untreated patients at the Beckman Laser Institute
and Medical Clinic, University of California, Irvine.  There are no limitations
in terms of skin distribution of the PWS.  Successive patient groups will be
given longer durations of the cryogen spurt (range 0-20 milliseconds) and within
each group, escalating light doses (range 5-10 J/cm2).  On each patient, test
sites will be compared and evaluated for efficacy and safety of the test doses.
Eighteen circular sites will be treated with different cryogen spurt regimes:
six sites will be treated without dynamic cooling; six adjacent sites will be
treated immediately after a 10 millisecond cryogen spurt; and six adjacent sites
will be treated immediately after a 20 millisecond cryogen spurt.
<P>
Efficacy will be determined by cryogen spurt duration/light doses necessary to
produce clinically significant blanching without adverse effects of treated PWS
sites compared to uncooled sites and untreated control sites.
<P>
19c. Not applicable.
<P>
19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
Treatment Visit<BR>
Patients will be allocated a sequential identification number and assigned to
treatment.  It should be noted after such assignment, all subjects including
drop outs must be accounted for and fully documented through withdrawal or study
completion.
<P>
In each subject, eighteen test sites on the PWS will be chosen for clinical
study.  All sites will be circular in shape, 5 mm in diameter and identified by
a skin marker.  Six sites (numbered 1,4,7,10,13,16) will be selected for
irradiation without dynamic cooling.  Six adjacent sites (numbered
2,5,8,11,14,17) will be selected for identical light doses of irradiation
immediately after a 10 millisecond cryogen spurt.  Six adjacent sites (numbered
3,6,9,12,15,18) will be selected for identical light doses of irradiation
immediately after a 20 millisecond cryogen spurt.  Before laser irradiation all
numbered sites will be photographed under standardized conditions for film,
light source and exposure.  Incremental dosages of light (range 5-10 J/cm2, in
increments of 1 J/cm2) will be applied ranging from the lowest in sites 1,2 and
3 to the highest in sites 15,16 and 17.  A surgical drape will be used to define
the study sites and to protect the remaining skin from exposure.  Subjects will
wear protective eye glasses to shield their eyes during the light treatment.
<P>
 Risks/Discomfort/Inconveniences
<P>
Possible adverse effects are as follows:<BR>
        - hypertrophic scarring<BR>
        - changes in the normal skin pigmentation or color<BR>
        - atrophy<BR>
        - induration<BR>
        - frostbite<BR>
        - local skin allergic reaction to the cryogen<BR>
Previous studies cited above using the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser for the
treatment of PWS have reported an incidence of adverse effects of less than 2%.
Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser treatment is likened to "a rubber band
snapping against the skin."  We have found the treatment to be well tolerated by
adult patients.  No local or general anesthetics are required.  Prolonged skin
exposure to the cryogen can cause frostbite.  However, the proposed application
of a  0-20 millisecond aerosol cryogen spurt is not expected to cause frostbite
and, therefore, does not constitute a significant risk to subjects participating
in this study.
<P>
The possibility of a local skin allergic reaction to the cryogen does exist and
participating subjects will be followed closely.  Skin allergic reactions will
be assessed on a five point scale:
<P>
<PRE>
SKIN ALLERGIC RESPONSE                                             SCORE
  No reaction; identical to surrounding non-irradiated skin         1
  Minimal perceptible erythema; blotchy areas of faint erythema     2
      confined to the irradiated site
  More pronounced, even bright, erythema without edema              3
  Marked erythema with edema                                        4
  Violaceous erythema with vesiculation                             5
</PRE>
<P>
Adverse Effects Reporting<BR>
Safety will also be evaluated at each visit by searching for any adverse effects
such as hypertrophic scarring, changes in the normal skin pigmentation, atrophy
or induration.  Additional photographs will be taken during the course of the
study of any adverse effects.
<P>
Adverse effects monitoring will consist of those symptoms, complaints, or
effects reported by subjects or investigators.  Subjects will be asked about
their symptoms, complaints, or adverse effects at each evaluation visit, and the
information recorded on the Adverse Experiences form.  Any severe or unexpected
adverse experiences, any increase in the frequency of adverse experiences or
death that may occur in this study will be reported immediately to the
Institutional Review Board together with an evaluation as to whether or not the
adverse experience is in any way related to the treatment.  The initial report
will be made by telephone and will be followed by a complete written report
within five working days.  The structure of the described protocol, close
clinical supervision and an awareness of the potential adverse reactions provide
a significant margin of safety for this investigation.  Vital signs monitoring
will take place only at baseline.
<P>
Informed Consent Procedures
<P>
Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects.  The principal investigator
will explain the full details of the protocol, experimental procedure, possible
side effects, risks, and complications of the treatment to each participant
before informed consent is sought and documented on the standard University of
California, Irvine consent form.  The subject will then be given the opportunity
to sign the informed consent form in the presence of the principal investigator
and a witness, who will also sign the informed consent.  The patient will be
informed that he or she may withdraw his consent at any time during the course
of the study without prejudice to further care.  The patient will be given a
copy of the informed consent to keep, and a copy will be placed as a permanent
record in the patient's medical chart.
<P>
Measures Taken To Protect The Rights/Welfare Of Subjects
<P>
Informed consent will be sought only after the participating physician explains
the full details of the protocol, possible side effects, risks and complications
to the subject.  Consent will be documented by signing the standard University
of California, Irvine, form.  Explanation will be given of all treatment
alternatives with respective advantages and disadvantages.  Complete
confidentiality will be maintained by staff physicians, nurses, and technical
support personnel. A sequential code number for each patient will be kept in a
log book and all records stored in a locked file.  Patients will be identified
only by their corresponding code numbers.  The records and results of these
studies will not be identified as pertaining to a certain patient without his or
her expressed permission to safeguard the confidentiality of the subject.  The
data assembled will be used for research purposes only to assess the efficacy of
the laser therapy and to develop optimum treatment parameters.  Study progress
will be monitored through monthly Operations Committee meetings.  These provide
the opportunity to review subject data and ensure the safety of the subjects in
the unlikely event of problem situations.

19a. Objectives
<P>
The objective of the study is to obtain data on the concentration of epidermal
melanin and fractional blood volume in human skin of patients with port wine
stain (PWS) birthmarks using visible reflectance spectroscopy (VRS).  This
non-invasive, non-contact method has great potential as a means to provide
quantitative data on the therapeutic response of PWS to laser therapy throughout
an extended treatment protocol.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FPPDL) has offered a superior approach in
therapy due to its ability to destroy selectively cutaneous blood vessels.
Light passing through the epidermis is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin
(the major chromophore in blood) in the ectatic capillaries in the upper dermis.
There, the radiant energy is converted to heat causing thermal damage and
thrombosis in the targeted vessels.  Studies show that the FPPDL produces good
results in the vast majority of pediatric and adult patients.
<P>
Prior to the institution of FPPDL treatment, a diagnostic measurement will be
made on PWS test sites and normal skin to determine the concentration of
epidermal melanin and fractional blood volume.  Standard FDA-approved treatment
using the FPPDL over a light dosage range of 2-10 J/cm2, which represents the
standard clinical practice for subjects seen at the BLIMC, will subsequently be
carried out.  Untreated areas of the PWS will serve as control (no laser
exposure).  Test sites will be observed to determine the degree of PWS
blanching.  Subjects will be evaluated at 2-3 months after laser irradiation.
All sites selected for treatment will be photographed before therapy is begun
and at each followup visit.  At the next patient visit, a second VRS record is
made.  Because the majority of the most superficial PWS blood vessels were
obliterated by the first laser treatment, the VRS record now measures a deeper
layer of PWS blood vessels and a second treatment is performed.  Proceeding in
this manner, the VRS record probes deeper and deeper layers of the PWS after the
more superficial layers are removed by each successive treatment at the same
site.
<P>
19c. Not applicable.
<P>
19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
The rationale for using VRS in the clinical management of patients with PWS is
that the technique offers a means of documenting the concentration of epidermal
melanin and fractional blood volume throughout an extended treatment protocol.
Prior to the institution of laser treatment, a diagnostic measurement will be
made on a PWS test site and normal skin to determine the concentration of
epidermal melanin and fractional blood volume.  Standard FDA-approved treatment
using the FPPDL will subsequently be carried out.  At the next patient visit, a
second VRS record is made.  Because the majority of the most superficial PWS
blood vessels were obliterated by the first laser treatment, the VRS record now
measures a deeper layer of PWS blood vessels and a second treatment is
performed.  Proceeding in this manner, the VRS record probes deeper and deeper
layers of the PWS after the more superficial layers are removed by each
successive treatment at the same site.  In conclusion, VRS offers the clinician
a direct means of documenting the concentration of epidermal melanin and
fractional blood volume throughout an extended treatment protocol.
<P>
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences
<P>
No venipuncture or other invasive procedure, such as biopsy, will be performed.
The study entails minimal risk to the subject.  The intensity of the source
light is less than that associated with the flash of commercially available
cameras.  Laser therapy of PWS has been approved by the FDA.  A physician will
be present throughout the study.
<P>
Measures Taken To Protect The Rights/Welfare Of Subjects
<P>
Informed consent will be sought only after the participating physician explains
the full details of the protocol, possible side effects, risks and complications
to the subject.  Consent will be documented by signing the standard University
of California, Irvine, form.  Explanation will be given of all treatment
alternatives with respective advantages and disadvantages.  Complete
confidentiality will be maintained by staff physicians, nurses, and technical
support personnel.  A sequential code number for each patient will be kept in a
log book and all records stored in a locked file.  Patients will be identified
only by their corresponding code numbers.  The records and results of these
studies will not be identified as pertaining to a certain patient without his or
her expressed permission to safeguard the confidentiality of the subject.  The
data assembled will be used for research purposes only to assess the efficacy of
the laser therapy and to develop optimum treatment parameters.  Study progress
will be monitored through monthly Operations Committee meetings.  These provide
the opportunity to review subject data and ensure the safety of the subjects in
the unlikely event of problem situations.

19a. Objectives
<P>
Specifying the distribution of laser energy within human skin is the first step
toward understanding and capitalizing on a variety of laser-tissue interactions.
Whether photothermal, photochemical, or photomechanical in nature, laser-tissue
interactions begin with the absorption, scattering, transmission, and reflection
of photon energy.  The spatial distribution of photon energy within human skin
specifies the required laser exposure to be delivered and the extent of
subsequent therapeutic action.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
Optical low coherence reflectometry (OLCR) or white light interferometry are
existing techniques whereby the location and relative strength of optically
scattering structures can be deduced.  Results from OLCR are analogous to
ultrasound B-scan except the imaging is performed optically instead of
acoustically.  However, OCLR is far superior to ultrasound in that the technique
is non-contact, has high sensitivity (&#62;140 dB dynamic range) and, most
importantly, exceptional spatial resolution (&#60;1 mm) in both the axial and
radial directions.  In practice, light emitted from a low coherence source is
coupled into a two beam fiber optic interferometer and split into sample and
reference paths.  Light backscattered by the test material is recombined with
that retroreflected from the reference to produce interference only for coherent
photons that have a time-of-flight difference that matches the reference-target
optical delay to within the source coherence length.
<P>
Infrared tomography (IRT) uses a fast infrared focal plane array (IR-FPA) camera
to detect temperature rises in a substrate, induced by pulsed radiation.  The
temperature rise, due to the selective optical absorption of pulsed laser light,
creates an increase in infrared (blackbody) emission which is measured by a fast
IR-FPA.  Although the use of IRT has become a topic of great interest in the
physical sciences to image subsurface cracks in aircraft fuselage due to metal
fatigue, the application of this modality to determine the initial
space-dependent temperature increase in absorbing subsurface chromophores in
human skin immediately following pulsed laser exposure is novel.
<P>
19c. Not applicable.
<P>
19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
We propose to use OLCR and IRT to measure the absorption, scattering,
transmission, and reflection of photon energy within human skin.  Discarded skin
samples will be collected by Dr. Bruce Achauer, Associate Professor of Plastic
Surgery, University of California, Irvine, from patients undergoing elective
rhytidoplasty ("face lift") and abdominoplasty ("tummy tuck") surgical
procedures.  The epidermal and dermal papillary layers will be non-destructively
isolated using a standard technique developed in the Department of Dermatology,
University of California, Irvine.  After isolation, each layer will be slowly
heated with a temperature controlled gel pack.  The pliable gel pack will allow
good contact and insulation of the tissue sample under test.  Using OLCR and
IRT, the absorption, scattering, transmission, and reflection of photon energy
within human skin will be measured.  The experimental procedure will be
conducted with a number of skin samples so that statistically significant
conclusions can be made.
<P>
Every effort will be made to obtain skin samples from the appropriate gender and
minority/ethnic background representation that reflects the general population
distribution seen at the University of California Irvine Medical Center.  This
protocol is being filed as Exempt Research under Category #4  because the work
involves the collection of data from discarded pathological specimens by the
investigator in such a manner that the subjects cannot be identified directly or
through identifiers linked to the subjects.

The objectives of this study are to determine the safety and effectiveness of
the clinical use of the excimer laser in treating the human cornea.
<P>
19b.  Methodology
<P>
The study measures:  (1) refraction and visual acuity, (2) shape of the cornea,
(3) complications, and (4) patient satisfaction to achieve the following:
<P>
1.  Assess the safety of the procedure during the immediate and long term
postoperative periods by numerous complete ocular examinations of the treated
eye.
<P>
2.  Determine the effectiveness of the excimer laser as a surgical device for
the treatment of mild to severe ametropia.  Patient's refraction will be
evaluated to determine the quality and stability of vision and the associated
improvement in visual function.
<P>
19c.  Not applicable.
<P>
19d.  Possible risks are glare or light sensitivity, fluctuating changes in
vision, or repeat surgery.  Vision may be worse.  There may be a slight amount
of discomfort usually relieve by aspirin or Tylenol.  Patients may experience a
milky appearance to the eye, a small amount of bleeding, or a small ulcer or
infection.  A small perforation of the cornea may occur, but it is unlikely.
New complications may be observed as the surgical procedure develops in the
future and long term effects of the excimer laser are known.  There is also a
possibility of other complications due to the anesthesia, drug reactions, or
other factors which may involve other parts of the body.

The broad long term objective of the proposed research is the development of
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for application in the clinical management of
patients with port wine stain (PWS) malformations.
<P>
19b.  Methodology
<P>
PDT involves the use of an exogenous drug which is concentrated in a targeted
tissue.  When irradiated at wavelengths specifically absorbed by the drug,
selective destruction of agents for imaging and eradication of neoplastic
diseases has become a topic of great interest in the medical field.  The
application and usefulness of this modality for the treatment of PWS is novel.

<P>
19d.  Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
Phototherapy is commonly associated with some degree of local burning, erythema,
and edema of the treatment site.  Necrosis of the treatment site is a rare event
which can be minimized by preliminary testing with low incident light doses and
subsequent dose escalation based on previous cutaneous response.  Subjects will
be fully informed regarding the potential for skin photosensitivity and will be
provided with prepared photosensitivity educational materials explaining to them
in detail precautions to avoid this side effect as well as a resource person to
contact should problems arise.

19a.     Objectives
<P>
Port wine stain (PWS) is a congenital vasculopathy that occurs most commonly on
the face and neck.  The chief complication of PWS is psychological disability,
particularly in young children. Personality development is adversely affected in
a large percentage of patients due to the negative reaction of others to a
"marked" person.  PWS has been treated in the past with an array of therapeutic
modalities including skin grafting, radiation therapy, cryosurgery,
electrocautery, sclerosing agents, tattooing and cosmetic camouflage.  All of
these have met with limited success, unpredictable results, or serious
complications.  The laser provided the first major advance in therapy for PWS
and has been used extensively in the past two decades.  Light of the appropriate
wavelength is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin and converted to heat,
causing thermal damage and thrombosis in the targeted vessels.  However, because
of the complex nature and individual variability in the optical properties of
human skin and vasculopathy, optimal clinical results (i.e., significant
blanching) are not always forthcoming.  Presently, all patients are treated with
incident doses of light based on the clinical judgment of the physician without
taking these important tissue properties into consideration.  Such lack of
specificity in choosing the light dose for therapy is the primary reason for
poor clinical results or complications, such as hypertrophic scarring or changes
in the normal skin pigmentation, seen after laser therapy.  There is a definite
need for non-invasive measurements to be made on each patient to predict the
threshold light dose that causes damage to the normal overlying epidermis.  It
is obvious that a method that considers individual variations in the optical
properties of the skin, on a case by case basis, would have decided advantages
over existing methodology.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
Pulsed photothermal radiometry is a non-invasive temperature measurement, using
remote thermal and optical sensing techniques. PPTR uses a fast infrared
detector to measure surface temperature rises induced by pulsed radiation.  In
practice, a pulsed laser is used to produce transient heating of the object
under study and the subsequent temperature rise creates an increase in infrared
(blackbody) emission that is measured by the detector.  In this case, absorption
of the laser pulse produces an initial temperature "jump" ("T-jump") which
denotes the temperature of the sample surface.  The initial "T-jump" can then be
used to calculate the epidermal absorption coefficient (a). Once a has been
determined, because there is a linear relationship between the incident light
dose and the resulting "T-jump", "T-jumps" at a variety of light doses may be
predicted.
<P>
When the epidermal surface of the skin is irradiated by a laser pulse such that
the "T-jump" is 70 degrees C, the result is epidermal denaturation leading to
necrosis.  For temperatures in excess of 140 degrees C, the result is explosive
vaporization of the epidermis.  The physician must avoid both such phenomena
during PWS therapy otherwise hypertrophic scarring or changes in the normal skin
pigmentation will result.  Thus, prior to starting therapy, the physician will
know the maximum incident light dose that may be delivered without damaging the
normal overlying epidermis. These thresholds will vary from subject to subject,
site to site. However, since temperature can be monitored on a pulsebypulse
basis, immediate feedback will be provided if damage to the epidermis is likely
to occur.
<P>
A PPTR instrument is on site at the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic.
A fast infrared detector senses the surface skin temperature as a function of
time and the resulting signal is displayed on the oscilloscope.
<P>
Initial "T-jump" measurements will be made on PWS patient's skin at low incident
(subtherapeutic) light doses.  The initial "T-jump" will then be used to
calculate the epidermal absorption coefficient (a) for each patient.  Once a
has been determined, the threshold incident light dose that results in epidermal
damage will be established.  Thus, before starting therapy, the physician will
know the maximum incident light dose that may be delivered without damaging the
normal overlying epidermis.  Laser treatment will then proceed normally with the
physician being careful to use an incident light dose far below that predicted
by PPTR to cause epidermal damage.
<P>
19c. Not applicable.

19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
Patients with (PWS) will be enrolled in this study from the population seen at
the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic. Patient enrollment will include
both sexes, all ethnic backgrounds and all age groups.  Only pregnant females
will be excluded.
<P>
Measures Taken to Protect the Rights and Welfare of Subjects
<P>
Informed consent will be sought only after the participating physician explains
the full details of the protocol, possible side effects, risks, and
complications to the patient, or in the case of a minor, parent or legal
guardian.  Consent will be documented by signing the standard University of
California, Irvine form.
<P>
Complete confidentiality will be maintained by staff physicians, nurses, and
technical support personnel.  The data taken will be used for research purposes
only to assess the efficacy of the laser therapy and to develop optimum
treatment parameters.  Study progress will be monitored through monthly
Operations Committee meetings.  This provides the opportunity to review patient
data and ensure the safety of the patients in the unlikely event of problem
situations.  A patient may leave the study at any time.
<P>
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences
<P>
No venipuncture or other invasive procedure, such as biopsy, will be performed.
The study entails minimal risk to the patient. The irradiation of the skin by
laser light for the purposes of making skin temperature measurements is painless
since subtherapeutic doses of light are sufficient.  Flashlamp pulsed dye laser
therapy of PWS has been approved by the FDA.  A physician will be present
throughout the conduct of the study.

19a. Objectives
<P>
To determine the safety and efficacy of topically applied dihematoporphyrin
ether (DHE) in the photodynamic treatment (PDT) of cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN) using fixed DHE doses and applications schedules and a variable
dose of 630 nm red light delivered by an argon pumped dye laser.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
Between February 1993 and April 1994, 24 non-pregnant women with a histologic
diagnosis of CIN were enrolled.  All patients had lesions involving at least 25%
of the cervix that were colposcopically visible.  Using a cervical cap, 2 ml of
a 1% solution of DHE (Photofrin) in a 4% Azone and isopropyl alcohol vehicle
were applied to the cervix for 24 hours prior to PDT.  An argon pumped dye laser
providing light at 630 nm was then used to perform PDT.  Light was coupled into
a 400 um silica fiber optic terminating in a microlens which focused the laser
radiation onto a circular field of uniform light intensity perpendicular to the
tissue.  The entire ectocervix was treated in a single field including a margin
of 3-5 mm of normal cervix.  Using a constant power density (150 mW/cm2) to
avoid thermal injury, the density of the PDT energy was increased every 4
patients in a phase I study (40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 J/cm2).
<P>
19c. See 19b. Methodology.
<P>
19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
The risks for this treatment include a possible discomfort from the tissue
biopsy; a burning irritation or possible allergic reaction, such as a skin rash
and itching from the DHE solution application, and a feeling of warmth in the
treatment area where the laser light is administered.  When DHE is injected
intravenously, it distributes throughout the body tissues and causes a tendency
to sunburn normal skin when exposed to bright light up to periods of four weeks
after injection.  Since in this study, the drug is being applied to the surface
of the body in much small quantities than with intravenous injection, the
photosensitivity of skin in other parts of the body is not to be expected.
Accidental exposure of the eyes to laser light could result in eye injury or
loss of vision.  Eye goggles will be worn during therapy to avoid eye injury.
DHE can also cause staining of garments that it comes in contact with.  The
patient will be informed of these potential risks.  For the blood tests, there
is the risk of possible discomfort and bruise at the site and swelling and
possibly infection as indicated in the informed consent.
<P>
The collection of medical information for this study will be accomplished with
the strictest adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  An
identification number for each patient will be kept on file, and all records
will be filed in a locked cabinet.  Patients will be identified only by their
corresponding identification number.

at a maximum of 10 sites followed for two years.
<P>
19b. Methodology
<P>
Excimer laser surgery is an investigational procedure.  Conventional clinical
examination techniques will be employed to evaluate each patient.  The clinical
status of the eye, the presence or absence of pre-existing ocular pathology, and
the presence of any complications will be assessed before laser surgery, at the
time of surgery, and at each postoperative evaluation.
<P>
19c. Not applicable.
<P>
19d. Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
Possible risks are glare or light sensitivity, fluctuating changes in vision, or
repeat surgery.  Vision may be worse.  Patients will experience pain during the
first 24 to 72 hours following treatment.  Analgesics are prescribed for this
post-operative discomfort.  Patients may experience a milky appearance to the
eye, a small amount of bleeding, or a small ulcer or infection.  Although
unlikely, a small perforation of the cornea may occur.  Other complications may
include:  corneal edema; corneal scarring; corneal infection/ulceration;
hyphema; patient discomfort; glare; cataract; bacterial keratitis; foreign body
sensation; corneal epithelial defect; iritis; viral kerato conjuctivitis; BCVA
post-operatively worse than pre-operatively at final visit.  New complications
may be observed as the surgical procedure develops in the future and the long
term effects of the excimer laser are not known.  There is a possiblity of other
complications due to the anesthesia, drug reactions, or other factors which may
involve other parts of the body.

The objective of this project is to construct normalized cDNA libraries from
human tissues as a resource to the community to expedite gene identification and
mapping. Total cellular RNA extracted from human tissues (obtained for purposes
other than those of this project) is used for construction of cDNA libraries
that are directionally cloned in a phagemid vector.  cDNA libraries are then
normalized according to procedures that we have developed (Soares et al., 1994:
PNAS 91,9228-9232). In addition we are attempting to develop methods for
construction of full-length cDNA libraries.

        The ocular radiation protection standards formulated by National Council on
Radiation Protection (NCRP) and the International Council on Radiation
Protection (ICRP) are all predicated on the assumption that radiation cataracts
are deterministic and only appear when a high dose threshold is exceeded.
However, several lines of evidence from experimental and epidemiologic studies
strongly suggest a stochastic basis for radiation cataract.  If this is the case
then the radiation safety standards set for workers as well as the general
population may be inadequate.  Furthermore, if radiation cataract is proven to
be stochastic -- implying that some fraction of a population will develop them
at even low doses -- its utility for dose reconstruction will be enhanced.
Therefore it is important for the risk assessment community to know whether
cataract formation is indeed a stochastic response to radiation, a question
which can be resolved by studying a dose-defined subset of the Chernobyl
population, the clean-up workers or so-called "Liquidators".
<P>
        In collaboration with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, three Institutes in
Kiev, and six  sites outside of Kiev, we plan a 12,000-subject cohort study with
a nested case-control analysis of the April 26, 1986-February, 1987 Liquidators
to assess the distribution of radiation cataracts as a function of dose.  The
follow-up involves biennial non-invasive slit-examinations of the lens for
cataract development.  The methodology does not deviate from that which
ordinarily would be applied during a standard ophthalmological examination.  A
questionnaire will be used to attempt to document the existence of potential
confounders to cataract development.
<P>
        The Chernobyl population, by its size, dose distribution and accessibility
presents the first real opportunity to address  fully the question of whether or
not radiation cataract should continue to be viewed as deterministic.  For the
same reasons it will permit the determination of risk for cataract development
from radiation exposure.  In addition, it can supply the data necessary to
determine the true potential for using cataract development as a tool to assess
populations at risk and help reduce uncertainties in retrospective dose
reconstructions across populations.

A.  Objectives:<BR>
     The focus of the present study has been to optimize the in-vitro uptake and
quantitation of H2TCPP, and then evaluate the potential of 5,10,15,20 tetrakis
(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (H2TCPP) as a biomarker of early (pre-malignant) lung
cancer.
<P>
B.  Methods:<BR>
     Two archives of sputum specimens collected at progressive degrees of
morphologic dysplasia along with corresponding histologically confirmed lung
tumors are available to confirm the link between a potential biomarker (i.e.,
H2TCPP) and standard, pathologically confirmed lung cancer.  These archives were
collected during an 8-year National Institutes of Health/National Cancer
Institute (NIH/NCI) early lung cancer detection trial at the Johns Hopkins Lung
Project (JHLP) and a pilot lung cancer screening study among Chinese Yunnan Tin
Corp (YTC) miners,  respectively.
<P>
     1.  Using video-enhanced transmitted light and fluorescent microscopy, we
acquired shading-corrected images of cells, stained and unstained with H2TCPP,
from freshly harvested human tissue culture cell lines of epidermoid American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HTB58, adenocarcinoma (ATCC Calu-3) and
undifferentiated small cell (ATCC OH3, H345) lung cancer, plus archived human
specimens.  We  established the optimal conditions under which neoplastic and
non-neoplastic cells take up H2TCPP by varying reagent concentration,
temperature, incubation time, and  pH (acidity).
<P>
     2.  Using optimal technique, we compared three biomarkers for their ability
to distinguish three groups of cells:  normal sputum cells only, ATCC lung
cancer cells only and 1:1 mixture of tumor and sputum cells.
<P>
     3.  Fluorescent staining methods:<BR>
          a.  7-amino Actinomycin-D (7-AAD) <BR>
               7-AAD is a membrane-impermeant fluorescent DNA intercalator which
binds particularly well to Guanine Cytosine (GC)-rich regions of DNA.  Upon
binding, 7-AAD undergoes a spectral shift resulting in an emission maximum at
655 nm after excitation at 555 nm.  Following a phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
wash, cells are resuspended in cold PBS and fixed by addition of freshly
prepared 2% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of
0.25%.  Fixation at 4 degrees Celsius (C) for 1 hour is followed by
permeabilization with 0.2% between-20 in PBS for 15 minutes.  After fixation and
permeabilization, DNA was stained with 7-AAD by 30 minute incubation of cells in
PBS containing 25 ug/ml of 7-AAD.
<P>
          b.  5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (H2TCPP)<BR>
                Cell spreads and cytospin preparations are fixed in 95% ethanol
for 10 minutes, then rinsed two times with PBS.  Under reduced ambient light,
H2TCPP is applied in concentrations from 50-200 ug/ml to slides maintained in a
dark humid chamber for 4 to 24 hours, at temperatures from 37 to 4 degrees C.
At the conclusion of incubation, excess porphyrin is removed by 2 quick PBS
washes.  Slides are then dehydrated, mounted in glycerol, cover slipped and
sealed with colorless nail enamel.
<P>
          c.   Fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibody (703D4) to alpha-2,
beta-1 hnRNP, p31.<BR>
                Monoclonal antibody 703D4, which binds to a tumor-associated
hnRNP, p31, was applied to cells which have been paraformaldehyde fixed and
permeabilized as described above.  Cells are suspended in a 1:50 dilution of Mab
703D4 and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C.  After washing with PBS two times,
the cells are resuspended in 1:50 dilution of biotinylated horse anti-mouse
Immunoglobulin G (IgG), incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and again
washed with PBS.  Cell pellets are then resuspended in a 1:50 dilution of
Fluorescein avidin D, incubated for 30 minutes at 4 deg C in the dark and washed
in PBS prior to measurement of FITC fluorescence.
<P>
C.   There is no human subject contact with chemicals, radioactive substances or
ionizing radiation in the present study.
<P>
D.  Involvement of Human Subjects
<P>
     1.  Procedures involving human subjects.
<P>
     Human specimens used in the present study were collected by the JHLP,
conducted from 4/71 through 11/87, and by the YTC, from 3/91 through 9/93.  In
both studies, an annual sputum induction was performed consisting of a 15-minute
inhalation of hypertonic saline performed before a laminar-flow hood.  Fresh
sputum was smeared on glass slides for Papanicolaou staining and interpretation.
The remaining sputum was homogenized, concentrated and placed in Saccomanno's
preservative solution using standard techniques. A total of 4,545 sputum
specimens from 953 participants are presently stored in 30 cc screw-top glass
bottles, each containing the specimen in a 2% carbowax/50% alcohol
(Saccomanno's) preservative solution, arranged in boxes of 50.  Box and bottle
location, specimen cytological interpretation, participant identification and
outcome are available on a computerized data base.
<P>
     2.  Risks to human subjects.
<P>
     It is very unlikely that research subjects will experience side effects
from performing the sputum induction procedure.  Occasionally, individuals may
experience transient shortness of breath or wheezing as a result of
induction/deep coughing.

This research project was carried out to assess the role of particle size,
respiratory tract dimensions and breathing properties in the deposition of
environmental airborne particles in the human respiratory tract.  The human
subjects inhaled a cloud of inert particles (di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate) containing
99m-Technetium radioactive material during the experiment.  Subjects performed
breathing maneuvers and had a sound measurement made to determine their
respiratory tract status.  The breathing test required that a modified
respirator face mask be worn during the procedure and a pressure tube placed
comfortably in the mouth.  Measurement of nose dimensions with an acoustic
reflection device was performed; this procedure involved placing a metal tube
comfortably into one nostril for a period for less than one minute while an
undetectable sound pulse was generated.  The subjects inhaled a cloud of
particles for a period not in excess of two minutes.  The inhalation of these
particles does not produce noticeable irritation or discomfort except for the
possible slight drying of the airway mucosa.  Following inhalation the subjects
were seated in front of a gamma camera that locates the particles in the airways
and their movement.  The radiation exposure a subject receives from
participating in this study is equivalent to an exposure of 0.02 rems to the
whole body. This procedure gives subjects about 4% of the annual limit
(excluding medical procedures) of radiation exposure.  Female subjects were only
allowed to participate in the study if they were certain that they were not
pregnant.   Di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate used in this study is inert and is safe for
inhalation studies.

a. Objectives
<P>
  Our goal is to measure the pattern of point mutations, both spontaneous and
due to particular mutagens, in human DNA sequences.  Our research is based on
the hypothesis that this pattern or mutational spectrum in human tissues will
permit discovery of the primary causes of mutations in humans.
<P>
b. Methodology
<P>
  Our methodology involves the use of Constant Denaturant Capillary
Electrophoresis (CDCE) in combination with high fidelity (hifi) polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). With this technique, we are able to measure any point mutation
in a 100 base pairs (bp) DNA sequence. This technique has a current sensitivity
of 2E-6 with human multicopy mitochondrial DNA. We are not only able to identify
mutant DNA sequences, but also recover them for sequencing.
<P>
c. Human Subject Exposure
<P>
  Human subjects are NOT exposed to any ionizing radiation, radioactive
substance, or chemical substance.
<P>
d. Involvemment of Human Subjects
<P>
1. B and T-lymphocytes are obtained from blood of healthy volunteers. Samples
are identified by code to maintain confidentiality, and the identity of the code
is only available to the principal investigator. Lymphocytes are isolated from
10 ml of blood by Ficol-Hypaque centrifugation. The lymphocytes are then either
grown in culture (in vitro spectrum) or directly analyzed (in vivo spectrum).
Lymphocytes are grown in culture with defined media, serum, crude IL-2, and
irradiated stimulator cells.
<P>
  The DNA is isolated from lymphocytes by Protease K, RNase, and restriction
digestion followed by spooling of the DNA with ethanol. The DNA is then exposed
to a combination of CDCE and hifi PCR followed by sequencing of the mutant DNA.
<P>
2.  NO risks are taken on the part of the volunteers, except for the mild
discomfort from the 10ml blood donation.

  Human subjects are NOT exposed to any ionizing radiation, radioactive
substance, or chemical substance.
<P>
d.  Involvement of Human Subjects:<BR>
1.  Tissue samples from specific organs are obtained from laboratories of
individual collaborators. These samples are excess tissue that would otherwise
be discarded. They are obtained from surgical procedures unrelated to our
research. No extra procedures are performed in order to obtain these tissues.
Tissue samples are identified by code to maintain confidentiality, and the
identity of the code is only available to the principal investigator. Only the
sex, age, race, tissue type, and date of sample are available to researchers.
<P>
  The DNA from each tissue is isolated by Protease K, RNAse, and restriction
digestion followed by spooling of the DNA with ethanol. The DNA is then exposed
to a combination of CDCE and hifi PCR followed by sequencing of the mutant DNA.
<P>
 2.  NO risks are taken on the part of the tissue donors and no extra procedures
are performed on subjects in order to obtain tissue samples for our research.

(a) The objective of this research is to determine whether human fibroblasts in
culture exhibit a cell cycle sensitivity to transformation by ionizing or
neutron radiation. (b) This is carried out by synchronizing a special strain of
human fibroblast cells (MSU-1.1) developed in this laboratory and then exposing
them to radiation at different points in the cell cycle. The cells are then
grown for a few days and then assayed for their ability to form foci. Cells
isolated from foci form tumors in athymic mice about 30% of the time.  MSU-1.1
cells do not form tumors. Results so far indicate that human fibroblasts are
hypersensitive to transformation by ionizing radiation  during S phase which is
quite different than the hypersensitive phase observed in mouse fibroblasts.
They are hypersensitive during G2/M. (c)  Since the experiments are carried out
on cells in culture, the human who was the donor of the cells used is not
exposed to any chemical or radioactive material. (d) This proposal makes use of
human fibroblasts in culture. They were originally obtained from foreskin tissue
of a newborn with the written permission of the parents. The circumcision was
undertaken for medical reasons at the explicit wish of the parents.

The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) is a bi-national organization
dedicated to the study of the long-term health effects of radiation in the
survivors of the atomic bombs detonated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
RERF, which superseded the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in 1975, is funded
equally by the governments of Japan and the United States.  Funding from the
United States is by contract from the Department of Energy to the National
Academy of Sciences.  The current contract between DOE and NAS for the 5-year
period April 1, 1990 through March 31, 1995 has been extended for a sixth year,
April 1, 1995 through March 31, 1996.  This project had 72 active protocols
during fiscal year 1995.
<P>
At the time of the renewal of this contract in 1990, the NAS Committee to Review
Human Subjects reviewed the application and determined that the RERF protocol
met the requirements of 45 CFR 46 and gave approval for continued NAS
participation.  The arrangement for sending funds to the RERF via the State
Department was implemented and arranged by the Office of International Health
Studies, Office of Health Studies, Environment, Safety and Health, at the
Department of Energy. Please contact Mr. Timothy Fox for details.
<P>
All the atomic bomb survivors in the Adult Health Study undergo standard medical
examination on a voluntary basis, biennially.  These participants receive chest
x-rays and ultrasonography examination (when necessary), as well as blood
sampling for standard tests.  With the participant's approval, some of the blood
is used for a variety of research purposes.  Serum is stored for future
epidemiological studies, lymphocytes may be analyzed cytologically to determine
chromosome aberration, red blood cells are examined to screen for somatic gene
mutations in order to assess the effects of the atomic bomb.  Immunological
assays are also performed in vitro to determine if the A-bomb radiation affects
the specificity of lymphocytes response over time and aging.  Blood cells are
also cryogenically preserved for future epidemiological and biochemical studies.
Lymphocytes from 1000 families (mother, father, child(ren)) are stored for
future research in order to assess the frequency, in the progeny, of induced DNA
changes that resulted from mutations in the germ cells of the parental
generation from A-bomb exposure.  About 800 family (cells) have been collected.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and feasibility of boron neutron capture
therapy (BNCT) of peripheral melanoma and intracranial melanoma metastases and
glioblastoma.  To identify via a phase-1 dose-escalation protocol the
radiotoxicity threshold of BNCT.
<P>
METHODOLOGY:  BNCT implemented using boronated phenylalanine (BPA) and
epithermal neutrons from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Research Reactor.  Peripheral sites have been irradiated prior to irradiating
the central nervous system (CNS) for subject safety reasons.
<P>
IONIZING RADIATION AND DRUG TOXICITY: Subjects are exposed to controlled doses
of high-LET (linear energy transfer) ionizing radiation by the BNCT procedure,
and to potential drug toxicity from the administration of the BPA drug.
<P>
HUMAN SUBJECT INVOLVEMENT: Subjects with distal lesions receive a computer aided
tomography (CT) scan for treatment planning purposes, a baseline
electrocardiogram (EKG), vital signs tests, hepatic function studies, a chest
x-ray, and blood and electrolyte studies.  A test dose of BPA for
pharmacokinetic and distribution studies is administered orally to the subject.
Subjects  then receive an additional oral dose of BPA followed by irradiation of
the tumor site with epithermal neutrons from the  (MIT) Research Reactor.  This
is repeated for four "fractions" (sessions separated by 1 or 2 days).  Subjects
then return at periodic intervals for followup examinations.
<P>
RISKS:  Ionizing radiation risk, BPA drug toxicity, risks of infection from
needle sticks and biopsy procedures, risks of the BNCT radiation burden

The same as protocol 46,176 / #2 except that proximal as opposed to only distal
lesions are admitted.  A minor degree of additional risk is involved due to the
collateral irradiation of sensitive organs and tissues.  Such additional risks
will be assessed for each individual subject prior to administration of BNCT.

Iododeoxyuridine, radiolabeled with Iodine-131 and Iodine-125 was injected into
the hepatic artery of patients with colorectal  cancer. The purpose of the study
was to obtain biodistribution and biokinetic data, in order to understand the
dosimietry of IUDR in radiolabeled form.  As well, the biology of targeting
clearance was also determined.  Kinetics were determined using a conjugate view
gamma camera approach.

     The primary objectives of this project are to identify underground uranium
miners who are at high risk for the development of lung cancer, to monitor
sputum cytologic samples from these individuals for morphologic changes
consistent with a neoplastic process, and to continue collecting epidemiological
data for inclusion in the Saccomanno Uranium Miner Archive.
<P>
     Cytologic surveillance continues on a group of 276 uranium miners who show
abnormal cells in sputum samples.  Sputum collection kits are sent to this study
group on a routine basis as determined by their degree of cellular abnormality.
The collected samples are assigned accession numbers corresponding to a
confidential miner identification source.  The samples are processed and
evaluated using current state-of-the-art laboratory procedures.  The final
diagnosis is communicated to the subjects' primary care physicians for
appropriate follow-up measures.  Once a diagnosis of primary bronchiogenic
carcinoma has been confirmed, either cytologically or pathologically, the
subject is entered into the tumor registry under a non-identifying number.  All
cytologic and histologic specimens are archived as well as subject demographics,
clinical and ancillary reports, and subject consent forms.
<P>
     At no time are these subjects either intentionally or unintentionally
exposed to any of the following substances: Ionizing radiation, Radioactive
substances, or any other chemical substance.
<P>
     The study subjects are referred by their attending physicians, other
enrolled subjects, or by self-referral.  Once the initial inquiry is made by the
miner or the miner's physician, an information packet detailing the study is
given to the potential subject.  This usually follows extensive dialog with the
miner, which includes information regarding eligibility and project protocols.
The Institutional Review Board's (IRB) approved subject consent form is included
in the packet.  After the subject has returned the signed written consent form,
he or she receives a sputum specimen container kit, which includes instructions
for obtaining an optimal sample by spitting any material coughed up from deep in
the lungs into the bottle.  Upon return of the sample to the laboratory, it is
processed and evaluated, and a diagnosis is given.  The results are communicated
to the attending physician.  As with any other laboratory test, appropriate
follow-up is the responsibility of the physician.  None of the above-stated
procedures require involvement with the subject in any way other than that which
is acceptable in a routine sputum cytologic examination for clinical medical
monitoring.
<P>
    The risk, as defined in the Definition Section ruling of the OPRR Reports
"Protection of Human Subjects, Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 -
Protection of Human Subjects" - Section 46.102, part (i), is minimal, meaning
"the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in research
(the acquisition of a sputum sample) are not greater in and of themselves than
those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine
physical... examination---" (e.g., routine coughing up of mucus material and
spitting it into a handkerchief or tissue to clear airways.)
<P>
     The risks are felt to be minimal and, thus, the potential benefits are felt
to far outweigh the possible risk factor.  The benefits, as stated in the
research proposal are as follows:
<P>
    a.   Research will continue to provide a vast amount of invaluable data and
material for epidemiological studies.
<P>
    b.   In following these cellular changes that identify the probable
progression to lung cancer, it is possible to diagnose occult lung cancer at a
stage when it is curable.
<P>
    c.  To help develop laboratory tests that may lead to a better understanding
of lung cancer, its causes, and, hopefully, earlier detection.

The main emphasis of this project is the morphologic diagnosis of early lung
cancer lesions.  Current studies at St. Mary's Hospital reveal improved survival
utilizing sputum cytology, while national statistics for early detection fail to
duplicate this finding.  An opportunity exists to better understand lung
tumorigenesis in uranium miners by molecular analysis of gene alterations in
both preneoplastic and malignant neoplasms.  Our objectives are to examine the
genetic alterations associated with the initiation and progression of
radon-induced lung cancer.  Genetic alterations will be identified in both
preneoplastic lesions and malignant neoplasms to ascertain the stage of tumor
development at which protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are mutated/lost.
Three long-term goals are as follows: 1) To detect early genetic and/or cellular
alterations which ultimately could lead to diagnostic modalities for the early
detection of lung cancer; 2)  To determine the mechanism of radon-induced lung
cancer in uranium miners; and 3) To utilize data on uranium miners to assess the
effect of low level radon exposure in the general population. Our research will
generate comprehensive tracheal bronchial trees from lung cancer patients to aid
in the characterization of lung tumor progression. Nonsmall cell lung carcinomas
and their precursor lesions will be examined from the following groups of
patients:  Group I -- uranium miners who were smokers; Group II -- uranium
miners who were not smokers; and Group III -- smokers who were not miners.
Comparisons between Groups I and III will generate data to address the
hypothesis that radon exposure plus smoking either induces different genetic
lesions or induces lesions at different stages of tumor development than does
smoking alone.  Observations made on Group II will either confirm or refute the
comparisons between Groups I and III.
<P>
Human Subjects:
<P>
     This proposed study has been approved by the St. Mary's Hospital and
Medical Center Institutional Review Board.  Archival material on patients
diagnosed with primary bronchogenic carcinoma will make up this study group.
The selection of these study subjects will primarily include men older than 50
years of age based on the known demographic characteristics of uranium mine
workers.  Subjects will also reflect the ethnic and racial composition of the
mining industry of the Colorado Plateau.  The clinical subjects chosen for
parallel studies will be selected from the St. Mary's Hospital total patient
base.  The hospital does not discriminate on the basis of age, race, color,
creed, or ethnic background.
<P>
     The subjects for this proposal will include patients who have
histologically confirmed primary bronchogenic carcinoma, the majority having
documentation of radon progeny exposure.
<P>
        1.      Underground Uranium Workers:  Subjects enrolled in the ongoing underground
uranium miner lung cancer surveillance program will be considered for the study.
Cases will be selected as to histologic classification, availability tissue
samples and documented smoking, occupational exposure and other risk factors for
lung cancer.
<P>
        2.      Clinical specimens:  Subjects who have surgical resections at St. Mary's
Hospital or the Veterans Administration Hospital in Grand Junction for primary
bronchogenic carcinoma will be considered for this study.  Cases will be
selected as to histological classification, tissue samples, documented smoking
history, occupational exposure, and other risk factors for lung cancer.
<P>
        3.      Risks:  Archived biological samples will be used in this study.
<P>
        4.      Procedures of protection of "Patient Rights" regarding the use of archival
samples:  Confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  Samples used for
analysis will be coded with the "Early Lesion Study" (ELS) prefix, year of study
enrollment, and enrollment number (ELS-93-000).  Subject keys will be maintained
in a subject file, which will be stored with all study information in a locked
cabinet with controlled access.
<P>
        5.      Risk/Benefit:  This study provides lung cancer patients and their families
with a unique opportunity to better understand the molecular makeup and possible
pathways to lung cancer genesis.  The knowledge gained from such studies is
critical to the issues of environmental exposure -- both in the work place and
in the home -- from radon progeny, its cause and effect on the development of
this disease.  Any important findings related to a specific individual that may
prove critical to the health maintenance of his family will be communicated to
his physician by the principal investigator with a complete and thorough
explanation as best we understand the information at that time.
<P>
        6.      Risk Manager:  In the event a subject or a family member questions the use
of archival tissue samples or the results of such studies, the person(s)
involved will be directed to the Risk Manager's office for consultation.

     Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and
Western Europe.  Improvements in early detection coupled with the identification
of a gene or genes which predispose individuals to lung cancer could help reduce
the death rate for this disease.  There is considerable evidence that genetic
predisposition may be an important factor in the development of lung cancer.
First, only 20% of smokers develop lung cancer.  Second, genetic epidemiologic
studies of familial lung cancer imply the involvement of a susceptibility
gene(s).  It was hypothesized that the genetic predisposition to lung cancer is
expressed only in individuals who smoke or are exposed to other environmental
insults such as radon.  Confirmation of a genetic predisposition for lung cancer
can be accomplished by linkage analysis to localize the putative susceptibility
gene(s) to a specific chromosomal region(s).  The strength of linkage analysis
is dependent upon the establishment of lung-cancer-susceptible kindreds for
which tissue samples are available and the history of tumor incidence exists for
two, preferably more, generations.  Four goals of this proposal are: 1) to
generate pedigrees for lung-cancer-susceptible families and collect tissue
samples from family members for genotyping analysis; 2) to genotype DNA from
family members with appropriate markers; 3) to perform linkage analysis with the
genotyping data to identify a potential locus (or loci) that may be involved in
lung cancer susceptibility; and 4) to begin to identify the susceptibility
gene(s).  The long-term objective is to characterize the susceptibility gene(s)
and develop blood tests to identify individuals who are predisposed to develop
lung cancer.
<P>
Human Subjects:
<P>
     This study was approved by the St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center
Institutional Review Board on August 11, 1993 and is being submitted for
approval by the Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Institutional Review Board.
The hospitals serve wide geographic regions and do not discriminate on the basis
of age, race, color, creed, or ethnic background.
<P>
     Study subjects will be members of lung-cancer-susceptible families and
families must contain more than one first- and/or second-generation blood
related member that had a tissue diagnosed, primary lung carcinoma.  Study
subjects will be asked to sign a medical release of information form and will be
interviewed in order to obtain accurate medical, smoking, occupational, family
histories, and genealogical information.  Potential lung cancer families have
been and will continue to be selected from the uranium worker's study, from
clinical pathology patients at St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center, and from
information obtained from primary care physicians and oncologists.  Similar
procedures will be utilized at the Medical College of Ohio, Toledo.  Permission
for subject contact will originate with primary care physician and/or other
family members.  The purpose and nature of the study will be explained to the
family contact person and all other potential family members by a scientist or
an appointed research staff member.
<P>
     All tissue samples including blood, paraffin embedded tissues, cytological
specimens, and fresh frozen tissue samples will be collected from study subjects
for research purposes.  All information and specimens will be obtained and
handled in a confidential manner.  The risk of unauthorized persons having
access is minimal.  Enrollment is voluntary and any enrollee may terminate his
or her participation in the study without any consequences.  Confidentiality of
all subjects' clinical, occupational, genealogical, and specimen acquisitions
will be maintained at all times.
<P>
     Standard phlebotomy techniques will be practiced to protect against or
minimize any potential risk for the collection of blood specimens.  Participants
will be given instructions on care of the venipuncture site.  The subjects will
be monitored for any stress during interview and/or blood draw.  The procedure
will be terminated immediately if participant shows signs of mental or physical
distress.  The phone number for the Risk Manager's office will be given in the
event physical or mental complications occur at a later time.  Should immediate
medical care be needed, subjects will be seen by Emergency Room physicians.
<P>
     While there will be no direct benefit to the participants in this study,
information may be gained about the existence and possible location of the gene
or genes that may interact with environmental carcinogens to increase the risk
of lung cancer or other smoking associated cancers.  If linkage for a marker and
one of these disorders can be found, it would be a major step in identifying
markers that may predispose individuals at risk for developing these cancers.
In the event such a linkage is identified, these individuals will be contacted
for appropriate counseling.

As per the subcontract between Medical College of Ohio and St. Mary's Hospital
and Medical Center, St. Mary's intends to pay Medical College of Ohio to
generate a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 pedigrees for lung cancer
susceptibility families and to collect tissues and/or blood samples from members
of these families.  Environmental exposure data as outlined in the Risk Factor
Questionnaire in the appendix will also be obtained from these families.  The
tissue samples will be sent to St. Mary's Hospital for DNA isolation and
subsequent genotyping of the DNA as described in the Experimental Design and
Methods section.  The lung cancer susceptibility families from Ohio will help us
address the question of genetic heterogeneity in lung cancer.  They will follow
the same objectives, methods, and involvement of human subjects as outlined in
the abstract for the "Identification of Human Lung Cancer Susceptibility Genes"
project."

Objective:  The development of a synchrotron based x-ray imaging method suitable
for the acquisition of transvenous coronary angiograms.  The hypothesis is that
this method can provide coronary angiograms of quality comparable to those
provided by conventional methods without the risks associated with arterial
invasion and the direct injection of x-ray contrast agents into the ostia of the
coronary arteries.  This method with its reduced risk and increased capability
would allow study of the progression of coronary artery disease and efficacy of
current and new treatments.  This is coupled with the long range goal of
creating a diagnostic tool that is safe and accurate for clinical use on high
risk subjects prior to onset of symptoms.  Such a tool could provide physicians
with early diagnosis allowing intervention that would result in increased life
span and/or better quality of life for these subjects and a reduced burden on
the national health care system in general.
<P>
Methodology:  The method is based on the principle of iodine dichromography,
using two beams of monochromatic x-rays whose energies closely bracket the
K-edge absorption of iodine.  In the case of coronary angiography, iodine
contrast agent is injected into a vein and two images of the coronary arteries
are acquired simultaneously using x-rays above and below the K-edge of iodine.
An imaging of the coronary arteries is created by taking the logarithmic
difference of the two images of different energies which virtually eliminates
all signals except those arising from the contrast agent.  The result is an
image that gives high contrast details of the coronary arteries without
interference from other structures such as bones which appear in standard x-ray
techniques.
<P>
Ionizing radiation and chemical substances:  The coronary angiography subject is
injected intravenously with 35-50 milliliters (ml) of commercial iodinated
contrast agent, 0.64 ml/kilogram (kg) at a rate of approximately 15 ml/second.
The bronchography subjects are administered a maximum of 1 liter of medical
grade 80% Xenon, 20% oxygen mixture in 100-300 ml boluses through inhalation.
The subject in both cases is then imaged by moving the area of interest through
two monochromatic x-ray beams that closely bracket the K-absorption edge of the
contrast agent (33.16 keV for iodine and 34.56 keV for xenon).  The subject
receives a maximum of 35 Rad skin dose total for all images.  Due to the high
absorption of low energy (33-34 keV) x-rays by the surface layers of the skin,
this translates into a small internal dose, the equivalent x-ray dose in this
case would be 0.35 Rad.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  The procedures here are performed on subjects
that were referred by participating cardiologists or cardiovascular surgeons and
have met the criteria set forth by the Stanford University and Brookhaven
Laboratories Internal Review Boards (IRBs).  The subjects participating in all
studies suffer the potential risk of exposure to x-rays of the levels described
above.  The coronary angiography subjects suffer the additional risk of adverse
effects of intravenous administration of iodinated contrast agents in total
doses of 50-150 ml, given in bolus amounts of 15-50 ml.  This risk entails acute
renal failure or hypersensitivity reactions but is small in the population as a
whole.  Special care has been taken in selection criteria to exclude any
subjects who have a high risk for adverse effect.  These reactions are generally
immediate and treatable, with no long term effects remaining.
<P>
Subject confidentiality will be maintained and no subject will be identified by
name during any presentations or publications nor will any data concerning the
subject be made available to anyone except members of the research team without
the subject's prior consent.

Objective:  A second project was initiated as an offshoot of the current
coronary angiography project.  This project, xenon dichromographic
bronchography, relies on similar techniques and uses the same facilities to
perform imaging of the bronchial airways using medical grade non-radioactive
xenon gas as the contrast agent.  Lung cancer today is one of the least curable
cancers due to its late diagnosis, which results from late onset of symptoms and
current imaging techniques lacking the ability to see small tumors before they
have metastasized and become inoperable.  The hypothesis here is that xenon's
K-edge absorption energy is very close to that of Iodine, allowing the use of
the same facility, and that xenon inhaled into the bronchial airways will
provide a good contrast agent outlining the bronchial walls and emphasizing
irregularities from tumors in the same manner that the iodine contrast agent
emphasizes arterial stenosis.  If this technique proves useful, it could become
an easy and non-invasive way to screen high risk subjects and follow the course
of current and new treatment methods to monitor their effectiveness.
<P>
Methodology:  The method is based on the principle of Iodine dichromography,
using two beams of monochromatic X-rays whose energies closely bracket the
K-edge absorption of iodine.  In the case of coronary angiography, iodine
contrast agent is injected into a vein and two images of the coronary arteries
are acquired simultaneously using X-rays above and below the K-edge of iodine.
An imaging of the coronary arteries is created by taking the logarithmic
difference of the two images of different energies, which virtually eliminates
all signals except those arising from the contrast agent.  The result is an
image that gives high contrast details of the coronary arteries without
interference from other structures, such as bones, which appear in standard
X-ray techniques.
<P>
The xenon dichromographic bronchography uses exactly the same techniques as the
iodine dichromographic angiography but uses xenon as a contrast agent requiring
only a slight readjustment of the imaging equipment used in the iodine imaging
to center the beam energies so that they bracket the xenon-K-edge instead of the
iodine K-edge.
<P>
Ionizing radiation and chemical substances:  The coronary angiography subject is
injected intravenously with 35-50 ml of commercial iodinated contrast agent,
0.64 ml/kg at a rate of approximately 15 ml/s.  The bronchography subjects are
administered a maximum of 1 liter of medical grade 80% xenon, 20% oxygen mixture
in 100-300 ml boluses through inhalation.  The subject in both cases is then
imaged by moving the area of interest through two monochromatic x-ray beams that
closely bracket the K-absorption edge of the contrast agent (33.16 keV for
iodine and 34.56 keV for xenon).  The subject receives a maximum of 35 Rad skin
dose total for all images.  Due to the high absorption of low energy 33-34 keV
X-rays by the surface layers of the skin this translates into a small internal
dose, the equivalent x-ray dose in this case would be 0.35 Rad.
<P>
Involvement of Human Subjects:  The procedures here are performed on subjects
that were referred by participating cardiologists or cardiovascular surgeons and
have met the criteria set forth by the Stanford University and Brookhaven IRBs.
The subjects participating in all studies suffer the potential risk of exposure
to x-rays of the levels described above.  The coronary angiography subjects
suffer the additional risk of adverse effects of intravenous administration of
iodinated contrast agents in total doses of 50-150 ml, given in bolus amounts of
15-50 ml.  This risk entails acute renal failure or hypersensitivity reactions
but is small in the population as a whole.  Special care has been taken in
selection criteria to exclude any subjects who have a high risk for adverse
effect.  These reactions are generally immediate and treatable with no long-term
effects remaining.
<P>
The subjects participating in the bronchography studies will suffer the
additional risk of exposure to medical grade 80% xenon, 20% oxygen gas.
Radioactive xenon has been approved for use on humans and is used clinically for
studies of ventilation scanning.  The effects of inhaled xenon are well known
and present little risk.  Xenon, as used in our imaging procedure, is
non-radioactive and has little or no physiologic effect since only small amounts
(less than 250 ml) are used and the xenon is inspired only into the dead space
of the bronchial airways and remains there for only a few seconds with little or
no xenon reaching the alveoli of the lungs.
<P>
Subject confidentiality will be maintained and no subject will be identified by
name during any presentations or publications nor will any data concerning the
subject be made available to anyone except members of the research team without
the subject's prior consent.

The proliferation of genetic screening and testing is requiring increasing
numbers of Americans to integrate genetic knowledge and interventions into their
family life and personal experience.  This study examines the social processes
that occur as families at risk for two of the most common autosomal recessive
diseases, sickle cell disease (SC) and cystic fibrosis (CF), encounter genetic
testing.  Since each of these diseases is found primarily in a different
ethnic/racial group (CF in European Americans and SC in African Americans) this
research will clarify the role of culture in integrating genetic testing into
family life and reproductive planning, and facilitate the development of
culturally sensitive genetic services.  A third type of genetic disorder, the
thalassemias primarily affect Southeast Asian immigrants, although another risk
group is from the Mediterranean region.  Thalassemias, like cystic fibrosis and
sickle cell disease, have a similar pattern of inheritance and raise similarly
serious bio-medical challenges and issues of information management.  This study
has expanded its original focus on cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease to
include families at risk for the thalassemias.
<P>
The study gathers data by interviewing members of families in which a gene for
cystic fibrosis, sickle cell or thalassemia has been identified.  Data
collection consists primarily of focused interviews with individuals from
families in which at least one member has been identified as having a genetic
disorder (or trait).  Index cases are identified in medical settings or in
advocacy groups.  Snowball sampling is used to recruit other family members.
Interviews are tape recorded, transcribed, coded and entered into a computerized
data base.   Analysis is conducted using a variety of qualitative methods
including   "grounded theory" and narrative analysis.  This study does not
involve exposing respondents to any substances.  It elicits only verbal
responses to questions.  Records are kept in locked cabinets.  In order to
protect confidentiality they are identified and filed by number.  The identity
of respondents is never revealed in reports of research findings.  The most
significant risks to which individuals are exposed is the risk of inconvenience
and the risk that discussion of sensitive topics may be uncomfortable to them.
Respondents are informed that they have the right to have the tape recorder
turned off or to withdraw from the interview at any time.  They are compensated
for their participation and for any incidental expenses they may incur with $20
in cash for individual interviews.

The objective of this subproject is to produce a video that presents the
perspectives of patients, their families and various types of health care
providers on living with and caring for persons with sickle cell disease.  This
video documents contrasting perspectives and facilitates effective communication
between professionals, patients and their families.  Participants are recruited
from among those who have agreed to be interviewed for the main project.  Health
care workers are recruited in person or by telephone from the clinics which have
cooperated with us during the larger study.  A second consent form has been
approved by the University IRB.  Participation in this subproject is entirely
voluntary and those who wish to participant in the video are informed they have
the right to withdraw from the video at any point up until its completion.
Risks to patients will be minimal because their health status is already known
to some people.  However, distribution of the video will result in a wider
population having knowledge of all participants' relationship to sickle cell
disease.  This is fully explained in the consent form.

The objective of this subproject is  to clarify cultural issues and processes
identified during the earlier phase of the study in which participants were
interviewed individually.  This is done by convening and tape recording focus
groups.  Each group is made up of from 3 to 8 individuals with certain key
characteristics in common.  These characteristics usually include cultural
background and relationship to a specific genetic disease.  For example, one
group is made up of mothers of affected children, another of fathers, a third of
siblings, a fourth of grandparents, etc.  By convening groups that share salient
social characteristics, we are able to generate interaction that represents each
cultural perspective more clearly than it can be conveyed by one individual in a
private dialogue with an interviewer.  This process brings to light issues that
are the focus of common interests and facilitates their expression in culturally
specific terms.  These focus groups are conducted in community settings and thus
tend to reflect community, as opposed to purely biomedical, perspectives.  They
are tape recorded, transcribed and analyzed using the same inductive methods
used in the larger study.   These methods include "grounded theory" and
narrative analysis.
<P>
Participation in focus groups poses a somewhat different risk than participation
in individual interviews,  such as potential for embarrassment, loss of
confidentiality and inconvenience.  Although participants have the assurance
that researchers will not violate confidentiality, there is a possibility that
other focus group participants may do so.  Participants are warned of this
danger, and to mitigate it,  they are introduced to each other only by first
names and  encouraged only to provide information that they feel comfortable
sharing with others.  They are compensated for any inconvenience and expenses
created by their participation with $50 in cash.

A.  OBJECTIVES <BR>
     To identify recurring chromosome abnormalities in human acute leukemia that
occurs after prior treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy for a prior
malignant disease.  To clone the translocation breakpoints in selected recurring
translocations.  To determine the function of the affected genes in normal cells
and their altered function in leukemic cells.
<P>
B.  METHODOLOGY <BR>
     Samples of tissues involved with leukemia, including peripheral blood, bone
marrow, lymph nodes and spleen, are obtained by the patient's physician and are
sent for cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis.  At the time we receive the
sample, we do not know whether the patient will be part of our research program.
<P>
   We process part of the sample for cytogenetic analysis using standard
techniques.  We also often use some of the cells for specialized studies
including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  If there are sufficient
cells, some are frozen in dimethylsulphoxide dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and
stored in liquid nitrogen for future molecular analysis.  After we analyze the
karyotype and receive the pertinent clinical information, we determine which
patients should be included.
<P>
C.  IONIZING RADIATION, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES <BR>
     No chemical or radioactive substances or ionizing radiation is administered
to individuals as part of this research.
<P>
     I have no responsibility for the medical treatment of patients.  The
attending physicians obtain the diagnostic x-rays that are appropriate and then
recommend the treatment that is indicated for the patient's diagnosis and stage
of the disease.  This can include radiation and/or chemotherapy.  The treatment
varies for different patients.
<P>
D.  INVOLVEMENT OF HUMAN SUBJECTS <BR>
     As noted in section C, the treatment is tailored to the patient's disease.
In our analysis of samples from the patients, especially in the molecular
diagnostics laboratory, we may use DNA probes labelled with an isotope of
phosphorous (32P) to determine whether a patient has a chromosome rearrangement
that can be detected with DNA probes.
<P>
   The project primarily uses samples obtained for clinical evaluation for this
research project.  On occasion, if we do not have any material for a
particularly important research question, we might ask another research
laboratory that may also have received a sample whether they have extra material
they could share with us.
<P>
     We are not involved in in vitro fertilization or genetic engineering.  We
do culture leukemic cells for two to three days to obtain mitotic cells.
<P>
    We provide reports on the patients to the referring physician.  The
cytogenetic reports are kept in file cabinets in a locked room.  Because all of
the samples are obtained by the physician to provide the best cure for the
patient, there is no harm to the patient.
<P>
   When patients are reported on in scientific papers, they are identified only
by case numbers.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
FMZ (flumazenil) is an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site of the CNS
GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) receptor -chlorine (CL) channel membrane
complex.  The drug has no effect on undrugged normal subjects but selectively
reverses the depressant effects of benzodiazepines.  The agent is specific for
benzodiazepines and does not reverse barbiturate-mediated sedations.  It has
been reported that FMZ also reverses the coma seen in chronic hepatic
encephalopathy and this observation has led to the suggestion that in hepatic
encephalopathy, an endogenous benzodiazepine like substance is present in the
brain.  This is supported by binding competition studies using body fluids from
human subjects with hepatic encephalopathy, and binding studies and mass
spectographic evidence from brains of experimental animals with hepatic failure.
Most recently, elevated concentrations of benzodiazepines have been found in the
brains of patients with fulminant hepatic failure.  The origins of these
benzodiazepines is unknown.  The most likely sources are dietary and/or gut
flora.
<P>
A previous PET study of hepatic encephalopathy with 11C-FMZ showed significantly
increased uptake in the brain.  This was interpreted as indication that FMZ
binding sites are increased in the brains of patients with hepatic
encephalopathy.  However, an alternate explanation is that plasma clearance of
FMZ is prolonged in hepatic encephalopathy, and thus the increased brain
accumulation of FMZ in this case is due to prolonged tissue exposure to the
tracer.
<P>
We anticipate decreased 11C-FMZ binding in the brains of patients with hepatic
encephalopathy due to competition of the tracer with the endogenous
benzodiazepines for binding sites.  If abnormalities in FMZ binding are found,
then those patients who later undergo liver transplantation will be restudied at
a time post transplantation when their clinical status is stable (approximately
6 months).  This is to determine the reversibility of the changes in FMZ binding
when normal hepatic function is restored.  Plasma benzodiazepine ligand levels
will be measured in collaboration with Dr. Basile of the National Institutes of
Health.
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
1.      Subjects will be studied lying supine, immobile, in a basal state with eyes
and ears open.<BR>
2.      A catheter will be placed in a radial artery for the withdrawal of blood
samples to permit quantification of the PET data.<BR>
3.      An intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm for the administration
of radiopharmaceuticals.<BR>
4.      A bolus of [11C]flumazenil,  containing up to 50 mCi and 27 g, will be
administered intravenously. <BR>
5.      Brain activity will be measured with a series of sequential emission scans
taken over 60 minutes.<BR>
6.      Arterial blood samples (total of less than 30 ml) will be withdrawn to
determine tracer time-activity curve.<BR>
7.      The PET images, together with the arterial blood curve and a physiologic
compartmental model describing the cerebral distribution of flumazenil, will be
analyzed to determine the transport and binding of the tracer.<BR>
8.      This procedure will be repeated after surgical intervention or liver
transplant.
<P>
RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES
<P>
Subjects will be injected intravenously with up to 50 mCi of [11C] flumazenil, a
radiolabeled antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site of the CNS GABA
receptor -CL channel membrane complex.
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
<P>
Subjects will undergo PET imaging, as described above, at baseline and after
intervention.  Medical records will be used for collection of ancillary
information.  No other procedures will be performed exclusively for the purpose
of this research.
<P>
RISKS
<P>
1.      Low-level radiation exposure.  At the levels used, the effects are judged to
be minimal.<BR>
2.      Arterial catheterization - unexpected bleeding, thrombosis, vasospasm, or
infection at the site of radial artery puncture.  This procedure has been used
for over 10 years in our PET facility without serious complication.  Risks are
kept to a minimum by employing aseptic technique by experienced personnel.<BR>
3.      Potential idiosyncratic reaction to administered radiopharmaceuticals.  At
the levels administered, the risk of reaction is judged to be minimal.  A "crash
cart" is readily available in the PET imaging area as are qualified persons
trained to handle such emergencies.<BR>
4.      Venous catheterization - infection.  Risks are kept to a minimum by employing
aseptic technique by experienced personnel.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) is the most prevalent inhibitory chemical
transmitter in the mammalian brain.  The neuronal receptors for GABA have been
purified and studied at the molecular level, where benzodiazepines have been
shown to augment GABA responses.  The benzodiazepines act at a recognition site
("receptor") which allosterically modifies the binding of GABA to its receptor.
Postmortem radioligand binding studies have demonstrated alterations in
benzodiazepine receptors in a number of diseases.  In addition, benzodiazepines
are used in the therapy of several neurologic and psychiatric disorders.
Preliminary studies on the in vivo distribution of the benzodiazepine
radioligand [11C]flumazenil in young normal volunteers indicate that its
regional brain distribution volume, as determined with positron emission
tomography, bears close correspondence to the regional distribution of receptors
found in postmortem in vitro studies.  In the present proposal, we will explore
the ability of tracer kinetic modeling  to detect patterns of [11C]flumazenil
delivery and receptor binding in normal subjects and in patients with neurologic
or psychiatric diseases.
<P>
METHODOLOGY, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND HUMAN INVOLVEMENT
<P>
        A.      Clinical Evaluation
<P>
                Clinical diagnosis will be established by a physician (usually a neurologist
or psychiatrist) experienced  in the evaluation of patients with the disorder
under investigation.  A clinical diagnosis will be established for all subjects
prior to the investigational procedures.
<P>
        B.      PET Imaging Procedures
<P>
                PET imaging with [11C]flumazenil may be combined with determination of
cerebral blood flow (CBF) or cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglu) for ancillary
physiologic characterization of cerebral function.  In addition, the
administration of flumazenil may consist of one or two injections, either during
the same imaging session or separated by a longer interval (i.e., a second
imaging session at a later time).  One of three imaging options will be
employed:  A) [11C]Flumazenil alone;  B) [11C]Flumazenil in combination with
[15O]H2O;  or C).  [11C]Flumazenil in combination with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose.
The protocols below indicate the relationships of the ancillary scans to the
flumazenil imaging session(s) and the dosimetry and maximal dosages of the
radiopharmaceuticals are given separately for each option.
<P>
        Option A (Flumazenil alone)
<P>
        1)      Subjects will be studied lying supine, immobile, in a basal state with eyes
and ears unoccluded, or during controlled auditory, visual, or somatosensory
stimulation.<BR>
        2)      A catheter will be placed in a radial artery for the withdrawal of blood
samples to permit quantification of the PET data.<BR>
        3)      An intravenous catheter will be inserted in an arm for the administration of
radiopharmaceuticals.
        4)      A bolus of [11C]flumazenil, containing up to 50 mCi and 27 g, will be
administered intravenously.  In some instances, the dose may be fractionated
between a bolus and a subsequent infusion, the total of which will not excede
the above limits.<BR>
        5)      Brain activity will be determined with a series of sequential emission scans
over 60 to 90 min.<BR>
        6)      Arterial blood samples (total of 40 ml or less) will be withdrawn to
determine the tracer time-activity curve.<BR>
        7)      The PET images, together with the arterial blood curve and a physiologic
compartmental model describing the cerebral distribution of flumazenil, will be
analyzed to determine the transport and binding of the tracer.<BR>
        8)      The injection of flumazenil may be repeated during the same session after
decay of the first dose (90-120 min later), or on a subsequent day, following
interval change in therapy or in physiologic/pharmacologic state.  The total
cumulative radioisotopic dose of  [11C]flumazenil administered in these sessions
will be less than 50 mCi.
<P>
        Option B (Flumazenil in combination with CBF)
<P>
        1)      Subjects will be studied lying supine, immobile, in a basal state with eyes
and ears unoccluded, or during controlled auditory, visual, or somatosensory
stimulation.<BR>
        2)      A catheter will be placed in a radial artery for the withdrawal of blood
samples to permit quantification of the PET data.<BR>
        3)      An intravenous catheter will be inserted in an arm for the administration of
radiopharmaceuticals.<BR>
        4)      A bolus of [15O]H2O, containing up to 100 mCi, will be injected
intravenously and arterial blood samples (less than 20 ml total) and sequential
emission brain scans will be obtained over the following 6 min to determine
CBF.<BR>
        5)      A bolus of [11C]flumazenil, containing up to 40 mCi and 27 g, will be
administered intravenously.  In some instances, the dose may be fractionated
between a bolus and a subsequent infusion, the total of which will not excede
the above limits.<BR>
        6)      Brain activity will be determined with a series of sequential emission scans
over 60 to 90 min.<BR>
        7)      Arterial blood samples (total of 40 ml or less) will be withdrawn to
determine the tracer time-activity curve.<BR>
        8)      The PET images, together with the arterial blood curve and a physiologic
compartmental model describing the cerebral distribution of flumazenil, will be
analyzed to determine the transport and binding of the tracer.  Comparison with
CBF will allow estimation of the relative contributions of blood-brain-barrier
permeability versus blood flow to overall flumazenil transport, and will permit
correlation of transport changes (between groups or between physiologic states
in the same individual) with CBF changes.<BR>
        9)      The injections of [11C]flumazenil and [15O]H2O may be repeated during the
same session after decay of the first dose (90-120 min later), or on a
subsequent day, following interval change in therapy or in
physiologic/pharmacologic state.  The radiotracer amounts administered in these
sessions will be subject to the cumulative total radioisotopic limits of  40 mCi
of [11C]flumazenil and 200 mCi of [15O]H2O.
<P>
        Option C (Flumazenil in combination with CMRglu)
<P>
        1)      Subjects will be studied lying supine, immobile, in a basal state with eyes
and ears unoccluded, or during controlled auditory, visual, or somatosensory
stimulation.<BR>
        2)      A catheter will be placed in a radial artery for the withdrawal of blood
samples to permit quantification of the PET data.<BR>
        3)      An intravenous catheter will be inserted in an arm for the administration of
radiopharmaceuticals.
        4)      A bolus of [11C]flumazenil, containing up to 25 mCi and 27 g, will be
administered intravenously.  In some instances, the dose may be fractionated
between a bolus and a subsequent infusion, the total of which will not excede
the above limits.<BR>
        5)      Brain activity will be determined with a series of sequential emission scans
over 60 to 90 min.<BR>
        6)      Arterial blood samples (total of 40 ml or less) will be withdrawn to
determine the tracer time-activity curve.<BR>
        7)      The PET images, together with the arterial blood curve and a physiologic
compartmental model describing the cerebral distribution of flumazenil, will be
analyzed to determine the transport and binding of the tracer.<BR>
        8)      Following decay of the flumazenil (60 to 90 min post-injection), a bolus of
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose containing up to 10 mCi will be administered
intravenously.  Arterial blood samples (less than 30 ml total) will be collected
for calculation of CMRglu.  The cerebral distribution of tracer will be
determined by emission scanning beginning 30 min post injection for a total of
two sequential 20-30 min periods.
<P>
        C.      Ancillary Measurements
<P>
        1)      Structural/anatomic brain imaging will be performed in some instances with
the use of magnetic resonance (MRI).  Standard T1 and T2 weighted images are
obtained in orientation to match the PET scan data.  The imaging session is
usually less than 1 hr in duration.<BR>
        2)      Neuropsychological testing will be performed in some subjects to establish
the presence of disease- or drug-related changes in function.  In addition,
elderly normal subjects may undergo screening neuropsychological testing to
exclude subtle memory abnormalities which may go undetected on routine
neurologic examination.<BR>
        3)      Electroencephalography (EEG) will be performed in association with
flumazenil imaging in some instances.  This will allow correlation of the
binding with the presence or absence of epileptogenic or seizure activity in
patients with epilepsy, or with the effects of drugs on the EEG in cases of pre-
and post-therapeutic studies.  Aside from the time required for electrode
placement (usually less than 30 min), the imaging session will not be altered by
EEG recording.
<P>
RISKS
<P>
1.      Low-level radiation exposure.  At the levels used, the effects are judged to
be minimal.<BR>
2.      Arterial catheterization - unexpected bleeding, thrombosis, vasospasm, or
infection at the site of radial artery puncture.  This procedure has been used
for over 10 years in our PET facility without serious complication.  Risks are
kept to a minimum by employing aseptic technique by experienced personnel.<BR>
3.      Potential idiosyncratic reaction to administered radiopharmaceuticals.  At
the levels administered the risk of reaction is judged to be minimal.  A "crash
cart" is readily available in the PET imaging area as are qualified persons
trained to handle such emergencies.<BR>
4.      Venous catheterization - infection.  Risks are kept to a minimum by employing

Previous research has shown that a decrease in benzodiazepine receptor binding
occurs in the hippocampi of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy patients.  It has
been proposed that this is a selective process affecting the GABA neuronal
population only.  However, the pathology of specimens from resected temporal
lobes in medically refractory epilepsy patients has demonstrated mesial temporal
sclerosis.  The co-localization of benzodiazepine receptors and muscarinic
cholinergic receptors on intrinsic neurons in the hippocampus has previously
been determined.  [11C]Flumazenil(FMZ) and [11C]N-methyl piperidyl
benzilate(NMPB) are radiopharmaceuticals which are antagonists of benzodiazepine
receptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, respectively.  Our hypothesis is
that the neurons of the hippocampal region undergo nonselective destruction, and
that by utilizing [11C]FMZ and [11C]NMPB we will observe similar decreases in
binding of each agent.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of delineating
terminals of aminergic neurons in the brain on the basis of specific binding
sites located on presynaptic vesicles.  Dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and
serotonergic neurons contain presynaptic vesicles which concentrate and
subsequently release transmitter upon stimulation.  Drugs which bind to active
sites on these vesicles are known, and are useful in the clinical management of
hyperkinetic movement disorders.  Among these drugs, the best known is
reserpine, which potently and noncompetitively inhibits uptake of transmitter
into vesicles.  An alternative drug used in Europe, tetrabenazine, is not yet
approved for use in the US, but has considerably fewer side-effects, and results
in shorter duration of effect.  We have investigated the use of
[11C]tetrabenazine for localization of aminergic nerve terminals in vivo by
positron emission tomography, but quantitation of the distribution of that
radioligand is limited by the in vivo production of radiolabeled metabolites.
The goal of the present project is to determine feasibility of quantitative
imaging of presynaptic dopamine terminals in the striatum using
[11C]dihydrotetrabenazine, a radioligand designed not to have radiolabeled
metabolites in vivo.  Our preclinical animal studies indicate that
dihydrotetrabenazine should be an improved radioligand for determination of
dopamine terminals.
<P>
METHODOLOGY, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND HUMAN INVOLVEMENT
<P>
1)      Telephone screening will exclude recruitment of subjects with significant or
prior illness or other exclusionary factors.<BR>
2)      A medical history and a neurologic examination will be performed on all
normal controls prior to the PET scan to verify this information, and to detect
occult abnormalities.<BR>
3)      Intravenous and radial artery catheters will be inserted to permit injection
of the  radiopharmaceutical and withdrawal of plasma samples, respectively.<BR>
4)      A dose of 18 mCi of [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine, containing less than 50 g
will be injected intravenously.<BR>
5)      A series of dynamic PET scans will be initiated with duration increasing from
30 seconds to 10 minutes over a one hour imaging period.<BR>
6)      Timed samples of arterial plasma will be collected to determine the
concentration curve of tracer.<BR>
7)      The PET data will be analyzed first qualitatively to determine the relative
uptake in striatum versus other brain areas with much lower levels of
presynaptic aminergic nerve terminals.  If the data permit, preliminary kinetic
compartmental modeling will be applied to determine the sensitivity of tracer
distribution to tissue delivery versus vesicular binding.<BR>
8)      In some instances, a repeat study (steps 4 through 7) may be performed within
60 min of the first to investigate the precision of the scanning procedure.  In
this instance, the total cumulative dose of [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine will not
exceed 18 mCi.<BR>

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Postmortem analyses of human neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's
disease (PD) have revealed decreases in neurochemical markers of dopaminergic
neurons.  These observations are interpreted as reflecting specific losses of
synaptic terminals arising from chemically-defined monoaminergic brain stem
neurons.  In the present project, we will investigate the relationship between
striatal monoaminergic innervation and PD with the use of positron emission
tomography (PET).  The relationship between disease severity and loss of
dopaminergic indices will be evaluated, as will the controversial relationship
between PD and isolated (essential) tremor (ET) in elderly patients.  Finally,
we will evaluate the longitudinal loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation in
PD, and assess the possible beneficial effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitor
therapy.
<P>
Specific aim 1:  To determine the loss of striatal monoaminergic vesicle content
in patients with early PD in comparison with elderly normal subjects and
patients with ET.  Subjects will be studied with [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine
(DTBZ) and with [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), to quantify monoaminergic vesicle and
benzodiazepine binding sites, respectively.  There is current disagreement as to
the relationship between ET and PD, particularly with regard to the risk of
developing PD in patients with isolated postural tremor.  We have determined an
age-associated increase in the cerebellar benzodiazepine binding in elderly
normals studied with FMZ, and hypothesize that ET may constitute an exaggeration
of this process, on the basis of functional studies implicating the cerebellum
in its generation.
<P>
Specific aim 2:  To determine the relationship between the loss of striatal
monoaminergic vesicle content and the severity of PD.  Patients with advanced
stages of PD will be studied with DTBZ and analyzed in comparison to early stage
PD patients.  Based on the prevailing hypotheses, it is anticipate that early PD
will be associated with over 50 to 75% depletion of striatal dopamine terminals.
Advanced PD is anticipated to result from further loss of DTBZ binding,
reflecting even greater depletion of terminals.  As observed in postmortem and
prior PET imaging studies, we anticipate a progression of dopamine terminal loss
with earliest and most severe involvement of the posterior putamen, and least
severe involvement of the anteroventral striatum.
<P>
Specific aim 3:  To determine the loss of striatal monoaminergic vesicles over
time in subjects with early PD.  Subjects with early PD will be followed
longitudinally over three years, to determine the relationship between disease
severity and dopamine terminal integrity within individuals.  A parallel group
of normal subjects will be studied longitudinally to determine whether the rate
of progressive loss of presynaptic dopamine terminals is accelerated in PD.
<P>
Specific aim 4:  To examine striatal muscarinic cholinergic receptors in PD
patients with complicated L-dopa responses as a marker of intrinsic
reorganization.  Although the primary pathology in PD affects extrastriatal
catecholaminergic neurons, there is data supporting intrinsic striatal changes
in PD, which may ultimately limit the efficacy of symptomatic therapy.  We will
examine the binding of [11C]NMPB to striatal muscarinic receptors in PD patients
with uncomplicated L-dopa responsiveness in comparison to patients with
complicated L-dopa responses as an indicator of intrinsic striatal organization.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
The pathophysiology of hyperkinetic movement disorders is incompletely
understood.  This lack of knowledge is an obstacle to the development of better
symptomatic therapies.  We will explore the pathophysiology of hyperkinetic
movement disorders using positron emission tomography (PET) with ligands aimed
at striatal muscarinic cholinergic receptors and striatal dopamine terminals.
We hypothesize that dystonias are characterized by excessive cholinergic
neurotransmission and down-regulation of striatal cholinergic receptors.  We
predict decreased muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding and will test this
hypothesis using [11C]NMPB.  In Tourette's syndrome, we hypothesize that there
is excessive striatal dopaminergic innervation and excessive striatal
cholinergic neurotransmission.  We predict increased density of striatal
dopaminergic terminals and decreased striatal cholinergic receptor binding.  We
will test these predictions with [11C]DTBZ and [11C]NMPB.  We hypothesize that
the degree of dopaminergic innervation is an important determinant of the type
of movement disorder suffered by Huntington's disease (HD) patients with marked
rigidity resulting from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.  We will test this
hypothesis by correlating character of the movement disorder with the results of
the [11C]DTBZ scans.  We predict significantly diminished [11C]DTBZ binding in
rigid but not in choreic HD patients.  We will examine striatal muscarinic
cholinergic receptors in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with complicated
L-dopa responses as a marker of intrinsic striatal reorganization.  Although the
primary pathology in PD affects extrastriatal catecholaminergic neurons, there
is data supporting intrinsic striatal changes in PD, which may ultimately limit
the efficacy of symptomatic therapy.

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Studies measuring cerebral glucose metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow will
be performed on elderly normal controls and on patients in various stages of
cognitive impairment.  Initially, patients studied in this project were required
to show a cognitive decline during the 6 months prior to study in order to be
entered into the project.  Groups will include patients diagnosed with possible
Alzheimer's disease (poss. AD), probable Alzheimer's disease (prob. AD), and
isolated memory impairment (IMI).  More recently, additional patient groups
including Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and
normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).  The primary objectives of the project
include determining whether there is an early pattern of glucose metabolism in
patients suspected of having early  Alzheimer's disease that will be useful in
predicting whether or not they will eventually go on to develop Alzheimer's
disease.  Another objective is to compare the dementia in Alzheimer's disease
with that of Parkinson's patients that develop dementia.
<P>
<P>
METHODOLOGY
<P>
Subjects will be studied lying supine, immobile in a basal state with their eyes
open, ears unoccluded, in a quiet room.  A radial artery catheter will be
inserted for the purpose of withdrawing arterial blood samples at specified
times throughout the scan in order to measure the concentration of injected
tracer in the arterial plasma.  A venous line will also be inserted for
administration of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and/or [Oxygen-15] H2O.  A few
blood samples will be used to determine arterial plasma levels of (cold)
glucose, Oxygen pressure (pO2), carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2), and hydrogen
pressure (pH).  Blood hematocrit will also be measured.
<P>
For cerebral blood flow scans, a bolus of 50-80 mCi of [15O]H2O will be
administered intravenously.  Brain activity will be measured with the PET
scanner as a dynamic sequence of scans of 6 minutes duration.  Arterial blood
sampling, removing less than 15ml of blood will be performed to determine the
arterial input function of [15O]H2O.  The PET scan and arterial input function
data will be analyzed by a tracer kinetic model to produce functional or
parametric images of both cerebral blood flow (given as ml of blood per gram of
tissue per minute) and brain water partition coefficient (given as ml of blood
per gram of tissue) using methods developed in our laboratories.
<P>
For cerebral glucose metabolic rate scans, a bolus of 10 mCi of [18F]FDG will be
administered intravenously.  A 30 minute incorporation period occurs following
injection prior to the initiation of PET scanning.  Brain activity will be
measured as a static set of images beginning at the 30 minute time point and
continuing for the next 30-50 minutes.  Arterial blood sampling, removing
approximately 30-40 ml of blood will be performed throughout the study, in order
to determine the arterial input function of [18F]FDG.  The PET scan and arterial
input function data will be analyzed by a mathematical approximation for a
kinetic model, yielding functional or parametric images of the metabolic rate of
glucose (given as mg of glucose per gram of tissue per minute).
<P>
<P>
RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES
<P>
Subjects will receive as many as two injections of [15O]H2O, with up to 80 mCi
per injection, and one injection of 10 mCi of [18F]FDG.
<P>
<P>
INVOLVEMENT OF SUBJECTS
<P>
Subjects (both normal and patient) will have a medical and neurologic
examination performed by a trained neurologist to rule out any occult
abnormalities.  This will take approximately 30-60 minutes.  The PET imaging
procedure may take up to three hours.  MRI and/or computed tomography (CT)
scanning will have already been performed as part of the patient's routine care
and diagnosis and will not be performed exclusively for the purposes of this
research project.
<P>

OBJECTIVES
<P>
[123I]IBVM (iodobenzovesamicol) is a newly developed radiotracer that was
designed to bind selectively to the intraneuronal storage vesicles of
cholinergic nerve endings.  Preclinical studies in small animals have confirmed
that [123I]IBVM does indeed serve as a highly specific marker for cerebral
cholinergic neurons(1).  Chromatographic analysis of brain radioactivity
revealed only parent tracer (2).  The marked accumulation and prolonged
retention of [123I]IBVM in cholinergic neuron rich regions of the brain, such as
the striatum and cerebral cortex, give expectations that high quality
tomographic images should result when SPECT (single photon emission computed
tomography) is applied for study of the human brain.  This radiotracer is
expected to define the density of presynaptic cholinergic neurons not only in
the brain, but also in the heart and stomach, permitting scintigraphic
assessments of these organs in living patients.  In each instance, the kinetic
behavior of the tracer will be established using mathematical models to derive
quantitative indices of cholinergic nerve densities in various anatomic zones.
<P>

OBJECTIVES
<P>
Using measurements of cerebral blood flow with [Oxygen-15]H2O during both
"activation" and "control" conditions we will determine cerebral blood flow
(CBF) changes attributable to the "activation" condition.  Regions of the brain
that exhibit changes are then assumed to be associated with the particular brain
function required to perform the "activation" task.  The purpose of using normal
subjects is 1) to validate that the "activation" and "control" conditions are
appropriate tasks for probing a particular aspect of brain function and 2) some
of the project's aims are to study the normal (not diseased) human brain.
<P>
The purpose of using these subjects is not to determine the pattern of uptake
and distribution of [O-15]H2O in normal controls.  Every newly proposed pair of
"activation" and "control" tasks has the purpose of studying a particular aspect
of brain function (such as cognition, memory, speech and language formulation,
visual/spatial processing) and requires a new set of control data.
<P>
The specific aim of this project is to study the mechanisms of memory in the
normal functioning human brain.  Five groups of normal subjects will be studied.
These groups will attempt to 1) determine brain regions involved in simple
spatial working memory, 2) differentiate effects on brain activation from left
vs. right visual field presentation of information, 3)  study effects of
difficulty of the memory task, 4) study effects of the duration of the memory
period required by the task, and 5) measure effects when a spatial orientation
task is included in addition to memory task.
<P>
METHODS, RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND HUMAN INVOLVEMENT
<P>
To examine rapidly changing states in brain function (lasting 1- 5 min) such as
those associated with sensory and most cognitive tasks, O-15-water will be used
to sequentially measure CBF.  Previous work in this area has employed a bolus
injection and a single 40 second PET scan for this measurement.  We plan,
however, to examine several protocols which will combine various methods of
injection (bolus, ramp, and/or continuous infusion) with dynamic PET data
acquisition to determine the best statistical measure of CBF.
<P>
All subjects will have an intravenous antecubital line placed for radiotracer
injection and then be positioned in the PET scanner.  Some subjects will have a
radial artery catheter placed as well for measurements of radiotracer blood
activity.
<P>
A series of PET measurements of CBF will be obtained over a period up to 3
hours.  Each measurement will begin with establishment of the mental state (see
below), then infusion of O-15-water (40 - 90 mCi) and initiation of dynamic PET
scanning (from 1 up to 6 minutes of data collection).  In certain subjects
arterial blood samples will be drawn through a continuous blood sampler for
quantitative CBF calculations.  After allowing for the decay of O-15  the PET
CBF measurement will be repeated (up to 20 times, or a maximum of 400 mCi)
depending on the number of mental states to be examined.
<P>
One of three general mental states will be established just prior to and
maintained during all PET measurements.  1) A control state: Eyes closed, ears
partially plugged, and the subject instructed to rest and "think of nothing in
particular".  2) A sensory state:  Consisting of either somatosensory (hand
vibration, thermal, or light touch), auditory (words, word-like sounds,
white-noise, etc.), and/or visual (words, shapes , colors, etc.) stimuli.  3)
Cognitive task state:  Subject responding  (internally or externally) to sensory
stimuli.  Rules of response can be simple (e.g., reading aloud a visually
presented word) or more complex (e.g., silently counting the number of times a
red square is seen among a pattern of red circles).
<P>
MRI studies:   In selected subjects an MRI study of the head will be obtained
after completion of the PET study.  To obtain both gray matter/white matter
distinction and brain/CSF distinction,  two different pulse sequence
acquisitions may be run, lasting a total of 45 minutes.
<P>
RISKS
<P>
1.      Low-level radiation exposure.  At the levels used, the effects are judged to
be minimal.<BR>
2.      Arterial catheterization - unexpected bleeding, thrombosis, vasospasm, or
infection at the site of radial artery puncture.  This procedure has been used
for over 10 years in our PET facility without serious complication.  Risks are
kept to a minimum by employing aseptic technique by experienced personnel.<BR>
3.      Venous catheterization - infection.  Risks are kept to a minimum by employing
aseptic technique by experienced personnel.

The overall incidence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in the United States has
been estimated to be approximately 7,000 new cases per year.  The treatment of
GBM is problematic. Most patients undergo a surgical "debulking" followed by
radiation therapy.  Successful surgical approach is improbable in cases with
diffuse and infiltrating growth of the tumor.  Furthermore, the low tolerance of
the normal brain tissue limits the delivery of tumor-effective radiation doses.
Chemotherapy has been shown to be ineffective.  As a result, the median survival
time is less than 12 months.  The overall prognosis for a patient suffering from
GBM remains dismal.
<P>
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) represents a promising alternative for
selective radiation therapy of such tumors.  The specific aims in this study
are:  to evaluate  4-Borono-2[18F] Fluoro-D, L-Phenylalanine-Fructose Complex
[18F]BPA-F with the use of positron emission tomography (PET); to measure the
pharmacokinetics of [18F]BPA-F and to examine if the GBM and/or normal brain
accumulation of [18F]BPA-F changes as a result of surgery;  to evaluate
accumulation of [18F]BPA-F in residual tumor for potential BNCT;  and to
evaluate the use of [18F]BPA-F imaging for measuring the response to BNCT.
<P>
All patients will be referred for PET brain scans on the basis of clinical
indication with strong suspicion for GBM.  Following the brain scan a whole body
PET scan will also be obtained to gather information on the organ distribution
of the BPA.  The patients shall be 18 years of age or older.  All patients will
have undergone physical, neurologic, fundoscopic, and visual field examinations
as well as x-ray computerized tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) studies of the brain within one week to ten days of the PET examination.
All tumors will be confirmed histologically.  The biopsies will be done after
the PET scan to avoid non-specific biochemical changes secondary to the surgical
procedure.  A second PET scan, including brain and whole body, will be done 4 to
6 weeks after the craniotomy, if possible.
<P>
A transmission scan will be done using an external ring source containing
germanium-68 for the purpose of acquiring data for image attenuation correction.
Following the transmission scan, patients will be given fluorine-18 labeled
BPA-F by intravenous injection.  The average dose to be given is 0.15 millicurie
(mCi) per Kilogram (Kg) of body weight.  PET imaging of the brain will begin
immediately after administration of the radiolabeled BPA-F.  Scans will be
carried out using the 47 slice tomograph which provides a spatial resolution of
approximately 5 millimeters  in 7 millimeter slices.  Images of the BPA-F
utilization will be analyzed quantitatively for selected regions of interest.
<P>
Patients will participate with informed consent.  All information gathered in
this study will be treated confidentially and the privacy of the research
subject will be protected.  Patients will receive nothing by mouth (NPO) for at
least 4 hours prior to the scan.  Each patient will have a venous line kept open
by a 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.)
drip through an 18 to 20 gauge needle for adequate bolus administration of the
radiotracer.  Vital signs will be monitored prior to, during, and after the PET
scan.
<P>
Participation in the PET study involves exposure to radiation.  The estimated
total body radiation dose that the patient may receive from 2 x [18F]BPA-F
injections (10 mCi/injection) is 0.94 rem or approximately 19% of the annual
radiation dose allowed to a radiation worker in the course of his/her normal
work activities.  This radiation dose is not expected to produce any harmful
effects.
<P>
Adverse effects with BPA-F have been generally non-complicating.  Investigators
at Idaho State University have studied the acute toxicity of intravenously
administered BPA-F at very high doses.  The investigators found that intravenous
administration of BPA-F doses up to 3000 mg (BPA)/kg appeared to be well
tolerated when delivered over a 1-hour infusion period to minimally stressed
rats.
<P>
Arterial blood samples not to exceed a total volume of 60 mL may be drawn during
a period of 60 to 90 minutes.  The patient will have some discomfort in the arm.
There is a possibility of the artery being lacerated during cannulation;
however, the probability of this occurring is extremely slight.  There is also a
chance that arterial spasm may occur, which would make the patient's hand become
cold and painful.  If this occurs, the physician may treat the spasm with
lidocaine or stop the procedure.  Rarely, a clot may form and require surgical
removal.  A small collection of blood can occur when the tube is removed, and a
bruise may occur.  Overall, the complications described are unlikely to occur.
<P>
Patients participating in this study may be required to endure up to 4 hours of
PET imaging procedures.  The PET procedures have been broken into two 2-hour
segments, with intermittent ambulation.
<P>
 The purpose of this preliminary investigation is to evaluate whether PET using
[18F]BPA-F can be used to study the biodistribution of [18F]BPA-F.  The results
of this PET study will not be used to guide the therapy of the involved
patients.  Hence, involved patients will receive no direct benefit from this
study.  Their participation may result in an improved understanding of the
pharmacokinetics of [18F]BPA-F in patients with GBM and perhaps improve therapy
planning.

     This project is designed to quantify skeletal muscle blood flow and
metabolism for assessment of ischemia.  The ultimate goal is to provide a
non-invasive method of measuring viability of skeletal muscle following
traumatic vascular compromise.  The technique involves the use of both dynamic
positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with compartmental model analysis of
the resulting time activity relationships and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMRS).  PET scanning is ideally suited for this project because of
the capability to utilize labelled organic compounds.  Blood flow will be
measured with N-13 ammonia.  Metabolism will be assessed with F-18 deoxyglucose
(FDG).
<P>
     Specific aims of the project include:  1)  is there a threshold level of
muscle perfusion below which there is no chance of metabolic recovery,  2)  can
the degree of recovery be assessed by PET measurements of skeletal muscle
metabolism, in particular, with FDG and BCAA,  3)  can PET be used to assist
surgeons in choosing the optimal site for muscle debridement in order to
minimize the risk of both infection and recurrent tissue death, and maximize the
potential for wound healing, and  4)  can NMRS be used either in conjunction
with PET scanning or independantly to provide information about the healing
potential of skeletal muscle following acute injury.
<P>
     The study period is divided into two phases.  Phase I (one year) was
devoted to developing new methods applicable to skeletal muscle physiology
utilizing an isolated gracilis muscle canine model.  Models for determination of
skeletal muscle blood flow  (13N ammonia) and  both glucose and BCAA metabolism
18F deoxyglucose, 11C-leucine, were investigated for use with dynamic PET
scanning.  In Phase II (two years), the models are being studied for use in
human subjects.  Overlap of appropriate portions of the two phases in the early
years will provide time for clinical follow-up in the later years.
<P>
     Methodology:  All procedures in this study may be performed on an
outpatient basis.  A transmission scan is done using an external ring source
containing 5 mCi of 68Ge for the purpose of attenaution correction.  The patient
is given 13NH3 or 18FDG.  The average dose will be:  13NH3 - 15mCi and 18FDG -
7.5 mCi.  PET imaging of affected tissue begins according to the following
schedule:  13NH3:  upon completion of transmission scan, 18FDG:  1 hour after
comletion of 13NH3 scan.  Each scan continues for approximately 20 minutes.
Scans are done with a 15 slice machine 931/08 ECAT PET unit.  In the 18FDG
scans, glucose loading with 50 gm dextrose will be given either IV or PO in all
trauma patients.  In the diabetic patients, glucose loading will only be
employed when the initial blood sugar is below 140 mg/dl.  Measurement of blood
glucose is obtained in all patients at the time of glucose loading, one hour
after oral or IV glucose, and at the end of the study.
<P>
     Human Subject Involvement:  All women of reproductive age have serum HCG
analysis for pregnancy prior to the scans.  No studies will be performed on
patients less than 18 years of age.  Each clinical protocol and the use of
radioactive tracers has been approved by the UTMCK Human Subject Protection
Committee, the Isotope Committee, and the Radiation Protection Committee.
<P>
     All participants sign a consent form which includes the following:  nature
of the procedure, potential benefits and risks, and patients right to refuse any
stage of the protocol without jeopardizing their care, provision of any or all
medical treatment necessary as a result of participation, and names and
telephone numbers of investigators or UTMCK officials who can be contacted for
questions and concerns.  All examination results and patient medical records are
kept strictly confidential.
<P>
     Venous punctures are standard procedures and carry a low risk for
complications.  The radiation doses to the patient are within the radiation
exposure considered acceptable for routine diagnostic and nuclear medicine
procedures.  The risk of low level radiation is explained to the patient.
<P>
      Safety precautions at UTMCK are employed according to usual practices
within the medical center.  The PET facility is equipped with standard acute
care materials including a crash cart, cardiac monitors, and automated blood
pressure monitoring devices.  A board certified nuclear medicine physician and
critical care nurse are present during each study to supervise the use of
monitoring equipment and the delivery of radioisotopes.
<P>
       Any information derived from these studies can potentially benefit the
patient's acute wound management.  Ultimately, data from this study are expected
to provide a more practical approach to management of wounds in acute and
chronic situations.

a. The overall goals of the research program of the Vermont Cancer Center
Genetics Laboratory are to understand the causes, mechanisms, and consequences
of somatic mutations in humans and to use this understanding to identify
individuals at risk for deleterious health effects resulting from environmental
mutagens/carcinogens.  In this context, the theme of this research program has
been mutation induction in human T-lymphocytes.  The emphasis has been on using
studies of in vitro mutations in T-lymphocytes as tools for the experimental
analyses of in vivo observations.  Our goal in this proposal is to define the
genetic bases of mutator phenotypes arising in vivo in non-malignant cells.   In
particular, the sub-projects are to discover and characterize
spontaneous/induced molecular mutational spectra in the hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene in human colon cancer cells; to use hprt
mutation in T-cells to identify hypermutable clones among the hprt mutants
arising in vivo in individuals constitutionally heterozygous for functionally
relevant mutation in a mismatch repair gene; to use hprt mutation in T-cells to
identify hypermutable clones among the hprt mutants arising in vitro following
exposures of lymphocytes from mismatch repair constitutional heterozygotes to
model mutagens; to characterize the hypermutable T-cell clones so obtained as to
molecular spectra, in vitro hypersensitivity to killing, in vitro mutability,
repair capacity, and the specific mutation in the inherited allele; to develop a
system for direct selection of mismatch repair deficient T-cells arising in vivo
in humans; and to identify nutrients or other agents that reduce the mutability
of hypermutable cells.
<P>
b.  The method used to study individuals and cells is the hprt clonal assay.
This requires a blood sample.  T-lymphocytes are isolated from the blood sample
and the number of mutant lymphocytes determined by limiting dilution cloning.
Molecular analysis of the mutations in the T-lymphocytes is then performed on
the mutant lymphocytes.  For some experiments, isolated lymphocytes are treated
with radiation or chemicals in vitro.  For some individuals, some data on age,
smoking, and health history are collected.
<P>
c.   Some individuals are cancer patients and have had chemotherapy or
radiotherapy; however, this was not administered  under this proposal.  These
patients were only studied because they had already received therapy.   Some
individuals have been studied because of radon exposure in their homes.
<P>
d.
<P>
1.   In vivo hprt T-lymphocyte clonal assay  informed consent is obtained and
then blood samples collected in heparin tubes.  The mononuclear cell layer is
isolated and washed twice with saline.  Cells are plated at limiting dilution in
96-well (round bottom) microtiter dishes at 1, 2, 5, and 10 cells/well in the
absence of TG and at 1-3 x 10e4 cells/well in the presence of 10 micromolar
(uM), thioguanine (TG), T-cell growth factor (TCGF), phytohemagglutinin (PHA),
and accessory cells.  The microtiter dishes are incubated for 10-16 days and
growing colonies determined by use of an inverted phase contrast microscope.
Wells are scored for colony growth on days 10-14.  Mutant and wildtype colonies
in positive wells are isolated, propagated and stored for molecular analysis.
Mutant frequencies are calculated based on Poisson statistics as the ratio of
the cloning efficiency (CE) in the selective 6-thioguanine medium divided by the
CE in non-selection medium.  CE are based on the fraction of wells with positive
cell growth (CE = -ln Po/N, where Po is the fraction of wells without cell
growth and N is the number of cells seeded into wells).  The ratio of CE in the
presence or absence of 6-thioguanine defines the mutant frequency.
<P>
     In vitro assays for induced hprt mutations exposed human T-lymphocytes  The
in vitro assays employ either fresh or cryopreserved mononuclear (MNC) and are
cultured in the same medium as described for the in vivo assay.  The cells are
exposed before mitogen stimulation, i.e., while in Go phase, in order to more
closely approximate the in vivo situation.  After exposure, cells are incubated
with 1 u/ml PHA for 36-40 hours to achieve mitogen stimulation.  The stimulated
cells are plated as for the in vivo assay to determine the relative survival and
the pre-existing mutant frequency.  Phenotypic expression is accomplished by two
methods.  The first is through subculture for expression and the second is
through in situ expression.  The latter method is primarily used to isolate
mutant clones with independent mutations for molecular analysis.
<P>
2.   There are no risks except bruising and a very minor risk of infection at
the site of blood draw.

Note that the Project identifier is changed each year by the University of
Washington IRB board. The project is now referred to as 26-009-E, but was
formerly 25-023-E, 24-030-E, and 23-039-E. The project's name, Analytical
Cytogenetics and Gene mapping, supplants projects of identical nature that have
been conducted since 1992.
<P>
The goal of the projects covered by this human subjects project is to develop
and validate improved procedures for mapping of the genome, characterization of
normal variation at the DNA level, detection of chromosomal abnormalities
associated with human disease, and identification of genes whose mutation causes
human disease. Procedures involve flow cytometric quantification of chromosomes
isolated from dividing cells, analysis of DNA sequences by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of
specific DNA sequences in dividing and non-dividing cells.
<P>
DNA sequences are mapped to their chromosomal location using peripheral blood
cells from normal donors. Polymorphism in the distribution of telomeric repeats
is being studied using tissue culture lines and normal control samples for FISH
and DNA analyses. Chromosomal abnormalities are being detected and progress is
being made toward identifying the genes involved by using FISH to map specific
DNA sequences to chromosomes maintained in tissue culture lines; cells from
normal donors serve as an important control for the normal pattern of
hybridization.
<P>
Human subjects are involved to obtain blood for biomedical and biochemical tests
outside the human body. Peripheral blood is obtained by venipuncture. Volunteers
will donate 5 ml of blood, which will be collected under conventional sterile
conditions. Blood samples are used to prepare microscope slide preparations or
suspensions of chromosomes, either directly or after short-term culture to
produce dividing cells. In some cases, DNA analyses such as PCR or hybridization
are conducted. Donors fall into 2 classes: (1) normal donors (local volunteers
within the department) who are more than 18 years of age, a maximum of 50
subjects per year; and (2) individuals with known chromosome abnormalities and
genetic disease who are more than 18 years of age, a maximum of 50 subjects per
year (although most samples in class 2 are obtained as established cell lines).
Donors in the two classes will donate a maximum of 10 and 2 times per year,
respectively. Normal donor samples will be identified only by a code number in
subsequent experiments, thus assuring donor confidentiality. The link between
code number and subject name will be kept in a locked computer file by the
principal investigator (PI). Blood samples of patients will be obtained at other
institutions in the course of our collaborator's experiments or during routine
clinical evaluation. The samples will be encoded at the collaborating
institutions, and donor identities will not be known to the investigators at the
University of Washington, thus assuring donor confidentiality. The principal
investigator requires that human subjects approval be obtained at the
collaborating institutions for this project. Normal donors are randomly
selected, balanced in numbers between males and females and different ethnic
backgrounds.
<P>
The possible risks and discomforts from the procedures are considered unlikely,
but include temporary pain, bruising and soreness of affected tissue or
surrounding region, formation of scar tissue, and infection. No in vivo studies
are performed. Samples are collected specifically for this project, but donors
are selected purely on the basis of their willingness to donate blood. Some
donors are asked to donate additional samples to reduce variability (normal
polymorphism) in our analyses.
<P>
The study may not result in direct benefits to individual subjects, but it may
contribute to the understanding and detection of human disease and may,
therefore, be of some benefit to human society in the future.

     The Registries study the biokinetics, dose, and possible biological effects
of actinide elements such as plutonium in persons with documented occupational
or other intakes.  Tissues, or in some cases the whole body, are obtained at
autopsy from volunteer donors and analyzed radiochemically.  These data are
evaluated in conjunction with the occupational exposure and medical histories
obtained during life to determine biokinetic parameters fundamental to the
development, verification, or refinement of radiation protection standards;
possible biological effects attributable to radiation; and risk coefficients.
An archival tissue material repository is also maintained and tissue materials
made available to other researchers.  The participants in the program are
selected from volunteers who have been previously exposed, occupationally or
otherwise.  The registries do not expose persons to radiation or chemicals, nor
administer drugs or substances of any kind.  Permissions for tissue samples and
medical and dosimetry records are typically obtained from fully informed donors
well in advance of death, or in some cases, are volunteered by next-of-kin after
death.  A few registrants may be asked to participate in special studies which
involve excreta collection and in vivo counting.  There are no known risks to
the volunteer participants in this research.
<P>
     The privacy of participants is protected in strict accordance with the
Federal Privacy Act and applicable laws of the state of Washington.  In
practice, personal identifiers are not published and all hard copy records are
maintained in locked storage; automated data are protected with multilevel
security to provide access only to authorized individuals.  Data users must sign
a confidentiality agreement before access can be granted.

     The objective of this project is to determine whether inherited defects in
myocardial fatty acid metabolism, which can lead to cardiomyopathy and sudden
death, can be delineated with positron emission tomography (PET).
<P>
     The research is not, at the current time, used for diagnosis or for
decisions regarding treatment to individual subjects.  Subjects are recruited
who have been diagnosed as having inherited defects in fatty acid metabolism.
Their siblings are also invited to participate.  For subjects younger than 18
years of age, parental consent is obtained.  For subjects 18 years of age or
older, informed written consent is obtained.
<P>
     For assessment of myocardial perfusion, oxygen-15 water is administered
intravenously, and for delineation of vascular structures (subjects  18 years of
age or older), oxygen-15 carbon monoxide is administered by inhalation.
Regional myocardial perfusion is quantified using a one-compartment mathematical
model.  For assessment of regional myocardial oxygen consumption, subjects
receive carbon-11 acetate intravenously, and for delineation of long-chain fatty
acid metabolism, carbon-11 palmitate intravenously.  Regional myocardial oxygen
consumption and regional myocardial long-chain fatty acid metabolism are
delineated with mathematical models.  Blood samples are obtained for analysis of
plasma substrates and radioactive metabolites.
<P>
     All human subjects receive intravenous administration of ionizing
radioisotopes, and subjects who are 18 years of age or older also receive
ionizing radioisotopes by inhalation.   All data are collected specifically for
this project.  Subjects are assigned a study number and are not identified by
name.   Data are maintained in the Principal Investigator's laboratory under
lock and are not disseminated other than to collaborators or to appropriate
government agencies.  The procedure does involve administration of ionizing
radiation.  This amounts to 31% of the maximum permissible to radiation workers
in subjects 18 years of age or older and 6% in subjects younger than 18 years of
age.   This amount of ionizing radiation is too small to have a directly
measurable effect.  Subjects undergo the research study after an overnight fast
(which may be uncomfortable), have an intravenous catheter placed (associated
also with discomfort and potential bruising, bleeding, or infection), and  must
lie in the PET scanner for a total of 1 1/2 to 2 hours (in 30 minute-intervals),
which can be uncomfortable.

<h1><b><center>DIFFUSION BATTERIES</b></h1><p>

</center>
<HR>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

<p>

We describe in this section EML's diffusion batteries (DB), and their use in measuring aerosol
particle size distributions.  There are five EML designs covering two main applications:<p>

<p>
<pre>
                           No. of    Typical<br>
                           channels  flow rate     Typical<br>
Type of diffusion battery  or stages (L/min)     application<br>
_____________________________________________________________________<br>

Multichannel disk-type      5         3        Radon progeny<br>
Multistage disk-type       12         4        Aitken particles<br>
Multichannel screen-type    5        25        Radon progeny<br>
Multistage screen-type     11         4        Aitken particles<br>
Multichannel carbon-type    5       283        Radon progeny<br>
</pre>
<p>

<p>

The multichannel designs, also called parallel diffusion batteries, are those in which air is drawn
simultaneously through side-by-side samplers.  Thus, all aerosol samples needed to construct the
particle size distribution are collected simultaneously.  In the multistage design, also called
series, the aerosol samples are collected sequentially.  The term Aitken particles refers to outdoor
atmospheric particles with diameters &lt; 0.2 &#181;m.  (However, diffusion batteries can be
used for
somewhat larger particles, either indoors or outdoors.)  The term radon progeny particles
refers to those few particles, typically 1 in 10E6, which carry short-lived radon progeny atoms. 
The batteries can also be used for other species, such as sulfate in airborne particles.<p>


The type most commonly used in recent years is the multichannel screen battery, so this will
be used for illustration in the discussion to follow.  Consult Knutson and Sinclair (1979),
Sinclair (1972), Sinclair and Hoopes (1975), and Sinclair et al. (1978) for further information
on the other types.<p>


We also use wire screens for a different but related radon progeny aerosol measurement
(George, 1972).<p>

<p>

<h2><b>2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE MULTICHANNEL SCREEN DIFFUSION
BATTERY</b></h2><p>


<a href="2_1.gif">Figure 1</a>, EML multichannel screen diffusion battery, shows the main
components of the
multichannel screen diffusion battery, and <a href="2_2.gif">Figure 2</a>, Cross section of
the sampler units of the
multichannel screen diffusion battery, shows one of the components in the cross section.  The
system consists of five filter-type aerosol sampler units, each preceded by a different number
of screens:<p>

<p>
<pre>
          Sampler unit:  B0   B1   B2   B3   B4<br>

     Number of screens:  0    1    5    15   40<br>
</pre>
(Unit B0 is also called the reference filter.)<p>

<p>

The screen used is a standard industrial twill-weave stainless-steel screen with the following
dimensions:<p>

<pre>
     Mesh                  250/cm<br>
     Wire diameter         20 &#181;m<br>
     Screen thickness      50 &#181;m (As measured with a machinist's 
                                   micrometer)<br>
     Solid fraction        0.345<br>
     Diameter of flow area 10.16 cm<br>
</PRE>
<p>


<p>

</h2><b>3. SAMPLING PROCEDURES</b></h2><p>



In normal use, the five samplers are loaded with clean 0.8 &#181;m pore membrane filters (Type
AA, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and air is drawn at 25 L/min through each unit. As the
air flows through the screens, particles are selectively removed from the airstream and
deposited on the wires.  Particles that escape collection by the screens are collected on the
filters.  For radon progeny the preferred sampling period is 5 min, but 10 or 20 min can be
used if the concentration is low.  For other species, the sampling period must be adjusted.<p>


After sampling, the filters are removed and analyzed.  When analyzing for radon progeny, any
of the three alpha-counting protocols described in <a href="rt01.html">Radon and Thoron
Progeny</a> can be used.  As
described there, it is important that the counting begin no more than 2 min after the end of
sampling.  This can be accomplished if two experienced operators are on hand at the time
when the filters are transferred.<p>

<p>

<h2><b>4. CALCULATIONS</b></h2><p>


Recovery of the particle size distribution from the activity measured on the five filters is
possible only with a quantitative knowledge of transport through the screens as a function of
the particle size.  We currently use the "CKK" equation (Cheng et al., 1980; Cheng and Yeh,
1983):<p>


<center>PHI = exp [-n  m  <i>ln </i>(10)]</center><p>


where<p>

<ul>
     PHI  =    the fractional penetration through a stack of n screens,<p>
     n    =    number of screens in the stack,<p>
     m    =    A<sub>0</sub> Pe<sup>-2/3</sup> + A<sub>1</sub> R<sup>2</sup> +
A<sub>2</sub> R<sup>2/3</sup> Pe<sup>-1/2</sup>,<p>
        A<sub>0</sub>  =    1.96,<p>
        A<sub>1</sub>  =    3.37,<p>
        A<sub>2</sub>  =    1.94,<p>
     Pe   =    u<sub>f</sub> d<sub>w</sub>/D, the Peclet number,<p>
     R    =    d<sub>p</sub>/d<sub>w</sub>, the interception parameter,<p>
     D    =    kTC/(3 pi &#181; d<sub>p</sub>), the diffusion coefficient,<p>


     k    =    1.38x10<sup>-23</sup> J &#176;K<sup>-1</sup>, Boltzmann's
constant,<p>

     T    =    temperature in degrees absolute, normally 293&#176;K,<p>

     C    =    1 + (lambda/d<sub>p</sub>)[2.514 + 0.800 exp(-0.55 d<sub>p</sub>/lambda)], the
Cunningham slip factor,<p>


     d<sub>p</sub>  =    particle diameter, m,<p>
     d<sub>w</sub>  =    wire diameter, m,<p>


     Lambda    =    mean free path of air molecules, normally 66 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m,<p>


     &#181;    =    viscosity of air, normally 1.81 x 10<sup>-5</sup> Pa sec, and<p>

     u<sub>f</sub>  =    air approach velocity, m sec<sup>-1</sup>.<p>
</ul>
<p><i>If your browser does not support sub- and superscripts, <A href="aer06eq1.html">click
here</a> for an image of this equation.</i><p>

The values for A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub> apply to the standard (250
mesh cm<sup>-1</sup>) screen - see Cheng and Yeh (1983) for other screens.  The equation for
the Cunningham factor is from Hinds
(1982).  In some of our computer programs we use an older equation with slightly different
coefficients.<p>


To analyze data from our diffusion batteries, we use one of the following two computer codes,
which run on IBM-compatible personal computers:<p>
<ul>

     <b>UNFOLDPS</b> - This is a Pascal program that uses the above-described Twomey
algorithm. 
An alternative algorithm, the expectation-maximization algorithm, described by Maher and
Laird (1985), is also available.<p>


     <b>NMSIMPLX</b> - This program, also in Pascal, makes use of the Nelder-Mead
downhill
simplex method to fit single or dual lognormal distributions to the data.<p>
</UL>

The logic involved in the first of these is the same as that in <b>ExMaxDB.Pas</B>, described in
Knutson
(1989).<p>

<h1><center>GRADED SCREEN ARRAY</b></h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

<h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

<p>

The graded screen array (GSA, also called the graded screen diffusion battery) is used for
measuring the particle size of radon progeny in the range below 20 nm.  The GSA is not capable
of dealing with larger sized aerosol particles, particularly those above 50 nm.  Therefore, the
GSA should be used simultaneously with one of the <a href="aer06.html">diffusion batteries</a>
or with the <a href="aer05.html">MOUDI</a>
impactor.  For example, the GSA used together with the MOUDI provides size information in the
range of 0.5-5000 nm.<p>


It is permissible to use the GSA alone, but only in laboratory studies in which radon progeny or
thoron progeny are sampled from a chamber free of larger aerosol particles.<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2.   APPARATUS REQUIRED</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   One set of four circular stainless steel screens, each mounted on a metal ring -- the
properties of these screens are:<p>
<pre>

Screen      Mesh,       Wire diameter,     Screen         Solid

</pre>
<p>


2.   A holder for the size of the screen selected.<p>


3.   A supply of Metricel DM-800 filters of the same size as the selected screens, and an
open-faced holder.<p>


4.   A pair of rotameter-type flow meters, one for the GSA and one for the open-faced filter,
and a suction pump.<p>


5.   Five drawer-type scintillation alpha counters of the type described in <a
href="rtp01.htm#TB1">Radon and
Thoron
Progeny</a>, Table 1.<p>


6.   A personal computer equipped with Keithley-Metrabyte CTM-05 (or equivalent) pulse-
counting hardware and the software program <b>ALPHALOG</b>, as described in
Raabe-Wrenn
<a href="rtp04.htm">Least-Squares Method</a>.<p>


7.   A stopwatch.<p>

<p>

<h2><b> 3.  Procedure</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   Set up and check out the alpha-counting equipment, as described in <a
href="trp01.htm#APCS">Alpha Particle
Counting System</a>, Section B.<p>

<p>

2.   Calibrate both flow meters as described in <a href="rtp01.htm#ST">Sampling Train</a>,
Section A.<p>

<p>

3.   Using the alpha counters, check the background activity of the wire screens (the
background should be no higher than 0.2 counts/min).  This step may be omitted if it is
known that the screens have not been used in the past 24 h.<p>

<p>

4.   Mount the four screens into the holder so that the air will flow through in the sequence
60-100-200-635; orient the mounting rings so that the flush side faces upstream.<p>

<p>

5.   Set up the filter for sampling, as described in <a href="rtp01.htm#ST">Sampling Train</a>,
Section B; set up
the
screen-holder in the same way.<p>

<p>

6.   Draw samples simultaneously through the filter and the screens, as described in Raabe-
Wrenn <a href="rtp04.htm">Least-Squares Method</a>.<p>

<p>

7.   After sampling, transfer the screens and the filter into separate alpha counters, and
perform minute-by-minute counting using <b>ALPHALOG</b>, as described in Raabe-Wrenn
<a href="rtp04.htm">Least-Squares Method</a>.<p>

<p>

8.   Use program<b> RWRENN6.EXE</b> to calculate activity concentrations from the
above count
data.<p>

<p>

9.   Use this data to calculate particle size distributions, as described in<a href="aer08.htm">
Mathematical
Analysis of Particle Size Data</a>.  This method has been used to measure the diffusion
coefficient of unattached radon progeny in filtered room air (George and Knuteson,
1994).<p>

<p>

<h2><b> 4.  Quality Control.</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   For the air sampling and alpha counting steps, follow the quality control procedures
outlined in <a href="rtp01.htm#ST">Sampling Train</a>, Section A and <a
href="rtp01.htm#APCS">Alpha Particle Counting System</a>,
Section B.<p>

<p>

2.   Whenever possible, take duplicate or triplicate samples from each experimental
condition.<p>

<h1><center><b>RAABE-WRENN LEAST-SQUARES METHOD</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>


<p>

As used here, the term &quot;Raabe-Wrenn least squares method&quot; refers to a certain
configuration of
alpha counters, a computer, hardware, and software for measuring radon decay product
concentrations (Raabe and Wrenn, 1969).  This sytem can handle up to 10 samples
simultaneously, which is needed when measuring the particle size distribution of radon progeny
particles (<a href="aer05.htm">Mondi</a>, <a href="aer06.htm">Diffusion Batteries</a>, <a
href="aer07.htm">Graded Screen Array</a>).  
The method is also convenient for single samples.<p>



     <b>A.  Components.</b><p>


1.   Up to 10, as needed, drawer-type gross alpha counters, Model TH-29-B or
equivalent.<p>


2.   A portable personal computer with two free 8-bit expansion slots.<p>


3.   Two CIO-CTR05 computer interface boards (Computer Boards 44 Wood Ave.,
Mansfield, MA 02048) or equivalent, installed in adjacent slots of the above computer
(item 2).  One board must be set to address 0300 (hex) and the other to address 0304
(hex).<p>


4.   Two 37-pin D-connectors and hoods (Wire Pro, Inc., types 17-10370 and 17-1371;
available from Newark Electronics).  Install five female K-LOC connectors (King
Electronics, Tuckahoe, NY) through the side panel of each hood, and wire them to the
pins corresponding to the five CIO-CTR05 counter inputs.  <p>
<ul>
     <b>Note</b>: the D-connectors must be made up in complimentary pairs so both can be
connected to the CIO-CTR05 boards at the same time.<p>
</ul>

5.   Up to 10, as needed, RG-174 coaxial cables with K-LOC connectors (King Electronics,
Tuckahoe, NY).<p>



6.   Copies of the computer programs <b>ALPHALOG</b> (or <b>ALPHALG2</b>) and
<b>RWRENN6</b>; see
<a href="rtp03.htm#TB1">Table 1 in Modified Tsivoglou Method</a>.  The full set of updated
programs is
available as downloadable files on <a href="progms.html">EOKEMLUS.DOE</a>.<p>


     <b>B.  Procedure.</b><p>


1.   Set up apparatus; it is best to arrange the alpha counters in a line, five on either side of the
computer.  Install cables and power-packs.<p>


2.   Start the computer and make a directory with a name appropriate for the project you are
working on.  Copy <b>ALPHALOG</b> and <b>RWRENN6</b> into this directory.  Or copy
these two
programs into a directory entitled EOKPROGS and place EOKPROGS into the PATH
statement.<p>


3.   Start <b>ALPHALOG</b>; ensure that the computer's time and date are set correctly;
when
prompted, rn\un the test using the internal 1000 Hz pulser (a 10-second counting period is
appropriate) to verify that the boards have been properly installed.<p>


4.   Skip over the &quot;Enter parameters&quot; step (it is usually more convenient to enter
the
parameters during counting).<p>



5.   Set the counting period (normally 60 seconds) and the number of intervals (normally
1000) and press Y in answer to the &quot;Ready to Start&quot; prompt.  The program will go
into a
preview mode, in which counts are collected and displayed -- but not saved -- every 10
sec.<p>



6.   Collect the filter or particle size samples as described in <a href="aer05.htm">Mondi</a>,
<a href="aer06.htm">Diffusion Batteries</a>,
<a href="aer07.htm">Graded Screen Array</a> , or <a href="rtp01.htm#ST">Sampling
Train</a> in Radon and
Thoron Progeny.<p>



7.   Promptly transfer the filters or other sampling substrates into the alpha counters; be sure
that the substrates are placed &quot;dirty side up&quot; and ZnS scintillator disks are placed
&quot;shiny
side up.&quot;<p>



8.   Verify from the computer preview screen that all channels are collecting counts; then with
an eye on the stopwatch, start official counting by hitting ENTER.  Make note of the time
at which counting was started.<p>


9.   Once the counting is well underway, choose option F7 to record the parameters associated
with the sample.  Enter information when prompted.<p>


10.  After sufficient data has been collected, press shift F10 to stop; 40 min of data is sufficient
for calculating radon progeny, but 240-300 min is needed for calculating thoron progeny.<p>


11.  If the parameters were entered during the data collection period (step 9), press Y to
proceed directly to the program <b>RWRENN6</b>, which calculates the decay product
concentrations.  If not, press N, then correct the parameters using an edit program such as
MSDOS EDIT.  Then run <b>RWRENN6</b>.<p>

<h1><b><center>MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF PARTICLE SIZE
DATA</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

<p>

This section describes the steps needed to calculate particle size distributions from samples
taken with the <a href="aer05.htm">MOUDI</a> impactor, a <a href="aer06.htm">diffusion
battery</a>, and a <a href="aer07.htm">graded screen array</a>, used
individually or in combination.  It can also be used for Sierra impactor data as described in
High Volume <a href="aer04.htm">Cascade Impactors</a>.<p>


The mathematical algorithms used in these calculation programs are described by Maher and
Laird (1985), Solomon and Ren (1992), Knutson (1991), and Twomey (1975).  Early versions
of some of these programs are given in Knutson (1989).  The full set of updated programs is
available as downloadable files on <a href="progms.html">EOKEMLUS.DOE</a>.<p>

<p>

<h2><b>2.  EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES NEEDED</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   An input data file (on disk) produced by the program <b>RWRENN6.EXE.</b><p>


2.   Copies (on disk) of the files <b>ABC^INP2.EXE</b>, <b>NMSIMPLX.EXE</b>,
<b>UNFOLDPS</b> and
<b>EMLMOUDI.EFF</b>.<p>



3.   An IBM-compatible personal computer, preferably 386 or better.<p>



<h2><b>3.  Procedure</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   Prepare the computer for this task as follows:<p>


<ul>
     a.   From the root directory of the computer's C: drive, make a directory called UTIL
and
copy the above .EXE files into the UTIL directory.<p>


     b.   Include the UTIL directory in the PATH statement.<p>


     c.   From the root directory, make a directory called (for example)  SIZEDATA and
copy
the above-mentioned input data file and the EMLMOUDI.EFF file into this directory.<p>


     d.   Change to the SIZEDATA directory.<p>

</UL>
2.   Type ABC^INP2; when requested, supply: <p>

     <ul>
     -    the name of the RWRENN6 output file, <p>

     -    the number of data points in each data set (that is, the number of alpha counters
that
were used to collect the data),  <p>

     -    whether or not the <b>RWRENN6</b> program was instructed to analyze for
thoron as well as
radon progeny, <p>

     -    answer Y to the question about mapping.  <p>

<p></ul>

This procedure produces a new file, with name ending in the character ^, that is ready for use
by either <b>NMSIMPLX</b> or <b>UNFOLDPS</b>.<p>


From this point on, the procedure differs according to which sampler or combination of
samplers was used.  <p>
<pre>
                         Program
     Sampler             to use         Option
<p>
Diffusion battery        NMSIMPLX       Classical RnP<br>
Graded screen array      NMSIMPLX       Unimodal<br>
Diffusion battery plus<Br>
   graded screen array   NMSIMPLX       Bimodal (fixed, common geometric
                                        standard deviation, GSD)

</pre><p>

Both of these programs require that certain information be entered from the keyboard.  When
answering a Y or N question it is not necessary to press ENTER.  Other responses require
pressing the ENTER key to signal  completion of the response.  For many questions, the
proper response will be obvious; these are not discussed in the itemized procedure below.<p>



3.   <u>Diffusion Battery Alone</u>.  As indicated above, use <b>NMSIMPLX</b>.  Supply
data as
indicated below.   Type:<p>

<ul>

     -    Y in answer to each question about acceptable data quality.<p>

</ul><p>

The progress of the calculation can be viewed on the screen as <b>NMSIMPLX</b> runs.  The
results
will also be stored in an ASCII file with an extension .NM5.  The program produces an
uncertainty estimate for each of the calculated parameters; this estimate is printed directly
below the value of parameter.<p>



4.   <u>Graded Screen Array Alone</u>.  Use <b>NMSIMPLX</b>.  Type in the data
indicated below.<p>

     -    N in answer to the questions about adding screens and showing rules,<p>

     -    BCDE X in answer to prompt for GSconfig,<br>

          [<b>Note: </b>This is the proper response if: the four screens were stacked into
one holder during
the sampling, such that the air flowed through in the sequence B-C-D-E; the filter was in
a separate holder;  and the data in the input file are in  the sequence B,C,D,E,X

     -    N to the question about inlet losses,<p>

     -    the flow area of the screens that were used,<p>

     -    1 to select unimodal,<p>

     -    N in answer to the question about default starting values,<p>

     -    1 in answer to the request for a starting diameter,<p>

     -    Y or N, as desired, to the question about switching to diffusion coefficient, (if no,
answer
Y or N, as appropriate, to the next question about temperature and pressure),<p>

     -    0 in answer to the question about Monte Carlo replications,<p>

     -    Y in answer to each question about acceptable data quality.<p>

</ul><p>

The program will run and produce a file as described under <b>3. Diffusion Battery Alone</b>,
except that
the file extension will be .NM1.<p>

<p>

     -    AB to select the combination of diffusion battery and graded screens,<br>

          [<b>Note: </b>This is the proper response if the diffusion battery data
<u>precedes</u> the graded screen
data in the input data file.  Otherwise interchange A and B.]<p>

     -    a digit from 1 to 5 to specify which diffusion battery,<p>

     -    the diffusion battery flow rate in L/min,<p>

     -    the uncertainty in the above flow rate (normally about 3% of the flow rate
itself),<p>

     -    N in answer to the questions about adding screens and showing rules,<p>

     -    BCDE X in answer to prompt for GSconfig,<br>

</ul><p>

The output file from the above steps will have the extension .NM2.<p>

<p>

6.   <u><a Name="aer08SECC6">MOUDI</a>, alone or with a reference filter</u>.  Use
<b>UNFOLDPS</b>.  Before proceeding, review the
input data file and make note of which impactor stages are represented in the file.  (Often the
upper stages are not alpha-counted.)  Also review the EMLMOUDI.EFF file and make note
of the 50% cut points of the first and last stage for which there is data in the input file.  Type
in the following information:<p>

<ul>

     -    a mask, such as *.??^, for the input data file,<p>

the last
impactor stage for which there is data in the input file.]<p>

     -    4000 in answer to the question about largest size,<br>

          [<b>Note:</b> This value should not exceed 120% of the 50% cut-point of the

     -    1 in answer to the question about particle density,<br>

          [<b>Note:</b> Entering 1 will cause the results to be presented in terms of
equivalent unit-density
spheres, i.e., the aerodynamic equivalent diameter.  Entering the actual density of the
particle will cause the results to be presented in terms of the Stokes equivalent diameter.]<p>

     -    Y or N, as appropriate, to the questions about data present in the input file,<p>

     -    Y in answer to the questions about data quality,<p>

     -    ENTER in answer to the request for file name,<p>

     -    Y in response to the question about 50-line screen.<p>

</ul><p>

As <b>UNFOLDPS</B> runs, the progress of the current calculation is shown near the bottom
of the
screen.  The upper part of the screen shows the results of the previous calculation.  When
finished, the long-form output can be found in a file with extension ending in &amp;, and the
short-form output will be in a file with extension ending in (.<p>

7.   <u>MOUDI plus Graded Screen Array</u>.   Use <b>UNFOLDPS</b>.  Before
proceeding, review the input
data file and the EMLMOUDI.EFF file as described in the last section.  Then type in the

     -    1.5 in answer to the question about particle density,<br>

          [<b>Note:</b> This value of particle density is approximately correct for indoor
aerosols; the
results will be g iven in terms of Stokes equivalent diameter, which is appropriate when
combining data from impactors and diffusion batteries, or graded screens.]<p>

<h2><b>4.  Quality Control</b></h2><p>

<p>

1.   Using a text-viewing or text-editing program, examine the output file from
<b>NMSIMPLX</b> or
from <b>UNFOLDPS</b>.  Starting at the end of the file, spot-check the column titled
"RawData" to
ensure that the input data have been properly matched to the stages of the sampling device.  It
will be necessary to consult the RWRENN6 output file to determine the proper matching.<p>



2.   Examine each block of results in the output file.  Any block of data that has more than one
negative input datum should be discarded.  Examine also the &quot;ChiSqr&quot; value, which is
a
measure of the internal consistency of the data.  If this number is &gt; 25, the data block should
be discarded unless the reason for the high value can be identified and fixed.  <p>



3.   Similarly if the ChiSqr value is &lt; 1, the data block should be discarded because the
uncertainties in the input data are too large to support calculation of the particle size
distribution.<p>

<h2><b><center>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Many of EML's research programs require that samples be taken of aerosols, defined as &quot;a
system of colloidal particles dispersed in a gas&quot;.  The suspending gas is normally indoor or
outdoor air.  Smoke and mist are common examples of aerosols, but frequently the particles
are so small that the aerosol cannot be detected by eye.  Typically, environmental aerosols
contain a broad mixture of chemical species, both liquid and solid, including some radioactive
materials.<p>


The sampling of aerosols involves a number of complications that are not present when
sampling for environmental gases.  Therefore, specialized training or experience is highly
desirable for personnel responsible for aerosol sampling.  Some universities -- such as New
York University (Institute of Environmental Medicine) -- conduct annual or semiannual one-
semester courses in aerosol science; inquiries can be made about auditing such courses.  Also,
the University of Minnesota offers a 4-day short course each summer.<p>


Excellent books are now available which consolidate the advances in aerosol science over the
past 25 years.  Two of the best are the textbook by Hinds (1982) and the handbook by the
ACGIH (1989).<p>


There are two broad categories of aerosol sampling methods: integral and size-selective.  In
the former, the goal is to collect a single sample in which the sizes and types of collected
particles accurately represent those in the air.  The integral samplers commonly used at EML
are described in <a href="aer02.html">Total Particle Collections</a> and <a
href="rtp01.html">Radon and Thoron Progeny</a>.  Size-selective
samplers are designed to provide information on particle size as well as particle amount. 
Descriptions of the size-selective samplers commonly used at EMLare found in <a
href="aer02.html">Total Particle
Collections</a>, <a href="aer03.html">Dichotomous Sampler</a>, <a href="aer04.html">High
Volume Cascade Impactors</a>, <a href="aer05.html">Moudi</a>, <a
href="aer06.html">Diffusion
Batteries</a>, and <a href="aer07.html">Graded Screen Array</a>.<p>


Among the size-selective samplers, the high volume cascade impactor and the diffusion battery
(when supplemented with the appropriate chemical analysis) produce sufficient data to generate
complete particle size spectra for the chemical species of interest.  Although shortcuts are
possible, the proper way to generate these spectra is to apply a suitable mathematical technique
to &quot;unfold&quot; or &quot;deconvolute&quot; the data (see <a
href="aer08.html">Mathematical Analysis of Particle Size Data</a>).<p>


The modern method of presenting aerosol size spectrum data is the &quot;generalized
histogram&quot;
described in Chapter E of ACGIH (1989).<p>

<h1><center><b>MOUDI</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>



Procedures are presented for using the micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) in
determining the particle size distribution of the decay products of radon and/or thoron gas. 
The MOUDI covers the size range of 50-5000 nm and complements the capabilities of the
<a href="aer06.html">diffusion batteries</a>, which cover a range of 5-500 nm.  To sample a
broader size range, 0.5-
5000 nm, the MOUDI may be used in parallel with the <a href="aer07.html">graded screen
array</a>.<p>


The MOUDI consists of two basic assemblies -- the cascade impactor itself, and its housing. 
The cascade impactor consists of an air inlet, eight impaction stages, and a backup filter,
which is located in the base of the impactor.  Each stage contains a removable impact plate for
the stage above and a nozzle plate for the stage below.<p>


Contained in the housing is a valve for controlling the flow through the impactor, two pressure
gauges to monitor the flow, and a mechanism for rotating the impaction stages.<p>


The table below gives the main characteristics of the MOUDI.  Further information about the
MOUDI can be found in Marple (1991).<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2. SAMPLING PROCEDURE</b></h2><p>
<p>

     <b>Preparation</b>.  Assemble the MOUDI for sampling by first inserting a filter in the
backup filter holder at the base of the MOUDI, then by placing clean impaction plates on each
stage starting from bottom to top of the impactor.  Coating the plates with silicone spray (to
prevent bounce) is necessary only in dry, dusty conditions.  Finally, place the cover onto the
upper stage.<p>

<p>

     <b>Checking air flow rate.</b>  Start the pump and adjust the pressure reading to 1250
Pa
for the upper gauge and 45 kPa for the lower one.  If this cannot be accomplished, stop the
pump and disassemble the MOUDI.  Reassemble it after checking each stage to see if the
gaskets are properly placed and greased.  Then repeat the air flow test.  If the pressure
readings are satisfactory, proceed to sampling.  <b>Caution:</b>  After testing the air flow rate,
always check the backup filter, which is
easily broken by a reverse airflow when the sampling pump is shut off.<p>

<p>

     <b>Sampling.</b>  For radon progeny, the sampling time is usually 5 min, but 10 to
20 min is also used for low radon concentrations.  For measurements of thoron progeny, a
sampling period of 10 or more hours might be needed.  In this case, use the rotating feature by
turning on the switch at the base of the MOUDI.  Use a stopwatch to time the sampling and
keep the watch running to time the interval between sampling and counting.<p>

<p>

     <b>Alpha counting.</b>  After sampling, disassemble the MOUDI starting with the upper
stage and working downward to the base.  Transfer the impaction plates into the alpha
counters, being careful to keep them in order.  Alpha count the plates simultaneously and
analyze for activity using methods described in Raabe-Wrenn <a
href="rtp04.html">Least-Squares Method</a>.<p>


Generally, 10 alpha counters are needed.  To complete sample transfer within 2 min, two
experienced operators are needed.<p>
<p>

     <b>Calculation of particle size.</b>  Follow the procedures given in <a
href="aer08.html">Mathematical Analysis
of Particle Size Data</a> Sections C-6 or C-7.  Use the calibration curves supplied by the
manufacturer.<p>

<h2><center><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Presented here are the three methods commonly used at EML for determining the concentration
of radon and thoron progeny in air.  All three methods - <a href="rtp02.htm">modified
Kusnetz</a>, <a href="rtp03.htm">modified
Tsivoglou</a>,
and <a href="rtp04.htm">Raabe-Wrenn least squares</a> - are based on collection in a known
volume of air
through a
filter in a known time period, and on counting the radioactivity on the filter after sampling.  The
methods described are suitable for use in the laboratory, in homes, and in the workplace.  The
same sampling and counting equipment are used, but with different counting and calculational
procedures.<p>



Units: when specifying the concentration of individual progeny nuclides, the Systeme
Internationale (SI) unit is Bq/m&#179;; when specifying the potential alpha energy concentration
(PAEC) of radon or thoron progeny, the SI unit used is J/m&#179;.<p>


These procedures have also been adopted by the World Health Organization (George, 1993).<p>


<p>

<h2><b><center><a NAME="ST">2.  SAMPLING TRAIN</a></b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

All three methods require a sampling train such as that shown in <a href="2_4.gif">Figure
1</a>, Sampling Train for
radon progeny measurements.<p>



     <b>A.  Air pump and flowmeter.</b><p>


A portable air pump capable of moving 10-20 L/min through a high efficiency filter is required. 
The pump should be rugged, light weight, quiet, and operate from the voltage line in the
building.  A calibrated flowmeter to measure the flow rate through the filter holder assembly
should be attached upstream of the intake of the pump.  Calibration of the flowmeter is air
density dependent and care should be taken if used at different altitudes.  The pump flowmeter
train assembly should be calibrated at the same elevation, and at the same resistance that is
caused by the filter and by the other component parts in the sampling train as shown in <a
href="2_4.gif">Figure 1</a>.  Never measure the air flow rate from
the
exhaust of the pump because of possible leakage in the pump housing.<p>


     <b>B.</b> <b> Air filters and filter holder.</b><p>


Use membrane filters with nominal pore size &lt; 0.8 &#181;m, or glass fiber with a collection
efficiency of &gt; 99.9%.  Membrane filters exhibit negligible
alpha-particle
absorption during alpha counting.  Glass fiber filters allow deeper penetration of particles, but
with the recommended flow rates, face velocity (&lt; 100 cm/sec), and short sampling period,
particle burial in the filter is negligible.  Any other type of filter medium should be investigated
for good surface deposition characteristics.  In general, small pore filters exhibit the best surface
collection, but also present the highest resistance to air flow.  To compensate for this, use a
higher capacity pump or a larger diameter filter and filter holder.  The diameter of the filter can
either be 2.5 or 4.7 cm depending on the size of the filter holder and the detector counter used. 
The connecting tubing between pump and filter holder should be a thick-walled pressure type
hose.  Filter holders should be of the open faced type to prevent the loss of radon progeny
particles due to plate out upstream from the filter.  The biggest error in measuring radon progeny
by collection on a filter is often from a defective filter holder.  To prevent this, make sure the
filter holder-filter assembly is airtight and has the proper O-ring seal.<p>


     <b>C.  Timing device.</b><p>

<p>

Sample collection timing is very important in the short sampling periods used for short-lived
radionuclides.  Errors may be significant if operators rely on their wristwatch and on their
memory.<p>


<center><p>

<h2><b><a NAME="APCS">3.  ALPHA PARTICLE COUNTING
SYSTEM</a></b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

     <b>A.  Description.</b><p>


Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the two alpha-particle counters most used at EML to
measure the alpha activity deposited on a filter.  Both counters are designed for gross alpha (total
alpha) counting, in which the alpha particles from Po-218 (6 MeV) and Po-214 (7.7 MeV) are
counted without discrimination.<p>



Both counting systems consist of a simple scintillation disc (ZnS silver activated screen)
mounted on or close to the face of a photomultiplier tube, and placed in close proximity to the
filter.  [In the TH-29-B (see Table 1), the scintillator is a separate Mylar disk coated on one side
with ZnS; be sure the coated side faces the filter.]  The photo-multiplier tube and preamplifier are
housed in light-tight housing and are connected to a stable high voltage supply and a scaler.<p>


     <b>B.  Calibration.</b><p>

<p>

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the certified alpha standard source most used at EML to
periodically measure the efficiency of the counting systems.  The counting efficiency is the ratio
of the counting rate (in counts/sec) of the instrument to the known activity (in Bq) of the
standard source.  The EML counters described above have an efficiency of about 48%, but this
figure should always be remeasured after the counters are moved to a field site.<p>



Checking calibration is also a good quality assurance step.  Measured efficiencies which are
outside the range 47-49%, or which are not reproducible, are an indication of equipment
malfunction and these counters should not be used.<p>


Because the counters are energy-independent, efficiencies determined with the Am-241 or Pu-239 
sources (alpha energies 5.53 MeV and 5.15 MeV, respectively) are believed to apply to
radon/thoron progeny as well.  For very precise work, the efficiency as measured above should
be multiplied by the factor shown in Table 2 to correct for backscatter.  This correction takes into
account the fact that the alpha emission from the front face of a metal plate is slightly higher than
from the same activity deposited on a filter.<p>

<h1><center><b>RAABE-WRENN LEAST-SQUARES METHOD</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>


<p>

As used here, the term &quot;Raabe-Wrenn least squares method&quot; refers to a certain
configuration of
alpha counters, a computer, hardware, and software for measuring radon decay product
concentrations (Raabe and Wrenn, 1969).  This sytem can handle up to 10 samples
simultaneously, which is needed when measuring the particle size distribution of radon progeny
particles (<a href="aer05.htm">Mondi</a>, <a href="aer06.htm">Diffusion Batteries</a>, <a
href="aer07.htm">Graded Screen Array</a>).  
The method is also convenient for single samples.<p>



     <b>A.  Components.</b><p>


1.   Up to 10, as needed, drawer-type gross alpha counters, Model TH-29-B or
equivalent.<p>


2.   A portable personal computer with two free 8-bit expansion slots.<p>


3.   Two CIO-CTR05 computer interface boards (Computer Boards 44 Wood Ave.,
Mansfield, MA 02048) or equivalent, installed in adjacent slots of the above computer
(item 2).  One board must be set to address 0300 (hex) and the other to address 0304
(hex).<p>


4.   Two 37-pin D-connectors and hoods (Wire Pro, Inc., types 17-10370 and 17-1371;
available from Newark Electronics).  Install five female K-LOC connectors (King
Electronics, Tuckahoe, NY) through the side panel of each hood, and wire them to the
pins corresponding to the five CIO-CTR05 counter inputs.  <p>
<ul>
     <b>Note</b>: the D-connectors must be made up in complimentary pairs so both can be
connected to the CIO-CTR05 boards at the same time.<p>
</ul>

5.   Up to 10, as needed, RG-174 coaxial cables with K-LOC connectors (King Electronics,
Tuckahoe, NY).<p>



6.   Copies of the computer programs <b>ALPHALOG</b> (or <b>ALPHALG2</b>) and
<b>RWRENN6</b>; see
<a href="rtp03.htm#TB1">Table 1 in Modified Tsivoglou Method</a>.  The full set of updated
programs is
available as downloadable files on <a href="progms.html">EOKEMLUS.DOE</a>.<p>


     <b>B.  Procedure.</b><p>


1.   Set up apparatus; it is best to arrange the alpha counters in a line, five on either side of the
computer.  Install cables and power-packs.<p>


2.   Start the computer and make a directory with a name appropriate for the project you are
working on.  Copy <b>ALPHALOG</b> and <b>RWRENN6</b> into this directory.  Or copy
these two
programs into a directory entitled EOKPROGS and place EOKPROGS into the PATH
statement.<p>


3.   Start <b>ALPHALOG</b>; ensure that the computer's time and date are set correctly;
when
prompted, rn\un the test using the internal 1000 Hz pulser (a 10-second counting period is
appropriate) to verify that the boards have been properly installed.<p>


4.   Skip over the &quot;Enter parameters&quot; step (it is usually more convenient to enter
the
parameters during counting).<p>



5.   Set the counting period (normally 60 seconds) and the number of intervals (normally
1000) and press Y in answer to the &quot;Ready to Start&quot; prompt.  The program will go
into a
preview mode, in which counts are collected and displayed -- but not saved -- every 10
sec.<p>



6.   Collect the filter or particle size samples as described in <a href="aer05.htm">Mondi</a>,
<a href="aer06.htm">Diffusion Batteries</a>,
<a href="aer07.htm">Graded Screen Array</a> , or <a href="rtp01.htm#ST">Sampling
Train</a> in Radon and
Thoron Progeny.<p>



7.   Promptly transfer the filters or other sampling substrates into the alpha counters; be sure
that the substrates are placed &quot;dirty side up&quot; and ZnS scintillator disks are placed
&quot;shiny
side up.&quot;<p>



8.   Verify from the computer preview screen that all channels are collecting counts; then with
an eye on the stopwatch, start official counting by hitting ENTER.  Make note of the time
at which counting was started.<p>


9.   Once the counting is well underway, choose option F7 to record the parameters associated
with the sample.  Enter information when prompted.<p>


10.  After sufficient data has been collected, press shift F10 to stop; 40 min of data is sufficient
for calculating radon progeny, but 240-300 min is needed for calculating thoron progeny.<p>


11.  If the parameters were entered during the data collection period (step 9), press Y to
proceed directly to the program <b>RWRENN6</b>, which calculates the decay product
concentrations.  If not, press N, then correct the parameters using an edit program such as
MSDOS EDIT.  Then run <b>RWRENN6</b>.<p>

<h1><b><center>DIFFUSION BATTERIES</b></h1><p>

</center>
<HR>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

<p>

We describe in this section EML's diffusion batteries (DB), and their use in measuring aerosol
particle size distributions.  There are five EML designs covering two main applications:<p>

<p>
<pre>
                           No. of    Typical<br>
                           channels  flow rate     Typical<br>
Type of diffusion battery  or stages (L/min)     application<br>
_____________________________________________________________________<br>

Multichannel disk-type      5         3        Radon progeny<br>
Multistage disk-type       12         4        Aitken particles<br>
Multichannel screen-type    5        25        Radon progeny<br>
Multistage screen-type     11         4        Aitken particles<br>
Multichannel carbon-type    5       283        Radon progeny<br>
</pre>
<p>

<p>

The multichannel designs, also called parallel diffusion batteries, are those in which air is drawn
simultaneously through side-by-side samplers.  Thus, all aerosol samples needed to construct the
particle size distribution are collected simultaneously.  In the multistage design, also called
series, the aerosol samples are collected sequentially.  The term Aitken particles refers to outdoor
atmospheric particles with diameters &lt; 0.2 &#181;m.  (However, diffusion batteries can be
used for
somewhat larger particles, either indoors or outdoors.)  The term radon progeny particles
refers to those few particles, typically 1 in 10E6, which carry short-lived radon progeny atoms. 
The batteries can also be used for other species, such as sulfate in airborne particles.<p>


The type most commonly used in recent years is the multichannel screen battery, so this will
be used for illustration in the discussion to follow.  Consult Knutson and Sinclair (1979),
Sinclair (1972), Sinclair and Hoopes (1975), and Sinclair et al. (1978) for further information
on the other types.<p>


We also use wire screens for a different but related radon progeny aerosol measurement
(George, 1972).<p>

<p>

<h2><b>2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE MULTICHANNEL SCREEN DIFFUSION
BATTERY</b></h2><p>


<a href="2_1.gif">Figure 1</a>, EML multichannel screen diffusion battery, shows the main
components of the
multichannel screen diffusion battery, and <a href="2_2.gif">Figure 2</a>, Cross section of
the sampler units of the
multichannel screen diffusion battery, shows one of the components in the cross section.  The
system consists of five filter-type aerosol sampler units, each preceded by a different number
of screens:<p>

<p>
<pre>
          Sampler unit:  B0   B1   B2   B3   B4<br>

     Number of screens:  0    1    5    15   40<br>
</pre>
(Unit B0 is also called the reference filter.)<p>

<p>

The screen used is a standard industrial twill-weave stainless-steel screen with the following
dimensions:<p>

<pre>
     Mesh                  250/cm<br>
     Wire diameter         20 &#181;m<br>
     Screen thickness      50 &#181;m (As measured with a machinist's 
                                   micrometer)<br>
     Solid fraction        0.345<br>
     Diameter of flow area 10.16 cm<br>
</PRE>
<p>


<p>

</h2><b>3. SAMPLING PROCEDURES</b></h2><p>



In normal use, the five samplers are loaded with clean 0.8 &#181;m pore membrane filters (Type
AA, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and air is drawn at 25 L/min through each unit. As the
air flows through the screens, particles are selectively removed from the airstream and
deposited on the wires.  Particles that escape collection by the screens are collected on the
filters.  For radon progeny the preferred sampling period is 5 min, but 10 or 20 min can be
used if the concentration is low.  For other species, the sampling period must be adjusted.<p>


After sampling, the filters are removed and analyzed.  When analyzing for radon progeny, any
of the three alpha-counting protocols described in <a href="rt01.html">Radon and Thoron
Progeny</a> can be used.  As
described there, it is important that the counting begin no more than 2 min after the end of
sampling.  This can be accomplished if two experienced operators are on hand at the time
when the filters are transferred.<p>

<p>

<h2><b>4. CALCULATIONS</b></h2><p>


Recovery of the particle size distribution from the activity measured on the five filters is
possible only with a quantitative knowledge of transport through the screens as a function of
the particle size.  We currently use the "CKK" equation (Cheng et al., 1980; Cheng and Yeh,
1983):<p>


<center>PHI = exp [-n  m  <i>ln </i>(10)]</center><p>


where<p>

<ul>
     PHI  =    the fractional penetration through a stack of n screens,<p>
     n    =    number of screens in the stack,<p>
     m    =    A<sub>0</sub> Pe<sup>-2/3</sup> + A<sub>1</sub> R<sup>2</sup> +
A<sub>2</sub> R<sup>2/3</sup> Pe<sup>-1/2</sup>,<p>
        A<sub>0</sub>  =    1.96,<p>
        A<sub>1</sub>  =    3.37,<p>
        A<sub>2</sub>  =    1.94,<p>
     Pe   =    u<sub>f</sub> d<sub>w</sub>/D, the Peclet number,<p>
     R    =    d<sub>p</sub>/d<sub>w</sub>, the interception parameter,<p>
     D    =    kTC/(3 pi &#181; d<sub>p</sub>), the diffusion coefficient,<p>


     k    =    1.38x10<sup>-23</sup> J &#176;K<sup>-1</sup>, Boltzmann's
constant,<p>

     T    =    temperature in degrees absolute, normally 293&#176;K,<p>

     C    =    1 + (lambda/d<sub>p</sub>)[2.514 + 0.800 exp(-0.55 d<sub>p</sub>/lambda)], the
Cunningham slip factor,<p>


     d<sub>p</sub>  =    particle diameter, m,<p>
     d<sub>w</sub>  =    wire diameter, m,<p>


     Lambda    =    mean free path of air molecules, normally 66 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m,<p>


     &#181;    =    viscosity of air, normally 1.81 x 10<sup>-5</sup> Pa sec, and<p>

     u<sub>f</sub>  =    air approach velocity, m sec<sup>-1</sup>.<p>
</ul>
<p><i>If your browser does not support sub- and superscripts, <A href="aer06eq1.html">click
here</a> for an image of this equation.</i><p>

The values for A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub> apply to the standard (250
mesh cm<sup>-1</sup>) screen - see Cheng and Yeh (1983) for other screens.  The equation for
the Cunningham factor is from Hinds
(1982).  In some of our computer programs we use an older equation with slightly different
coefficients.<p>


To analyze data from our diffusion batteries, we use one of the following two computer codes,
which run on IBM-compatible personal computers:<p>
<ul>

     <b>UNFOLDPS</b> - This is a Pascal program that uses the above-described Twomey
algorithm. 
An alternative algorithm, the expectation-maximization algorithm, described by Maher and
Laird (1985), is also available.<p>


     <b>NMSIMPLX</b> - This program, also in Pascal, makes use of the Nelder-Mead
downhill
simplex method to fit single or dual lognormal distributions to the data.<p>
</UL>

The logic involved in the first of these is the same as that in <b>ExMaxDB.Pas</B>, described in
Knutson
(1989).<p>

<h1><b><center>HIGH VOLUME CASCADE IMPACTORS</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>



A description of the Sierra Model 235 multistage cascade impactor, which is used to measure
the particle size distribution of both indoor and outdoor aerosols, is presented here.  The
original design was developed and sold by Sierra Instruments, Inc., but now is sold by
Andersen Instruments, Inc., Sierra Anderson Division, 4801 Fulton Industrial Blvd., Atlanta,
GA  30336.  A number of articles are available in the literature that deal with both the
theoretical and experimental development of inertial impactors (Marple et al., 1973, 1974;
Marple and Willeke, 1979).<p>


At EML, this impactor is used for research studies and is not commonly used for long-term
sampling projects.  The methods described herein are used for 1-5 day sampling periods, and
the units are checked on a daily basis.<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2. OPERATING CONDITIONS.</b></h2><p>



The sampler is capable of sampling at flow rates ranging from 0.56 m&#179;/min to 1.68
m&#179;/min. 
The flow is regulated by a constant flow controller that automatically adjusts to any flow rate
change caused by loading conditions or motor variances.  In the majority of our outdoor
sampling efforts, the unit is operated at a flow rate of 0.85 m&#179;/min (30 cfm) to prevent
overloading and to assure that the flow rate remains constant during the sampling interval.<p>



     <b>Configuration.</b>  The unit is housed in a standard high-volume sampling shelter
without
a size selective inlet.  Under some conditions a 10 &#181;m or 15 &#181;m size-selective inlet is
used. 
The impaction substrate is slotted Whatman No. 41 filter paper treated with light mineral oil
(Fisher Scientific, 50 Faden Road, Springfield, NJ  07081).  The oiled filter minimizes particle
rebound and reentrainment, which has been found during previous impactor evaluations to bias
impactor size distribution measurements toward smaller sizes (Knuth, 1979a).  This method of
oil treating the filter is not compatible with mass determination by weighing methods.  All of
our analyses are done by chemical or radiochemical procedures.<p>


     <b>General maintenance.</b>  The impactor plates are washed with alcohol and the slots
are
cleaned using a cotton swab or soft cloth.  Care must be taken so that the integrity of the slot
is not altered by using any cleaning material that may damage the slot spacing or edges in any
manner.  The plates are dried with compressed air and the slots are visibly examined to assure
that no foreign material remains in the slot.  The impactor plates should be numbered 1-5 in a
corresponding corner of the plates, starting with the largest slotted plate numbered 1 to the
smallest plate numbered 5.<p>


     <b>Loading procedures.</b>  The loading and unloading of the impactor assembly should
be
done in a clean environment (clean room or clean bench).  The loaded unit can then be
transported to the sampling area and installed on site.  In handling the filters, reasonable care
should be taken to minimize contamination of the sample.  Filters should be handled at the
extreme corners, and latex gloves or forceps should be used during the following loading
procedures.<p>


1.   Soak the total number of filter impaction substrates needed for the number of impactors
being loaded in mineral oil using a Pyrex or comparable dish.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  A few
extra oiled
filters may be required for blank analysis values.<p>


2.   After the filters are completely wetted, they are removed from the oil and allowed to
drip until all excess oil has run off.<p>


3.   Starting with the slotted base plate, place a mineral oil wetted filter on the plate
assuring that the paper is centered and all slots are open.  Using a glass rod, assure that
the paper is in contact with the plate and no air bubbles are present.<p>


4.   Carefully place the slotted plate, #5, on top of the filter.  Assure that it is flat, and that
it secures the impaction filter #5 beneath it to the base plate.  At this time, the filter
paper should be visible through the slots.  If not, remove plate #5 and reposition it 180
degrees.  Check again.<p>


5.   Continue placing filters and plates #4 to #1 as described in Step 4 above.<p>


6.   After positioning slotted plate #1, tighten the two screws that secure the five plates
sandwiched to the base plate.  At this time, wipe any excess oil from the sides of the
plate assembly.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  If there is an extreme amount of oil seeping through the
edges
of the plates, start over at Step 1 allowing a longer time for the filters to drip dry.<p>


7.   The extra wetted filter is carefully folded over on itself once or twice and placed in a
polyethylene bag.  Attach an appropriate identification label to the bag.<p>


8.   The loaded impactor assembly is taken to the sampling site and placed in position over
an appropriate back-up filter.  For our work, a suitable back-up filter is determined
dependent on the analytical procedure to be used.  Back-up filters which have been
used for different applications are <a href="sp20.html">glass fiber</a>, <a
href="sp17.html">Microsorban</a>, 
<a href="sp18.html">Microdon</a>, and Whatman No. 41.<p>


9.   Tighten wing nut assemblies on four corners of the base plate to secure impactor
assembly to back-up filter holder.<p>

<p>

     <b>Sampling procedure.</b><p>



1.   Start unit and adjust the in-line orifice reading to the desired setting.  This setting
corresponds to the flow rate determined from a calibration curve of the orifice. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>: 
A top loading calibrated orifice can be used to verify flow rate in the field.<p>


2.   Record all pertinent flow and time information required.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  If a
number of runs
will be required for the experiment, a data sheet form should be developed and used for
recording data.<p>


3.   Whenever possible, the unit should be visibly checked during the sampling period.  If
an in-line orifice is being used, the manometer reading can be read and recorded at any
time during the exposure period without interrupting the sampling procedure.<p>


4.   At the end of the sampling period, record all data and if possible recheck the flow rate
with the top loading orifice.<p>

<p>

     <b>Sample recovery.</b><p>


1.   Carefully remove the impactor assembly from above the back-up filter.  Immediately
fold the back-up filter over on itself, soiled side in, twice if required, and place in
prelabeled polyethylene bag.<p>


2.   Take the impactor assembly to a clean environment and begin the disassembly
procedure by carefully removing the top plate, #1, folding the soiled filter over on
itself, soiled side in, and placing it in a prelabeled envelope or polyethylene bag. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>:  We have found that polyethylene bags are better than glassine envelopes
for
storing the oiled filters prior to analysis.  A glass rod can be used for creasing the oiled
filter when folding.<p>


3.   Place the five oiled impaction filter polyethylene bags into a larger polyethylene bag,
appropriately labelled, along with the back-up filter and the appropriate blank oiled
filter.  This is the extra-oiled impaction filter prepared prior to loading the impactor. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>:  Although you can usually determine the stage the oiled filter came from
by
visual determination of the width of the deposit on the filter, care should be taken when
removing the filters from the impactor to assure that the filter is correctly identified

4.   The impactor plates can be placed in an alcohol bath to remove any excess oil from the
plates prior to cleaning for assembly.  Compressed air can be used to clean slots if
necessary.<p>

<p>

     <b>Data analysis.</b>  Various methods of describing the particle size distribution of
sampled
aerosol have been used through the years for impactor data.  In order to use any one or more
of these methods it is necessary to determine the amount of material collected on each of the
impactor stages and back-up filter.  At EML, this is usually done by measuring the
radioactivity or by chemical analyses.<p>



Two of the most used methods of describing the distribution derived from impactor data are
histograms and cumulative plots (Knutson and Lioy, 1989).  At EML we use a computer
program, <a href="progms.html">UNFOLDPS</a>, to construct smooth particle size spectra
from the impactor data.  To
do this, construct an impactor efficiency file from the curves given in Figure 7 of Knuth
(1979b) per the instructions given in UNFOLDPS, then follow the procedure for <a

<hr>
Downloadable in a ZIP file: <a href="eokemlus.zip">EOKEMLUS.ZIP</a> (655KB).

<hr>
<p>
<b>README.TXT</b> contains information about the programs.  A brief description of the
programs is provided below.<p>
<UL>


<li><b>##^UNFDP.EXE</b> - This is a "bridge" program.  It reads files that are produced by
AlphaLg2 and writes an output file that can be read by UnfoldDP.
<p>
<li><B>ABC^INP3.EXE</b> - This is also a bridge program.  It reads the detailed files produced
by RWRenn7, UnfoldDP, or WWN5, picks out the meat, then writes a compact file ready for
input into UnfoldPS  or NMsimplx.
<p>
<li><b>ALPHALG2.EXE</b> - This program works with a pair of MetraByte CTM-05 boards 
(or equivalent) to collect gross count data from up to 10 pulse sources simultaneously.  Typically,
counts are recorded in one minute increments.  Data are stored in ASCII files automatically
named to show the year, month, date, hour, and minute that counting was started.
<p>
<li><b>CAMELOT.EXE</b> - This program downloads, stores (ASCII files, extension ACM) 
and displays alpha spectral data from the Victoreen AlphaCam.  It's a partial replacement for
Victoreen's program SANDAL. 
<p>
<li><b>CNTEFF3.EXE</b> - This program uses Monte Carlo techniques to determine the 
alpha-counting efficiency of axi-symmetric source-detector geometries.  Energy dissipation in
absorbers can be taken into account.
<p>
<li><b>DISTFIT^.EXE</b> - This program operates on DISTFIT-format files that can be 
produced by TSI's Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer.  Certain calculations can be done and ASCII
files can be generated for input to a plotting program.
<p>
<li><B>EAACALC2.EXE</b> - This program massages and displays the binary files produced 
by EAALOG2.
<p>
<li><B>EAALOG2.EXE</b> - With the help of a DAS-8 analog input board from Metrabyte (or
equivalent) this program interacts with TSI's Electrical Aerosol Size Analyzer (EAA).  The EAA
is cycled every third  minute and the resulting data are stored in binary files with extension EAA. 
The accumulated data can be reviewed while the machine is running.<p>

<li><b>GBE3.EXE</B> - The program does time-stepping integration of the set of nine
equations comprising the &quot;room model.&qout;  Given certain inputs, we try to predict the
change of concentration of radon and its progeny with time.  The names signifies the "generalized
Bateman equations".
<p>
<li><B>JWT1.EXE</b> - This program interprets data from two-filter-tube samples. Using
sequential 10-minute counts collected by AlphaLg2, it calculates the concentration of both radon
and thoron gas. It is named after J.W. Thomas, who illucidated the theory of the two-filter
method.
<p>
<li><b>NMSIMPLX.EXE</b> - This program is used to fit single or double log normal  particle
size distributions to data from various aerosol samplers. It uses the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex
method.
<p>
<li><b>OUT^PSI.EXE</b> - This program operates on the output files from UNFOLDPS, 
extracting the meatier parts and writing these into a simple ASCII table (extension DAT) for
convenient input into plotting programs.  It is meant for use with radon progeny data.
<p>
<li><b>OUT^QPRO.EXE</b> - This is much like the program above, except that the output file
is in "quote and comma" format, convenient for use with Quattro Pro.
<p>
<li><b>RADCHAIN.EXE</b> - This is meant for exploratory calculations on the ingrowth or
decay of nuclides in a radiactive decay chain.  Both initial value problems and continuous
collection problems are treated.  The calculations are done using Samuelsson's recursive
technique.
<p>


<li><B>RNPCNTS4.EXE</b> - This program uses random numbers produce synthetic 
alpha-count data to test out programs like RWRENN7.
<p>
<li><b>RUDYTEST.EXE</b> - This program will produce a table of lung deposition as a 
function of particle size, based on Rudolf, et al.
<p>
<li><B>RWRENN7.EXE</b> - This program uses the Raabe and Wrenn weighted least squares 
technique to calculate Po-218, Pb-214, Bi-214, Pb-212 and Bi-212 concentrations from sequential
gross alpha counts.
<p>
<li><B>SCINTCEL.EXE</b> - This program uses the Monte Carlo method to calculate the 
counting efficiency of cylindrical scintillation cells. Efficiency is calculated for radon gas, thoron
gas, and each of their decay products.  Temperature, pressure and counting threshhold are among
the parameters considered.
<p>
<li><b>STRIPPER.EXE</b> - This is an editor program for stripping out unwanted lines, or
keeping wanted lines, from line-organized ASCII files.<p>

<li><b>TUBEDEP.EXE</b> - This program calculates deposition of highly diffusional particles
in circular tubes using three equations given by Ingham, J. Aerosol Sci 22:253-257.
<p>
<li><b>UCPCLOG.EXE</b> - This program collects data from the serial port of the  TSI
Ultrafine Codensation Particle Counter.  NOTE: the UCPC's serial port is not IBM-compatable,
so a special cable is needed.
<p>
<li><B>UNFOLDDP.EXE</b> - This program uses the expectation-maximization algorithm to 
calculate Po-218, Pb-214, Bi-214, Pb-212 and Bi-212 from either 1) gross alpha count data or 2)
alpha counts in the three main energy bands.  It's an alternative to RWRenn7.
<p>
<li><b>UNFOLDPS.EXE</b> - This program uses the expectation-maximization algorithm to 
unfold particle size histograms out of data from certain aerosol samplers.  It can deal with wire
screen diffusion batteries of almost any configuration, and the same for impactors.  The EAA is
also covered. 
<p>
<li><b>UNFTEST.EXE</B> - This can be used to generate synthetic data for input to 
UnfoldPS.  Mainly a familiarizaton tool.   
<p>
<li><b>WWN5.EXE</b> - This program calculates Po-218, Pb-214 and Bi-214 from  any
three-period gross alpha counts protocol.  Use is  made of W.W. Nazaroff's compact equations.

<h2><center><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The procedures and instruments commonly used at EML for measuring radon are presented here. 
The main sampling methods are grab, two filter tube, continuous, and integrating.  Both active
and passive methods are included.  These methods are used in laboratory applications as well as
in situations requiring mobility and portability.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>QUALITY CONTROL</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

To verify the measurement accuracy of all monitoring devices for radon and thoron, periodic
intercomparison measurements are made with pulse ionization chambers (Fisenne and Keller,
1985).  The pulse ionization chambers are the primary calibration instruments traceable directly
to the NIST through use of their standard Ra-226 reference solutions.  The accuracy of the
thoron
concentrations is obtained through intercomparisons (Knutson et al., 1994).<p>

<h1><b><center>CONTINUOUS RADON MONITORING</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>

<p>

Continuous reading radon monitors are ideal for measuring varying concentrations of radon over
a long period of time.  The scintillation flask used for radon grab
sampling can be adapted to measure radon continuously by sampling at f1ow rates of 1-2 L/min
as described in Thomas and Countess (1979).  Any of the three flasks used at EML can serve this
purpose.  The flask is mounted on top of the phototube in light-proof housing.  Sample air is
drawn continuously through the flask by means of a pump, with a high efficiency filter mounted
inline to remove dust particles and radon progeny.  The number of alpha counts accumulated at
the end of each counting interval, usually 30-60 min, is stored in a computer or printed out on
paper tape.<p>



The entire system is calibrated in a continuous operation mode to obtain the appropriate
C<sub>f</sub> at a
fixed flow rate and at varying radon concentrations.  In an atmosphere in which the concentration
of radon changes drastically, the calibration of the whole system becomes tedious.  However,
with the aid of modern desk computers the average radon concentration during the sampling
interval can be calculated accurately.  This is accomplished by means of an equation that takes
into consideration the number of counts obtained in preceding sampling intervals (Thomas and
Countess, 1979).<p>



The C<sub>f</sub> from four continuous 2-L scintillation flask radon monitors used in the EML
radon
calibration facility at flow rates of 1 L/min range from 0.0019-0.0020 counts/min per Bq/m
(4.2-4.5 counts/min per pCi/L).  The range in factors results from differences in phototubes
and scintillation flasks.<p>

<h2><center><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Seven major facilities that are used in research programs at EML are described.  Four of these are
stationary, and are located in EML's quarters in New York City (Radon Pulse Ionization
Chamber, Exposure Facility, 
Clean Room, Electron Microscope).  Two major on-site EML facilities are used for research on
Rn gas measurements, instruments, and methods (the pulse ionization chamber facility and the Rn,
Th, and progeny exposure facility).  

Two of the facilities are
mobile and are used in field sampling/ measurement work all over the U.S.(Mobile Laboratory,
Work Boat).  The seventh facility is an outdoor laboratory located in rural New Jersey (Chester
Regional Baseline Station).<p>

<p>

All seven facilities have been built up over a period of many years and we anticipate that they will
continue in operation for many additional years.  Although modifications to the facilities will be
made from time to time, the descriptions given here should remain substantially correct for years
to come.<p>

<h2><center><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Presented here are the three methods commonly used at EML for determining the concentration
of radon and thoron progeny in air.  All three methods - <a href="rtp02.htm">modified
Kusnetz</a>, <a href="rtp03.htm">modified
Tsivoglou</a>,
and <a href="rtp04.htm">Raabe-Wrenn least squares</a> - are based on collection in a known
volume of air
through a
filter in a known time period, and on counting the radioactivity on the filter after sampling.  The
methods described are suitable for use in the laboratory, in homes, and in the workplace.  The
same sampling and counting equipment are used, but with different counting and calculational
procedures.<p>



Units: when specifying the concentration of individual progeny nuclides, the Systeme
Internationale (SI) unit is Bq/m&#179;; when specifying the potential alpha energy concentration
(PAEC) of radon or thoron progeny, the SI unit used is J/m&#179;.<p>


These procedures have also been adopted by the World Health Organization (George, 1993).<p>


<p>

<h2><b><center><a NAME="ST">2.  SAMPLING TRAIN</a></b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

All three methods require a sampling train such as that shown in <a href="2_4.gif">Figure
1</a>, Sampling Train for
radon progeny measurements.<p>



     <b>A.  Air pump and flowmeter.</b><p>


A portable air pump capable of moving 10-20 L/min through a high efficiency filter is required. 
The pump should be rugged, light weight, quiet, and operate from the voltage line in the
building.  A calibrated flowmeter to measure the flow rate through the filter holder assembly
should be attached upstream of the intake of the pump.  Calibration of the flowmeter is air
density dependent and care should be taken if used at different altitudes.  The pump flowmeter
train assembly should be calibrated at the same elevation, and at the same resistance that is
caused by the filter and by the other component parts in the sampling train as shown in <a
href="2_4.gif">Figure 1</a>.  Never measure the air flow rate from
the
exhaust of the pump because of possible leakage in the pump housing.<p>


     <b>B.</b> <b> Air filters and filter holder.</b><p>


Use membrane filters with nominal pore size &lt; 0.8 &#181;m, or glass fiber with a collection
efficiency of &gt; 99.9%.  Membrane filters exhibit negligible
alpha-particle
absorption during alpha counting.  Glass fiber filters allow deeper penetration of particles, but
with the recommended flow rates, face velocity (&lt; 100 cm/sec), and short sampling period,
particle burial in the filter is negligible.  Any other type of filter medium should be investigated
for good surface deposition characteristics.  In general, small pore filters exhibit the best surface
collection, but also present the highest resistance to air flow.  To compensate for this, use a
higher capacity pump or a larger diameter filter and filter holder.  The diameter of the filter can
either be 2.5 or 4.7 cm depending on the size of the filter holder and the detector counter used. 
The connecting tubing between pump and filter holder should be a thick-walled pressure type
hose.  Filter holders should be of the open faced type to prevent the loss of radon progeny
particles due to plate out upstream from the filter.  The biggest error in measuring radon progeny
by collection on a filter is often from a defective filter holder.  To prevent this, make sure the
filter holder-filter assembly is airtight and has the proper O-ring seal.<p>


     <b>C.  Timing device.</b><p>

<p>

Sample collection timing is very important in the short sampling periods used for short-lived
radionuclides.  Errors may be significant if operators rely on their wristwatch and on their
memory.<p>

<h2><b><a NAME="APCS">3.  ALPHA PARTICLE COUNTING
SYSTEM</a></b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

     <b>A.  Description.</b><p>


Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the two alpha-particle counters most used at EML to
measure the alpha activity deposited on a filter.  Both counters are designed for gross alpha (total
alpha) counting, in which the alpha particles from Po-218 (6 MeV) and Po-214 (7.7 MeV) are
counted without discrimination.<p>



Both counting systems consist of a simple scintillation disc (ZnS silver activated screen)
mounted on or close to the face of a photomultiplier tube, and placed in close proximity to the
filter.  [In the TH-29-B (see Table 1), the scintillator is a separate Mylar disk coated on one side
with ZnS; be sure the coated side faces the filter.]  The photo-multiplier tube and preamplifier are
housed in light-tight housing and are connected to a stable high voltage supply and a scaler.<p>


     <b>B.  Calibration.</b><p>

<p>

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the certified alpha standard source most used at EML to
periodically measure the efficiency of the counting systems.  The counting efficiency is the ratio
of the counting rate (in counts/sec) of the instrument to the known activity (in Bq) of the
standard source.  The EML counters described above have an efficiency of about 48%, but this
figure should always be remeasured after the counters are moved to a field site.<p>



Checking calibration is also a good quality assurance step.  Measured efficiencies which are
outside the range 47-49%, or which are not reproducible, are an indication of equipment
malfunction and these counters should not be used.<p>


Because the counters are energy-independent, efficiencies determined with the Am-241 or Pu-239 
sources (alpha energies 5.53 MeV and 5.15 MeV, respectively) are believed to apply to
radon/thoron progeny as well.  For very precise work, the efficiency as measured above should
be multiplied by the factor shown in Table 2 to correct for backscatter.  This correction takes into
account the fact that the alpha emission from the front face of a metal plate is slightly higher than
from the same activity deposited on a filter.<p>

<h1><b><center>TOTAL PARTICLE COLLECTIONS</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>


The procedures discussed in this section are limited to the specific requirements of programs
currently conducted at EML and may not be applicable to other studies that require the total
collection of air particles.<p>


Since January 1963, EML has conducted the Surface Air Sampling Program (SASP).  In 1987,
the Remote Atmospheric Measurements Program (RAMP) was initiated as an extension and
modification of SASP.  The primary objectives of SASP/RAMP are to identify and study the
temporal and spatial distribution of anthropogenic and natural radionuclides in the lower
troposphere.  These objectives are achieved by filtration of large volumes of air to concentrate
the radionuclides in the aerosol prior to sample analyses.  The sampling procedures used in
SASP/RAMP would not be appropriate if one requires particle size analyses or particle specific
activity distributions.  The filters used in these programs also will not collect uncharged,
unattached radioactive gas molecules.<p>


To sample large volumes of air and obtain total particle collection, it is necessary to use an
appropriate filter material and an air mover.  In SASP/RAMP, the air mover
must be capable of continual operation at high flow rates under harsh environmental conditions.
To calculate air concentrations of radionuclides, it is necessary to
accurately determine the total volume of the air which has been sampled.<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2.  FILTER MATERIAL FOR TOTAL PARTICLE COLLECTIONS
</b></h2><p>


The criteria for filter selection are good collection efficiency for submicron particles at the range
of face velocities used, high particle and mass loading capacity, low-flow resistance, low cost,
high mechanical strength, low-background activity, compressibility, low-ash content, solubility
in organic solvents, non-hygroscopicity, temperature stability, and availability in a variety of
sizes and in large quantities.  In the selection of a filter material, a compromise must be made
among the above criteria that best satisfies the sampling requirements.  An excellent review of air
filter material used to monitor radioactivity was published by Lockhart et al. (1964).  Lippmann
(1989a) also provides information on the selection of filter materials for sampling aerosols by
filtration.<p>


In the mid-1960s, the filter material used in SASP was changed from Type 6 asbestos paper to an
organic filter, <a href="sp17.html">Microsorban</a>, to simplify the radiochemical analyses. 
This
filter material of the type Delbag-Microsorban dry air filter medium 99/97-4200 consisted of a
layer of cellulose gauze onto which microfibers of polystyrene were deposited in &quot;random
disorder&quot;.  This in turn was protected with another layer of cellulose tear-resistant gauze. 
Delbag
Luftfilter (Berlin, Germany) discontinued production of Microsorban in 1981.  EML's stock of
these filters was depleted in 1988.<p>


In 1986, studies were conducted to obtain a replacement filter paper for Microsorban. 
 <a href="sp18.html">Microdon</a> LM2020 (Carl Freudenberg,Vertrieb Industrielle
Vliesstoffe, Germany; U.S. distributor Pellon Company, Chemsford, MA) was chosen as a
suitable replacement.  These filters are manufactured from polycarbonate microfiber placed
between two supporting layers of nonwoven polypropylene fibers for ease of handling. 
Intercomparison experiments conducted at EML between Microsorban and Microdon filter
materials show no significant difference (P &gt;5%) in their collection capability for Be-7 and
Pb-210. 
In 1985, Carl Freudenberg discontinued the production of Microdon and destroyed all of their
stock.  EML's stock of Microdon filters lasted until 1991 and was replaced by Dynaweb Grade
DW7301L.<p>



Several different filter media were tested and evaluated to find a suitable replacement for
Microdon LM2020.  The polypropylene fiber filter, <a href="sp19.html">Dynaweb</a> Grade
DW7301L, was selected as a
suitable replacement.  The filter is composed of a 100% polypropylene web that is 100%
binderless.  Three layers of this web are collated and sandwiched between two sheets of a
protective DuPont Reeme (100% polyester) scrim.  The top scrim is removed prior to sampling at
RAMP sites because after their return to EML for analysis these samples are compressed into
pellets and the scrim hinders compression.  At all other sites, the filter can be used during
sampling with both top and bottom scrim in place.<p>



Gelman A/E <a href="sp20.html">glass fiber filters</a> were also occasionally used at selected
SASP
sites starting in 1988.  In general, glass fiber filters will be used at sampling sites where filter
compression after collection is not anticipated.  Glass fiber filters have excellent particle collection
efficiency, high mass loading capacity, low cost, availability, and good mechanical strength. 
These filters are non-compressible and have a high ash content.  They may occasionally have a
slightly higher background count for radionuclides such as Pb-210.  Glass fiber filters are
insoluble
in organic solvents and generally are difficult to analyze radiochemically.<p>



Two filter sizes are presently used in SASP/RAMP, a 20.32 cm circle and a 
20.32 cm x 25.40 cm rectangle.  Filter cartridge systems were developed to support
both filter shapes.  Most of the sites have or will modify their sampling equipment to accept these
filter cartridges.<p>


<p>
     <h2><b>3. AIR MOVERS</b></h2><p>


A large variety of air movers are commercially available and have been reviewed by Rubow and
Furtado (1989).<p>


Many factors must be considered when selecting an air mover.  Such factors as portability, power
requirements, maximum operational flow rate/temperature/pressure, cost, durability, and
maintenance must be considered in the selection of an air mover.  It is also important that the air
mover itself is not a source of contamination in any study.<p>


The major factors that were considered in the selection of an air mover for the SASP sites were
durability, low maintenance, and a flow rate of &#126; 1 m&#179;/min [288&#176;K, 101.3 kPa
(760 mm Hg)] at
pressure drops across the filter ranging from &#126; 5 kPa to &#126; 20 kPa (20-80 in
water).<p>



Two air mover systems are currently used in SASP/RAMP.  The SASP sites are equipped with a
<a href="sp21.html">Roots Blower</a> connected to a 1 HP electric motor by a fan belt.  The
RAMP sites are equipped with a <a href="sp22.html">Fuji ring compressor</a> in which the air
mover is directly connected to a 0.5 HP electric motor.  The Roots system must be enclosed in a
louvered shelter to protect the pump from direct exposure to precipitation.  The Roots system is
frequently mounted on a 1-m high metal stand.  The Fuji system is enclosed in a custom
manufactured aluminum container.  The Roots system is heavier than the Fuji system and may be
more durable for continual operation in harsh environments.  The Roots system exhausts some oil
vapors which may be a contaminant in certain studies.  The Roots system is designed for 20.32
cm round filters, while the Fuji system is designed for 20.32 cm x 25.40 cm rectangular filters.<p>

<p>
     <h2><b>4. FLOW CALIBRATION AND SAMPLE VOLUME DETERMINATION
</b></h2><p>


To calculate the concentrations of radionuclides in the lower troposphere or concentrations of any
air pollutant collected and concentrated by filtration, it is necessary to accurately determine the
total volume of air sampled.<p>


Generally, a parameter of the air mover can be related to flow.  If the mean flow during a
collection period can be determined, the total volume of air sampled can be calculated.  Accurate
flow measurements and the total integrated sample volume of air can be obtained using a mass
flow meter and a totalizer.  This direct technique of air flow measurement becomes impractical at
remote field locations due to cost and exposure of the flow meter to harsh environments.  Other
procedures for the measurement of air flow in sampling systems are reviewed by Lippmann
(1989b).<p>


We have determined that the best technique to measure flow, at sites equipped with Roots
 systems, is to determine an empirical relationship between the Roots blower inlet
pressure and the flow through the upstream filter.  An orifice meter was manufactured at EML to
derive this relationship.  The orifice meter has been calibrated for flow using secondary flow
measurement devices that are traceable to a primary standard volume meter.  All Roots systems
are calibrated using this orifice meter prior to field installation.  Periodic calibrations are
conducted at the field sites.<p>


During sampling, the pressure at the Roots blower inlet is measured using a Magnehelic gauge. 
The initial and final pressure values are averaged.  The average inlet pressure is then used in the
previously described empirical relationship to calculate the average flow.  This average flow is
multiplied by the collection interval to obtain the total volume sampled.  The total volume
sampled is adjusted to a pressure of 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg) and a temperature of
288&#176;K.<p>


At sites equipped with a Fuji system, the flow is determined using an empirical relationship
between the pressure differential across a fixed orifice located in the blower exhaust.  The initial
and final pressure values are used to calculate a mean flow and a total sample volume as
previously described.  The relationship between flow and the pressure differential across the fixed
orifice plate and in the Fuji flow system was determined using a Hastings Laminar flow element
traceable to a primary standard volume meter.<p>

Each voltmeter should read about 14 V.<p>


The MCA ammeter should read about 0.7 A with the display OFF and about 1.0 A with the

The laptop ammeter should read about 0.3 A with the display OFF and about 0.5 A when the
display is ON.<p>


The transmitter/converter ammeter should read about 0.3 A.  Every 3 min when the

<h1><center><b>SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>

<p>

Once the system has been set up and is running, it should continue to do so indefinitely. 
There are a number of error traps built into the computer software program.  If an error
occurs and is trapped by the program, a message will be displayed indicating what action the
operator should take.<p>


Power for the transmitter/converter is protected with a 5 A internal fuse.  If the LED on the
serial/parallel two-way converter is not illuminated, and the transmitter/ converter meters
indicate no voltage, this fuse may need to be replaced.  In order to replace this fuse, the cover
for the RAMP system power supply must be removed.  The fuse holder is at the back of the
left side of the unit.  Spare fuses have been supplied with the backup equipment.<p>


If none of the power supply LEDs are lit, the ammeters read 0 and the voltmeters read
between 12 and 13 V, then the AC fuse at the back of the unit must be replaced to restore the
AC (main) power.  The batteries inside the power supply will continue to provide power for
the RAMS for about 8 h.<p>


If the computer does not respond, press 'CTRL,' 'ALT,' and 'DEL' at the same time.  This
will reset the computer and restart the program.  Press the 'A' key, then either the 'C,' 'B' or
'S' key, as appropriate.<p>


If the computer has entered the DOS operating mode as indicated by the DOS prompt A&gt;,
type 1RAMP and press ENTER to restart the program.  Press the 'A' key, then either the 'C,'
'B' or 'S' key, as appropriate.<p>


If the MCA has been turned off or has lost power for a long time, it will be necessary to reset
the high voltage and to recycle the baud rate and parity so that communications with the
computer can be established.  Proceed as follows:<p>

<ul>
     Press SETUP on the MCA.<p>

     Press the UP ARROW.<p>

     Press 'YES' eight times or until 'BAUD RATE=9600' appears again.<p>

     Press the UP ARROW.<p>

     Press 'YES' six times or until 'PARITY=8+NONE' appears again.<p>

     Press END.<p>

     Use 'CTRL,' 'ALT,' and 'DEL.'  (This will reset the computer and restart the
program.)<p>

</ul>

When the RAMP control program starts, there will be four possible operations.<p>

<ul>

     I    - for initial setup,<p>

     C    - for system clock reset,<p>

     G    - for MCA gain check, or<p>

     A    - for data acquisition.<p>

</ul>

Press the 'I' key on the computer.  Accept the default values displayed by pressing ENTER. 
Press the 'Y' key to accept these values.  The high voltage will automatically be set to the
correct value by the initial setup routine.<p>



Computer software problems can develop if:  1) the MCA amplifier gain is beyond the range
that the computer can correct; 2) the MCA gain setting when the unit was packaged for
shipment was preset to an invalid value; and 3) the internal temperature of the environmental
chamber was not set at 88oF.  The MCA gain can be checked and adjusted as follows.<p>



Press the 'G' key on the computer keyboard.  "THE CURRENT GAIN VALUE IS" message
will be displayed.  After a few seconds, the current gain value will also be displayed.  If the
gain is very different from the preset value, enter the preset value and press the ENTER key
on the computer.  Press ENTER on the computer to leave the current gain value unchanged.<p>


The MCA gain can also be reset automatically by the software.  The procedure is as follows:<p>

<ul>
     From the initial menu, press 'I' for initialization.<p>

     Enter the correct local date and time.<p>

     When prompted for a GAIN value, enter the word RESET.<p>

     Follow the instructions on the computer screen.<p>

</ul>

If the data that is being transmitted is not received by EML in New York City, EML will
inform site operators by TELEX or FAX and ask operators to TELEX or FAX the status of
the RAMS.  After EML has determined the correct resolution of the problem, instructions will
be communicated to site operators.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>



<h2><center><b>1.  CONTROL PROGRAM MENUS</b></h2></center>
<p>



When the RAMP control program starts, there are four possible operations.<p>
<ul>


     I    - for initial setup,<p>

     C    - for system clock reset,<p>

     G    - for MCA gain check, or<p>

     A    - for data acquisition.<p>
</ul>

<h1><center><b>ATMOSPHERIC TRACING</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

This section describes the apparatus and procedures used by EML to sample tracer gases used
in studies of long range atmospheric transport.  The analysis of the collected samples is
described separately in <a href="ac01.htm">Gas Chromatographic Determination of
Perflurocarbon Tracers</a>. 
Atmospheric tracing is done primarily to test meteorological models that predict the
atmospheric transport and dispersion of pollutants over distances as far as 3000 km from the
source(s).  Among other things, these models are used in assessing the potential for "acid
precipitation" in different regions and under different meteorological conditions.<p>


The tracer gases used in EML atmospheric tracing experiments are:<p>
<pre>

                                          Global Background
     <u>Tracer Gas</u>                  <u>Acronym</u>    <u>   (fL/L)     
</u><p>
perfluoromethylcyclohexane         PMCH          3.3<br>
total perfluorodimethylcyclohexane PDCH         28.8<br>
perfluoromethylcyclopentane        PMCP          3.2<br>
ortho(cis)perfluoro-
  dimethylcyclohexane              OC-PDCH       0.15<br>
perfluorotrimethylcyclohexane      PTCH         &lt;0.5<br>
<p></pre>

The first two tracer gases were identified by Lovelock (1982) and the others by Dietz 
(1987).  These gases are nontoxic and chemically stable.  They were selected because

they have no natural or anthropogenic source apart from their release during tracing 
experiments, and because they are detectable at their background levels (shown above)
using the procedures described here and in <a href="ac01.htm">Gas Chromatographic
Determination of
Perflurocarbon Tracers</a>.<p>

<p>


<h2><center><b>2.  THE PROGRAMMABLE ATMOSPHERIC TRACER
SAMPLER</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The programmable atmospheric tracer sampler (PATS) (Model RD113, Gilian Instrument
Company, Dawes Highway, Wayne, NJ  07470) is used as the primary sampler for all
perfluorocarbon tracers.  The unit, shown in <a href="2_5.gif">Figure 1</a>, The
programmable atmospheric tracer
sampler, is housed in a waterproof 36 cm x 25 cm x 20 cm container and weighs ~ 7 kg.  It
consists of two sections: the lid (air flow module, AFM) and the base (power control module,
PCM).<p>



The lid holds 23 sampling tubes, each containing 150 mg of Ambersorb adsorbent (Rohm and
Haas).  The Ambersorb absorbs the tracer from the sample air flowing through the tube.  The
air flow may be directed through a preselected tube by means of a multiple port switching
valve (Scanivalve, 10222 San Diego Mission Road, San Diego, CA  92120) which is
controlled by the PCM.<p>


The base of the PATS contains a constant flow pump which draws air through the selected
sampling tube.  The constant flow pump is based on the EML tethered air pump system
(Latner, 1986), and may be set to draw 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 cm&#179;/min.  The base also
contains programmable timer controls that allow for single or multiple start and stop times
over a 7-day period.  These controls are also used for automatic analysis when the unit is
coupled to a gas chromatograph.<p>


Two liquid crystal displays in the base indicate the time of day, the day of the week, and the
tube number, and a digital printer records this information at each tube change.  As a
precaution against printer failure, this information is also stored in an integrated memory
circuit module (Polito, 1987) mounted on each lid.  The memory module is used during the
gas chromatographic analysis phase, and this information is stored in a computer for inclusion
into a data base.<p>


Power is supplied by an internal rechargeable battery which can operate the unit up to 30 days. 
Longer periods of operation are possible if 110 V A.C. power is available. All lids are
interchangeable and usable with any base, so that after 23 samples have been collected, a new
lid may be substituted to continue sampling.<p>


<h2><center><b>3.  ADSORBENT TUBE BAKE-OUT PROCEDURE</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

     <b>A.  Introduction.</b><p>


Programmable atmospheric tracer sampler (PATS) adsorbent tubes are decontaminated (baked
out) by resistance heating of each tube at &gt; 400oC.  This method is applicable to all PATS
lids.  Up to 10 lids may be baked out at one time (<a href="2_6.gif">Figure 2</a>,
Configuration of the PATS lid
absorbent tube bake-out system).<p>


     <b>B.  Special apparatus.</b><p>


1.   Constant current power supply, Power Mate Corporation Model BPA 2086-V or
equivalent with special interface.<p>


2.   Micromaster programmable controller, Model No WP6201-AA-AA or equivalent.<p>


3.   Matheson Model 3800 gas pressure regulator or equivalent (two regulators required).<p>


4.   PATS bases and lids (up to 10).<p>


5.   Primeline (Soltec) two channel strip chart recorder or equivalent.<p>

2.   Nitrogen, Matheson Purity (99.995%) or equivalent.<p>


     <b>D.  Procedure.</b><p>


1.   Attach each lid to each base whose batteries have been fully charged.  Disconnect all
battery chargers.<p>


2.   Insert a jumper in the receptacle labelled <b>Analysis</b> <b>Connector</b> of each
base to disable
the sampling pump.<p>


3.   Attach the UHP nitrogen line to the <b>To Equalization</b> port of each lid.  Set the
equalization nitrogen gas pressure to 207 kPa (30 psig).<p>


4.   Plug each lid AFM electrical connector into each base receptacle labelled <b>AFM
Connector. </b><p>


5.   Set the clock time and day of the week of each PATS base and power up each unit. 
The clock time is set at the thumbwheel switch marked <b>Set/Time Alarm</b> and the day of
the week by placing the appropriate <b>Day Select</b> switch to <b>On.</b><p>


6.   Manually cycle through each of the 23 tubes using the base manual <b>Valve Step</b>
switch. 
Cycle each lid at least twice to assure seating of the Scanivalve.  Leave the tube
number of each unit at &quot;00&quot; and turn off the power to each unit.<p>



7.   Attach the Matheson Purity Nitrogen gas line to the <b>To PCM</b> connector of each
lid.<p>


8.   Set the UHP nitrogen pressure to 138 kPa (20 psig) and turn the nitrogen gas on. 
Adjust the flow to ~ 30 cm&#179;/min.<p>


9.   For each base, set the thumbwheel switch marked <b>Duration</b> to 0016 and the
<b>Sample</b>
<b>Quantity</b> switch to &quot;24&quot;.  This sets the switching time between tubes and the
number
of tubes to be sequentially decontaminated.  There are only 23 tubes in each lid,
however, the base must switch to the 24th tube in order to complete the bake-out cycle.<p>


10.  Plug all the electrical jacks into the <b>Desorption Power</b> lid connector.<p>


11.  Turn the constant current power supply on and set the current to 16.0 A.<p>


12.  Turn on the dual channel strip chart recorder to record the desorption voltage and
current.<p>


13.  Quickly turn each unit on, push the PATS base <b>Operate</b> switch to <b>Off</b>,
bring the
<b>Alarm</b> toggle switch from <b>Manual</b> to <b>Multi</b> and then back to
<b>Manual.</b>  Bring the
<b>Operate</b> toggle switch to <b>Run</b>.  This procedure should be completed within 1
min for
all 10 bases so that all units will start at the same time.<p>


14.  At the next minute, tube number 1 of each unit will switch into position, the current
will be turned on and the tube will be heated to &gt; 400&#176;C for a 15-min period. The
contaminants will be desorbed into the nitrogen carrier gas stream.  At the end of the
15-min heating period the current will turn off.  At 16 min, the next tube will advance
into position and the heating cycle will be repeated until all 23 tubes have been
decontaminated.<p>



15.  Disconnect all wires and gas lines.  Insert a 1/2 hole septum over all lid inlet and outlet
ports and disconnect the lid plug from the base. <p>

<h1><center><b>POT COLLECTOR</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<center><p>

<h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The determination of Sr-90 and other radioisotopes contained in fallout can be carried out on the
total material collected in a high-walled pot.  The collection of fallout is simple, but the transfer
of all the material in the pot must be done with great care in order to collect all of the radioactive
material and to avoid a buildup of contamination in the pot, which may influence a subsequent
sample.<p>


<h2><center><b>2.  APPARATUS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

EML's collectors are stainless-steel pots, 0.076 m&#178; in area, but many other high-walled
vessels
are equally suitable.  The requirements include smooth surfaces that do not absorb the
radionuclides and rounded corners for easy cleaning and durability.  The pot collector is shown
in <a href="2_7.gif">Figure 1</a>.<p>


<p>

<h2><b><center>3.  DEPLOYMENT, SAMPLING, AND RETRIEVAL</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

For our program, the pot collector is placed in an open area away from buildings or overhanging
trees and shrubbery.  An acceptable location is atop a one or two story building with a flat roof
not shaded by other buildings or trees.  The pot is placed outside on the first of the month and left
there for one month.  (During months of heavy rainfall, it may be necessary to remove and
evaporate some of the water prior to the end of the month.)<p>


At the end of the month, the water in the pot is evaporated to ~ 200 mL and transferred to a 1-L
polyethylene bottle.  Distilled water is added to the pot and, using a rubber spatula, the sides and
bottom of the pot are scrubbed.  The slurry is transferred to the bottle and the washing is repeated
with 1:1 HNO3, again scrubbing and transferring the slurry.  Then the pot is washed a final time
with distilled water and scrubbed.  It is extremely important to transfer all the solid material in
the pot to the bottle.  If necessary more than one polyethylene bottle may be used for each
month's collection.  The bottle(s) should be carefully labeled with the site location, sample dates,
and the
monthly precipitation amount from the nearest recording station.<p>

<h1><center><b>ION EXCHANGE FALLOUT COLLECTOR</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Like the pot collector, the <a href="sp14.htm">ion exchange collector</a> is designed for
measuring
fallout at sites
removed from the source.  At sites where personnel and facilities are at a minimum, the ion
exchange collector is used.  The collectors are exposed for monthly intervals and the collected
fallout may then be shipped to a laboratory for analysis.  The collector can be operated without
a laboratory facility and consists of a funnel, an <a href="sp05.htm">ion-exchange column</a>,
and a
leveling device
(all constructed of polyethylene) mounted in a wooden housing.  The ion-exchange column is
packed with paper pulp, <a href="sp04.htm">ion-exchange resin</a> and a glass wool plug, and
is
saturated with
water.  A utility light fixture with a 100-W bulb and a 30-m heavy duty extension cord is
provided to heat the device in cold climates.  The ion exchange fallout collector is shown in
<a href="2_7.gif">Figure 1</a>.  A descriptive diagram of
the collector is shown in
<a href="2_8.gif">Figure 2</a>.<p>

<p>


<center><h2><b>2.  MATERIALS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>
<OL>
<li>One plywood housing<p>

<li>One 30-cm polyethylene funnel<p>

<li>Two loaded resin columns, with caps<p>

<li>Two tapered caps<p>

<li>One leveling tube<p>

<li>One threaded T-connection<p>

<li>One piece of plastic tubing<p>

<li>One wash bottle<p>

<li>One set spare caps for mailing<p>

<li>One 100-W heating unit, where necessary<p>
</OL>
<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  PREPARATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The polyethylene ion-exchange column contains glass wool, paper pulp, and cation exchange
resin.  The glass wool is the standard laboratory material.  The paper pulp is prepared from
Whatman No. 41 filter paper or S&amp;S No. 289 paper pulp by mixing in a blender with distilled
water.<p>


Dowex 50W-X12 cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., 1000-T Alfred Nobel
Dr., Hercules, CA  94547) 50-100 mesh in hydrogen form is used.  The resin is washed with
deionized water.<p>


Glass wool is added to the bottom of each column and cation exchange resin and paper pulp
are added in that order.  Approximately 17 cm of glass wool, 50 mL of wet settled resin and 4
cm of paper pulp are packed into a column filled with distilled water.  Care is taken to prevent
the formation of air pockets.<p>

<p>


<center><h2><b>4.  COLLECTOR LOCATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The collector should be located with the same criteria used for selecting a rain gauge site. 
These criteria are generally that the collector should be able to receive precipitation in an open
area free of buildings, trees, and other obstructions that might shelter the collector.  In many
locations a flat roof is available - this is a suitable location, when the collector cannot be
placed in an open area at ground level.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>5.  SITE OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

 1.  Remove the ion-exchange column from its mailing tube and retain the tube for return of
sample.<p>


 2.  With the ion-exchange column inverted (small end up), remove the small cap and
replace with the open tapered cap.<p>


 3.  Force the short end of the J-shaped tube over the tapered cap and tape the other end to
the column so that the small flexible hose is approximately level with the top of the
tube.<p>


 4.  Turn the column upright (large end up) and remove the large cap.  Screw the column to
the polyethylene funnel and place in the wooden housing.  (Retain both caps for return
of sample.)<p>


 5.  Lead the long flexible tube, which serves as an overflow, through the hole in the side
of the housing.<p>


 6.  If subfreezing weather is anticipated during the month, hang the heating element from
the eyelet in the housing and switch on during periods when snow or ice may
accumulate in the collector.<p>


 7.  The collector is left exposed continuously for 1 month, beginning on the first day of the
month.<p>


 8.  It is important that the resin column be kept saturated with water.  If a dry period
extends for several days, examine the column and add water if necessary.  A plastic
wash bottle is provided for this purpose.  In most areas, tap water is satisfactory.
However, in a few localities where rain water is collected directly for household use,
distilled water should be used.<p>


 9.  At the end of the observation period, use the wash bottle to rinse down any dust that
has accumulated in the funnel and into the column, and wipe the inside of the funnel
thoroughly with a wet tissue, which is then added to the column.<p>


10.  Remove the ion-exchange column from the assembly and replace the caps.  (The new
column can be installed at this time.)<p>


11.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  The column label should contain the station name, the month of
exposure, and
the total amount of precipitation recorded by the station during the month.<p>


12.  Pack the column in the original mailing tube and return to the analytical laboratory.<p>

<h1><center><b>WET/DRY DEPOSITION COLLECTOR</b></h1><p>
<hr>
</center>
<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

We examine the wet phase and dry phase of deposition to further understand atmospheric
pollution deposition processes, and the physical and chemical characteristics of these
pollutants.  Our measurements of fallout from weapons tests were largely directed towards
stratospheric fallout, which is primarily deposited by way of precipitation scavenging.  Dry
deposition processes are also important and, therefore, it is desirable to measure wet and dry
deposition separately.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  APPARATUS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

EML's wet/dry deposition collector is a two-bucket system with a movable peaked cover
designed to expose the wet and cover the dry <a href="sp28.html">bucket</a> at the onset of
precipitation, and vice
versa (Volchok and Graveson, 1976).  There is a conductivity sensor on each side of the roof. 
The sensor base plate electrode is separated from the parallel bar electrode above by a thin
(about 0.8 mm) air space.  Any electrical flow between the electrodes activates the motor in
the base of the unit and the counter-weighted lid moves to cover the dry bucket.  When the
circuit is broken, the cover returns.  Heaters are mounted below the sensors and are activated
when the temperature drops below 4&#176; C to melt snow or ice accumulations on the sensor,
or
when the instrument is in the wet collection mode to evaporate moisture from the sensor. 
Thus, when properly adjusted, the wet collector will be exposed only during periods of
continuous precipitation.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  SAMPLING AND DEPLOYMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

In the past, we have used stainless-steel pots to collect radioactive debris from weapons tests,
and heavy polyethylene buckets to collect trace metals.  Since many of EML's sites are remote
from the Laboratory, we have adopted a commercial container which has a positive closure to
prevent leakage during shipment.  The opening in the plastic bucket is about 30 cm in
diameter.  The sampling containers for these wet/dry collectors are <a
href="sp29.html">polyethylene buckets</a> particularly well-suited for shipping because of the
design of the lip and cover.  On
the underside rim of the cover there is a groove with an O-ring seal.  When the cover is
securely hammered onto the bucket with a rubber mallet, no leakage will occur.  The cover is
destroyed when it is removed from the bucket at the Laboratory.  The sample buckets are
shipped in fiber mailing boxes.<p>


In 1978, EML started to use Aerochem Metrics Model 201 wet/dry collectors (Bushnell, FL)
at some of our sampling sites.  This collector is similar in concept and design to EML's
collectors.  Both the EML and the Aerochem Metrics collectors are shown in <a
href="2_9.gif">Figure 1</a>, 
Aerochem metrics wet/dry collector and EML wet/dry collector.  The major
mechanical difference is the Aerochem Metrics clutch system and switching system.  EML's
collector uses a shear pin to prevent damage to the motor when the lid is frozen in place.  The
Aerochem unit has a clutch on the motor drive of the covering lid.  This clutch eliminates the
problems caused by frequent shear pin breakage common to the EML units at windy or cold
sites.  The switches on the motor box of the Aerochem Metric unit are mercury-wetted
switches, whereas microswitches are used in our units.<p>

<h1><center><b>SAMPLING OBJECTIVES</b></h1><p>

</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The sampling of soil is a useful approach to determine the accumulated amounts of airborne
long-lived radioactive and stable contaminants that deposit on the ground.  Soil sampling is,
however, of questionable value in attempting to estimate small increments of deposition over a
period of a few years or less.  It is not recommended as a routine method of environmental
monitoring except in preoperational surveys.<p>


Historically, soil sampling procedures for radionuclides were modifications of techniques used
in agriculture and engineering.  Often, not enough emphasis is placed on the importance of a
proper sampling method to accurately represent the total pollutant being sampled.  The
objectives of the project should be well-defined and the degree of precision required should be
established before sampling.  The purpose of the project (deposit, resuspension, root uptake)
should dictate the type of sampling (total inventory, surface sampling, depth profile) used. 
Site characteristics, such as soil type, topography, source, and current distribution of the
contaminant must be taken into account when designing the study.  Other factors to be
considered in the design stage are the uniformity of the contamination, the required accuracy
necessary to provide reasonable results, and the minimization of cross-contamination.<p>

<p>

<center><p>

<h2><b><a NAME="S01SEC2">2.  DEPOSITION INVENTORIES</a></b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The most direct use of soil measurements is for estimating the inventory of the material
deposited over a given area.  EML has used soil analyses in estimating the deposition of Sr-90
(Hardy et al., 1968) and plutonium (Hardy et al., 1973; Krey et al., 1976a) on a worldwide
basis, and in estimating the deposition of Sr-90 (Hardy et al., 1972), Cs-137 (Beck and Krey,
1980) and plutonium (Hardy, 1976) northeast of the Nevada Test Site.  Such inventories
require the selection of a sufficient number of representative sites, with the density of the sites
depending on the accuracy sought.  A statistical sampling scheme is generally not employed in
sampling global fallout because the aerial distribution and particle size are nearly uniform over
large areas (i.e., latitude bands).  Low-level baseline sampling would require the careful
selection of sites that serve to integrate fallout over time.<p>


The most useful measures of the concentration of deposited material in soil relate
to the amount per unit area.  Sampling is therefore carried out in such a way that the weight of
the material collected can be directly related to the area sampled and the depth of the sampling. 
The analytical results from a weighed aliquot of the soil sample can then be readily related to
area concentration.<p>


An additional requirement is that the sample is taken to a sufficient depth so that all of the
deposited material is sampled.  Without previous knowledge of the depth of penetration, an
excessive sampling depth must be selected.   This results in dilution of the radionuclide or
other contaminant of interest.  If time and cost considerations allow, it is recommended that a
depth profile be taken (see <a href="s03.html">Trench Method</a>).  An optimum depth for
sampling, which should
contain 90-95% of the total material of interest, can then be selected.  In our worldwide Sr-90
network we have increased our depth of sampling over the years from a few centimeters to 30
cm.  Even so, at some sites typified by calcareous soils, the Sr-90 has moved deeper than 30
cm.  Sampling parameters should be reevaluated and decisions made on a site basis.<p>


     <b>Criteria for site selection.</b>  When the accumulated deposition over a given time
period
is to be estimated by soil sampling, it is necessary that the area selected for sampling has been
undisturbed for at least the time interval that is of interest.  As the time interval increases, it
becomes increasingly more difficult to obtain an accurate history of the site. In studies of
cumulative fallout deposition, areas undisturbed since the early 1950s are sought.  Institutional
property will have certain advantages over private property in these cases.<p>


The second criterion, that of representativeness of the sample site, depends on the
surroundings and the meteorological or climatological factors of the area.  This generally
requires that the site selected should be at the center of a large, flat open area.  Accumulative
areas at the foot of slopes, in low spots or in flooded areas are not suitable.  The site should
not be near enough to buildings or trees to be sheltered during blowing rains.  The sampling
location should be 100 m or more from dusty roads.  A large area of collection is desirable to
make the sample more representative.  A surface area of 500-1000 cm&#178; is adequate when a
composite of 10 cores is taken over a reasonable distance (~ 30 cm apart).<p>


The third criterion, that the deposited material remain in place, generally requires that the area
be vegetated and have moderate to good permeability.  There should be little or no runoff
during heavy rains and no overwash at any time.  The soil should have a base exchange
capacity adequate to keep the contaminant from being readily leached into the ground water. 
A good grass turf aids in absorption of water and reduces the likelihood of runoff.  Such sites
are frequently found on smooth ridge crests, level virgin land, and in well-kept lawns and
grounds around institutional buildings.<p>


At EML, we recommend short-cropped grass sods as the most suitable sampling areas.  Higher
stands of vegetation may bias the collections by acting as a filter to remove airborne material
in excess of what would normally be deposited. In wooded areas, the nonuniform distribution
of tree canopies will lead to unevenness in deposition of fallout materials.  Soils having high
earthworm activity should be avoided because of uneven mixing of the soil to considerable
depths.  Rodent activity also makes an area unsuitable for sampling (Alexander et al., 1960).<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  DEPOSITION INCREMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Incremental estimation of a contaminant through soil sampling and analysis should be
undertaken only after careful planning.  Because of the large uncertainties in sampling and the
inherent variability in soil, estimating short-time increments of deposition history or deposition
changes of small degrees is not recommended.  When monitoring global fallout, short-term
changes in radiation concentrations are generally small compared to the variability in the local
radionuclide distribution.  Direct collections of deposition or of airborne material are much
more specific and yield more information with respect to the time when contamination
occurred.<p>

<p>
<p>

<center><h2><b>4.  OPERATIONAL OR ACCIDENTAL RELEASES</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Following an acute release of a contaminant or an accident at a specific facility, surface soil
sampling soon after the event can be used to define the contamination contours or distribution
pattern.  This would require sampling only the top 5 cm of soil, including the vegetation.  Our
experience indicates that attempts to sample a shallower depth results in less reproducible
samples.  In many areas, a site meeting the criteria for an optimal sample has a root mat
extending several centimeters into the ground, and it is rarely possible to remove a 
core &lt; 5 cm in depth intact.<p>


In the case of accidental or operational releases, consideration must be given to liquid effluent
as well as airborne particulate deposition.  The amount deposited may vary with direction and
distance from the release point.  Airborne particle dispersal is affected by particle size and
meteorological patterns.  Gaussian plume models which take into account meteorology, stack
height, topography, and deposition velocity of the particles are used to map local dispersion
patterns.  The horizontal dispersion of liquid effluent releases is influenced by the composition
and quantity of the liquid, the topography, the soil type, and the properties of the contaminant
of interest.<p>


Sampling techniques used in evaluating acute releases are more site dependent and methods
used for fallout deposition may not be appropriate.  Differences in the methods are dictated by
the nature of the distribution of the contaminant in the soil, the range of particle sizes, and the
generally higher levels of releases.  Soil sampling in locally contaminated areas, such as Rocky
Flats, can be inventoried by EML methods where the contaminant was initially made airborne
in micron size particles from the source (Hardy and Krey, 1971).<p>


     <b>Criteria for site selection.</b>  Wind roses and atmospheric dispersion calculations
provide useful guidance in selecting appropriate soil sampling locations.  <a
href="2_10.gif">Figure 1</a>, shows a
suggested distribution of sampling sites covering the area surrounding a plant, with emphasis
on the downwind direction.  This approach to soil sampling was used by EML at Rocky Flats
(Krey, 1976; Krey et al., 1976b).  Samples are commonly collected from a regular grid or a
radial pattern, at least close to the facility.  When using such a systematic sampling design,
care should be taken to ensure that the repetitive spacing of the sampling points does not
introduce an error in the results.  Consideration should also be given to the likelihood that a
grid point can not be used for sampling.   Some alternative random location or selection
procedure should be established during the planning stages.  Soil sampling within a 16 km
radius should give an adequate preliminary picture of levels around the plant.  It is also
suggested that one or more samples be taken close to the center of the most heavily populated
area in the vicinity of the plant.  When sampling at facilities that release activity via tall stacks,
sample locations at considerable distance from the potential release point may be indicated.<p>



The same site selection techniques can be used for a preoperational survey around a plant. 
When choosing sampling locations at this early stage, it is desirable to select areas that can be
resampled at a later time, should it become necessary.  Samples should not be taken from the
identical location since the sampling depletes the soil and alters the concentration of the
pollutant under investigation.  Rather, a sampling plot of several square meters should be
established and samples removed from different areas of the plot.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>5.  AGRICULTURAL AVAILABILITY</b></h2><p>

<p>

</center>
When evaluating soil for uptake availability of a contaminant of interest, it is not necessary to
measure the total deposit but only the amount in the root zone that would be available to the
plant or crop of interest.  In most cases this would be the depth of the plowed layer.  In
addition to root zone concentration, the extent to which the nuclide or contaminant is
chemically available for uptake must be considered.  The availability of the particular
contaminant to the plant is rarely 100%.  The processes influencing the mobility and
availability of radionuclides in soil are complex and have been discussed by several researchers
(Schulz, 1965; Russell et al., 1971; Eisenbud, 1987).  Routine procedures for soil sampling
will not be appropriate for this type of study because of the distribution of the nuclide.  Field
studies of environmental levels of radionuclides in agricultural soils have confirmed the
nonuniformity of the concentration distribution due to mixing of the soil during cultivation and
depletion by plant uptake and harvesting (Hardy and Bennett, 1977).<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2><b><center>6.  RESUSPENSION AVAILABILITY</h2><p>

</b></center>
<p>

There is no standard method to sample for availability of a contaminant in the soil for
resuspension.  The direct measurement of the airborne contaminant is the only sound approach
to the problem of evaluating exposure to resuspended material.  The practical problems of the
mechanics of sampling make it difficult to take a very shallow soil sample with reliability.  In
trying to sample 1 cm or less it is very difficult to take into account the variation in the ground
contour and to reproduce a particular sample.  EML has tested other techniques, such as
pressing gummed film to the surface, but these also have many mechanical difficulties (Krey et
al., 1977).  Another approach is to measure a depth profile at the site and plot the contamination
as a function of depth.  This has been found in practice to be an exponential, and
extrapolation of the curve to zero depth might give an index of suspendability.  This
approach is limited by the error introduced if the shape of the curve as it approaches the
surface deviates markedly from an exponential function.  Resuspension concepts and prediction
of the degree to which resuspension may occur have been reviewed (Healy, 1980; Sehmel,
1980).<p>

<h1><center><b>SAMPLE PROCESSING</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

The procedures to be followed to process a soil sample to obtain a representative subsample
for analysis depend to some extent on the nuclide of interest, the size of the sample, and the
amount of processing already undertaken in the field.  Any one of, or a combination of, the
following procedures may be employed.  The soil may be crushed to reduce the size of stones,
sieved to remove sample content above a desired size, blended to obtain a more homogenous
distribution of particle sizes, or milled to reduce the particle size of the soil.  If the sample was
sieved or split in the field or a small sample was taken, the preparation process may be
eliminated.  For some purposes, it is possible to remove large nonporous stones and not grind
them to size, but they must be weighed separately and an appropriate allowance made.  As a
general rule, at EML samples are air-dried, crushed to break up large rocks, blended to allow
a representative aliquot to be removed, and only this subsample is pulverized.  The pulverizing
reduces the soil to a standard particle size.  Other preparation protocols are addressed in
ASTM (1983).<p>


Global fallout is relatively homogeneous in particle size and distribution in the sample.  When
sampling accidental or operational releases, the procedures described here may not be
adequate.  Care must be taken that the subsample taken for analysis accurately represents the
total sample.  This will depend on the size and the degree of heterogeneity.  Multiple
subsampling and multiple analysis may be the only technique available to adequately define the
content of radionuclides in heterogeneous samples.<p>


Care must be taken in all stages of processing to avoid contamination from previously
prepared higher concentration samples.  In addition to careful cleaning of the equipment
between samples it is sometimes advisable to run blank samples (e.g., sand) between the
samples being processed.  Another technique to minimize cross-contamination is to order the
processing of samples starting with the lowest level samples first.  This is difficult to know in
an exact sense, but generally deeper depth samples will have a lower content than surface
samples.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  DRYING</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A recommended procedure is described as follows.<p>


1.   The &quot;excludable&quot; fraction of the sample should be defined, dependent on the
contaminant of interest.  Vegetation, root mat, large organic pieces, stones, etc., in
some cases can be discarded.  If this is the case, the sample can be screened using a 6
mm sieve or a 10 mesh screen.  The appropriate steps of drying process (e.g., Step 3
and/or 5) can then be skipped.<p>


2.   If facilities are available, the samples can be dried at 100&#176;C overnight.  Oven drying
has the advantage that most materials will become brittle enough to mill properly. 
Otherwise, spread out the sample on a plastic sheet or in trays and allow to air dry.
This will take 3 days to 2 weeks.  Turning the soil will facilitate the drying process
especially when the drying area does not allow the soil to be spread in a thin layer. 
However, turning is not advised when the rising dust might cause contamination of
other samples.<p>


3.   Break up soil aggregates and pull apart the top soil plugs consisting of vegetation and
root mat.  Using scissors or clippers, cut up the vegetation so that it is distributed
homogeneously throughout the sample.<p>


4.   When completely dry, weigh the entire sample.<p>


5.   Remove large rocks, weigh separately, and discard.<p>

<p>
<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  HOMOGENIZING</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

When using equipment in this stage of preparation close attention must be paid to
cross-contamination.  Machinery should be dismantled and decontaminated between samples.<p>


1.   If the sample contains small rocks or pebbles:<p>

<ul>
     a)   crush the entire soil sample, reducing the sample to 6.35 mm, or<p>


     b)   sieve the entire sample through a 12.7-mm screen.<p>
</ul>

2.   Then blend the entire sample for 15-30 min.<p>


3.   Spread out the sample, mark off quarters, and take scoop-fulls from each quarter in a
consecutive manner until about 3 kg has been collected.<p>


4.   Pass this subsample of soil through a grinder, ball mill, sieve or pulverizer.  The
pulverizer used at EML reduces the soil to &lt;1.3 mm (15 mesh equivalent).  Transfer
to a wide-mouth polyethylene bottle.<p>


5.   When ready for analysis, roll the bottle to mix the sample thoroughly.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  RAPID PREPARATION METHOD</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

An alternate soil sample preparation procedure is employed to allow rapid processing and
aliquoting when gamma-ray spectrometric analysis for short-lived radionuclides is desired. 
This procedure was developed to provide timely data from surface soil samples collected
following the Chernobyl reactor accident.  After weighing the sample in the wet state (as
received), the entire sample is sieved through a steel mesh screen with square openings, 1.27
cm on edge.  Rocks and pebbles of greater size are brushed and discarded.  Vegetation and
root mat are cut to a size (about 0.6 cm) that permits them to pass through the sieve.  The
mixture of wet soil and vegetation is homogenized by hand for several minutes before aliquots
of about 100 g are removed.  If desired, the remainder of the sample can then be dried and
processed as previously described.<p>


In experiments involving 75 sets of duplicate wet samples, 87% of the samples agreed with
each other to within two standard deviations of the propagated Poisson counting uncertainties. 
This indicates a reasonable degree of homogenization of the wet sample.  In addition, the ratio
of the deposition values for wet samples to dry pulverized samples was close to unity for most
radionuclides.  The homogenization of the wet samples is not as efficient in mixing the
infrequent particles enriched in refractory nuclides, resulting in a consistent bias toward higher
wet values (Krey et al., 1986).<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>4.  PROCESSING EQUIPMENT</b></h2><p>

<p>

The accuracy of the estimated deposit at any site is related to the representativeness
of the soil sampling and aliquoting, and to the quality of the analysis.  The sampling
design should prevent biases and allow errors to be readily determined.  A QA program
should be maintained at all stages of the project.  A detailed discussion of QA for soil
sampling is presented in Barth et al. (1989) and van Ee et al. (1990).<p>

<p>

<center><p>

<h2><b>1.  REPRESENTATIVENESS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

If the criteria for selecting a soil sampling site are satisfied, the EML sampling method has
been shown to provide reasonable estimates of local and regional fallout.  Integrated fallout of
Cs-137, Sr-90, and Pu-239,240 have been shown to be quite uniform within metropolitan areas
characterized by the same annual precipitation.  The deposition variability of these
radionuclides was &lt;15% (Hardy, 1975).  In extensive studies of Sr-90 deposition, 50 paired
sites, 2-40 km apart, showed an average difference expressed as a percent of the mean of
&lt;10% (Hardy and Krey, 1971).<p>


Where it can be assumed that there is little gradient in the cumulative fallout within a city,
duplicate soil collection and measurement has inferred a precision of sampling and analysis of
8% for Cs-137 (Beck and Krey, 1980), 9% for Pu-239,240, 3% for the Pu-240/Pu-239 atom
ratio,
and 4% for the Pu-241/Pu-239 atom ratio (Krey and Beck, 1981) for the determination of these
values at any given site.<p>



The statistical analyses of common sampling designs, such as random or systematic sampling,
are discussed in a familiar text such as Cochran (1977).<p>


In cases where the contaminant may not be uniform in size or concentration, the resulting "hot
spots" will be found in some but not all the samples.  Uneven physical distribution of particles
or particles with a large range of sizes and concentrations complicates the collection of a
representative sample and subsampling.  Gilbert (1987) discusses different approaches for
sampling nonuniformly distributed contamination.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  ALIQUOTING</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Analyses of Utah soils have shown that the prepared soils are sufficiently homogeneous, after
following the procedures described above (air-dry, crush, blend, and pulverize), that duplicate
aliquots agree within two standard deviations of the counting rate for Cs-137 (Beck and Krey,
1980) and the radioassay value for Pu-238, Pu-239,240, and Am-241 (Krey and Beck, 1981).  A
mean
deviation of 7% was found for 426 pairs of duplicate soil aliquots, representing the
subsampling and analytical errors for Sr-90 over an 8-y period (Hardy and Krey, 1971).<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  ANALYTICAL ACCURACY</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

     <b>A. Soil standards.</b><p>


Two standard reference materials are available through the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST, formerly the National Bureau of Standards), SRM 4353 Rocky Flats Soil
Number 1 and SRM 4355 Peruvian Soil.  SRM 4355 has nonmeasurable radioactivity
concentrations for many fallout radionuclides and is intended for use as a blank.  Upper limits
of the radioactive concentrations are given and can be used to monitor laboratory
contamination and background counting rates.<p>


Secondary soil standards, that is, large quantity soil samples that have been dried, blended and
pulverized and aliquots of which have been analyzed by inter- and intra-laboratory
comparisons, are used at EML as the best possible substitute for a primary standard soil
sample for artificial radioactivity. There is no satisfactory way to add a radionuclide to a soil
sample so that it represents the chemical and physical form as it exists in the field.<p>


     <b>B.  Blanks.</b><p>


Soils collected in 1943, and therefore containing no artificial radionuclides, have served as a
quality control blank sample throughout EML's soils programs to monitor contamination by
laboratory handling, reagents, and other possible sources.<p>

<h1><center><b>CORE METHOD</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

The procedure described here is designed to obtain samples that will measure the total amount
of an initially airborne contaminant that has fallen out in a given area.  The criteria for
selecting an optimal site have been discussed in  <a href="s01.html#S01SEC2">Section 2,
Deposition Inventories</a> in Sampling
Objectives.<p>


All analytical values must be related to the surface area sampled.  The surface area and depth
define the volume; the weight of the volume of dry soil defines the field bulk density.  These
data are necessary to convert to radioactivity concentration per unit surface area (i.e., Bq
/m&#178;).<p>


A recommended procedure is described as follows.<p>


 1.  Following the selection of an undisturbed site which meets the criteria previously
discussed, lay out a straight line transect about 4.5 m long.  If the site is to be
resampled at a later time, record distances to fixed landmarks to identify the relative
location of the transect or adopt a systematic scheme or grid.<p>


 2.  If the vegetation cover is not to be included with the soil sample, or is to be kept as a
separate sample, the vegetation is removed to the surface level.<p>


 3.  Using the 5 cm depth top soil cutter, press it into the ground without twisting or
disturbing the grass cover or surface soil.  This may best be accomplished by stepping
on the rim of the cutter with both shoe heels.  If more force is required, a rubber mallet
may be used.  Gently twist the handle of the cutter to cleanly remove the top soil plug. 
Place the core in a plastic sampling bag.<p>


 4.  Repeat the process until the desired number of cores have been sampled.  We
recommend 10 cores for providing a representative sample (Alexander et al., 1961). 
Samples of 20 and 10 core composites were collected in about 10 areas and no
significant differences were found in the estimated Sr-90 deposit.  Compositing soil
samples provides a larger sample volume and possibly a more representative sample of
the area.  Compositing is discussed further in Bernhardt (1976) and Gilbert (1987). 
Take 10 top soil cores in a straight line about 30 cm apart, placing the cores in a plastic
bag.  (The total area sampled is 620 cm&#178;.) <p>


 5.  Sometimes it may not be possible to remove a 5 cm depth plug cleanly because of a
thick root mat.  If the top soil and bottom soil are to be combined, a 10 cm or 15 cm
deep cutter may be used to remove the top soil by pounding it part way into the ground
with the rubber mallet, until it is possible to remove the core intact.<p>


 6.  Next, take the subsoil samples down to the desired depth with the auger.  A slight
downward pressure with slow turning will guide the auger.  When the cylinder is about
3/4 full, remove the auger slowly and either tap out or scrape out the soil with a large
flat blade knife.  Continue to use the auger until the desired depth has been sampled.  If
rocks or roots impede the auger, it may be possible to carefully remove them.  They
should be included with the sample.  If, however, this destroys the core, the sample
should not be used.  It is a useful practice to place the soil from the core as it is
removed into a plastic pail until the entire depth is removed.  Then, if the core is not
suitable, it may be poured back into the hole.  Only after the entire sample is
successfully removed is the soil added to the sampling bag.  Repeat the procedure for
the remaining cores.<p>


 7.  After collection, label the plastic bag containing the sample, fold, and seal with a heavy
duty stapler.  If a portable scale is available, the wet weight can be taken in the field. 
Then place the sample in a canvas bag and tie firmly.  The label should include the
date, location, and depth.<p>


 8.  The holes should be filled with top soil to prevent an accident.  A new grass cover will
develop in a few weeks.  If immediate restoration is necessary, plugs may be cut from
a piece of sod.<p>


Using the above procedure, a site can be sampled in two increments, 0-5 cm and 5-30 cm. 
This is useful in areas where most of the contamination is in the surface cut of the soil.  In
other sampling situations using cores of 10 and 15 cm depth will provide incremental samples:
0-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-30 cm.  When attempting this type of incremental sampling, attention
must be given to two sources of error: contamination by fall-in of soil from the upper layers of
more highly contaminated soil as the subsequent cores are taken from the hole and error in
depth due to compaction.<p>


     <h3><b>A.  Limitations.</b></h3><p>


Implicit when using the above sampling method is the need to take the sample deep enough so
that all the radionuclide deposited is collected.  The extent of vertical penetration will depend
primarily upon the soil type with other factors, such as amount of annual precipitation and
chemical form of the nuclide, playing a confounding role.  [See <a href="rm03.html">Field
Gamma-Ray Spectrometry</a> for a discussion of the use of <i>in situ</i> spectrometry
to aid in establishing the depth of penetration.]<p>


There is no simple satisfactory way of sampling powdery, dry, loose, single grain soils by this
core method.  It is best to take samples when the soil has enough moisture to be coherent even
if this requires wetting the area to be sampled by sprinkling.  An alternate method for
sampling loose soils is to leave the corer in place and scoop out the contents.  Only one
composite depth can be taken however, since once the corer is removed the integrity of the
core is lost.<p>


     <h3><b>B.  Sampling equipment for the core method.</b></h3><p>


Tools for sampling may be of any material and type that will take a core of equal area through
its entire length.  The following equipment are used at EML:<p>


 1.  Barrel auger - Standard Type No. R-HEO, 8.2 cm ID, with T-handle, Arts Machine
Shop, American Falls, ID.<p>


 2.  Top soil cutters - 5, 10, 15 cm depth, 8.9 cm ID.  Made from 0.155 cm thick cold-
rolled steel.  One end sharpened on a lathe, the other end fitted with a welded handle.<p>


 3.  Other equipment -<p>
<ul>
          Long, flat blade knife for removing cores from auger<p>

          Measuring tape (~ 8 m)<p>

<h1><center><b>TEMPLATE METHOD</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

Although the core method is preferred, there are areas where the rocks will make it impossible
to use this technique.  An alternate method we employ in these areas is to cut out a 900
cm&#178;
sample using a 31.6 cm square-template for guidance.  The soil and rocks are removed with
chisels and scoops down to the desired depth.  The rocks are included and weighed with the
sample. The large rocks can be discarded after removing loose dirt.  The remaining smaller
rocks are crushed as part of the sample.<p>


This method is comparable to the ring method used by the Nevada Applied Ecology Group
(NAEG) for sampling sandy and rocky soils.  Here a 12.7 cm ID ring with a lip to assure
constant depth of penetration is used.  The soil adjacent to the exterior of the ring is removed
to the depth of the ring.  The confined volume of soil is then transferred to a plastic bag using
an appropriate tool.  Depth profile may be drawn using this method by repeating the steps for
each subsequent depth to be sampled.  Removal of soil exterior to the ring is necessary to
minimize the possibility of cross-contamination of the deeper, less radioactive fractions
(Fowler et al., 1974).  A minimum of five separate samples (633 cm&#178;) are recommended
along
a transect and composited for analysis.<p>


     <b>A.  Sampling equipment for the template method.</b><p>



Tools for sampling may be of any material that will maintain a rigid shape and straight edge. 
The sampling equipment used at EML consists of:<p>


 1.  A square template 20 cm or 30 cm on the inner edge made of 0.157-cm thick cold-
rolled steel, with holes at the corners,<p>


 2.  Pins or long nails of corresponding diameter to the corner holes of the template to
anchor the template to the surface, and<p>


 3.  Chisels, knives, and small shovels.<p>

<h1><center><b>TRENCH METHOD</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

The trench method is used to determine the depth of penetration of a radionuclide or
contaminant or to establish a detailed depth profile.  The most suitable area for taking soil
profiles is one where there are no rocks and stones, and very few pebbles.  The procedure
works well in sandy loam, loam or loamy sand types of soil (Hardy, 1974; Fowler et al.,
1974).  Use of this method in unsuitable areas will result in cross-contamination of lower
profile cuts with higher specific activity subsoil from upper layers.  Cross contamination
effects of worms and burrowing insects, cracks from swelling, and other biological and
physical disturbances must be considered.<p>



A recommended procedure is described as follows.<p>


 1.  As far as grass cover and terrain are concerned, the site selection criteria previously
described apply.  As in the core sampling method, the depth profile samples are taken
so that the weight and depth of the material collected can be directly related to the area.<p>


 2.  If the vegetation represents a seasonal growth, it should be clipped to 2.5-5 cm over a
measured area.<p>


 3.  Lay a tarpaulin (about 0.6 m&#178;) on the ground near the clipped area.  Dig a trench of
an
appropriate size for ease of access (about 60 cm wide by 90 cm long by 60 cm deep,
about 15-25 cm deeper than the desired sampling depth) immediately adjacent to the
clipped area, placing the dirt on the tarpaulin.  Usually the sod can be cut out in blocks
making it easy to replace after sampling.<p>



 4.  The face of the trench (adjacent to the clipped area) is smoothed from side to side with
a flat blade shovel or mortar trowel, making it perpendicular to the surface.<p>


 5.  A metal flat-bottomed three-sided pan with sharpened edges on the open side (15 cm x
15 cm x 5 cm deep; 230 cm&#178;) is pressed into the face from ground surface to 5 cm. 
Remove the first cut and seal in a small plastic bag.<p>



 6.  Cut away the top soil on either side of the cut to make a shelf about 35 cm long by 15
cm wide and 5 cm deep from the surface.  Lightly brush away any particles that may
have fallen on the shelf.<p>


 7.  Again, push the open-end cutting pan into the side and cut out the next incremental
sample.  Continue this procedure until the desired depth is reached.  The actual depth
of each cut can be determined by placing a two by four on the surface and measuring to
each subsurface.<p>


 8.  When all the samples have been taken, fill the trench with dirt on the tarpaulin and
replace the sod taken from the trench.<p>


          <b>A.  Limitations.</b><p>



A depth profile is only useful for finding the relative vertical distribution of the radionuclide. 
Since only 100-300 cm&#178; of surface area at one spot is sampled when taking depth
increments,
the integrated deposit is not necessarily representative of the area.<p>



The trench method is more time consuming and more difficult than taking core samples. 
Therefore, researchers rarely sample and composite more than two samples per trench and
rarely take duplicate profiles.  However, if care is taken, there will be very little cross
contamination and the data collected in terms of the depth profile will be more accurate.<p>


Some consideration should be given to the problems introduced by sampling across soil
horizons.  Soil horizons differ in chemical and physical properties.<p>


          <b>B.  Sampling equipment for the trench method.</b><p>



The sampling equipment used by EML consists of:<p>


 1.  Three-sided square pan with cutting edges on the open side (15 cm x 15 cm x 5 cm
deep made of 0.157 cm thick cold-rolled steel, welded at the corners),<p>


 2.  Mortar trowel,<p>


 3.  Long flat-blade knife, and


 4.  1.2 m piece of two by four.<p>

<h1><center><b>NONHOMOGENEOUS TERRAIN METHOD</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

Previous site selection techniques discussed above assure a representative sample by the
homogeneous and undisturbed nature of the location.  In geographic areas characterized by
sparse vegetation, wind erosion, and nonuniform drainage, the fallout is expected to be
nonuniformly distributed.  A procedure for recovering a representative soil sample from
complex terrain for the purpose of determining the integrated radionuclide inventory deposited
in the area is described in Krey and Klusek (1995).  The following protocol is used in such a
nonhomogeneous terrain area.<p>



 1.  In the area of interest, select a site that is visually representative of the area.  An
optimal area would be without excessive rills, washout areas, and gullies that would
indicate areas of intense erosion.  If the area is very diverse in landscape, consideration
should be given to subdividing the area and taking samples in each area.<p>


 2.  Determine the number and types of covers (strata).  Some common strata are: open
pavement, trees, shrubs, grass, rocks.  Some judgment is required with small trees and
large bushes.  Vegetation should be assigned as a cover type if there is a significant
difference in the character or amount of accumulation of soil at their base. It is
preferable to preassign the vegetation to a category before attempting to estimate the
linear percentage to avoid changing the category's characteristic in midcount.<p>


 3.  Select, at random, a starting point and mark off a 100 m straight line transect in a
randomly selected direction.<p>


 4.  Using a measure that is a reasonable small unit, i.e., every 0.1 m, count off the
number of meters intersected by each stratum.  Estimate the proportion of each cover
along the total transect.<p>


 5.  Determine the number and method of sampling to be used in each identified stratum. 
Samples should be taken in every stratum that represents more than 5% of the total
transect.  For each cover type to be sampled:<p>

<ul>
          a)   Sample (systematically) by the core method at a fixed interval (e.g., 6 m)
along
the transect using the closest sampling location within &#177; 0.5 m of the mark.<p>



          b)   Sample (randomly) each cover type by the template method.  It is only
feasible to
take two to four samples by this method.<p>
</ul>

 6.  The samples taken in a stratum are combined.  At this point the soil samples (one per
stratum) can be analyzed:<p>

<ul>
          a)   independently to obtain information pertinent to each stratum and the total
inventory estimated by summing the proportional contribution from each stratum;<p>



          b)   the soil samples can be composited based on the areal proportion and only
this
composite sample for the site is analyzed.<p>
</ul>

<h1><center><b>WORK BOAT AND TRIPOD CORER</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>

<p>

<h2><b><center>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>

</center>


The main focus of this section is to present an overall description of the EML research vessel,
<i>Sedimental Journey</i>, including its associated trailer and large diameter sphincter corer. 
<i>Sedimental Journey</i> is used for taking sediment cores from inland lakes as a means of
reconstructing the deposition history of energy-related pollutants in different regions of the
U.S. (Heit et al., 1981). The sampling procedure itself is discussed in 
Section 3. Equipment Design and Application in <a href="sa06.htm">Sediment 
Sampling</a>.<p>

<p>



<h2><center><b>2.  RESEARCH VESSEL SEDIMENTAL JOURNEY</b></h2><p>



<h3><b>2.1  Dimensions and Configurations</b></h3><p>

</center>


<i>Sedimental Journey</i> is an outboard-powered aluminum boat.  It was specially designed and
constructed by Winninghoff Boats, Inc. (Warehouse Lane, Rowley, MA  01969).  The
principal dimensions of the boat and some accessory items are listed in Table 1.  A photograph
of Sedimental Journey is shown in <a href="6_9.gif">Figure 1</a>.<p>


The main feature that distinguishes this boat as a sediment coring research vessel is the well in
the stern section of the hull.  This craft has the maximum beam size (2.6 m) that can legally be
trailered by someone with a standard driver's license.  There is some cabin space in the bow
that is primarily used for dry storage.  The captain's chair and steering wheel are located on
the forward starboard side.  This midship area is protected by a permanently mounted
windshield, as well as a collapsible canvas cover.  There are storage brackets available for the
disassembled coring device along each side of the boat.  The winch motor and spool are bolted
directly onto a plate on the hull.  The boat has four mounts along the gunnels in the stern (two
on each side) which are used to attach the quadrapod.<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>2.2  Power Equipment</b></h3><p>

</center>


<i>Sedimental Journey</i> is powered by a pair of 30 kW (40 horsepower) Evinrude outboard
engines.  The controls for these motors are visible on the starboard deck in <a
href=6_9.gif">Figure 1</a>.<p>


A gasoline powered winch is installed on the starboard deck in front of the control console. 
Information about the winch is given in Table 1.  The winch, together with the quadrapod
mounted over the well, are used to lower the tripod corer to the lake bottom for sampling, and
to retrieve it after sampling.  The quadrapod is clearly visible as the tallest structure on the
deck in <a href="6_9.gif">Figure 1</a>.<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>2.3 Depth Recording Gear</b></h3><p>

</center>

Two devices are available for measuring depths.  One is a mechanical system mounted on the
cable sheave at the top of the quadrapod, which records the length of cable payed out.  The
second device on board is a recording fathometer (Low Range Model X-16).  This unit is
capable of measuring depths to 300 m.  The transducer is mounted on the rear underside of the
hull.  The display is placed on a bracket so that it is visible from the captain's chair.  The boat
has a Loran unit for locating geographical positions and determining bearing.  This micrologic
explorer model unit is mounted next to the fathometer display.  The receiving antenna is
positioned along the port side.  For emergency communications, <i>Sedimental Journey</i> is
also
equipped with an ICOM VHF radio.  The radio is mounted beside the Loran unit and has an
antenna off the starboard side.<p>

<p>



<h2><b><center>3.  TRAILER AND TOWING VEHICLE</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The trailer used to transport the boat is a commercially available E-Z loader, with a maximum
weight capacity of 2,000 kg.  The towing vehicle is a four-wheel drive Chevrolet 4x4 pickup
truck with a 5.7 L V-8 engine and an automatic transmission with four-wheel driver transfer
case.  A Class III load-equalizing type hitch and antisway bars are used to stabilize the ride.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b><a NAME="SF08SEC4">4.  TRIPOD CORER</a></b></h2><p>


</center>
<a href="6_10.gif">Figure 2</a> shows the assembly that is lowered through the well in the
hull of <i>Sedimental
Journey</i>, to the bottom of the lake or reservoir to be sampled.  It consists of three main
subassemblies:  the coring tube and its attachments, the frame, and the weight stand.<p>



The operation of the sampling assembly is described in Section 3. Equipment
Design and Application in <a href="sa06.htm">Sediment Sampling</a>, but a brief overview is
useful
here.  When the tripod contacts the bottom, a catch is released and gravity drives the coring
tube (marked &quot;core barrel&quot; in Figure 2) into the sediment.  The depth of penetration
depends
on the nature of the sediment and on the number of lead weights placed in the weight basket. 
When the winch has started to raise the assembly (usually after 1 min of penetration), the
initial tension on the cable acts to close the sphincter valves at both ends of the coring tube. 
This done, the cable pulls the coring tube out of the sediment back into the frame.  Finally,
continued pulling on the cable raises the entire assembly back to the deck of <i>Sedimental
Journey</i>.<p>


Sampling operations are most convenient with a crew of three or four.  The skipper maneuvers
the boat on the sampling station and operates the recorder, while one crew member operates
the winch which has separate throttle, brake, and clutch controls and thus requires their full
attention, and the remaining crew members handle the sampling gear.<p>

<p>
<h3><center><b>4.1  Coring Tube and Attachments</b></h3><p>

</center>


This subassembly consists of a 1 m or 1.5 m length of tubing (&quot;core barrel&quot;) with
fittings at both ends.  The tube is made of fiberglass, although Lucite tubes can also be
used.  The outside diameter is 21.9 cm and the wall thickness is 3 mm.<p>


The fitting at the lower end is called the &quot;core catcher&quot; and consists of a stainless
steel sleeve
fitted over the coring tube.  The sleeve provides the edge that cuts into the sediment, as well as
the mechanism to close the bottom of the tube after coring.<p>


The fitting at the upper end of the coring tube is also a stainless steel sleeve.  It carries the
valve mechanism used to close off the top end of the coring tube after the core is taken.<p>


A further description of this subassembly can be found in Burke (1968) and in Burke et al.
(1983).<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>4.2  FRAME</b></h3><p>

</center>


The frame consists of a top plate, a guide ring, and three legs, and is assembled from its
components before launching <i>Sedimental Journey</i>.  Assembly involves installing 15 bolts. 
Two of the legs fold so the corer can fit through the well in the hull.  Once the corer is in the
water, but before the corer is lowered to the sediment, the collapsed legs are manually swung
out and locked with a spring-loaded pin.<p>



The guide ring, together with the vertical support shown in <a href="sect6/6_10.gif">Figure
2</a>, serve to steer the coring
tube vertically into the sediment during sampling.<p>

<p>



<h3><center><b>4.3  Weight Basket</b></h3><p>

</center>


Up to 14 lead weights, each 13.6 kg, can be loaded onto the tripod corer to provide the force
needed to drive the coring tube into the sediment.  These weights are specially shaped to fit
into the bucket-like structure labeled &quot;weight basket&quot; in <a
href="6_10.gif">Figure 2</a>.<p>

<p>



<h3><center><b>4.4 Core Extruder</b></h3><p>


</center>
The extrusion sampling method is described in Section 4.4 Sediment
Extrusion in <a href="sa06.htm">Sediment Sampling</a>.  The core extruder mechanism is
simple and
easy to use (<a href="6_11.gif">Figure 3</a>).  The basic components consist of the
following.  
<ul>
<li>A flat aluminum
plate (50 cm x 50 cm) with two pins (one in the center and one off to the side) is used as the
base.  
<li>Two pieces of galvanized pipe (5 cm in diameter) are used for support.  One piece is
1.5 m long and is fitted over the centered base pin.  The other piece (2 m) is marked with a
scale of holes drilled down the length of the pipe, and it fits over the side pin. </ul><p>
The core with
the piston in place on the bottom is positioned onto the center pipe.  A clamp with a loop is
placed over the large pipe and tightened around the core.  As the core barrel is pulled down,
sediment is forced out of the top.  The scale on the large pipe is used to regulate the depth of
each section removed from the core.  Locking pliers can be used to mark the stop points on the
scaled pipe so that sections are one or more centimeters thick.<p>

<p>

<h2><b><center>5.  ASSEMBLY, LAUNCHING AND RETRIEVAL
PROCEDURE</b></h2><p>

</center>


The quadrapod and corer are assembled before the boat is launched.  Sedimental Journey is
launched by backing the trailer down a ramp and into the water.  Once the boat contacts the
water, the brakes are applied and the boat gently slips into the water.  The trailer is then pulled
out of the water and parked.  The launching procedure takes about one-half hour to complete. 
Retrieval of <i>Sedimental Journey</i> is essentially a reversal of the launching, except that the
boat
is pulled onto the submerged trailer with a manual winch.  The coring gear is then
disassembled and stored before transporting the boat.<p>

<h1><center><b>URANIUM AND RADIUM IN WATER</b></h1><p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>
</center>
<h2><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A simple method for the field collection of uranium and radium in 10 L of fresh water (tap,
well, river) is described.  Similar collection methods for radium are in use elsewhere, notably
at the New York University Institute of Environmental Medicine.<p>

<p>

This method has been used to collect uranium and radium from fresh water
samples at environmental levels.  The use of the ion exchange collector concentrates the
uranium and radium in the water samples and permits shipment of the samples within national
and international regulations.  Water samples collected with this system have been sent to
EML from locations within the continental U.S., the middle East, and Africa.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  APPARATUS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The ion exchange collector is a modified version of the fallout collector described in <a
href="ad02.html">Ion
Exchange Fallout Collector</a>.  This unit consists of a funnel and ion exchange column
constructed of polyethylene.  The funnel is welded to a threaded cap which is attached to the
top of the ion exchange column.  The bottom of the column is threaded for a tapered fitting,
which in turn has a small cap at the end.  The funnel and the tapered fitting are replaced with
standard bottle caps for return shipment to EML.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  PROCEDURE</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The column is packed with a plug of glass wool, a 1 cm plug of Whatman No. 41 paper strip
(Note 1), 150 mL of mixed anionic-cationic resin (Note 2), and a top plug of filter paper strip. 
The threaded tapered fitting (outlet end of the column) is taped to the column to assure
leak-proof operation during sampling.<p>

<p>

The column is attached to a funnel marked for a 10 L volume, it is then placed in a stand and
10 L of the water to be sampled is poured into the funnel.  The bottom cap is removed from
the tapered fitting, allowing gravity flow of the water.  The collection time is about 3 h.<p>

<p>

Upon return to EML, the resin and paper pulp are pushed out of the column body into a 250-mL
platinum crucible.  The glass wool is discarded.  The resin may be analyzed sequentially
for isotopic uranium and radium (see Procedure Se-01).<p>

<p>

<b>Notes:</b><p>


 1.  Filter paper pulp must not be used, as the flow rate through the column is too slow. 
Narrow strips cut from filter discs are recommended.<p>


 2.  The resin is an equal mixture of Bio-Rad 1x4 in the H+ form (20-50 mesh) and Bio-
Rad 50x8 (20-50 mesh).<p>

<h2><b><center>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

This section describes the instrumentation, setup, calibration and analysis for EML's field (<i>in
situ</i>) gamma -ray spectrometry using high resolution Ge detectors.  The specific application to
inventory measurements is described, as well as a spectral stripping routine for total exposure
rate measurements.  Methods for low resolution NaI detectors are also given.<p>



Field spectrometry is used at EML for the rapid identification of radionuclides in the
environment.  When the source geometry is taken into account, the concentrations or
inventories (activity per unit area) of these radionuclides in the soil can be inferred along with
the contribution to the above ground exposure rate.  Applications have included:<p>


1.   the measurement of natural background and weapons test fallout emitters (Lowder et
al., 1964a, b; Beck, 1966; Beck et al., 1964);<p>


2.   indoor radiation studies (Miller and Beck, 1984);<p>


3.   analysis of power reactor plumes (Gogolak, 1984);<p>


4.   the determination of aged fallout levels in terrain with mixed ground cover (Miller and
Helfer, 1985).<p>


5.   site characterization for environmental restoration (Miller et al., 1994).<p>

SETUP</b></h1><p>

</h1></center><p>


<center><h2><b>1.  INSTRUMENTATION</b></h2><p>

</center>

Although field spectrometry can be performed with a NaI scintillator, the detector of choice at
EML for most applications is a high resolution hyperpure germanium coaxial crystal.  This
type of detector can sustain warmup when not in use, which is a convenient feature during
extended field trips.<p>


Ease of handling is best accomplished with a detector mounted in a cryostat that is small
(hand-held) and which has an all-attitude capability.  Ideally, the detector assembly should be
mounted on a tripod with the crystal endcap facing down toward the ground and the dewar
above.  This orientation maximizes the flux that will be intercepted and registered by the
detector.  However, a standard 17- or 30-L dewar with an upward facing endcap can still be
used without a large loss in efficiency, since most of the flux is incident at the sidewall of the
detector, with the dewar blocking out only a few percent of the ground area that is effectively
being measured.  In either the downward or upward facing geometries, the axis of rotation for
the cylindrical crystal is perpendicular to the ground plane.  As such, the detector can be
assumed to have a symmetrical azimuthal response.  A &quot;goose neck&quot; cryostat, where
the
crystal axis is parallel to the ground plane, should be avoided since this introduces asymmetry
and would require making complicated angular corrections.<p>


Counting times in the field can be reduced by using large volume detectors, however, the
crystal length/diameter ratio is an important consideration as well.  The standard method of
measuring the efficiency for a Ge detector is performed with a Co-60 source at 25 cm normal to
the detector face.  As mentioned above, the open field source geometry is such that most of the
flux is incident from the side.  Thus, for two detectors that have the same quoted efficiency, a
long thin crystal will yield a higher count rate in the field as compared to a short wide one. 
However, length/diameter ratios close to unity would generally result in less uncertainty in
measurements due to flatter angular responses.<p>



A list of detectors that we have calibrated for field spectrometry is given in Table 1.  Our
current primary detector for field work is the 45% efficient high purity P-type Ge coaxial
mounted in a portable (hand-held) cryostat.  It requires a 6 h cool-down time before becoming
operational, although it is normally mated to an overhead  30-L liquid nitrogen dewar with a
gravity feed system when stored in the laboratory so that it is always ready for use.  This type
of setup also allows the detector to be placed in a shield and used for sample analysis.  Once
cooled down and detached from the feeder dewar, the hand-held cryostat (1.2 L) can be used
for as long as 24 h before refilling is required.  For studies involving low energy, a recently
acquired detector measures 75% in relative efficiency and is of N-type Ge with a beryllium
window.  It has a 3-L dewar and can be hand-held although it is best suited for tripod
mounting.<p>



Generally, measurements are made in the field using a portable battery-powered computer-based
spectroscopy system.  High voltage and preamplifier power are supplied to the detector
by the system.  Some detectors feature low power preamplifiers which provide for extended
operational time when using battery power in the field.  A spectroscopy grade amplifier is also
contained within the system.  The complete spectrometer system can be carried and operated
by one person.<p>


<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  SITE SELECTION AND INSTRUMENT SETUP</b></h2><p>



</center>
The detector is placed ~1 m above the ground with the analyzer and operator positioned a few
meters away.  The site chosen should be a flat, relatively even and an open area.  Terrain that
has obstructions such as boulders, large felled or standing trees, and any man-made structures
should be avoided as these will block the  flux from the underlying soil.  Extreme ground
roughness will result in anomalies since the soil surface area close to the detector is increased,
while the surface contribution from large distances is reduced.  For measurements of fallout
radionuclides, the area must be undisturbed in that water and wind erosion as well as human
activity, such as cultivating, would tend to upset the distribution of any deposited activity. 
<a href="3_4.gif">Figure 1</a> shows an example of equipment placement at a typical field
site.<p>



When selecting a site for measurement, the source geometry must be taken into account.  An
unshielded detector, placed at 1 m above the ground, samples the photon flux from a volume
of soil out to a radius on the order of 10 m and down to a depth of about 30 cm, depending
upon the photon energy.  <a href="3_5.gif">Figure 2</a> shows a pictorial representation
of the relative ground area
contributions to the primary (uncollided) flux at a height of 1 m for a medium energy (662
keV) source with a typical exponential depth profile in the soil.  This effective &quot;field of
view&quot;
varies, being somewhat larger (smaller) for higher (lower) energy sources.  Also, activity that
is closer to the soil surface will produce a wider field of view.  In effect, a field spectrum
samples an area of several hundred square meters, thus averaging out the local inhomogeneities
in the distribution of the radionuclides.  The source being measured is essentially a giant soil
sample and counting statistics for a given spectral absorption peak are obtained in a fraction of
the time required for counting a small collected sample.<p>


A good practice to follow is to make a series of short measurements in an area to ensure that
there is approximate uniformity before collecting a longer spectrum and obtaining the desired
counting statistics.  When making measurements of natural background, or when the exposure
rate is dominated by the man-made emitters under study, this check can be performed with an
ionization chamber or a suitably sensitive survey ratemeter in that uniform exposure rate
readings would imply a spatially invariant source distribution relative to the detector.  If the
particular radionuclides under study contribute just a small fraction to the total exposure rate,
then the corresponding peak area count rates should be checked with the spectrometer to
ensure uniformity.<p>

</center><hr>
<p>

A complete description of field gamma-ray spectrometry can be found in Beck et al. (1972) and
Miller and Shebell (1993).  To summarize, the exposure rate in air above the ground is related
to the absorption peak counting rate registered by the detector by<p>


<img src="fg02eq1.gif"><p>

where<p>

<ul>
     N<sub>o</sub>/Phi   is   the counting rate from a particular spectrum absorption
peak due to a unit
primary photon flux density of energy E incident on the detector along the
detector axis (normal to the detector face),<p>



     N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>   is   the correction required to account for
detector angular response, and<p>



     Phi/I     is   the primary photon flux density with an energy E at the detector resulting
from the decay of a particular radionuclide per unit exposure rate at the
detector from all primary and scattered photons originating from this nuclide
and any others present from its radioactive decay series.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The first two terms depend on the particular detector; Phi/I values depend only on the source
composition and geometry and can be used for any spectrometer calibration.<p>



In a like manner, the concentration or <a NAME="EQ2">inventory of a particular nuclide</a> is
related to absorption
peak counting rate by<p>

<p>

<img src="fg02eq2.gif">

<p>

where <p>

<ul>

     Phi/A     is   the total photon flux density at the detector location per unit concentration
or
inventory of the nuclide.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The three factors to compute N<sub>f</sub>/I or N<sub>f</sub>/A are discussed separately.<p>

<p>

     <b>A.  N<sub>o</sub>/Phi.</b><p>



The response to unit flux at normal incidence is evaluated for a detector using various gamma-ray
point sources.  A complete energy response curve from 40 keV to 3 MeV can be inferred with
a set made up with the reasonably long lived isotopes Eu-152, Am-241, Cs-137, Co-60, and
Th-228.  The
measurement procedure is as follows:<p>



1.   Position the source at a distance of at least 1 m and at normal incidence to the detector
face.<p>


2.   Calculate the uncollided flux density at the detector effective crystal center, which is
obtained by dividing the  emission rate by 4 pi r&#178;.  The value of r is the distance from
the source to the crystal effective center.  This can be taken to be the geometric center
for high energy (&gt; 1 MeV) rays and the crystal face for low energy (&lt; 0.1 MeV) gamma
rays.  For the energy range between these two values, an estimate of average
penetration distance can be made based on the absorption coefficient of the crystal. 
The gamma flux density is also corrected for air and source holder attenuation.<p>



3.   Collect a spectrum and determine the full absorption peak count rate.<p>


4.   Collect a spectrum without the source present and subtract out from the previously
measured count rate any contribution to the peak from background emitters.<p>



5.   Divide the corrected count rate by the flux density to determine N<sub>o</sub>/Phi.<p>



6.   Perform this measurement at different energies with either simultaneous or separate
runs.<p>


7.   Plot the values of N<sub>o</sub>/ versus energy on a log-log scale and fit the data to a
smooth
curve. <a href="3_6.gif">Figure 1</a> shows N<sub>o</sub>/Phi as function of energy
above 200 keV for the detectors
listed in <a href="fg01.htm#TB1">Table 1</a> in Instrumentation, Site Selection and Instrument
Setup.  In the energy
range shown, the response can be fit to a straight line on a log-log plot to within 3%.<p>



     <b>B.</b> <b> N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>.</b><p>


The uncollided gamma-ray flux for a soil half space source geometry is not limited to angles
normal
to the detector face.  Therefore, the complete flux density response calibration must account
for the fact that a cylindrical Ge crystal when oriented with the axis of symmetry perpendicular
to the ground plane has a variable altitudinal (zenith-angle) response.  The correction factor,
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>, is determined from point source calibrations as functions of
energy and angle in the
vertical plane and can be calculated from<p>

<p>

<img src="fg02eq3.gif">

<p>

where<p>

<ul>

     Phi(theta)/Phi is   the fraction of the total primary flux at zenith angle theta for
a given source
energy and geometry, and<p>



     N(theta)/N     is   the response of the detector at angle theta for the same energy
gamma ray relative to
the response at normal incidence.<p>
</ul>
<p>


The procedure for determining the values of N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> is as follows:<p>



1.   Measure the full absorption peak count rate (minus any background contribution to the
peak) using a point source at a fixed distance of at least 1 m to the crystal at 15&#176;
intervals between incident angles of 0&#176; (normal to detector face) and 90&#176;.<p>


2.   Plot the relative response N(theta)/N versus angle and fit the data to a smooth curve.<p>



3.   Evaluate N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> numerically for at least three different source
distributions in the
soil (surface plane, 3 cm relaxation depth, and uniform). The angular flux distribution
data can be found in Beck et al. (1972).<p>


4.   Repeat Steps 1-3 for several other energies and plot the resultant values of
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> versus
energy.  The data points can be fit to a smooth curve for each source depth distribution.<p>



As noted before, a longer crystal would tend to yield a higher count rate in the field, meaning
that the value of N<sub>f</sub</N<sub>o</sub> would be &gt; 1.  For the source distributions
generally encountered,
more than 80% of the uncollided flux is incident between theta = 30&#176;-90&#176; ( measured
from the
detector axis normal to the ground interface).  Uniformity of the zenith angular response in
this range to within a few percent assures that the value of N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> will
not vary significantly
with changes in the distribution of flux.  In general, a more uniform response is achieved with
a crystal where the diameter is close to the length dimension.  However, the variation in
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>
for a detector where the crystal length/diameter is as high as 1.3 or as low as 0.7 would not be
expected to be more than about 20% for energies &gt;200 keV. <a href="3_7.gif">Figure
2</a> shows angular
correction factor data at three different energies for several detectors in a downward facing
geometry and a uniform source depth profile.<p>



     <b>C.  Phi/I and Phi/A.</b><p>


The Phi/I (and Phi/A) factors are derived from gamma-ray transport calculations.  Tabulations of
these
data along with other pertinent information on the make-up of the environmental gamma radiation
field can be found in Beck et al. (1972), Beck and de Planque (1968), and Beck (1972).  A
complete set of exposure rate values (I/A) for close to 200 common fission and activation
isotopes at various exponential depth distributions in the soil can be found in Beck (1980).<p>


<b>Notes:</b><p>


1.   The inference of exposure rates from nuclides located in the ground does not require a
precise knowledge of the distribution with depth or of the exact soil density or
composition.  This property results because the observed peak count rate in a field
spectrum is essentially a measure of the uncollided flux, and although this quantity and
the exposure rate produced by it and the associated scattered flux varies significantly
with the source depth distribution and soil characteristics, the ratio of these two
quantities, Phi/I, does not. Thus, even a crude estimate of source distribution should not
lead to a sizeable error in the exposure rate.<p>



2.   In lieu of a complete experimental calibration of a Ge detector for field spectrometry,
generic factors may be substituted at energies &gt; 200 keV (Helfer and Miller, 1988). 
The only parameters needed to apply this semiempirical calibration method are the
manufacturer's quoted efficiency at 1332 keV (5-45%), the crystal length/diameter
ratio (0.5-1.3), and the detector orientation in the field (upward or downward facing). 
The accuracy of the derived factors is estimated to be 10% for energies &gt; 500 keV
and 15% for energies between 200 and 500 keV.<p>

<center><h1><b>SPECTRUM ANALYSIS</b></h1><p>

<hr><p>

</center>
In many situations, the built-in peak area estimate features of state-of-the-art analyzers are
used in providing quick results in the field.  Prominent peaks are identified in a bench-mark
spectrum and the appropriate regions of interest are set up.  On certain analyzers, function
keys are programmed using the net peak area, counting time and calibration factor
(N<sub>f</sub>/I and
N<sub>f</sub>/A) to provide instantaneous readout of exposure rate and concentration or
inventory.<p>


For more complete data reduction, a small computer is interfaced to the analyzer to run a
spectrum analysis program.  If desired, a totally portable system may be configured using a
battery-powered laptop computer.  Our standard analysis program (Gogolak and Miller, 1977;
Gogolak, 1982) performs the following:<p>


1.   Based on a two point energy calibration as set by the operator, certain peaks which are
characteristic of typical environmental spectra are identified, namely:<p>

<ul>

     a.   the 186, 295, 352, 609, 1120 and 1765 keV peaks in the U-238 series;<p>

     b.   the 583, 911, 966 and 2615 keV peaks in the Th-232 series;<p>

     c.   the 1460 keV peak of K-40;<p>

     d.   the 662 keV peak of Cs-137.<p>

</ul>

These peaks are defined by set energy bands where the left and right channel markers
are representative of the Compton continuum.<p>



2.   The counts between the energy boundaries for each of the above peaks are summed. 
The background counts in three channels on each side of a peak are averaged and the
result is used as an estimate of the baseline under the peak.  This is multiplied by the number of
channels in the peak and subtracted out from the total counts in the peak
band to yield the net peak counts.<p>



3.   Detector specific calibration factors are applied to convert from peak count rate to
exposure rate and concentration or inventory.<p>


4.   A printout is made listing count rates, converted quantities and associated statistical
counting errors.<p>



5.   Permanent storage of the spectrum is made on either magnetic tape or diskette.<p>



6.   As an option, an automated search is performed to identify any peaks present in 
the spectrum.  Data such as nuclide, half-life, gamma-ray intensity and associated 
energy are printed out using a library of nearly 400 principal gamma-ray energies that are seen in
the environment (see <a href="rd04.htm">Gamma</a> in <a href="rd01.htm">Radionuclide
Data</a>).  Any peak can be quickly
analyzed by using an optional automated continuum strip.<p>



7.   The program enters an interactive phase where the operator examines any additional
peaks, checks the results of the automated routine, or investigates any
unusual or unexpected features of a spectrum.<p>

A field gamma-ray spectrum can also provide an estimate of the amount of activity per unit area
of
soil surface for nuclides which have been deposited on the ground.  To do this, a knowledge of
the source distribution in the soil is required in order to relate the  measured total absorption
peak count rate to the incident unscattered photon flux and then to the activity in the soil in a
manner analogous to that used for natural emitters.<p>

<p>

The activity profile with depth for deposited nuclides in undisturbed soils can be represented
by an exponential function,<p>

<img src="fg04eq1.gif">

<ul>

<h2><b>2.  HOMOGENEOUS TERRAIN</B></h2><P>

In the case of a freshly deposited nuclide, the depth parameter is infinite corre-sponding to a plane
source distribution and a relaxation length of zero.  In practice, the effects of ground roughness
bury the source somewhat.  Even on what appears to be flat terrain, we apply an alpha/rho value
of 6.25 cm&#178;/g, which at a typical soil density of 1.6 g/cm&#179; corresponds to a
relaxation depth of 0.1 cm.  Values of alpha/rho for aged global fallout Cs-137 have been found
to range from a high of 1.0 for an evergreen forest floor to a low of 0.03 for a flood irrigated
lawn.  At a soil density of 1.6 g/cm&#179;, these correspond to relaxation lengths of 0.6 and 21
cm, respectively.  More typical values of alpha/rho tend to range from 0.05-0.1 for open field sites
and 0.2-0.5 for wooded or desert areas.<p>

Values of the unscattered flux and its angular distribution at 1 m above the
ground have been tabulated for exponentially distributed sources in the soil for various energies
and alpha/rho values (Beck et al., 1972).  Using <a href="fg02.htm#EQ2">the equation</a> for
the concentration or inventory of a particular nuclide as related to the absorption peak counting
rate, where the term A now represents the inventory (activity per unit area), the detector response
can be calculated for a particular nuclide as a function of alpha/rho.  If the nuclide has two
reasonably strong gamma lines well separated in energy, the value of alpha/rho can be inferred
from the ratio of the measured fluxes.<p>

In the case of a monoenergetic source such as Cs-137, the value of alpha/rho can be determined
experimentally as follows:<p>

1.  A 62 cm&#178; or similar large area corer and auger is used to extract soil samples from
    different depth intervals (see <a href="sa05.htm">Soil Sampling</a>) depending upon the
    expected activity distribution.  For example, if the profile is expected to be shallow, the
    depth intervals can be 0-2.5, 2.5-5, and 5-30 cm, while if it is expected to be deep,
    intervals of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-30 cm can be used.  More than one core can be
    taken, in which case the samples from the same depth are composited.  The depth of the
    soil core should be sufficient to include essentially all of the deposited activity so that
    I<sub>o</sub> can be determined.<p>

2.  An aliquot of a sample from each depth increment is counted on a high resolution Ge
    detector to determine the concentration of the radionuclide of interest.<p>

3.  The activity per unit area for each depth is computed from the product of the con-centration and the sample mass for that depth increment divided by the area of the
    sample.<p>

4.  A fit toinventory, I,  is then applied, the variables being I<sub>o</sub> - I, the integrated
    activity per unit area and rho z , the gross <i>in situ</i> mass per unit area down to depth
    z .  Graphically, this can be performed by plotting the log(I<sub>o</sub> - I) versus rho z
    and fitting a straight line through the points, weighting the points near the surface more
    heavily since this is where most of the activity is contained.  The slope of this line is just
    alpha/rho.<p>

<b>Note:</b><p>

Although the inventory is determined using the soil sample data itself, it is quite useful to
corroborate this estimate with the field spectrum.  The soil cores may represent an area of a few
hundred square centimeters, while the field data represent the average over several hundred
square meters.<p>
<p>

<h2><b>3.  NONHOMOGENEOUS TERRAIN</h2></b>
<p>
For areas where the fallout is suspected of being unevenly distributed across the ground,
representative inventory measurements can still be made by relying on the fact that a field
spectrum averages out the local inhomogeneities in the source geometry.  This more generalized
method is applied to cases such as the measurement of aged fallout in the desert southwest of the
U.S. where blowsand tends to shift from bare soil and collect under vegetative cover.  A complete
description can be found in Miller and Helfer (1985).  The basic steps include:<p>

1.  Soil samples in depth increments are collected from the different types of ground cover
    present (grass, brush, bare soil, etc.).<p>

2.  The samples are counted and a depth profile for each type of ground cover is obtained
    using the procedure outlined above for homogeneous terrain.<p>

3.  If the depth profiles are significantly different, the approximate percentage of ground
    cover of each type is determined within a 15 x 15 m square centered at the detector.  This
    can be performed using a combination of tape measurements and eye estimates to
    approximate the dimensions of any patches of grass or shrubs and trees out to their drip
    line, or to where there is an obvious change in soil characteristics, and then calculating the
    total area of each particular type of cover.<p>

4.  The conversion factor to apply to the peak count rate in order to obtain an inventory
    estimate is given by<p>

<img src="fg04eq3.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>
   &lt;g&gt;     is   the average full absorption peak count rate to inventory conversion factor for an infinite half
                      space source distribution with randomly spaced segments of different types of ground cover,
                      each of which has its own characteristic nuclide depth distribution and inventory (inventory
                      per unit count rate), <p>

    x<sub>i</sub>     is   the fraction of the total inventory associated with the i-th type of ground cover,
                           and<p>

    g<sub>i</sub>     is   the full absorption peak count rate to inventory conversion factor for an infinite
                           half-space source distribution with a measured depth profile characteristic of the i-th type of ground cover (inventory per unit count rate).<p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><p>

The value of &lt;g&gt; exhibits a dependence on the relative inventory mix for the different
ground covers which can only be determined through soil sampling.  Nonetheless, the value of
&lt;g&gt; must fall within the range of the individual values of g<sub>i</sub>  Generally, this
range is not large.  Although the inventory may typically vary by a factor of two for the different
ground covers, the variation in the conversion factor for the different depth profiles associated
with these ground covers will average &lt;30%.  This is particularly true for sites where the
fallout is near the soil surface because the conversion factor does not vary strongly with the depth
profile for values of alpha/rho &gt; 0.2.<p>

<h1><center><b>SPECTRAL STRIPPING FOR GERMANIUM DETECTORS</b></h1><p>
<hr>
</center><p>


<h2><center><b>1.  APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A stripping operation can be applied to a Ge detector spectrum which has been collected in
free air in order to obtain the  flux density as a function of energy (Miller, 1984).  This flux
spectrum can be readily converted to an independent estimate of the free air exposure rate or
be used to make energy response corrections to other radiation measuring devices.  This
technique has particular applications to indoor radiation measurements, where the flux
distribution is not easily predicted because of the complex and generally unknown gamma source
geometry.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  THEORY</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A count registered by the detector can be caused by the full or partial absorption of an incident
photon or by the passage of a cosmic ray produced charged particle.  In order to obtain a
measure of the incident photon flux spectrum, the partial absorption and cosmic-ray events
must be subtracted out and then the full absorption efficiency curve of the detector can be
applied.<p>


The stripping operation can be expressed as:<p>

<p>

<img src="fg05eq1.gif">


<p>

where<p>

<ul>
N<sub>i</sub><sup>'</sup>, N<sub>j</sub><sup>'</sup>   are  the counts in an
energy band due to the total absorption of incident gamma flux,<p>

N<sub>i</sub>  is   the observed counts in an energy band due to all sources,<p>

L    is   the energy band containing the highest energy  line (generally 2.615 keV),<p>

f<sub>ij</sub> is   the fraction of the continuum counts at energy band i due to the
partial
absorption of incident  flux at energy band j,<p>

r<sub>j</sub>  is   the ratio of total counts to full absorption peak counts for incident
flux at
energy band j, and<p>

N<sub>c</sub>  is   the counts in band i due to cosmic-ray events, assumed to be
constant in any
energy band and given by<p>

     <ul>
<img src="fg05eq2.gif"><p>
     </ul>


</ul>
where<p>

<ul>
E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>  are  the lower and upper energy bands of a pure
cosmic-ray energy (generally 3-4
MeV).<p>
</ul>


<p>

<h2><center><b>3.  DETERMINATION OF STRIPPING PARAMETERS (f and
r)</b></h2><p>

</center>


<b>Factor  f</b> - For the factor f, a multiple step function fit is used wherein the region below
the
Compton edge is divided into 10 equal size energy bands and the region above the Compton
edge is divided into four equal bands.  The fraction of the total counts in the continuum in
each band  can be experimentally determined for a particular detector by examining the shape
of the continuum below a full absorption peak from a monoenergetic  source.  Although the
shape of the continuum is a function of the energy and incident angle of the  ray, it is not
overly sensitive to these variables, particularly at the higher energies which contribute the most
to the exposure rate.<p>


<b>Factor  r</b> - In the same manner that the full absorption peak efficiency is determined for a
detector (see <a href="fg02.htm">Calibration</a> for N<sub>o</sub>/Phi), the total efficiency
can be determined and its ratio
computed.  However, effectively monoenergetic sources must be used and room background
must be subtracted from the entire spectrum.  Like the full absorption peak efficiency, the total
efficiency varies with incident angle for a cylindrical detector.  However, the ratio of the two,
r, varies more smoothly and is not a strong function of the incident angle.  A single angular
correction factor can therefore be applied which is representative of the higher gamma energies
which weigh heavily in the exposure rate computation.  This factor can be obtained by
assuming an isotropic radiation field and averaging over the entire 4 pi solid angle.  Although,
in practice, the radiation field may not be isotropic, a reasonable approximation to this ideal
can be created by accumulating a spectrum with the detector oriented in different directions,
thus averaging out the angular dependence.  To accomplish this, we routinely count for equal
lengths of time with the detector pointing in six different directions, that is, each way along
three orthogonal axes.<p>

<p>



<h2><center><b>4.  STRIPPING OPERATION</b></h2><p>

</center>

The stripping operation is performed on a portable PC using Basic and takes &lt; 1 min to
complete.  It proceeds as follows:<p>


1.   The spectrum is calibrated using two energy-channel points supplied by the operator.<p>


2.   The spectrum is compressed from 4000 channels to 400 channels for faster
computation.<p>


3.   The spectrum is stripped of the cosmic-ray events.<p>


4.   The spectrum is stripped of partial absorption events for equal size energy bands of 
10 keV each and starting at the band containing the highest energy gamma line (generally
2.615 keV), where N = N - N<sub>c</sub>.  Succeeding lower energy bands can then be
computed based on the N<sub>j</sub><sup>'</sup> values from any higher band.<p>



5.   The spectrum of counts which remains after the stripping operation is completed is
converted to the incident flux density energy distribution by applying the full
absorption peak efficiency of the detector.  As in the case of the factor r, an angular
correction based on the assumption of isotropic incidence must be applied.<p>


6.   The gamma exposure rate is computed by integrating across the spectrum the product of
the
energy, flux density, and mass energy absorption coefficient for air at each energy
band.<p>



<b>Note:</b><p>


Intercomparisons between the spectral stripping method and our own instruments and standard
procedures, as well as with those of the Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute, have
shown good agreement (Nagaoka, 1987).  Based on these measurements, we conservatively
estimate an upper limit in the total systematic error of &#177;5% when this method is applied to
spectra at background levels.  The statistical error was determined to be &lt; 2% (at the 1 sigma
level) for a 1-min spectrum at typical background levels.<p>

<h1><center><b>SODIUM  IODIDE DETECTORS</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>


<center><h2><b>1.  APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Although no longer used routinely by EML for field gamma-ray spectrometry, NaI detectors are
nonetheless capable of yielding satisfactory results particularly for natural background
measurements.  Like the case for Ge detector measurements, full absorption analysis can be
applied to a NaI field spectrum.  In addition, there is the technique of &quot;energy band&quot;
analysis
as well as &quot;total spectrum energy&quot; analysis.  A complete description of these methods
can be
found in Beck et al. (1972). <p>



<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  EQUIPMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>


The NaI detectors (usually 4-x-4 in cylindrical crystals attached to matched photomultiplier
tubes) are coupled through an emitter-follower preamplifier.  Either a battery powered
portable or 120 V AC vehicle-based analyzer with at least 400 channels is used to collect the
spectra.  NaI detectors are usually covered (in addition to the manufacturer's standard thin
aluminum or stainless steel window) by a 6-mm bakelite shield to reduce the beta-ray contribution
to the Compton continuum as well as to moderate thermal stresses.  The NaI detector is
transported in a rugged, foam-cushioned box to minimize mechanical and thermal shock.<p>

<p>



<center><h2><b>3.  PEAK ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

For NaI spectrometry, the N<sub>o</sub>/Phi should be obtained with source energies as close
as possible to
those environmental sources to be evaluated, usually the energies associated with the U-238 and
Th-232 series, K-40, and Cs-137.  The resulting N<sub>o</sub>/Phi versus E data do not
represent the usual NaI
response curve, because the analysis of absorption peaks does not lead to accurate estimates of
the actual peak areas, unless one engages in a complex computer program for spectral
stripping.  NaI peak areas are determined in essentially the same manner as those from Ge
detectors, though only a few absorption peaks are measurable due to the relatively poor
resolution.  Cross-calibration of a NaI detector with the more accurate Ge detector can be very
helpful.<p>


<center><h2><b>4.  ENERGY BAND ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>

When the naturally-occurring nuclides associated with the U-238 and Th-232 series and K-40
predominate at a field site, the simplified &quot;energy band&quot; method of analysis can be
applied.  In
this method, the spectrum energy is calculated as the product of the counts per channel times
the energy represented by each channel in bands of channels.  The energy bands are centered
on the 1.46 MeV K-40, the 1.76 MeV Bi-214, and the 2.62 MeV Tl-208 peaks.  The response in
each bin can then be represented by the following equations.<p>

<ul>

E<sub>1</sub> = u<sub>1</sub>U + k<sub>1</sub>K + t<sub>1</sub>T + I<sub>1</sub><p>

E<sub>2</sub> = u<sub>2</sub>U + k<sub>2</sub>K + t<sub>2</sub>T + I<sub>2</sub>
<p>

E<sub>3</sub> = t<sub>3</sub>T + I<sub>3</sub><p>
</ul>



where E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub> are the measured
&quot;energy&quot; values for some arbitrary counting period; U,
K and T represent the exposure rates to be measured; the constants represent the distribution of
spectrum energy per unit exposure rate among the three energy bands; and I<sub>1</sub>,
I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>3</sub> are the
cosmic-ray contributions.  The three equations relating the U, K and Th exposure rates to the
energy bands are determined by solving the three equations above and evaluating the coefficients
from
regression analyses of a large number of field spectra for which exposure rates had been
determined from absorption peak analyses.<p>


The following approximate equations apply for a nominal 10.16 x 10.16 cm NaI detector,
shielded with 6-mm Bakelite, though calibration of individual detectors is preferred.<p>

<ul>

U = 0.4 E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.2 E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

K = 0.08 E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.06 E<sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.02
E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

T = 0.3 E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

I = E<sub>T</sub><sup>'</sup>/37<p>
</ul>

where I is the total exposure rate from natural radioactivity in soil, and<p>

<ul>
1.32 MeV &lt; E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 1.60 MeV,<p>

1.62 MeV &lt; E<sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 1.90 MeV,<p>

2.48 MeV &lt; E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 2.75 MeV,<p>

0.15 MeV &lt; E<sub>T</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 3.40 MeV,<p>

</ul>

the E values being in GeV per 20-min counting period.  The primes indicate that the energy
contributions from cosmic rays must be subtracted before the equations are used.<p>


Energy band analysis is performed quickly in the field by interfacing the multichannel analyzer
to a portable computer.  Using interactive software (Gogolak and Miller, 1977), the basic steps
include:<p>



1.   The spectrum is read into the computer and the operator  provides a two point energy
calibration (usually the positions of the 1460 keV K-40 and 2615 keV Tl-208 peaks) and
the altitude to the nearest thousand feet (for the cosmic-ray corrections). <p>



2.   The above equations are applied.<p>



3.   A printout is made of the total exposure rate and the contributions for K- 40 and the U-238
and Th-232 series.<p>

<p>


<h2><center><b>5.  TOTAL SPECTRUM ENERGY ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>

The exposure rate in air is proportional to <img src="fg06eq1.gif">
where Phi(E) is the flux of 
gamma rays of energy E and &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho is the mass absorption coefficient in air. 
Between a few hundred
keV and several MeV, &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho is fairly constant.  Also for low energies, the
probability of an
incident photon being totally absorbed by a large NaI detector is fairly high (on the order of
50-100% from 100 keV to 1 MeV).  About 75% of the exposure rate from the soil is due to
emitters between 100 keV and 1500 keV.  This and the fact that the spectrum of gamma rays
from
natural emitters is fairly invariant to the exact proportions of U, Th and K in the soil, indicates
that the total &quot;spectrum energy&quot; is a reasonable measure of free air exposure from
natural
radioactivity in the soil.  A large NaI or similar detector measures the flux to a fairly high
degree of accuracy and, even though sensitivity decreases somewhat at higher energies due to
the escape of secondary scattered photons, this decrease tends to be compensated by
correspondingly smaller values of &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho for energies above 1 MeV relative to
values below 1
MeV.<p>


Unlike many NaI hand-held survey instruments, which depend on the assumption that the
counting rate above some bias level is proportional to the exposure rate, the total energy
technique requires only that the counts in a channel be proportional to Phi (E)
(&#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho) for that
energy, and is, therefore, less sensitive to spectral changes.  For example, a NaI survey meter
might indicate that the exposure rate from a unit flux of 60 keV photons as being almost equal
to the exposure rate from a unit flux of 1460 keV photons.  This would occur since the 1460
keV pulse would be recorded due to the high probability of a Compton collision in the detector
even though many of the secondaries would escape the crystal.  In the total energy technique,
the higher energy counts are weighted by the energy deposited and reflect their relative
contribution to the exposure rate more correctly.  The slightly larger total absorption at 60 keV
reflects the larger value of (&#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho) relative to higher energy gamma rays.<p>



The spectrum &quot;energy&quot; calibration factors for 10.16 x 10.16 cm detectors are
determined in
two ways:<p>


1.   The detectors are exposed to a known point source of Ra-226 in the laboratory and the
measured exposure rate is compared to an ionization chamber reading.  The
measurement should be corrected to account for the fact that the rays from the point
source are incident along the detector axis.<p>



2.   A comparison of measurements of &quot;spectrum energy&quot; from actual field spectra
is made
with simultaneous ionization chamber measurements for different environ-mental
radiation fields.<p>


The two methods give essentially the same calibration factors.<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INSTRUMENTATION</b></h2><p>

</center>

Although field spectrometry can be performed with a NaI scintillator, the detector of choice at
EML for most applications is a high resolution hyperpure germanium coaxial crystal.  This
type of detector can sustain warmup when not in use, which is a convenient feature during
extended field trips.<p>


Ease of handling is best accomplished with a detector mounted in a cryostat that is small
(hand-held) and which has an all-attitude capability.  Ideally, the detector assembly should be
mounted on a tripod with the crystal endcap facing down toward the ground and the dewar
above.  This orientation maximizes the flux that will be intercepted and registered by the
detector.  However, a standard 17- or 30-L dewar with an upward facing endcap can still be
used without a large loss in efficiency, since most of the flux is incident at the sidewall of the
detector, with the dewar blocking out only a few percent of the ground area that is effectively
being measured.  In either the downward or upward facing geometries, the axis of rotation for
the cylindrical crystal is perpendicular to the ground plane.  As such, the detector can be
assumed to have a symmetrical azimuthal response.  A &quot;goose neck&quot; cryostat, where
the
crystal axis is parallel to the ground plane, should be avoided since this introduces asymmetry
and would require making complicated angular corrections.<p>


Counting times in the field can be reduced by using large volume detectors, however, the
crystal length/diameter ratio is an important consideration as well.  The standard method of
measuring the efficiency for a Ge detector is performed with a Co-60 source at 25 cm normal to
the detector face.  As mentioned above, the open field source geometry is such that most of the
flux is incident from the side.  Thus, for two detectors that have the same quoted efficiency, a
long thin crystal will yield a higher count rate in the field as compared to a short wide one. 
However, length/diameter ratios close to unity would generally result in less uncertainty in
measurements due to flatter angular responses.<p>



A list of detectors that we have calibrated for field spectrometry is given in Table 1.  Our
current primary detector for field work is the 45% efficient high purity P-type Ge coaxial
mounted in a portable (hand-held) cryostat.  It requires a 6 h cool-down time before becoming
operational, although it is normally mated to an overhead  30-L liquid nitrogen dewar with a
gravity feed system when stored in the laboratory so that it is always ready for use.  This type
of setup also allows the detector to be placed in a shield and used for sample analysis.  Once
cooled down and detached from the feeder dewar, the hand-held cryostat (1.2 L) can be used
for as long as 24 h before refilling is required.  For studies involving low energy, a recently
acquired detector measures 75% in relative efficiency and is of N-type Ge with a beryllium
window.  It has a 3-L dewar and can be hand-held although it is best suited for tripod
mounting.<p>



Generally, measurements are made in the field using a portable battery-powered computer-based
spectroscopy system.  High voltage and preamplifier power are supplied to the detector
by the system.  Some detectors feature low power preamplifiers which provide for extended
operational time when using battery power in the field.  A spectroscopy grade amplifier is also
contained within the system.  The complete spectrometer system can be carried and operated
by one person.<p>


<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  SITE SELECTION AND INSTRUMENT SETUP</b></h2><p>



</center>
The detector is placed ~1 m above the ground with the analyzer and operator positioned a few
meters away.  The site chosen should be a flat, relatively even and an open area.  Terrain that
has obstructions such as boulders, large felled or standing trees, and any man-made structures
should be avoided as these will block the  flux from the underlying soil.  Extreme ground
roughness will result in anomalies since the soil surface area close to the detector is increased,
while the surface contribution from large distances is reduced.  For measurements of fallout
radionuclides, the area must be undisturbed in that water and wind erosion as well as human
activity, such as cultivating, would tend to upset the distribution of any deposited activity. 
<a href="3_4.gif">Figure 1</a> shows an example of equipment placement at a typical field
site.<p>



When selecting a site for measurement, the source geometry must be taken into account.  An
unshielded detector, placed at 1 m above the ground, samples the photon flux from a volume
of soil out to a radius on the order of 10 m and down to a depth of about 30 cm, depending
upon the photon energy.  <a href="3_5.gif">Figure 2</a> shows a pictorial representation
of the relative ground area
contributions to the primary (uncollided) flux at a height of 1 m for a medium energy (662
keV) source with a typical exponential depth profile in the soil.  This effective &quot;field of
view&quot;
varies, being somewhat larger (smaller) for higher (lower) energy sources.  Also, activity that
is closer to the soil surface will produce a wider field of view.  In effect, a field spectrum
samples an area of several hundred square meters, thus averaging out the local inhomogeneities
in the distribution of the radionuclides.  The source being measured is essentially a giant soil
sample and counting statistics for a given spectral absorption peak are obtained in a fraction of
the time required for counting a small collected sample.<p>


A good practice to follow is to make a series of short measurements in an area to ensure that
there is approximate uniformity before collecting a longer spectrum and obtaining the desired
counting statistics.  When making measurements of natural background, or when the exposure
rate is dominated by the man-made emitters under study, this check can be performed with an
ionization chamber or a suitably sensitive survey ratemeter in that uniform exposure rate
readings would imply a spatially invariant source distribution relative to the detector.  If the
particular radionuclides under study contribute just a small fraction to the total exposure rate,
then the corresponding peak area count rates should be checked with the spectrometer to
ensure uniformity.<p>

<h1><center><b>SPECIAL APPARATUS</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>



<b>1.     TLD phosphors: </b><p>

<i>Lithium fluoride dosimeters</i> - <sup>7</sup>LiF:Mn,Ti chips are used for most
applications.  They are 3.2 x
3.2 x 0.89 mm, 24 mg chips manufactured by Harshaw/Bicron Co., 6801 Cochran Rd., Solon,
OH  44139-3395 (TLD-700).<p>



<i>Aluminum oxide dosimeters</i> - Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:C chips are presently used
only for research purposes.  They
are 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick and are manufactured by Victoreen, Inc., 6000 Cochran
Rd., Solon, OH  44139-3395 (Model 2600-80).<p>



<i>Calcium fluoride chips and bulb dosimeters</i> - EML's historical experience has included
bulb-type
dosimeters and other types of chips such as CaF<sub>2</sub>:Mn (Gulbin and de Planque, 1983;
de Planque,
1984); however, these phosphors are not presently in use and will not be covered here.<p>


<b>2.     Annealing equipment:</b><p>

<i>High temperature furnace</i>- A furnace with constant temperature capability up to
1000&#176;C
(manufactured by Blue M Electric Co., Blue Island, IL  60406) is used for high temperature
annealing.  A controlled atmosphere oven (manufactured by GS Lindberg/Blue M., Watertown,
WI) has recently been installed for research.<p>



<i>Low temperature furnace</i> - This furnace is maintained at 100&#176;C for low temperature
annealing
(manufactured by Fisher Isotemp, Pittsburgh, PA  15219).<p>


<i>Planchet</i> - An EML-designed, platinum-plated copper planchet is used for chip annealings. 
The
tray is indented so that chips may be identified by placement (see <u>Figure 1</u>).<p>


<i>Brass heat sink</i> - A brass heat sink, 5-x-5-x-21 cm, is mounted on an aluminum base that is
placed on steel unistrut bars to allow uniform cooling of chips (see <a href="3_9.gif">Figure
1</a>).<p>


<b>3.     Controlled lighting:</b><p>

<i>Gold fluorescent lights</i> with no ultraviolet emissions.<p>


<i>Dark room shades.</i><p>


<i>Incandescent bulbs</i>, including a 25-W red bulb for minimal lighting.<p>

<b>4.     Cs-137 source:</b><p>

A 2 Ci collimated NIST traceable Cs-137 source is used for calibration.  Usual exposure distance
is
2 m, where the beam is uniform within a radius of at least 3.0 cm.<p>



<b>5.     TLD readers:</b><p>

The TLD reader room is air-conditioned to maintain a constant temperature (~ 68&#176;F)
year-round. 
Three TLD readers are presently in use:<p>



<i>EML reader</i> - This reader was built by EML and has been in use since 1971.  It uses linear
pan
heating and measures the TL signal with a high-gain, low-noise photomultiplier tube cooled to
15&#176;C below room temperature.  An internal light source is used to verify the electronic
stability of
the system.  Power is applied to a heating element silver-soldered to a thin silver heater pan.  The
chip is positioned manually and centered in the pan by a removable platinum-plated, stainless-steel
disk with a central hole for the TLD.  This disk suppresses the infrared signal from the heater pan
and provides a reproducible geometry for chip placement.  Heating parameters are adjustable up
to a maximum temperature of about 550&#176;C.  Purified nitrogen gas flows through the
heating
chamber at a rate of about 2.4 L/min to suppress any nonradiation induced TL signal.  A strip
chart records the glow curve and temperature profile with a selected glow peak region of interest
indicated by pen offsets.  The integral &quot;counts&quot; in this region is indicated on a
numerical display.<p>



<i>Victoreen Model 2800M</i> - A commercially available reader with many of the same
features as the
EML reader using updated technology, it will eventually replace the aging EML reader.  Readout
data can be sent to a printer or personal computer.<p>


<i>Automatic hot gas reader (TNO)</i> - Built by Radiologische Dienst TNO at the Netherlands
Organization for Applied Research.  This reader is different from the other two, both in heating
methods and chip handling.  It uses three jets of preheated nitrogen gas (about 190&#176;C
constant
temperature, not a linear profile) for reproducibility and speed.  Chips are handled automatically at
a rate of 150 per hour up to 1000 chip readings.  Readout parameters and output are controlled
and stored by a personal computer.  This reader is especially suitable for large-scale studies and
routine monitoring.<p>


<b>6.     Lead shield:</b><p>

A 10-cm thick lead shield is used to store TLDs after preparation or before readout.<p>

<h1><center><b>DEPLOYMENT OF TLDs</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>



<h2><b><center>1.  PREDEPLOYMENT PREPARATION OF CHIPS</b></h2><p>

</center>

     <b>A.  Batch preselection.</b><p>


Before chips are to be used for measurements, a set (typically 200 to 300 chips) from a single
manufacturing batch is tested for uniformity as follows:<p>


1.   Clean and anneal chips as described in Section B.<p>


2.   Give chips a single exposure to Cs-137 (typically on the order of 70 Gy in air, or 8
mR).<p>



3.   Read out the chips (see Table 1 for readout parameters).<p>


4.   Assign chips with readings that agree to within 30% of each other to the same group. 
Outliers should be flagged and removed from the group.  (Note: A tighter criterion of
5-10% may be used for special applications.)<p>


5.   Assign each chip a unique identification number to be permanently retained.<p>


     <b>B.  Cleaning/annealing.</b><p>

<p>

1.   Manually clean individual chips before each use with methanol and a cotton swab,
handling chips with forceps or a vacuum pen under appropriate lighting conditions (see
Table 1) (Freeswick and Shambon, 1970).<p>


2.   Anneal chips as follows:<p>
<ul>
     LiF: 1 h at 400&#176;C, 1-min cool-down on heat sink, followed by 2 h at 100&#176;C.<p>

     Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:  10 min at 300&#176;C.<p>

</ul>

3.    Cool chips to room temperature on heat sink.<p>



4.   Store chips in the lead shield if they are not going to be used immediately.  Keep
careful records of the date and time that the chips are placed in the lead shield, as well
as when they are removed for deployment.<p>


     <b>C.  Dosimeter packaging.</b><p>


Packaging should be light-tight, moisture proof, and thick enough to provide electronic
equilibrium and to shield against environmental beta radiation.  The EML dosimeter consists
of a commercially available black lucite box in which additional black lucite pieces have been
bonded in place to provide depressions for holding the individual chips (see <a
href="3_9.gif">Figure 1</a>).  It has
outside dimensions of 2.9 x 2.9 x 0.9 cm.  Each chip is surrounded by lucite with a minimum
thickness of 2.8 mm (about 320 mg/cm&#178;).  A dosimeter usually consists of five chips,
though
the container can hold up to 10 chips.  To ensure water-tightness, the lucite box is placed 
inside a thin plastic bag which is heat sealed or secured with fiber tape.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  ENVIRONMENTAL DEPLOYMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Environmental TLDs are usually deployed for 1-3 months.  A preselected uniform batch (see
Section 1A) with enough TLDs to cover at least three monitoring cycles is maintained
exclusively for use in environmental monitoring (i.e., while one set is in the field, there are
enough dosimeters for two replacement sets).  A set of environmental dosimeters for a
monitoring cycle includes six control dosimeters prepared with the field dosimeters, as
described in Section 1B.  All dosimeters are stored in the lead shield after preparation until
they can be deployed, noting date and time.  Two of the controls will be used to determine the
exposure rate in this shield (<tt> STORAGE CONTROLS</tt>) and are thus stored there for the
duration of
the field cycle.  The other four are used for calibration of the system (<TT>CALIBRATION
CONTROLS</tt>) and will be discussed in Section D of <a href="td03.htm">Readout and
Calibration</a>.<p>


If the field site is far from the laboratory, it is necessary to use additional controls to account
for exposure received in transit (<tt>TRANSIT CONTROLS</tt>).  These controls must be kept
with the
field dosimeters at all times except during field deployment, when they must be kept
somewhere where the exposure rate is known or can be measured independently.<p>



The dosimeter is hung 1 m above the ground, away from large structures that may provide
shielding or additional exposure (see <a href="3_11.gif">Figure 2</a>).  Usually the
dosimeter is left hanging freely to
rotate in the wind for isotropic angular exposure.  At the end of the field cycle, the dosimeters
are returned to the lead shield until they are read out, and a replacement set is deployed in the
field.<p>

<h1><center><b>READOUT AND CALIBRATION</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>


     <b>A.  Reader checkout.</b><p>

1.   Prepare the reader for use by setting the appropriate reader parameters as shown in
<a href="td02.htm#TB1">Table 1</a>.<p>


2.   Check the reader's dark current, the heating chamber current (background of empty
chamber), and the response of the reader to the internal light source.<p>



3.   Readout a test chip several times to check for anomalous results.<p>


     <b>B.  Preread annealing.</b><p>


1.   Remove the FIELDdosimeters from the lead shield, noting the date and time.<p>


2.   Perform a preread anneal for LiF chips at 100&#176;C for 10 min.  (No preread anneal is
used for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> chips.)<p>



     <b>C.  Initial readout.</b><p>


1.   Read out <b>one </b>chip from each FIELD dosimeter.  After it returns to room
temperature,
the chip is read a second time to measure the background of the system.<p>



2.   Temporarily discontinue readout at this point to prepare the calibration dosimeters.<p>


     <b>D.  Calibration.</b><p>


Four dosimeters are used to calibrate the system during readout.  Two of these are from the
set originally prepared at the start of the field cycle, and two are taken from the set of
replacement dosimeters just prepared.  Thus, while each prepared set includes four calibration
dosimeters,
two will be used right away to calibrate the returning field set and the other two are stored in
the lead shield for the duration of the field cycle to be used at the following readout.  The
calibration is performed as follows:<p>


1.   Examine the range of reader net counts from the initial readout of each field dosimeter
to determine the calibration exposures to use.  Choose three calibration exposures to
bracket the readings given by the field dosimeters and to provide a check on the
linearity of the system.  (The approximate counts per unit exposure is known from
previous readouts.)<p>


2.   Remove the CALIBRATION CONTROLS from the lead shield, noting the date and time
of
retrieval.<p>


3.   Give one CALIBRATION CONTROL an exposure that is expected to yield net counts in
the
range of the lowest result found for the field dosimeters.  Another CALIBRATION
CONTROL is given an exposure corresponding to the highest reading, and the other two
receive an exposure in the middle of this range.<p>


     <b>E.  Resuming readout.</b><p>



1.   Remove the STORAGE CONTROL dosimeters from the lead shield, noting the date and
time.<p>



2.   Anneal all of the control dosimeters in the case of LiF TLDs (the four CALIBRATION
CONTROLS as well as the two STORAGE CONTROLS) for 10 min at 100&#176;C.<p>



3.   Intersperse the STORAGE CONTROL and CALIBRATION CONTROL dosimeters
among the
field dosimeters.  Read out one chip from each dosimeter before going to the next chip
in any dosimeter.  (This provides a QC check against any variations in the system
during readout.)<p>

<h1><center><b>ANALYSIS OF RESULTS</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>


An interactive program that runs on a personal computer (written in Fortran) handles the data
analysis.  A sample input file is shown in Table1.  It includes for each dosimeter:  date and
times of preparation, deployment, return, and readout; gross counts; background counts; and
time of exposure to the cesium source.  The program determines the field exposure by
correcting for exposure received in storage as measured by the storage controls and then
converting counts to exposure by using the calibration controls.  The user is given the option
of rejecting outliers, and the statistical error is propagated throughout each step in the
calculation.  The program returns the net field exposure and exposure rate and the field
deployment time for each field dosimeter.  It also gives information about the exposure rate in
storage, the calibration factor, and any rejected readings.  A sample output file is shown in
Table 2.  Details of the calculations are given below.<p>


     <b>A.  Computing net counts and standard error.</b><p>

<p>

The mean net counts for each dosimeter is:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq1.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     x<sub>i</sub> = gross counts - background counts of<i> i</i>th chip, and<p>

     n  = number of chips per dosimeter<i> (n = 5 usually)</i>.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The standard error of the mean for each dosimeter is:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq2.gif"><p></ul>

<p>

     <b>B.  Outlier check.</b><p>


The program checks for outliers among the individual chip readings in a dosimeter.  Two
different criteria are used:<p>


1.   <i>"Extreme Values" - </i>Individual chip net counts that are &gt; 150% or &lt; 50% of
the
dosimeter average <b>X </b>are flagged.  This test would find missing chips or noise spikes.<p>


2.   <i>"r Test"</i> - This is an outlier test for gaussian distributions (Proschan, 1969).  The
net
counts for the five chips are ranked in order of smallest to the largest, such as x<sub>1</sub>, 
x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>,
x<sub>4</sub>, x<sub>5</sub>.  If the ratio r = (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>) &#247;
(x<sub>5</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>) is larger than 0.780, chip x<sub>1</sub> is flagged. 
Similarly if the ratio r = (x<sub>5</sub> - x<sub>4</sub>) &#247; (x<sub>5</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub>) is larger than 0.780, chip x<sub>5</sub> is flagged. 
This is a more sensitive test that can identify outliers that would be missed by the
extreme value test.  While it is redundant for values beyond 150% of the mean, it could
miss the very low extreme values so both tests are needed.  (Proschan describes more
sensitive tests to apply when more than 7 chips are used.)<p>



In either criterion, the user is then given the option of omitting flagged chips from the
analysis.  No chips are automatically rejected: the final decision is made by the user.  (In
practice data are rarely rejected, and then usually for obvious reasons.)  If a chip is rejected,
the mean net counts and standard error are recalculated for that dosimeter, and a note appears
in the output file.<p>


     <b>C.  Storage exposure rate correction factor.</b><p>

<ul><img src="td04eq3.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     S    =  storage correction factor,<p>

     X<sub>SC1</sub>     =  mean net counts for STORAGE CONTROL #1,<p>

     X<sub>SC2</sub>     =  mean net counts for STORAGE CONTROL #2, and<p>

     t<sub>SC</sub> =    time storage controls were in lead shield <i>(calculated by
subroutine from dates
in input file)</i>.<p>
</ul>


The standard error is propagated through this calculation as:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq4.gif"><p></ul>

With err<sub>SC1</sub> and err<sub>SC2</sub> being the standard error of the storage
controls as defined in Section A
above.  (The error associated with the storage time is negligible, estimated at &lt; 0.01%.)<p>



     <b>D.  Calibration factor.</b><p>

<ul><img src="td04eq5.gif"><p></ul>

where <p>

<ul>

     C    =  calibration factor,<p>

     X<sub>CCi</sub>     =  mean net counts of CALIBRATION CONTROL #<i>i</i>,<p>

     t<sub>CCi</sub>     =    time<i> i</i>th CALIBRATION CONTROL was kept in
lead shield <i>(calculated by
subroutine from dates in input file)</i>, and<p>

exposure<sub>CCi</sub>   =    cesium exposure given to<i> i</i>th calibration control
<i>(calculated from decay
corrected known source strength and time of exposure)</i>.<p>

</ul>

The standard error propagated through this calculation is then:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq6.gif"><p></ul>

(Uncertainties in cesium calibration exposure are treated as systematic rather than statistical
errors and are treated separately.)<p>



The program also performs a linear regression on the corrected counts vs. exposure for the
four calibration dosimeters.  The goodness of fit is a check on the linearity of the system and
the slope may be compared to <b>C</b>.<p>


     <b>E.  Field exposure.</b><p>


     The field site exposure (f) is a function of the quantities calculated above.  The
algorithm used by the program to calculate field site exposure may be summarized as:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq7.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>
     X<sub>F</sub>  =    mean field dosimeter counts, and<p>



     t<sub>F</sub>  =    time field dosimeters were kept in lead shield<i> (calculated
by subroutine
from dates in input file)</i>.<p>

</ul>

     <b>F.  Error analysis.</b><p>


<center>Total uncertainty = statistical error at 95% confidence + estimated systematic
error</center>
<p>


While the standard error was propagated through all the above calculations using the analytical
propagation of error formulas, for the last step it is easier to calculate the statistical error
numerically as shown below (Bevington and Robinson, 1992).<p>


<ul><img src="td04eq8.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     2.776     =    95% confidence interval for 5 chips (4 degrees of freedom)<p>

<img src="td04eq9.gif">
<img src="td04eq10.gif">   
<img src="td04eq11.gif"><p>

</ul>
Systematic error is estimated on a case-by-case basis and added linearly to the statistical error for
reporting the final results.  The estimated systematic uncertainty associated with EML's cesium
source is 2.5%.<p>

     <b>G.  Situations involving transit controls.</b><p>

In cases where TRANSIT CONTROLS are required, the field exposure (Section E) calculation
would instead be: <p>

<ul><img src="td04eq12.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>
     T =  mean TRANSIT dosimeter counts corrected for exposure received in storage.<p>
</ul>
If it happens that the TRANSIT CONTROLS are stored in the same lead shield as the other
storage controls during the field cycle (time = t<sub>F</sub>), then 

<ul><img src="td04eq13.gif"><P></ul>

where <p>
<ul>
      X<sub>T</sub> =  mean TRANSIT dosimeter counts.<p>
</ul>
More likely the TRANSIT CONTROLS will be stored in a different lead shield near the field site,
in which case the storage exposure must be measured by some other means.<p>

<p>



<b>1.     TLD phosphors: </b><p>

<i>Lithium fluoride dosimeters</i> - <sup>7</sup>LiF:Mn,Ti chips are used for most
applications.  They are 3.2 x
3.2 x 0.89 mm, 24 mg chips manufactured by Harshaw/Bicron Co., 6801 Cochran Rd., Solon,
OH  44139-3395 (TLD-700).<p>



<i>Aluminum oxide dosimeters</i> - Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:C chips are presently used
only for research purposes.  They
are 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick and are manufactured by Victoreen, Inc., 6000 Cochran
Rd., Solon, OH  44139-3395 (Model 2600-80).<p>



<i>Calcium fluoride chips and bulb dosimeters</i> - EML's historical experience has included
bulb-type
dosimeters and other types of chips such as CaF<sub>2</sub>:Mn (Gulbin and de Planque, 1983;
de Planque,
1984); however, these phosphors are not presently in use and will not be covered here.<p>


<b>2.     Annealing equipment:</b><p>

<i>High temperature furnace</i>- A furnace with constant temperature capability up to
1000&#176;C
(manufactured by Blue M Electric Co., Blue Island, IL  60406) is used for high temperature
annealing.  A controlled atmosphere oven (manufactured by GS Lindberg/Blue M., Watertown,
WI) has recently been installed for research.<p>



<i>Low temperature furnace</i> - This furnace is maintained at 100&#176;C for low temperature
annealing
(manufactured by Fisher Isotemp, Pittsburgh, PA  15219).<p>


<i>Planchet</i> - An EML-designed, platinum-plated copper planchet is used for chip annealings. 
The
tray is indented so that chips may be identified by placement (see <u>Figure 1</u>).<p>


<i>Brass heat sink</i> - A brass heat sink, 5-x-5-x-21 cm, is mounted on an aluminum base that is
placed on steel unistrut bars to allow uniform cooling of chips (see <a href="3_9.gif">Figure
1</a>).<p>


<b>3.     Controlled lighting:</b><p>

<i>Gold fluorescent lights</i> with no ultraviolet emissions.<p>


<i>Dark room shades.</i><p>


<i>Incandescent bulbs</i>, including a 25-W red bulb for minimal lighting.<p>

<b>4.     Cs-137 source:</b><p>

A 2 Ci collimated NIST traceable Cs-137 source is used for calibration.  Usual exposure distance
is
2 m, where the beam is uniform within a radius of at least 3.0 cm.<p>



<b>5.     TLD readers:</b><p>

The TLD reader room is air-conditioned to maintain a constant temperature (~ 68&#176;F)
year-round. 
Three TLD readers are presently in use:<p>



<i>EML reader</i> - This reader was built by EML and has been in use since 1971.  It uses linear
pan
heating and measures the TL signal with a high-gain, low-noise photomultiplier tube cooled to
15&#176;C below room temperature.  An internal light source is used to verify the electronic
stability of
the system.  Power is applied to a heating element silver-soldered to a thin silver heater pan.  The
chip is positioned manually and centered in the pan by a removable platinum-plated, stainless-steel
disk with a central hole for the TLD.  This disk suppresses the infrared signal from the heater pan
and provides a reproducible geometry for chip placement.  Heating parameters are adjustable up
to a maximum temperature of about 550&#176;C.  Purified nitrogen gas flows through the
heating
chamber at a rate of about 2.4 L/min to suppress any nonradiation induced TL signal.  A strip
chart records the glow curve and temperature profile with a selected glow peak region of interest
indicated by pen offsets.  The integral &quot;counts&quot; in this region is indicated on a
numerical display.<p>



<i>Victoreen Model 2800M</i> - A commercially available reader with many of the same
features as the
EML reader using updated technology, it will eventually replace the aging EML reader.  Readout
data can be sent to a printer or personal computer.<p>


<i>Automatic hot gas reader (TNO)</i> - Built by Radiologische Dienst TNO at the Netherlands
Organization for Applied Research.  This reader is different from the other two, both in heating
methods and chip handling.  It uses three jets of preheated nitrogen gas (about 190&#176;C
constant
temperature, not a linear profile) for reproducibility and speed.  Chips are handled automatically at
a rate of 150 per hour up to 1000 chip readings.  Readout parameters and output are controlled
and stored by a personal computer.  This reader is especially suitable for large-scale studies and
routine monitoring.<p>


<b>6.     Lead shield:</b><p>

A 10-cm thick lead shield is used to store TLDs after preparation or before readout.<p>

<h2><b>1.  SCOPE</B></h2><p>

The table of beta emitters presented here is useful in identifying unknown beta emitters whose
energies and possibly half-lives have been determined by standard laboratory techniques,
including the <a href="ac01.htm">Harley-Hallden method</a>.  It is also a handy guide
to beta emitting isotopes for applications requiring specific half-lives and/or energies.

The original table was developed by Hallden (1955).  Since that time there have been three
revisions based on &quot;current&quot; published compilations.  The present table was compiled
from the Table of Isotopes (Lederer and Shirley, 1978).<p>

The emitter energy listings are the maximum beta energy (E<sub>max</sub>).  Isotopes decaying
the the emission of beta particles of different energies are listed in the energy group corresponding
to each E<sub>max</sub> provided that the branch contributes > 5% of the total beta emission. 
Isotopes with longer-lived parents are also listed under the parent half-life.  In the case of multiple
long-lived parents, the nuclide is listed under the half-life of the nearest long-lived parent, as well
as its own half-life.<p>

<h1><b>RADON, THORON, AND PROGENY EXPOSURE FACILITY</b></h1><p>
<hr><p>

<h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>


The EML radon, thoron, and progeny exposure facility consists of a walk-in chamber that is used
for research, testing, calibration, and for the evaluation of measuring instruments.<p>

The new 30 m&#179; chamber, installed in 1993, provides for a well-controlled, clean, airtight,
and uniform test environment.  Research with inert aerosols and other pollutants can also be
carried out. <a href="sect6/6_2.gif">Figure 1</a> shows the major features of the exposure
facility.<p>


<p>
<h2><b>2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPOSURE FACILITY</b></h2><p>

<b>A.  Radon and thoron gas sources.</b><p>

Radon is generated from a Pylon (Model RN-1025, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) Ra-226 source
with 3810 kBq of radium.  The source is sealed hermetically inside a container located on top of
the chamber.  The injection of radon into the mixing chamber is computer controlled to obtain the
desired concentrations of radon inside the main chamber. <p>

Thoron is generated from a Pylon (Model TH-1025)  Th-228 source.  The strength of the source
was 1960 kBq at the time of acquisition.  The source has to be recharged every 5 yr because of its
short half-life.  The thoron generator can be installed in different locations inside the main
chamber in order to achieve the desired airborne thoron concentrations.<p>

<b>B.  Design characteristics of the chamber.</b><p>

A schematic diagram of the chamber is shown in <a href="sect6/6_2.gif">Figure 1</a>.  The
interior dimensions of the main exposure room are 3.3 m x 3.83 m x 2.59 m with a total volume
of 30.75 m&#179;.  The wall panels are made of enameled aluminum on the exterior, and 22
gauge stainless steel on the inside.  The floor is constructed of 16 gauge stainless steel.  The
floors, walls, and ceiling are insulated to ensure minimum heating and cooling requirements.<p>

The mixing room has a volume of 3.5 m&#179;.  The anteroom, which has a volume of 5.8
m&#179;,  serves as a means to transfer instruments in and out of the main chamber and as a
buffer between the main chamber and the adjacent laboratory space.  Two viewing windows, with
triple panes, are located on the west wall.  On the same wall there are 10 sampling ports that are
10 cm in diameter at a height of 1 m off the floor.  A two-way audio system is provided for
communication purposes. <p>

<b>C.  Environmental control characteristics.</B><p>

The environmental conditioning system (Fidelity Engineering, Hunt Valley, MD) consists of the
following systems: refrigeration, heating, humidification, dehumidification, air delivery, control,
and pressurization air.<p>

The refrigeration system consists of a single air-cooled condensing unit, two refrigeration
evaporator coils, and a refrigerant piping network.  The cooling coils are made of copper with
aluminum fins;  the refrigerant is HCFC-22.  All of the elements of the air conditioning system are
constructed to minimize contamination.  The compressor, condenser coils receiver, and filter
dryer are located outside the chamber, adjacent to the mixing room.  The evaporator coils are
inside the mixing room.  The temperature in the main test chamber can be controlled from
5&#176;C - 40&#176;C.  The difference in temperature anywhere within the chamber is no more
than 1&#176;C.<p>

For humidification of the environment, water vapor is generated by an evaporative type system
which is installed inside the mixing room.  The system runs hot water across a screen-like surface
and allows the water to evaporate into the air.  The temperature of the water is kept below
boiling.  Dehumidification is accomplished by a refrigeration coil that becomes active only on call. 
It is isolated by a damper for the defrost cycle to avoid reintroduction of humidity during
defrosting.  The humidity is variable between a minimum that is determined by a -10&#176;C dew
point temperature and a maximum of 95%.  The humidity inside the chamber is controlled to
within 2 units of the set point during steady conditions.<p>

The environmental conditioning system also has a hydronic hot water system located outside the
test chamber.  It consists of a small glass electric hot water heater of about 2000 W, a water
circulation pump, a diaphragm expansion tank, and a filter.  The hot water system is used to heat
the test chamber air as needed. <p>

The air delivery system, located in the mixing room, uses an in-line axial fan that can deliver a
maximum of 30 m&#179;/min.  A typical operating range is 3-10 m&#179;/min.  In addition, a
filtered pressurization air system is used to create a slight positive pressure in the main chamber to
prevent uncontrolled infiltration. <p>

<b>D.  Aerosol generator systems.</b><p>

A TSI Model 3470 condensation monodisperse aerosol generator (TSI, St. Paul, MI) located
outside the main chamber, is used to produce particles of the desired concentration and size. 
Vaporized Carnauba wax condenses on NaCl nuclei to produce monodisperse aerosols with a
geometric standard deviation of around 1.1 or less.  The concentration of the aerosols inside the
test chamber can be controlled from 1,000 to 30,000 cm&#179;.  If polydisperse aerosols are
desired, the concentration can be increased to more than 100,000/cm&#179;.  The generated
aerosols are injected through a sampling port hole into the main chamber.  Aerosols from a
burning candle, an electric heater, a kerosene lamp, or from cigarette smoke, can be generated
individually or in combination by placing the generators inside the test chamber.  The particle
concentration inside the main chamber without any generated aerosol is &lt; 200 cm&#179;.<p>

<b>E.  Aerosol and vapor monitoring systems.</b><p>

The aerosol concentration inside the main chamber is measured with an Environment One Rich
Model 200 condensation nucleus counter, or a TSI Model 3025 ultra-fine particle counter.  The
size distribution of the test aerosol is measured with a TSI scanning mobility particle sizer.  A
Bruel & Kjaer Multi-gas Monitor Type 1302 is used to measure key organic pollutants.  The
detection limit depends on the type of pollutant and ranges from 0.001 - 1.0 ppm.<p>

<b>F.  Radon control and monitoring systems.</b><p>

The concentration of radon, thoron and progeny is regulated by adjusting the output from the
radon generator.  Radon is measured with two continuous scintillation cell monitors (cell volume
= 0.096 and 3.3 L).  The monitors are interfaced to a computer located at the control panel
outside the chamber.  The calibration and the accuracy of the radon monitors are based on
intercomparisons made with <a href="sf02.htm">pulse ionization chambers</a>.  The data are
logged to a computer at 15-min intervals, and may be recalled at any time.  Radon and thoron
concentrations in the main chamber are adjustable in the range from 100 - 5000 Bq/m&#179;, and
50 - 5000 Bq/m&#179;, respectively. <p>

The radon and thoron progeny concentrations are regulated by the dilution of the parent gases
and by the presence of aerosols.  The progeny concentrations are measured inside the main
chamber by grab, integrating, and continuous monitoring devices.  The standard monitoring
instruments for radon and thoron progeny are the AlphaSmart-760 (Alpha Nuclear, Missisauga,
Ontario, Canada) and the GRI-1100 monitor.  The analyses for the individual radon and thoron
progeny and the potential alpha energy concentrations are performed using the methods of
Thomas (1972), Nazaroff (1983), and Raabe and Wrenn (1969).  All three methods are
computerized and the data are available on an hourly basis.  The concentrations in the main
chamber range from 5.6 E-9 J/m&#179; to 1.4 E-5 J/m&#179; for radon progeny, and 1 E-5 to 7
E-5 J/m&#179; for thoron progeny.<p>

Because of the capability to maintain the test chamber at less than 200 particle/cm&#179;,  the
equilibrium factor as low 0.01 is achievable.  At very high particle concentrations, an equilibrium
factor of 0.5 is obtainable.<p>

The sensors for temperature and humidity are located in the main test chamber and in the mixing
room.  The static pressure in the main chamber and the speed of the conditioned air exiting from
the mixing room are monitored continuously. The data are automatically logged on the control
computer.<p>

<b>G.  Radon progeny particle size distribution measurements.</b><p>

The test chamber particle size conditions can be measured with the micro-orifice uniform deposit
impactor (<a href="aer05.htm">MOUDI</a>), EML developed <a href="aer06.htm">screen
diffusion batteries</a>, and <a href="aer07.htm">graded screen array</a>.  When used in
combination,  these instruments can measure radon and thoron progeny particle sizes ranging
from 0.5 to 5000 nm (Tu and Knutson, 1994).<P>

<h1><b><center>CHEMISTRY CLEAN ROOM FACILITY</b></H1><p>

</center>
<HR><p>

<p>

<H2><center><b>1.  SCOPE</b></H2><p>


</center>
Presented here is a description of the clean room chemical laboratory that has been in
operation at EML since 1976.  The facility is used for low-level trace metal analyses of
biological and environmental samples for various on-going and past programs, such as,
metabolic balance studies, geochronology of pollution, and atmospheric transport and
deposition phenomena.<p>


Generally, these programs require the analyses to be performed in an ultraclean environment
because of the low concentrations found in many of the specimen.  Typically specimens of
urine, excreta, diet, fish, vegetation, air, filters, water (tap, lake, rain), sediments, and soil
have been analyzed for more than 20 environmentally significant trace metals.<p>


<p>

<H2><center><b>2.  FACILITY LAYOUT</b></H2><p>

</center>


A diagram of the facility, its equipment, and instrumentation is shown in <A
HREF="sect6/6_4.gif">Figure 1</A>.  Note that
one entry serves as the change room and also houses the air handling system.  The other entry
houses the gas cylinders that are required by the instruments.<p>



<p>

<h2><b><center>3.  AIR CLEANING SYSTEM</b></h2><p>

</center>


Clean air is supplied to the room through 16 high efficiency particulate air filters suspended
directly over the workbench, located in the center of the room.  This downward flow of air
maintains Class 100 conditions (as defined in Federal Standard 209B, 1973) at the top of the
workbench.  The same air flow maintains Class 2000 conditions in other areas of the facility. 
The air handler supplies sufficient clean air to maintain positive pressure in the clean room,
even with the fume hood and the furnace hood in operation.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>4.  MONITORING OF CLEAN ROOM OPERATION</b></h2><p>

</center>


To check that the facility is operating properly, particle concentrations are monitored with a
Royco particle counter.  In accordance with Federal Standard 209B, this counter is set to
measure the concentration of particles with diameters larger than 0.5 &#181;m.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>5.  PERMANENT APPARATUS</b></h2><p>


</center>
The clean room chemical laboratory is equipped for all stages of analysis, from sample
preparation to final measurements, of trace metals in various biological matrices.<p>


The clean room can produce both ultra pure deionized water and a sub-boiling distillation
apparatus.  The clean room is also equipped with a freezer, refrigerator, muffle, drying oven,
and several analytical balances.<p>

<h1><center><b>SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE FACILITY</b></h1<p>

</center>
<hr><p>

<p>

<h2><center><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>


</center>
This section describes EML's scanning electron microscope (SEM) facility.  The physical
layout of this facility is shown in <a href="sect6/6_5.gif">Figure 1</a>.  The SEM is used
to:<br>
 1) analyze aerosols collected
from the troposphere and the stratosphere (Kromidas et al., 1993);<br> 2) characterize
laboratory-generated aerosol; and<br> 3) analyze biological samples.  <p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  SAMPLE PREPARATION ROOM</b></h2><p>


</center>
The sample preparation room is maintained under clean-room conditions using high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) ceiling filters.  The air is recirculated and controlled with a system that
is independent of the building air delivery system.  There are two Class-100 benches to
provide additional cleanliness for sample preparation and for the preparation of sampling
equipment.  The first, an exhausting laminar bench (Advanced Purification Inc., Hauppauge,
NY 11788; Model G68-PD) allows the use of various solvents and provides a Class 100
environment for equipment setup and preparation of biological samples.  The second bench
(Laminar Flow Inc., Ivyland, PA  18974; special order) is a recirculating vertical laminar flow
system with two cartridges that contain molecular sieve 5A and activated charcoal.  These
cartridges remove substances from the airstream that may interfere with aerosols.  Such
interfering substances include ammonia, water vapor, and organics.  <p>

<p>


<h2><center><b>3.  MICROSCOPE ROOM</b></h2><p>


</center>
The microscope room is also maintained under clean-room conditions using HEPA ceiling
filters.<p>

<p>


<h3><center><b>3.1  Scanning Electron Microscope</b></h3><p>

</center>

The SEM is an AMRAY-1820 (AMRAY, Bedford, MA 01730) and has a 150-mm specimen
chamber and a resolution of 5 nm.  The SEM may be operated at low voltages (~1 kV), thus
allowing imaging of samples without prior preparation.  Microprocessor controlled operations
permit automatic image focusing and stigmation and provides push button digital magnification
from 25X- 400,000X at a 12 mm working distance.  However, just how much of this
magnification is usable depends heavily on the contrast characteristics of the sample.  The
SEM is supplied with a solid-state backscatter detector.  This detector produces images which
emphasize maximum atomic number differences.  The resulting image shows contrast
differences that can be related to differences in trace element composition.  The SEM is also
supplied with an X-ray/imaging system.  This system controls the sample
stage automatically and thus allows for unattended X-ray analyses, imaging, and sample
characterization of more than 100 different fields.<p>



The whole microscope assembly is isolated on a Micro-g vibration isolation table (TMC,
Peabody, MA  01960).<p>

<p>


<h3><center><b>3.2  Microanalysis System</b></h3><p>

</center>

The microanalysis system used in conjunction with the AMRAY 1820 SEM is the PGT IMIX
system with a two position light element Si(Li) energy dispersive spectrometer (Model 4200
EDS, Princeton Gamma-Tech, Princeton, NJ 08540).  The PGT IMIX system is equipped
with:<p>
<OL>
<li> An ultrahigh resolution 19-in color display,<p>

<li> Dec 11/73 high performance processor with floating point,<p>

<li> SPARC station 1+ (SUN Microsystems) with a built-in, 3 1/2&quot; floppy disk drive, 
external CD ROM drive, and a 1.27 gigabyte Fujitsu drive,<p>

<li> Two thousand channel data collection system,<p>

<li> Pulse processing electronics,<p>

<li> EDS X-ray analysis software,<p>

<li> Qualitative and quantitative analysis software,<p>

<li> Chemical classification software,<p>

 <li>     PGT beam control package,<p>

<li> Advanced feature analysis package, and<p>

<li> Mega plane option (800 x 1040 pixel image).<p>
</ol>
<p>

The microanalysis system allows detailed chemical and size classifications of samples.  In the
windowless mode, the model 4200 EDS allows the analysis of X-rays with energies down to
700 eV.  In this position, detection of B, C, N, and O is possible, as well as enhanced
detection of F, Na, Mg, and Al.  The PGT beam control package allows automated analysis of
specific points on a collection surface by controlling the scan coils of the microscope column. 
Up to 300 points can be automatically stored for later use.<p>


The PGT imaging system is connected to the Tissue Culture Facility via a video cable that is
attached to a CCD video camera and can capture images from the optical microscopes.<p>

<p>


<h3><center><b>3.3  Sample Critical Point Drying and Coating Equipment</b></h3><p>

</center>

The sample coating equipment consists of a Denton high vacuum evaporator (Denton Vacuum,
Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ 08003), an EFFA Carbon Coater (Ernest E. Fullam Co., Latham, NY 
12110; Model No. 12560), and a sputter coater (Polaron, Warrington, PA; Model E5000). 
The sputter coater is supplied with platinum, gold, and silver targets.  The carbon coater and
sputter coater, plus an optical microscope are housed in a vertical flow class 100 laminar clean
bench (Laminaire Corp., Rahway, NJ  07065; Model DWS-630).<p>


Critical point drying of biological samples is accomplished via the Balzers CPD 030 using
acetone as the transfer medium and liquid CO<sub>2</sub> as the transition liquid.  The CPD
030 is
located in the Sample Preparation Room with access to the exhaust laminar flow bench. <p>

<p>


<h2><center><b>4.  QUALITY CONTROL</b></h2><p>

</center>

When using an SEM, several things should be kept in mind.  The sampling process must be
conducted very carefully to provide the microscopist with a representative sample of the
material of interest.  Many methods of sampling introduce bias in that their collection
efficiency varies with particle size.  The internal environment of the microscope should also be
taken into account.  In order to function, the column is kept at a high vacuum (10<sup>-5</sup>
Torr) and
there can be large amounts of heat generated in the sample by electron bombardment.  These
conditions can alter or destroy susceptible samples.  Contamination is always a concern. 
Considering the size of the particles of interest, unless strict sample handling procedures are
followed, contributions from contaminating sources may outweigh the sample material.<p>

<h1><center><b>SEDIMENT</b></h1><p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>
<center>
<h2><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Discussed in this section are the methodologies used at EML for obtaining sediment cores
from inland lakes and reservoirs for reconstructing the deposition histories of energy-related
pollutants.  Topics included are the relationship of lake bathymetry to core quality, a general
description of the operation of the corer from our specially designed <a
href="sf08.html">catamaran</a>, and the procedures for extruding the cores.<p>

<P>
<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Lake and reservoir sediments offer unique substrates for investigating the occurrence of many
energy-related pollutants since they are the main &quot;sink&quot; for materials entering
watersheds and
may be dated by radioactive methods so as to provide a depositional history (MARC, 1985). 
Furthermore, accurate coring, e.g., minimal disturbance of sediments, is of great importance
to paleolimnological investigations, especially those aimed at reconstructing the deposition
history and/or inventories of pollutants deposited through atmospheric processes.  Errors
caused by a poorly performing coring system or by taking sediment cores from locations in
lakes that are not representative of atmospheric deposition (e.g., areas affected by sediment
focusing or excessive erosion) can often lead to an erroneous interpretation of actual events
(Heit and Miller, 1987).<p>



To properly assess geochronologies of sediments in a meaningful way, methodologies must be
available for taking large volume, undisturbed sediment cores, so that multiple parameter
analyses can be performed at critical core depths.  As stated in Burke (1968), for the
commonly used 4-7 cm diameter sediment corers, increased sample size can be obtained only
by homogenization of longer segments of core, with consequent blurring of stratigraphic
details. For isotopic dating procedures, the demand for really large samples (&gt;200 g wet
weight) presents an even more severe problem. Only by increasing the area of the column
sampled can one improve the sensitivity in the study of sediment horizons.  Unfortunately,
most larger area coring devices are of such size and weight that they can only be used on
oceanographic-sized vessels, making them unfit for studies of most lakes and reservoirs.<p>


As further stated in Burke (1968), the study of vertical profiles of the concentrations of fallout
radionuclides (which have been available for sedimentation only since the early 1950s in most
places) also demands efficient sampling of the topmost layers of sediments and their recovery
<i>in situ</i>.  Some evidence from studies of more conventionally collected cores indicates that
these
upper layers are commonly lost, either by washout at the top of the core tube or by being
swept away from the point of impact by the shock wave of rapidly falling corers (Sachs and
Raymond, 1965).  Also, as stated in McIntyre (1971), a peculiarity of many gravity corers is
that the length of the core retrieved may be considerably less than the penetration depth of the
core barrel into the sediment.  This is likely to cause a vertical redistribution of the sediment
and hence an erroneous chronology. Also core tubes having diameters &lt;10 cm are subject to
loss of surface sediment (McIntyre, 1971).<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

We have developed a large diameter (21 cm), slow penetration sediment corer, and a 27 ft (7
m) transportable research vessel (&quot;Sedimental Journey&quot;) to avoid the pitfalls
described above. 
This equipment, whose design and construction are described in detail in <a
href="sf08.html">Special Facilities, 
Work Boat and Tripod Corer</a>, has allowed us to take large volume, undisturbed cores from
many locations in
the U.S. and measure increments of sediment as small as 1 cm for a suite of toxic trace
substances and environmental tracers indicative of both natural and anthropogenic origins.  In
fact, sediment cores taken with the tripod-sphincter corer have been shown to be comparable in
quality to those taken with the much larger &quot;Soutar type&quot; box corers which, because
of their
size, can only be used successfully on oceanographic vessels (Burke et al., 1983).<p>


Examples of highly resolved sediment cores that can be obtained with our sediment sampling
equipment are shown in the following figures: <a href="2_13.gif">Figure 1</a>,  the
historic deposition pattern of Cs-137 from atmospheric weapons testing,  <a
href="2_11.gif">Figures 2</a>, the Cs-137 activity per unit area
(Bq/m&#178;) versus depth (cm) for sediment cores taken from Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY, and
<a href="2_12.gif">Figure 3</a>, the Cs-137 activity per unit area
(Bq/m&#178;) versus depth (cm) for sediment cores taken Deer Creek Reservoir, Provo, UT. 
Clearly, the Cs-137 distributions closely
follow the historic deposition pattern of Cs-137 from atmospheric weapons testing.
The two easily distinguished Cs-137 peaks follow the major cycles of fallout from
atmospheric weapons testing in 1959 and 1963.  Furthermore, there is a rapid drop of Cs-137
activity in sediments younger than 1963 following the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty between the
U.S. and U.S.S.R.  Lastly, the activity after the onset of atmospheric weapons testing follows
closely that of historic fallout patterns with little debris diffused or mixed below the depth
corresponding to 1951.<p>


Further confirmation of our ability to take quality cores with this system is shown by the use
of the SNAP-9A (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) Pu isotope signature.  In 1964, the
U.S. satellite, SNAP-9A, which used Pu-238 as a heat source for generating power,
disintegrated  after entering the atmosphere of the Southern Hemisphere.  As a result, there
was a sharp rise in the stratospheric concentration of Pu-238 relative to Pu-239+240 in 1964 in
the
Southern Hemisphere.  The pulse of Pu-238 from SNAP-9A did not reach the surface of the
Northern Hemisphere until 1966, at which time a distinct rise in the ratio of Pu-238 to
Pu-239+240
activity also occurred.  It is the increase in this ratio which is used as a geochronological
marker for establishing the year 1966 in a sediment core.  This is clearly shown in <a
href="2_14.gif">Figure 4 </a>
where the Pu-238/Pu-239+240 activity ratio increases between 13 and 11.5 cm deep in the
sediment
core from Cayuga Lake, NY.<p>


The remainder of this section is a description of the procedures that are used by EML to take
sediment cores from inland lakes and reservoirs using the <i>Sedimental Journey</i> and tripod
corer.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>4.  PROCEDURES</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

<center><h3><b>4.1  General Operation</b></h3><p>

</center>
<p>

Procedures for the preparation and operation of the <i>Sedimental Journey</i> are described in
detail
in <a href="sf08.html">Special Facilities, Work Boat and Tripod Corer</a>.  The basic coring
strategy is to launch the boat and
determine the best sampling sites through a bathymetric survey of the lake or reservoir, obtain
the cores, extrude the cores immediately after their retrieval, and, finally, remove the boat
from the water with the trailer.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h3><b>4.2  Bathymetric Survey</b></h3><p>

</center>
<p>

Bathymetric surveys are always conducted prior to coring since such data are usually not
available.  It has been our experience that even when bathymetry is available, it is usually
inaccurate or out of date and hence misleading.  This can be a severe problem because the lack
of accurate bathymetric data will almost certainly result in a failure to locate suitable coring
locations within a lake or reservoir.<p>


In general, it has been our aim to take replicate cores from those portions of lake basins which
are the least likely to be affected by processes known to disturb sediments, such as, excess
terrestrial runoff (erosion), sediment slumping, sediment resuspension, and sediment focusing
(Davis and Ford, 1982; Edgington and Robbins, 1977; Heit and Miller, 1987).  In this regard,
the bathymetric survey is used to select sites located in relatively large, hypolimnetic basins, as
far away as possible from shoreline areas prone to erosion.  Inlet and outlet areas, as well as
locations at the confluence of rivers or close to dams are also avoided.<p>


For our bathymetric survey work we use a Lowrance graph recorder sonar unit.  This device is
capable of accurately graphing a lake bottom to a depth of 300 m (900 ft).  Our location is
determined using a micrologic explorer Loran system.<p>

<center><h3><b>4.3  Sediment Sampling</b> </h3><p>

</center>
<p>

All of the sediment cores are taken with a sphincter corer with a tripod modification capable of
taking a 21 cm diameter, 90 cm long core.  The design and mechanics of the corer are
described in detail in <a href="sf08.html#SF08SEC4">Section 4, Tripod Corer</a> of Special
Facilities, Work Boat and Tripod Corer.<p>



The device uses the barrel and nose-cone of the original 21-cm sphincter corer (Burke, 1968),
but is mounted in a tripod.  The operation of
the sphincter is not changed by this design, the tripod frame only provides stability to keep the
corer in a vertical position while it penetrates.  This design also allows the corer to be lowered
to the bottom very slowly, with minimal sediment disturbance.  The core barrel is driven into
the sediment only by the force of weights mounted on the weight stand.
Varying the amount of this weight gives control over penetration into various sediment types. 
It should be noted that the tripod corer is &quot;manageable&quot; on small boats and is easily
disassembled for transporting or shipping.<p>


The corer is lowered at 100 m/min (75 m/min in fairly active weather) until it is 5
m from
the bottom (observable with the Sonar unit).  It is then slowed to 10 cm/min, or as slow as
the winch will operate, for placement on the bottom.  The feet of the tripod contact the
sediment first.  The barrel continues to descend, penetrating the sediment by the force of the
weights contained in the weight stand.  The core barrel stops its downward travel when the
weight stand comes in contact with the guide ring, or when the resistance of the sediment is
sufficient to stop the downward penetration. 
When the weight stand comes to a stop, the weight is taken off the spring-loaded release pin
and the pin retracts.  This should be
completed within 60 sec after the corer reaches the bottom.  The pull on the wire to retrieve
the corer begins immediately and closes the diaphragms of the core catcher and the top valve. 
Stress is taken off the closure wires by a stop which engages the bottom of the release
mechanism where force is exerted during retrieval.<p>


The corer is pulled out of the sediment at the slowest winch speed, or about
10 cm/min.  In the past, pullout forces have not exceeded 4450 N (1000 lb force) and are
generally somewhat lower.  After pullout the corer can be retrieved at a rate of
50 m/min.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h3><b>4.4.  Sediment Extrusion</b></h3><p>

</center>
<p>

More than one method has been employed to extrude sediments from the core barrels since
EML started coring in the early 1970s.  In all of these methods, the sediments are always
extruded immediately after retrieval.  Water retained above the core is siphoned or pipetted off
and may be reserved for analyses.  In most cases, contiguous 1 cm increments are taken from
the top of the core to &#126;40 cm, and 2 cm sections are taken thereafter.  The outer &#126;1
cm of
each layer of sediment is always discarded, resulting in &#126;19 cm diameter sections.  We have
found that if this outer ring of sediment is not eliminated, contamination may result from
surface sediments &quot;dragging down&quot; to subsurface depths via friction with the core
barrel wall
or through other physical processes.  Lastly, glassware and covers used for sample storage are
prewashed with 1:1 HNO<sub>3</sub>, rinsed with double-deionized water, followed by acetone
and
methyl-alcohol washes.  All of the glassware is dried and sealed under laminar flow clean
stations until the time of use.  Precleaned glass jars are used, which can be obtained from
several suppliers.<p>


Prior to extrusion, the length of the core and its distance from the top of the barrel are
measured and noted.  After the excess water is removed by siphon or pipette, the sediment is
then carefully removed in 1 cm increments with a large Teflon-coated spoon bent into an
&quot;L&quot;
shape.  The accuracy of this procedure is ensured by placing the sediment in precalibrated 16-oz
(500 mL) wide-mouth glass jars, and noting the actual extrusion depth relative to the initial
location of the top of the core as measured immediately after core retrieval.  In addition, the
core barrels are marked at 5 cm increments for further calibration.  Thus, errors in extrusion
are identified.<p>


Once the surface sediment is removed, the remaining sediment is usually firm and is not easily
disturbed.  The rest of the core can be sectioned in the following manner.  A stainless steel
piston is fitted inside the top of the core barrel and contacts the sediment.  While this piston is
held in place, the core is laid down on its side, the bottom core catcher is removed, and
another piston is placed into the bottom of the core.  The core is then listed upright again and
placed on an extruding stand.  Next, the top piston is removed and the bottom one is pushed
up through the core barrel until the sediment becomes flush with the top of the barrel.  The
remainder of the sediment is extruded at 1 to 2 cm intervals by pulling the barrel down to
designated marks on the attached scale.  The outer ring is removed from the protruding
sediment; the rest of the interval is sliced and packed into sampling jars.  Sediment is sectioned
in this way to a desired depth or to the bottom of the core.  A description of the construction
and design of the extruder used to section the core is given in 4.4, Core Extruder of <a
href="sf08.html#SF08SEC4">Section 4, Tripod Corer</a> in Special Facilities, Work Boat and
Tripod Corer.


The reproducibility of this technique is demonstrated in <a href="2_15.gif">Figure 5</a>,
which compares the Cs-137
distribution in two sediment cores (A and B), taken from separate but nearby locations (within
0.5 km) in Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY.  Although the sedimentation rate was slightly different
for the two locations (Heit et al. 1986), as would be expected from bathymetric variations
within a lake basin, even for nearby locations, the Cs-137 distribution patterns were remarkably
similar with only small differences occurring among the major peaks which represent fallout
from atmospheric weapons testing in 1959 and 1963.  This agreement (&#177; 2 cm) between the
patterns of Cs-137 distributed in these independent cores attests to the reproducibility of our
current method of sediment extrusion.<p>

<h1><b><center>CHESTER REGIONAL BASELINE STATION</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr><p>

<p>

<h2><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>


The location, site characteristics, and permanent facilities of the field station operated by EML
at Chester, NJ, are described here.  The station is used by EML as a site for environmental
research and for field testing of environmental instruments.  Both short- and long-term
research and testing programs are carried out, but our purpose here is to describe the site and
the facilities - not the programs.  Reports on the programs can be found in a series of USDOE
Reports, and the latest publication in the series is USDOE Report EML-538.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  LOCATION</b></h2><p>



</center>
The EML Regional Baseline Station, henceforth called EML/Chester, is located about 64 km
west of the Laboratory, on the grounds of the Chester, NJ, unit of Bell Communications
Research (BCR).  Table 1 shows the latitude, longitude, and elevation of EML/Chester, and
the distance to nearby areas.  Table 2 gives the distance and direction from EML/Chester to
major metropolitan areas.  Similar information for coal-burning electric generating stations is
shown in Table 3.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>3.  LOCAL TERRAIN, SOIL, AND VEGETATION</b></h2><p>



</center>
<a href="6_12.gif">Figure 1</a> is an aerial photograph showing EML/Chester and the
surrounding area.  The view is
westward, across the station which is the fenced rectangular area in the center foreground.  It
is seen that the general environs consist of rolling hills, with a mixture of fields and woods.<p>



The ground slopes at about 12% from the upper right to the lower left (NW to SE).  The
research station is located about 200 m south and about 10 m below the nearest high ground.<p>


The figure also shows that the research station is located at the southern edge of a cleared field,
with a wooded area about 15 m to the south.  There is also a wooded area about 75 m to the
north-northeast.  To the west, the direction of the prevailing winds, there is a fetch of about
150 m to the line of trees along Dover-Chester Road.  The trees in all cases are deciduous and
their average height is about 15 m.<p>



The cleared area around the station is grass-covered.  BCR personnel keep the grass cut to a
height not exceeding 20 cm.  The grass within the station fence is kept to about 10 cm by
cutting with conventional power lawn mowers (also by BCR personnel).<p>


Information of the radionuclide content of the soil at EML/Chester can be found in EML-347
(1978, p. 146).<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>4. SITE CHARACTERISTICS AND PERMANENT
FACILITIES</b></h2><p>


</center>
EML/Chester is situated on a 15.2 x 61 m area of ground, and is surrounded by a 2.4 m high
chain-link fence.  The fence provides additional security for the site. (The first line of security
is provided by the fact that the site is on property owned by BCR.)<p>


<a href="6_13.gif">Figure 2</a> is a plan view of EML/Chester.  A 2.4 x 6 m enclosed
trailer serves as a
communications center and staging area for experiments at the research station.  Electric
service totaling 45 kW is brought into the trailer via underground cables; both 120 and 240 V
are available.  The trailer's interior is temperature-controlled to protect the most delicate
equipment.<p>



A computer link using commercial telephone lines is available between the EML/Chester site
and the Laboratory in New York.  This provides semicontinuous communication, particularly
important after installation of new or critical experiments and to promptly alert the researchers
to events of interest or problems.<p>


Six redwood platforms are provided for mounting long- and short-term outdoor experiments. 
Each platform has electric service and wiring for data communications.  High volume aerosol
samplers and an environmental Rn monitor are examples of the experiments mounted on these
platforms.<p>



The southwest end of the enclave is set aside for measurements of environmental radiation. 
High pressure pulse ionization chambers for measuring the gamma  field are an example of the
equipment installed here.  A telephone pole (11.5 m) is provided for use in measuring vertical
gradients.<p>


At the northeast end of the enclave there is a 10 m meteorological tower, with instruments
mounted at the 1 m and 10 m levels.  The meteorological instruments, which comprise the
bulk of the permanent instrumentation at the site, are described in the next section.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>5.  METEOROLOGICAL DATA INSTRUMENTATION</b></h2><p>

</center>


The instrumentation presently being used at the site, see Table 4, include rain gauges, a solar
pyranometer, a wind vector transmitter, a temperature and dew point sensor, and a barometric
pressure sensor.  The wind instrument is located atop a 10 m tower and provides the X and Y
components of the wind vector.  In an area free from shadows is a solar pyranometer which
measures the total solar radiation reaching the earth's surface.  Precipitation amounts are also
continuously monitored using two heated tipping bucket rain gauges and one weighing bucket
rain gauge.  An aspirated temperature and dew point sensor has been installed at a height of 1
m.  Signals for all sensors are recorded on magnetic cassette tape using a data acquisition
system designed by EML.  The data acquisition system is operated in a 6 min integration
cycle, thus providing 10 average values per hour.<p>

<h2><b><center>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Many of EML's research programs require that samples be taken of aerosols, defined as &quot;a
system of colloidal particles dispersed in a gas&quot;.  The suspending gas is normally indoor or
outdoor air.  Smoke and mist are common examples of aerosols, but frequently the particles
are so small that the aerosol cannot be detected by eye.  Typically, environmental aerosols
contain a broad mixture of chemical species, both liquid and solid, including some radioactive
materials.<p>


The sampling of aerosols involves a number of complications that are not present when
sampling for environmental gases.  Therefore, specialized training or experience is highly
desirable for personnel responsible for aerosol sampling.  Some universities -- such as New
York University (Institute of Environmental Medicine) -- conduct annual or semiannual one-
semester courses in aerosol science; inquiries can be made about auditing such courses.  Also,
the University of Minnesota offers a 4-day short course each summer.<p>


Excellent books are now available which consolidate the advances in aerosol science over the
past 25 years.  Two of the best are the textbook by Hinds (1982) and the handbook by the
ACGIH (1989).<p>


There are two broad categories of aerosol sampling methods: integral and size-selective.  In
the former, the goal is to collect a single sample in which the sizes and types of collected
particles accurately represent those in the air.  The integral samplers commonly used at EML
are described in <a href="aer02.html">Total Particle Collections</a> and <a
href="rtp01.html">Radon and Thoron Progeny</a>.  Size-selective
samplers are designed to provide information on particle size as well as particle amount. 
Descriptions of the size-selective samplers commonly used at EMLare found in <a

Among the size-selective samplers, the high volume cascade impactor and the diffusion battery
(when supplemented with the appropriate chemical analysis) produce sufficient data to generate
complete particle size spectra for the chemical species of interest.  Although shortcuts are
possible, the proper way to generate these spectra is to apply a suitable mathematical technique
to &quot;unfold&quot; or &quot;deconvolute&quot; the data (see <a
href="aer08.html">Mathematical Analysis of Particle Size Data</a>).<p>


The modern method of presenting aerosol size spectrum data is the &quot;generalized
histogram&quot;
described in Chapter E of ACGIH (1989).<p>

<center><h2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Described in this section are the equipment and procedures used at EML in sampling for trace
amounts of certain gases, liquids or solids dispersed in air.  For gases, this involves either
&quot;whole air&quot; samplers, or samplers which selectively adsorb the gas of interest.  For
the liquids
and solids (aerosols), the techniques involve separating the particles from air by means of
filtration or impaction.The locales for sampling in EML programs range from indoor
(residential or occupational) to outdoor (surface to upper troposphere).<p>



<i>In situ </i>methods in which the sampling and analysis are one combined operation are not
described
as they are not commonly used at EML.  Further information can be found in <i>Air Sampling
Instruments for Evaluation of Atmospheric Contaminants</i>, a handbook published by the
American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH, 1989).  This handbook,
which is updated every 5 to 6 years, includes descriptions of practically every commercially
available instrument for sampling trace gases and aerosols.  It also has concise theory sections
covering basic physics and experimental design pertinent to air sampling.<p>

<h1><center><b>WET/DRY DEPOSITION COLLECTOR</b></h1><p>
<hr>
</center>
<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

We examine the wet phase and dry phase of deposition to further understand atmospheric
pollution deposition processes, and the physical and chemical characteristics of these
pollutants.  Our measurements of fallout from weapons tests were largely directed towards
stratospheric fallout, which is primarily deposited by way of precipitation scavenging.  Dry
deposition processes are also important and, therefore, it is desirable to measure wet and dry
deposition separately.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  APPARATUS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

EML's wet/dry deposition collector is a two-bucket system with a movable peaked cover
designed to expose the wet and cover the dry <a href="sp28.html">bucket</a> at the onset of
precipitation, and vice
versa (Volchok and Graveson, 1976).  There is a conductivity sensor on each side of the roof. 
The sensor base plate electrode is separated from the parallel bar electrode above by a thin
(about 0.8 mm) air space.  Any electrical flow between the electrodes activates the motor in
the base of the unit and the counter-weighted lid moves to cover the dry bucket.  When the
circuit is broken, the cover returns.  Heaters are mounted below the sensors and are activated
when the temperature drops below 4&#176; C to melt snow or ice accumulations on the sensor,
or
when the instrument is in the wet collection mode to evaporate moisture from the sensor. 
Thus, when properly adjusted, the wet collector will be exposed only during periods of
continuous precipitation.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><h2><b>3.  SAMPLING AND DEPLOYMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

In the past, we have used stainless-steel pots to collect radioactive debris from weapons tests,
and heavy polyethylene buckets to collect trace metals.  Since many of EML's sites are remote
from the Laboratory, we have adopted a commercial container which has a positive closure to
prevent leakage during shipment.  The opening in the plastic bucket is about 30 cm in
diameter.  The sampling containers for these wet/dry collectors are <a
href="sp29.html">polyethylene buckets</a> particularly well-suited for shipping because of the
design of the lip and cover.  On
the underside rim of the cover there is a groove with an O-ring seal.  When the cover is
securely hammered onto the bucket with a rubber mallet, no leakage will occur.  The cover is
destroyed when it is removed from the bucket at the Laboratory.  The sample buckets are
shipped in fiber mailing boxes.<p>


In 1978, EML started to use Aerochem Metrics Model 201 wet/dry collectors (Bushnell, FL)
at some of our sampling sites.  This collector is similar in concept and design to EML's
collectors.  Both the EML and the Aerochem Metrics collectors are shown in <a
href="2_9.gif">Figure 1</a>, 
Aerochem metrics wet/dry collector and EML wet/dry collector.  The major
mechanical difference is the Aerochem Metrics clutch system and switching system.  EML's
collector uses a shear pin to prevent damage to the motor when the lid is frozen in place.  The
Aerochem unit has a clutch on the motor drive of the covering lid.  This clutch eliminates the
problems caused by frequent shear pin breakage common to the EML units at windy or cold
sites.  The switches on the motor box of the Aerochem Metric unit are mercury-wetted
switches, whereas microswitches are used in our units.<p>

<body>
<h1><center><b>MODIFIED TSIVOGLOU METHOD</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>


<p>

The modified Tsivoglou method is more complicated than the <a href="rtp02.htm">Kusnetz</a>,
but it yields additional
information: the concentration of individual radon progeny (Thomas, 1972).<p>



     <b>A.</b> <b> Procedure.</b><p>

<p>

The sampling procedure is identical to that used for the modified Kusnetz method.  (Actually all
three methods can be used with the same filter containing sampled radon progeny.)<p>


After the end of sampling, remove the filter containing radon progeny from the filter holder and
transfer it to the counting system for analysis.  The standard counting intervals are 2-5, 6-20, and
21-30 min after the end of sampling.  These intervals allow adequate time to transfer the filter
into the counting system and record the counts from the different counting intervals.  The
technician or the person who performs the test is required to stand by for 30 min unless he uses
automated counting equipment operated by a computer.<p>


     <b>B.</b> <b> Calculation.</b><p>


The equations needed to calculate the air concentrations from a 5 min sample and for the
standard counting intervals are:<p>

<img src="rtp03eq1.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq2.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq3.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq4.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>

C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>  =    the concentrations of Po-218, Pb-214, and Bi-214, respectively (Bq/m&#179;),<p>

     C<sub>p</sub>  =    the PAEC (nJ/m&#179;),<p>

     N<sub>t</sub>(...)  =    the net counts in the intervals 2-5, 6-20, and 21-30,<p>

     E    =    fractional counter efficiency [(counts/min) /(disintegrations/min)], and<p>

     Q    =    sampling air flow rate, L/min.<p>
</ul>
These coefficients were derived using 3.05 min for the half life of Po-218 (Martz et al., 1988). 
The half lives used for Pb-214 and Bi-214 were 26.8 and 19.9 min, respectively (ICRP,
1983).<p>

The standard deviation equations which calculate the precision for each radionuclide are:<p>




<img src="rtp03eq5.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq6.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq7.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq8.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>

 S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub> = standard deviation of the Po-218, Pb-214,
and Bi-214 (Bq/m&#179;),<p>

 S<sub>p</sub> = standard deviation of the PAEC (nJ/m&#179;), and<p>

 N<sub>t</sub>(...), E and Q were defined earlier.<p>
</ul>
The coefficients in the above four equations are the squares of the corresponding coefficients in
Equations 1-4.  Terms involving the uncertainty of the background count rate have been omitted
because they are seldom significant.<p>

A computer program (<b>WWN5</b>, for a PC; see Table 1) based on the optimizing technique
of Nazaroff (1984) has been written to do the calculations in Equations 1-8.  Results can be
acquired within 15 sec after the end of counting.  The program can also do these calculations
from any three-count radon progeny measurement.
<p>
The two outlined counting procedures can be applied to the same filter sample simply by using
two counting regimes in sequence: three counting intervals [(2-5), (6-20), and (21-30)] for the
modified Tsivoglou method; a single counting interval from 35-45 min after the end of sampling
(<a href="rtp02.htm">modified Kusnetz method</a>).  This provides a useful check against
errors in transcribing data and in calculations.

<h1><b><center>TOTAL PARTICLE COLLECTIONS</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>


The procedures discussed in this section are limited to the specific requirements of programs
currently conducted at EML and may not be applicable to other studies that require the total
collection of air particles.<p>


Since January 1963, EML has conducted the Surface Air Sampling Program (SASP).  In 1987,
the Remote Atmospheric Measurements Program (RAMP) was initiated as an extension and
modification of SASP.  The primary objectives of SASP/RAMP are to identify and study the
temporal and spatial distribution of anthropogenic and natural radionuclides in the lower
troposphere.  These objectives are achieved by filtration of large volumes of air to concentrate
the radionuclides in the aerosol prior to sample analyses.  The sampling procedures used in
SASP/RAMP would not be appropriate if one requires particle size analyses or particle specific
activity distributions.  The filters used in these programs also will not collect uncharged,
unattached radioactive gas molecules.<p>


To sample large volumes of air and obtain total particle collection, it is necessary to use an
appropriate filter material and an air mover.  In SASP/RAMP, the air mover
must be capable of continual operation at high flow rates under harsh environmental conditions.
To calculate air concentrations of radionuclides, it is necessary to
accurately determine the total volume of the air which has been sampled.<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2.  FILTER MATERIAL FOR TOTAL PARTICLE COLLECTIONS
</b></h2><p>


The criteria for filter selection are good collection efficiency for submicron particles at the range
of face velocities used, high particle and mass loading capacity, low-flow resistance, low cost,
high mechanical strength, low-background activity, compressibility, low-ash content, solubility
in organic solvents, non-hygroscopicity, temperature stability, and availability in a variety of
sizes and in large quantities.  In the selection of a filter material, a compromise must be made
among the above criteria that best satisfies the sampling requirements.  An excellent review of air
filter material used to monitor radioactivity was published by Lockhart et al. (1964).  Lippmann
(1989a) also provides information on the selection of filter materials for sampling aerosols by
filtration.<p>


In the mid-1960s, the filter material used in SASP was changed from Type 6 asbestos paper to an
organic filter, <a href="sp17.html">Microsorban</a>, to simplify the radiochemical analyses. 
This
filter material of the type Delbag-Microsorban dry air filter medium 99/97-4200 consisted of a
layer of cellulose gauze onto which microfibers of polystyrene were deposited in &quot;random
disorder&quot;.  This in turn was protected with another layer of cellulose tear-resistant gauze. 
Delbag
Luftfilter (Berlin, Germany) discontinued production of Microsorban in 1981.  EML's stock of
these filters was depleted in 1988.<p>


In 1986, studies were conducted to obtain a replacement filter paper for Microsorban. 
 <a href="sp18.html">Microdon</a> LM2020 (Carl Freudenberg,Vertrieb Industrielle
Vliesstoffe, Germany; U.S. distributor Pellon Company, Chemsford, MA) was chosen as a
suitable replacement.  These filters are manufactured from polycarbonate microfiber placed
between two supporting layers of nonwoven polypropylene fibers for ease of handling. 
Intercomparison experiments conducted at EML between Microsorban and Microdon filter
materials show no significant difference (P &gt;5%) in their collection capability for Be-7 and
Pb-210. 
In 1985, Carl Freudenberg discontinued the production of Microdon and destroyed all of their
stock.  EML's stock of Microdon filters lasted until 1991 and was replaced by Dynaweb Grade
DW7301L.<p>



Several different filter media were tested and evaluated to find a suitable replacement for
Microdon LM2020.  The polypropylene fiber filter, <a href="sp19.html">Dynaweb</a> Grade
DW7301L, was selected as a
suitable replacement.  The filter is composed of a 100% polypropylene web that is 100%
binderless.  Three layers of this web are collated and sandwiched between two sheets of a
protective DuPont Reeme (100% polyester) scrim.  The top scrim is removed prior to sampling at
RAMP sites because after their return to EML for analysis these samples are compressed into
pellets and the scrim hinders compression.  At all other sites, the filter can be used during
sampling with both top and bottom scrim in place.<p>



Gelman A/E <a href="sp20.html">glass fiber filters</a> were also occasionally used at selected
SASP
sites starting in 1988.  In general, glass fiber filters will be used at sampling sites where filter
compression after collection is not anticipated.  Glass fiber filters have excellent particle collection
efficiency, high mass loading capacity, low cost, availability, and good mechanical strength. 
These filters are non-compressible and have a high ash content.  They may occasionally have a
slightly higher background count for radionuclides such as Pb-210.  Glass fiber filters are
insoluble
in organic solvents and generally are difficult to analyze radiochemically.<p>



Two filter sizes are presently used in SASP/RAMP, a 20.32 cm circle and a 
20.32 cm x 25.40 cm rectangle.  Filter cartridge systems were developed to support
both filter shapes.  Most of the sites have or will modify their sampling equipment to accept these
filter cartridges.<p>


<p>
     <h2><b>3. AIR MOVERS</b></h2><p>


A large variety of air movers are commercially available and have been reviewed by Rubow and
Furtado (1989).<p>


Many factors must be considered when selecting an air mover.  Such factors as portability, power
requirements, maximum operational flow rate/temperature/pressure, cost, durability, and
maintenance must be considered in the selection of an air mover.  It is also important that the air
mover itself is not a source of contamination in any study.<p>


The major factors that were considered in the selection of an air mover for the SASP sites were
durability, low maintenance, and a flow rate of &#126; 1 m&#179;/min [288&#176;K, 101.3 kPa
(760 mm Hg)] at
pressure drops across the filter ranging from &#126; 5 kPa to &#126; 20 kPa (20-80 in
water).<p>



Two air mover systems are currently used in SASP/RAMP.  The SASP sites are equipped with a
<a href="sp21.html">Roots Blower</a> connected to a 1 HP electric motor by a fan belt.  The
RAMP sites are equipped with a <a href="sp22.html">Fuji ring compressor</a> in which the air
mover is directly connected to a 0.5 HP electric motor.  The Roots system must be enclosed in a
louvered shelter to protect the pump from direct exposure to precipitation.  The Roots system is
frequently mounted on a 1-m high metal stand.  The Fuji system is enclosed in a custom
manufactured aluminum container.  The Roots system is heavier than the Fuji system and may be
more durable for continual operation in harsh environments.  The Roots system exhausts some oil
vapors which may be a contaminant in certain studies.  The Roots system is designed for 20.32
cm round filters, while the Fuji system is designed for 20.32 cm x 25.40 cm rectangular filters.<p>

<p>
     <h2><b>4. FLOW CALIBRATION AND SAMPLE VOLUME DETERMINATION
</b></h2><p>


To calculate the concentrations of radionuclides in the lower troposphere or concentrations of any
air pollutant collected and concentrated by filtration, it is necessary to accurately determine the
total volume of air sampled.<p>


Generally, a parameter of the air mover can be related to flow.  If the mean flow during a
collection period can be determined, the total volume of air sampled can be calculated.  Accurate
flow measurements and the total integrated sample volume of air can be obtained using a mass
flow meter and a totalizer.  This direct technique of air flow measurement becomes impractical at
remote field locations due to cost and exposure of the flow meter to harsh environments.  Other
procedures for the measurement of air flow in sampling systems are reviewed by Lippmann
(1989b).<p>


We have determined that the best technique to measure flow, at sites equipped with Roots
 systems, is to determine an empirical relationship between the Roots blower inlet
pressure and the flow through the upstream filter.  An orifice meter was manufactured at EML to
derive this relationship.  The orifice meter has been calibrated for flow using secondary flow
measurement devices that are traceable to a primary standard volume meter.  All Roots systems
are calibrated using this orifice meter prior to field installation.  Periodic calibrations are
conducted at the field sites.<p>


During sampling, the pressure at the Roots blower inlet is measured using a Magnehelic gauge. 
The initial and final pressure values are averaged.  The average inlet pressure is then used in the
previously described empirical relationship to calculate the average flow.  This average flow is
multiplied by the collection interval to obtain the total volume sampled.  The total volume
sampled is adjusted to a pressure of 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg) and a temperature of
288&#176;K.<p>


At sites equipped with a Fuji system, the flow is determined using an empirical relationship
between the pressure differential across a fixed orifice located in the blower exhaust.  The initial
and final pressure values are used to calculate a mean flow and a total sample volume as
previously described.  The relationship between flow and the pressure differential across the fixed
orifice plate and in the Fuji flow system was determined using a Hastings Laminar flow element
traceable to a primary standard volume meter.<p>

<h1><center><b>DICHOTOMOUS SAMPLER</b></h1><p>

<p>

</center>
<HR>
<p>

A Sierra Model 245 automatic dichotomous sampler is used to study the &quot;inhalable&quot;
(&lt;10 m)
particles in ambient air.  The original commercial design was developed and sold by Sierra
Instruments Inc., but is now sold by Andersen Instruments, Inc., Sierra Anderson Division,
4801 Fulton Industrial Blvd., Atlanta, GA  30336.<p>


The dichotomous sampler is capable of separating the particles &lt;10 m (determined by the
aerosol 10 &#181;m inlet cut-off size) into two fractions.  By means of virtual impaction, the
sampled particles are separated into two fractions, the fine fraction, &lt;2.5&#181;m, and the
coarse
fraction between 2.5 and 10 m.  This technique has the added advantage of eliminating
problems associated with particle bounce and re-entrainment that are sometimes experienced in
cascade impactor sampling.<p>


The particles are collected on Teflon membrane filters which are ideal for gravimetric analyses
of the fine, coarse, and inhalable (sum of fine and coarse) fractions, and for chemical analyses
by X-ray fluorescence or other high-resolution chemical techniques.<p>



The experimental procedures used at EML are defined in the instrument manual along with
literature references on the development and application of the sampler for studies of PM-10
compliance monitoring, source discrimination, fine-particle monitoring, and visibility
monitoring.<p>

<h1><b><center>HIGH VOLUME CASCADE IMPACTORS</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></h2><p>



A description of the Sierra Model 235 multistage cascade impactor, which is used to measure
the particle size distribution of both indoor and outdoor aerosols, is presented here.  The
original design was developed and sold by Sierra Instruments, Inc., but now is sold by
Andersen Instruments, Inc., Sierra Anderson Division, 4801 Fulton Industrial Blvd., Atlanta,
GA  30336.  A number of articles are available in the literature that deal with both the
theoretical and experimental development of inertial impactors (Marple et al., 1973, 1974;
Marple and Willeke, 1979).<p>


At EML, this impactor is used for research studies and is not commonly used for long-term
sampling projects.  The methods described herein are used for 1-5 day sampling periods, and
the units are checked on a daily basis.<p>

<p>

     <h2><b>2. OPERATING CONDITIONS.</b></h2><p>



The sampler is capable of sampling at flow rates ranging from 0.56 m&#179;/min to 1.68
m&#179;/min. 
The flow is regulated by a constant flow controller that automatically adjusts to any flow rate
change caused by loading conditions or motor variances.  In the majority of our outdoor
sampling efforts, the unit is operated at a flow rate of 0.85 m&#179;/min (30 cfm) to prevent
overloading and to assure that the flow rate remains constant during the sampling interval.<p>



     <b>Configuration.</b>  The unit is housed in a standard high-volume sampling shelter
without
a size selective inlet.  Under some conditions a 10 &#181;m or 15 &#181;m size-selective inlet is
used. 
The impaction substrate is slotted Whatman No. 41 filter paper treated with light mineral oil
(Fisher Scientific, 50 Faden Road, Springfield, NJ  07081).  The oiled filter minimizes particle
rebound and reentrainment, which has been found during previous impactor evaluations to bias
impactor size distribution measurements toward smaller sizes (Knuth, 1979a).  This method of
oil treating the filter is not compatible with mass determination by weighing methods.  All of
our analyses are done by chemical or radiochemical procedures.<p>


     <b>General maintenance.</b>  The impactor plates are washed with alcohol and the slots
are
cleaned using a cotton swab or soft cloth.  Care must be taken so that the integrity of the slot
is not altered by using any cleaning material that may damage the slot spacing or edges in any
manner.  The plates are dried with compressed air and the slots are visibly examined to assure
that no foreign material remains in the slot.  The impactor plates should be numbered 1-5 in a
corresponding corner of the plates, starting with the largest slotted plate numbered 1 to the
smallest plate numbered 5.<p>


     <b>Loading procedures.</b>  The loading and unloading of the impactor assembly should
be
done in a clean environment (clean room or clean bench).  The loaded unit can then be
transported to the sampling area and installed on site.  In handling the filters, reasonable care
should be taken to minimize contamination of the sample.  Filters should be handled at the
extreme corners, and latex gloves or forceps should be used during the following loading
procedures.<p>


1.   Soak the total number of filter impaction substrates needed for the number of impactors
being loaded in mineral oil using a Pyrex or comparable dish.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  A few
extra oiled
filters may be required for blank analysis values.<p>


2.   After the filters are completely wetted, they are removed from the oil and allowed to
drip until all excess oil has run off.<p>


3.   Starting with the slotted base plate, place a mineral oil wetted filter on the plate
assuring that the paper is centered and all slots are open.  Using a glass rod, assure that
the paper is in contact with the plate and no air bubbles are present.<p>


4.   Carefully place the slotted plate, #5, on top of the filter.  Assure that it is flat, and that
it secures the impaction filter #5 beneath it to the base plate.  At this time, the filter
paper should be visible through the slots.  If not, remove plate #5 and reposition it 180
degrees.  Check again.<p>


5.   Continue placing filters and plates #4 to #1 as described in Step 4 above.<p>


6.   After positioning slotted plate #1, tighten the two screws that secure the five plates
sandwiched to the base plate.  At this time, wipe any excess oil from the sides of the
plate assembly.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  If there is an extreme amount of oil seeping through the
edges
of the plates, start over at Step 1 allowing a longer time for the filters to drip dry.<p>


7.   The extra wetted filter is carefully folded over on itself once or twice and placed in a
polyethylene bag.  Attach an appropriate identification label to the bag.<p>


8.   The loaded impactor assembly is taken to the sampling site and placed in position over
an appropriate back-up filter.  For our work, a suitable back-up filter is determined
dependent on the analytical procedure to be used.  Back-up filters which have been
used for different applications are <a href="sp20.html">glass fiber</a>, <a
href="sp17.html">Microsorban</a>, 
<a href="sp18.html">Microdon</a>, and Whatman No. 41.<p>


9.   Tighten wing nut assemblies on four corners of the base plate to secure impactor
assembly to back-up filter holder.<p>

<p>

     <b>Sampling procedure.</b><p>



1.   Start unit and adjust the in-line orifice reading to the desired setting.  This setting
corresponds to the flow rate determined from a calibration curve of the orifice. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>: 
A top loading calibrated orifice can be used to verify flow rate in the field.<p>


2.   Record all pertinent flow and time information required.  <b><u>Note</u></b>:  If a
number of runs
will be required for the experiment, a data sheet form should be developed and used for
recording data.<p>


3.   Whenever possible, the unit should be visibly checked during the sampling period.  If
an in-line orifice is being used, the manometer reading can be read and recorded at any
time during the exposure period without interrupting the sampling procedure.<p>


4.   At the end of the sampling period, record all data and if possible recheck the flow rate
with the top loading orifice.<p>

<p>

     <b>Sample recovery.</b><p>


1.   Carefully remove the impactor assembly from above the back-up filter.  Immediately
fold the back-up filter over on itself, soiled side in, twice if required, and place in
prelabeled polyethylene bag.<p>


2.   Take the impactor assembly to a clean environment and begin the disassembly
procedure by carefully removing the top plate, #1, folding the soiled filter over on
itself, soiled side in, and placing it in a prelabeled envelope or polyethylene bag. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>:  We have found that polyethylene bags are better than glassine envelopes
for
storing the oiled filters prior to analysis.  A glass rod can be used for creasing the oiled
filter when folding.<p>


3.   Place the five oiled impaction filter polyethylene bags into a larger polyethylene bag,
appropriately labelled, along with the back-up filter and the appropriate blank oiled
filter.  This is the extra-oiled impaction filter prepared prior to loading the impactor. 
<b><u>Note</u></b>:  Although you can usually determine the stage the oiled filter came from
by
visual determination of the width of the deposit on the filter, care should be taken when
removing the filters from the impactor to assure that the filter is correctly identified
when placed in the polyethylene bag.<p>



4.   The impactor plates can be placed in an alcohol bath to remove any excess oil from the
plates prior to cleaning for assembly.  Compressed air can be used to clean slots if
necessary.<p>

<p>

     <b>Data analysis.</b>  Various methods of describing the particle size distribution of
sampled
aerosol have been used through the years for impactor data.  In order to use any one or more
of these methods it is necessary to determine the amount of material collected on each of the
impactor stages and back-up filter.  At EML, this is usually done by measuring the
radioactivity or by chemical analyses.<p>



Two of the most used methods of describing the distribution derived from impactor data are
histograms and cumulative plots (Knutson and Lioy, 1989).  At EML we use a computer
program, <a href="progms.html">UNFOLDPS</a>, to construct smooth particle size spectra
from the impactor data.  To
do this, construct an impactor efficiency file from the curves given in Figure 7 of Knuth
(1979b) per the instructions given in UNFOLDPS, then follow the procedure for <a
href="aer08.htm#SECC6">Moudi in Mathematical Analysis of Particle Size Data</a>. <p>

<h1><center><b>MODIFIED KUSNETZ METHOD</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>

The simplest method is the Modified Kusnetz, in which a 5-min air sample is taken on a high
efficiency filter to be counted for 5-10 min any time between 35-95 min after the end of
sampling.  This method differs from the original method (Kusnetz, 1956) in that a scaler is used
in place of a ratemeter and the counting time is longer.<p>



     <b>A.</b>  <b>Procedure.</b><p>

<p>

Before sampling and counting a sample, the operator should ensure that the entire sampling train
is in good working order and that the counting system is calibrated and running properly.  The
counting efficiency of the system and its background counting rate should be determined as
discussed earlier.<p>



Using a 2.5 or 4.7 cm open-faced filter holder, mount a membrane or glass fiber filter.  Attach the
filter holder upstream of a calibrated flowmeter with the proper
hose and connect to the intake of an air pump.<p>



Sample air from the environment to be tested for 5 min at a rate of 10-20 L/min.  After
sampling, remove the filter containing the radon progeny from the filter holder and transfer it to
the counting system for analysis.  There is no urgency to do this since the operator has 35 min to
commence counting.  During that waiting period he/she may wish to take another sample in
another part of the building using a new filter and the same filter holder and sampling
equipment.<p>



The modified Kusnetz method requires a single count of the filtered sample usually for 10 min in
the counting interval from 35-45 min after the end of sampling, or at any other 10-min intervals
between 35-85 min after the end of sampling.<p>


     <b>B.</b>  <b>Calculation.</b><p>

<p>

The potential alpha energy concentrations (PAEC) can be calculated from the equation:<p>


<img src="rtp02eq1.gif"><p>



where<p>
<ul>
     N    =    net counts/min,<p>

     E    =    fractional counter efficiency (counts/sec/Bq),<p>

     T<sub>s</sub>  =    sampling time in min,<p>

     Q    =    sampling flow rate in m&#179;/min, and<p>

     T<sub>f</sub>  =    time factor given in Table 1.<p>
</ul>
The relative standard deviation of the measurement in % can be calculated from the following
equation.<p>

<img src="rtp02eq2.gif"><p>

     <u>Example</u>: An air sample was collected for T<sub>s</sub> = 5 min, at a flow rate
of Q = 10 L/min
(0.01 m&#179;/min).  The counting was done from 35-45 min after the end of sampling.  The
total
alpha count in that interval was 4200 counts.  The counter background was 0.1 counts/min
measured for a period of 25 min.  The counter efficiency, E, was 0.48.  T<sub>f</sub> at 40 min,
which is the
midpoint of 35-45 min, is 7.21 obtained from Table 1.  The total count in that interval was 4200
counts.<p>

<p>

     From Equation (1)<p>

<h1><b><center>MICROSORBAN AIR FILTERS</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr><p>

<p>

Microsorban filter material was used in the Surface Air Sampling Program (SASP) from the
mid-1960s until 1988 (<a href="aer02.htm">Total Particle Collections</a> in <a
href="aer01.htm">Aerosols</a> in <a href="sa03.htm">Air Sampling</a>).  This material was
also used in the Remote
Atmospheric Measurements Program (RAMP), from the program's inception, until the fall of
1988.<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2><center><b>1.  DESCRIPTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Microsorban consists of a layer of cellulose gauze onto which microfibers of polystyrene are
deposited in &quot;random disorder.&quot;  This in turn is protected with another layer of
cellulose tear-resistant gauze.  The filter has relatively low air resistance and is very resistant to
clogging.  It
is soluble in organic solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and acetone.  The ash
weight is on the order of 0.3%.  Spectrographic analysis of the ash indicates that titanium is
~25% of the ash weight, silica ~15%, barium ~10%, and calcium ~5%. 
Radiochemical analyses of blank filters for Pu-239,240 and Sr-09 indicate activities that are at or
below the lower limits of detection for these analyses.  Gamma-ray spectrometry of blank
filters also indicates the absence of the gamma-ray emitting isotopes (Be-7, Zr-95, Cs-137, Ce-144,
and Pb-210) that we routinely report.<p>

<p>

The flow rate through a ~ 200-mm diameter Microsorban filter using a 
<a href="sp21.htm">Roots Blower-24AF</a>
at about 1700 RPM may range from ~ 0.7 to ~ 1.5 m&#179;/min during sampling.  This
corresponds to a range in the filter face velocity from ~ 45 to ~ 90 cm/sec.  The flow rate
through a ~ 200 mm by ~ 250 mm filter using a <a href=sp22.htm">Fuji Ring Compressor</a>
Type 302P may
range from ~ 0.7 to ~ 1.1 m&#179;/min during sampling.  This corresponds to a range in the
filter face velocity from ~ 30 to ~ 45 cm/sec.<p>

<p>

Table 1 presents the percent penetration of a 0.3-&#181;m DOP aerosol at different face
velocities
(Lockhart et al., 1964).<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2><center><b>1.  DESCRIPTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Microdon filters replaced <a href="sp17.htm">Microsorban filters</a> at all SASP and RAMP
sites in 1988.  Viledon
Microdon filters consist of polycarbonate microfibers covered on both sides with PVC/PVA
fleece.<p>

<p>

Radiochemical analyses of blank filters for Sr-90 indicate values that are at or below the lower
limits of detection for these analyses.  Gamma-ray spectrometry on blank filters also indicates
the absence of the gamma-ray emitting isotopes that we routinely report.  The flow rates
through ~ 200-mm diameter Microdon filters are generally higher than the flows obtained
using Microsorban filters.<p>

<h1><center><b>GRAB SAMPLING FOR RADON</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

Three sizes of <a href="sp27.html">scintillation flasks</a>, all based on a design described in
George
(1976), are used at EML.  Typical characteristics are shown in Table 1.  The flasks are made at
EML from methylmethacrylate stock.  The bottom plate, made from sheet, is cemented to the
body, made from tubing.  The top plate, also from sheet, slides into the body and is sealed with
an O-ring.  The top plate is fitted with two petcock valves.  All three flasks are designed to be
counted on 12.7-cm phototubes.<p>


As the radon inside the flask decays, most of the radon progeny that are produced plate out on
the interior surfaces of the flask.  The alpha particles from radon and radon progeny interact with
the ZnS(Ag) atoms to produce scintillations which are detected, amplified, and converted to an
electrical signal by the phototube.<p>


          <b>A. Flask coating procedure.</b><p>


In this procedure, we place a thin phosphor coat on all internal surfaces. The thin coating on the
bottom plate adds 15-20% to the sensitivity.  The materials and steps used in this process are
listed below.<p>


          <u><b>Coating materials</u>:</b><p>


1.   Silver activated zinc sulfide phosphor (Wm. B. Johnson Associates, PO Box 472, 216
Edgar
Ave., Ronceverte, WV  24970).<p>



2.   Bonding solution (<b>Caution-Flammable-Use Hood</b>).  Dissolve 30 mL of silicone
fluid (Dow
Corning, Midland, MI; Silicone Fluid 200) in 285 mL of reagent benzene plus 285 mL of
reagent cyclohexane.  Stir until the silicone is completely dissolved.  This is enough to coat
about 100 flasks.<p>



          <b><u>Coating steps (use a hood)</u>:</b><p>



1.   Clean the flask with a nonabrasive cleaner.  [A plastic cleaning foam (REN RP-70 cleaner)
has
been found to be excellent.]<p>



2.   Remove cover, add 50 mL of bonding solution, replace cover, close both valves, and
rotate
the flask slowly until all surfaces including the bottom are coated.  Open valves and remove
cover.<p>



3.   Pour out excess bonding mixture into a second clean flask or return to the stock bottle. 
Let
flask air dry for a few minutes.<p>



4.   Add 15-20 g of phosphor, replace cover, and close valves.<p>


5.   Shake gently until all surfaces are coated.  Open valves and remove cover.<p>



6.   Pour out the loose powder and blow off excess phosphor from the flask and from the
cover
with clean air.<p>



7.   Replace cover and purge the flask with aged (radon free) air or nitrogen for a few minutes. 
Close the valves and store the flask for use.<p>



8.   When background becomes excessive, wipe out phosphor with clean tissue, clean as
above, and rephosphor.<p>



          <b>B. Sampling and counting procedures.</b><p>



1.   Connect a high collection efficiency filter to one valve of the flask to remove particulates
and
radon progeny.  Connect the other valve to an air pump and draw air at 2-10 L/min for 2-5
min for a href="sp27.html">scintillation flasks</a> of 165-2000 mL.<p>



2.   Turn off pump and close both valves.  An alternate method for filling the flask is to
evacuate it
down to 133 Pa (1 mm Hg) of pressure prior to filling with the test atmosphere.<p>



3.   Count the scintillation flask on a 12 cm phototube beginning 3 h after sampling.<p>



4.   To convert the counting rate to radon concentration, use the calibration factor (Cf)
obtained
from a test in a known radon environment and the appropriate decay correction.  Each
scintillation flask should have its own C<sub>f</sub> which can be influenced by its size and by
the
phototube assembly.  It is very important that the entire system (scintillation flask, and
phototube) is calibrated as a unit.  Typical C<sub>f</sub> for the three scintillation flasks used at
EML are
shown in Table 1.<p>





5.   Determine the radon concentration at the time of sampling by applying the decay
correction
(Df):<p>

<IMG SRC="rt02eq1.gif">

<p>

where t is the time in hours from the midpoint of sampling to the midpoint of counting, and
T<sub>1/2</sub>
is
the half-life of radon (91.7 h).<p>

<h1><center><b>TWO-FILTER TUBE SAMPLING FOR RADON AND
THORON</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>



<p>

The two-filter tube sampling method described in this section is used for simultaneous
measurements of airborne radon and thoron (Knutson et al., 1994).<p>

<p>

     <b>A.  Description.</b><p>

<p>

The sampling tube (9.7 cm diameter x 61 cm in length) has two filter heads.  The front end of the
tube is fitted with a 10.5-cm filter holder to accommodate two 10.5-cm high efficiency glass
fiber filters  mounted in series for the collection of all particulates
including radon and thoron progeny.  The back end of the tube is fitted with a 4.7-cm filter head
assembly to hold a 4.7-cm diameter high efficiency Metricel membrane filter paper.  This filter
has very low alpha-radioactivity background (0.05 counts/min) and antistatic electrical
properties.  The background counting rate of the back-end filter is critical in measuring the
expected low counting rate from the buildup of radon and thoron progeny originating inside the
tube.  The sampling flow rate, ranging from 30-50 L/min, is high enough to minimize the loss
of Po-216 and Po-218 atoms to the wall of the tube and to maximize the collection on the
back-end
filter.<p>



     <b>B.  Sampling and counting.</b><p>

<p>

1.   Mount two 10.5-cm diameter glass fiber filters in series in
the front end of the tube and a single 4.7-cm Metricel membrane filter in the back end of
the tube.<p>



2.   Connect the intake of an air pump to the back end of the tube and sample for 5-6 h.<p>



3.   At the end of sampling, transfer the back-end filter into a 5 cm diameter gross alpha
scintillation counter and begin to count as soon as possible in short time intervals (5-10
min) for 4-6 h.  One convenient way to do this is to make use of a portable personal
computer equipped with pulse-counting hardware and the software program
<b>ALPHALOG</b>
in <a href="rtp04.htm">Raabe-Wrenn Least Squares Method</a>.  The sooner the counting
begins the better the
precision that is obtained for radon measurements; for thoron, the sensitivity increases
with counting times of several hours.<p>



     <b>C.  Calculations.</b><p>

<p>

The concentrations of radon and thoron are calculated from the radioactivity measured on the
back-end filter using a computer program <b>JWTI</b>, which is based on the recursion formula
method
of Samuelson (1987).  This method is very flexible employing different sampling regimes and
counting intervals.  The calculated penetration (F<sub>f</sub>) of Po-216 from thoron and Po-218 from radon is
governed by the flow rate and the value for the diffusion coefficient, D, used for these isotopes. 
The relationship between D and F<sub>f</sub> is obtained from Table 1, using the value of the
parameter &#181;
given by the expression<p>

<img src="rt03eq1.gif">

where<p>
<ul>
     pi   =    3.14,<p>
     D    =    diffusion coefficient, cm2 sec-1 (0.085 cm&#178;/sec),<p>
     L    =    length of tube, cm (61 cm), and<p>
     Q    =    sampling flow rate, cm&#179;/sec (500-800 cm&#179;/sec).<p>
</ul>
<p>

The value of D = 0.085 cm&#178;/sec is used for very fresh radon progeny.  The concentration of
radon or thoron is underestimated by 3%, 4.5%, and 6.0% if the value used for D = 0.06, 0.05,
and 0.043 cm&#178;/sec, respectively.<p>


A computer program<b> JWT1</b> is used to calculate both radon and thoron concentrations in
Bq/m&#179;. 
The lower limit of detection is 5 Bq/m&#179; for both radon and thoron.  For concentrations
higher
than 200 Bq/m&#179;, a smaller two-filter tube can be used (Thomas, 1970).<p>

The activated carbon monitor is used to obtain the average radon concentration over a 1-3 day
period of passive sampling.  The original design (George, 1984) was based on the M11 charcoal
canister.  Although there are currently many variants of the activated carbon monitor, the device
described below is the one most used at EML.<p>

This monitor consists of the following materials: (1) a metal can with a lid (1.2-cm diameter by
2.9-cm deep); (2) 75 g of 8-16 mesh activated carbon (Calgon, Pittsburgh, PA); (3) metal screen
(80 mesh) to keep the carbon in place; (4) removable internally expanding retaining ring to
secure the screen; and (5) a strip (35 cm) of vinyl tape for sealing the lid to the can when closed. 
After loading and after each use, the carbon monitor is heated at 100&#177;C for a minimum of
10 h to
drive off any previously adsorbed radon and water.<p>



The counting system consists of an 8.0-x-8.0 cm NaI(Tl) detector inside a 9-cm lead shield
coupled to a compact multichannel pulse-height analyzer and a printer.  The counting system is
operated with the discriminator set to include gamma energies between 0.23 and 0.72 MeV,
spanning the peaks of Pb-214 (0.242, 0.294, and 0.352 MeV) and Bi-214 (0.609) MeV.  The
normal
counting period is 10 min.<p>



To determine the counting efficiency of the NaI detection system, a monitoring device is sealed
after spiking with a known quantity of radon or Ra-226.  This becomes the standard source with
the
proper counting geometry.  A different standard source will be required for any change in the
configuration of the monitor.  Typically, the efficiency of the EML canister and counter
combination is 0.117 counts per radon atom decay.<p>


     <b>B.</b> <b> Calibration.</b><p>


The monitors must be calibrated because the response depends on the length of exposure, relative
humidity during the exposure, and on the type of carbon used.  (Temperature effects encountered
indoors are, however, insignificant because of the limited temperature range encountered.) 
Calibration is performed for several relative humidities from 20-90% and for 1-3 days of
exposure.  This calibration is required whenever new samplers are built using a new batch of
activated carbon.<p>


Each combination of exposure time and humidity yields a C<sub>f</sub> calculated from the
following
equation:<p>

<img SRC="rt05eq1.gif"><p>





where<p>
<ul>
     1000 =    L/m&#179;,<p>

     N    =    net counting rate (counts/min),<p>

     60   =    sec/min,<p>

     E    =    NaI detector efficiency, typically 0.117 counts/sec/Bq Rn (0.26 
counts/min/pCi), <p>

     Rn   =    radon concentration in Bq/m&#179;, and<p>


     D<sub>f</sub>= decay factor from the midpoint of exposure to the midpoint of
counting
(see Equation 1 of <a href="rt02.htm">Grab Sampling for Radon</a>).<p>
</ul>


Typical results are shown in Table 1.  The amount of water adsorbed, shown in the left column,
was determined from the difference in weights before and after exposure.<p>


     <b>C.</b> <b> Use of device.</b><p>


Before exposure the monitoring device is heated to regenerate it.  Exposure times longer than 3
days should be avoided because water competes with radon adsorption and the effectiveness of
the device as an integrating monitor will diminish.<p>


To calculate the concentration of radon from the measured count rate and

measured water uptake, Equation 1 is applied after solving for radon:<p>

<img src="rt05eq2.gif"><p>


with the symbols as defined before.  Use Table 1 to obtain the C<sub>f</sub>.  The 1 sigma 
counting error is
calculated from the following expression:<p>

<img src="rt05eq3.gif"><p>


When exposed for 3 days and counted 3 days later, the device described here has a lower limit of
detection of 7.4 Bq/m&#179;.  Other versions of the device that contain better adsorptive carbon
can
measure radon concentration levels at 3.7 Bq/m&#179; or less.<p>

<h1><b><center>Rn-220 AND Rn-222 IN SOIL GAS</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>



This section describes the procedures used to determine soil gas Rn-220 and Rn-222
concentrations
using commercially-available scintillation cells and photomultiplier tube apparatus (referred to as
&quot;Rn-222 detector&quot; in the following procedure).<p>



     <b>A.  Apparatus.</b><p>


1.   Scintillation cells (Scintrex, Ltd., 222-T Snidercroft Rd., Concord, ON, Canada, nee
EDA, Model #RDX-013, or equivalent).<p>


2.   Photomultiplier tube and counting apparatus (Scintrex, Ltd., 222-T Snidercroft Rd.,
Concord, ON, Canada, Model #RDA-200, or equivalent).<p>


3.   Stainless-steel sampling tubes, 0.95 cm ID, various lengths.<p>


4.   Portable battery-operated pump (Du Pont E. I. De Nemours and Co., Route 87 S., PO
Drawer Z, Fayetteville, NC  28302, Model #2500B, or equivalent) capable of 

~ 2.0 L/min at delta p of 10 kPa.<p>


5.   Flow meter, 0-5 L/min (Cole-Parmer, or equivalent).<p>



6.   Pressure gauge, 0-25 kPa (Dwyer Instruments, Inc., PO Box 373-T, Michigan City, IN 
46360, or equivalent).<p>



7.   Short section of Tygon tubing (or equivalent) filled with dessicant held in place by glass
wool, fitted at one end with an in-line filter holder containing Millipore (or equivalent)
0.8 &#181;m filter to remove progeny from initially entering scintillation cell.<p>



8.   Computer program <b>RNTNCAL</b> (Hutter, unpublished) or equivalent, for
calculating
Rn-220 and Rn-222 concentrations from scintillation cell counts.<p>



     <b>B.  Procedure.</b><p>


1.   Emplace sampling tubes into the soil using reamer to pound, ensuring no soil is retained in
tube, or alternatively, drill hole using auger and insert tube, tamping soil to minimize
cavities along tube walls.<p>


2.   Obtain a 5-min background count for each scintillation cell to be used before the sample is
drawn at the measurement site.<p>


3.   Obtain the soil gas sample using a portable battery-operated pump, according to the
apparatus arrangement shown in <a href="2_3.gif">Figure 1</a>, Schematic of soil gas
sampling arrangement,
with a flow rate of between 1 and 3 L/min for 1 min.  Measure and record the flow rate
and the volume of the sample tubing.  The sample is drawn directly into scintillation cells
that have been previously inserted into the Rn-222 detector.<p>



4.   Turn the pump off, remove the tubes to the scintillation cell and screw on the cap to the
Rn-222 detector.<p>


5.   Obtain a 1-min count (see Notes 1 and 2).<p>


6.   Remove the scintillation cell from the Rn-222 detector, and obtain another sample using a
different scintillation cell, or see Note 3 to reuse a cell.<p>



7.   Obtain a 5- or 10-min count at least 5 min after the soil gas sample was drawn into the
scintillation cell, and no longer than 3 or 4 days.  Typically, these counts are obtained
either on-site at the end of collecting all samples, or within an hour to two at a convenient
(i.e., warm and dry) site.<p>


8.   Calculate the concentration of Rn-220 and Rn-222, correcting for decay of Rn-220 during
sampling (Hutter, in press).  This requires knowledge of the flow rate and sample tube
volume.  A computer program, <b>RNTHCALC</b>, is available to do this calculation.<p>



<b>Notes:</b><p>


1.   The time between the end of pumping and the start of counting must be as short as
possible (&lt; 90 s; 1 1/2 half-lives of Rn-220).  Typically, this delay time is about 10sec.  
Record the time between the end of pumping and the start of counting to within &#177;1 s.<p>



2.   The counts/min from the sample must turn out to be at least 3 times the background. 
Obtain a new sample if this requirement is not met, either using a different scintillation
cell, or by waiting until the background decreases.<p>



3.   If the 5-min count is obtained 5 min after sampling is ended, the cell can then be purged
with outdoor air and a new background count obtained, to be reused for the next sample,
provided that the new background check shows the sample counts/min to be at least 3
times the background.<p>



     <b>C.  QC.</b><p>


Duplicate samples, defined as measurements performed on the same sampling hole on the same
day ~ 10 to 15 min apart using a different scintillation cell, are performed at a rate of 1 in 10 for
the purpose of assessing measurement precision.  Second countings of samples are performed at
approximately the same rate in order to ensure cell integrity with regard to leakage and to assess
statistical counting uncertainties.<p>


Calibrations of scintillation cells/Rn-222 detector apparatus are performed on at least a
semiannual
basis using the EML <a href="sf01.htm">Radon Gas and Radon/Thoron Progeny Facilities for
Testing and Research</a>
or other radon chambers.  At this time, it is useful to check for leaks in the scintillation cells by
testing for consistency in the count rate, and by taking into consideration decay over several days. 
Approximately 1 in 5 cells obtained from a commercial vendor have been found to leak.  Nearly
all leaks can be sealed using epoxy around the window and all valve connections.<p>

The SASP sites are equipped with a Roots Rotary Lobe Blower Type 24 AF connected to a 1
HP electric motor by a fan belt.  Roots lobe pumps fall into a category of pumps where
volumetric displacement is the means by which flow is induced.  Lobe pumps use two
counter-rotating impellers to provide flow.  As each impeller passes over the inlet, a volume of air
is
trapped, carried through the blower to the discharge and is expelled against the discharge
pressure. <a href="7_14.gif">Figure 1</a> shows a sketch of the Roots pump and motor. 
<a href="7_15.gif">Figures 2</a> and <a href="7_16.gif">Figure 3</a>

The laptop ammeter should read about 0.3 A with the display OFF and about 0.5 A when the
display is ON.<p>


The transmitter/converter ammeter should read about 0.3 A.  Every 3 min when the
transmitter is active this ammeter will read about 0.8 A for a second.  This meter deflection is
a good indication that the transmitter is operating.<p>

A red LED on the parallel/serial converter should be on, as it indicates the unit is powered.<p>



A green LED on the MCA indicates that the battery is charging properly.  If this LED should

<h1><center><b>SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>

<p>

Once the system has been set up and is running, it should continue to do so indefinitely. 
There are a number of error traps built into the computer software program.  If an error
occurs and is trapped by the program, a message will be displayed indicating what action the
operator should take.<p>


Power for the transmitter/converter is protected with a 5 A internal fuse.  If the LED on the
serial/parallel two-way converter is not illuminated, and the transmitter/ converter meters
indicate no voltage, this fuse may need to be replaced.  In order to replace this fuse, the cover
for the RAMP system power supply must be removed.  The fuse holder is at the back of the
left side of the unit.  Spare fuses have been supplied with the backup equipment.<p>


If none of the power supply LEDs are lit, the ammeters read 0 and the voltmeters read
between 12 and 13 V, then the AC fuse at the back of the unit must be replaced to restore the
AC (main) power.  The batteries inside the power supply will continue to provide power for
the RAMS for about 8 h.<p>


If the computer does not respond, press 'CTRL,' 'ALT,' and 'DEL' at the same time.  This
will reset the computer and restart the program.  Press the 'A' key, then either the 'C,' 'B' or
'S' key, as appropriate.<p>


If the computer has entered the DOS operating mode as indicated by the DOS prompt A&gt;,
type 1RAMP and press ENTER to restart the program.  Press the 'A' key, then either the 'C,'
'B' or 'S' key, as appropriate.<p>


If the MCA has been turned off or has lost power for a long time, it will be necessary to reset
the high voltage and to recycle the baud rate and parity so that communications with the
computer can be established.  Proceed as follows:<p>

<ul>
     Press SETUP on the MCA.<p>

     Press the UP ARROW.<p>

     Press 'YES' eight times or until 'BAUD RATE=9600' appears again.<p>

     Press the UP ARROW.<p>

     Press 'YES' six times or until 'PARITY=8+NONE' appears again.<p>

     Press END.<p>

     Use 'CTRL,' 'ALT,' and 'DEL.'  (This will reset the computer and restart the
program.)<p>

</ul>

When the RAMP control program starts, there will be four possible operations.<p>

<ul>

     I    - for initial setup,<p>

     C    - for system clock reset,<p>

     G    - for MCA gain check, or<p>

     A    - for data acquisition.<p>

</ul>

Press the 'I' key on the computer.  Accept the default values displayed by pressing ENTER. 
Press the 'Y' key to accept these values.  The high voltage will automatically be set to the
correct value by the initial setup routine.<p>



Computer software problems can develop if:  1) the MCA amplifier gain is beyond the range
that the computer can correct; 2) the MCA gain setting when the unit was packaged for
shipment was preset to an invalid value; and 3) the internal temperature of the environmental
chamber was not set at 88oF.  The MCA gain can be checked and adjusted as follows.<p>



Press the 'G' key on the computer keyboard.  "THE CURRENT GAIN VALUE IS" message
will be displayed.  After a few seconds, the current gain value will also be displayed.  If the
gain is very different from the preset value, enter the preset value and press the ENTER key
on the computer.  Press ENTER on the computer to leave the current gain value unchanged.<p>


The MCA gain can also be reset automatically by the software.  The procedure is as follows:<p>

<ul>
     From the initial menu, press 'I' for initialization.<p>

     Enter the correct local date and time.<p>

     When prompted for a GAIN value, enter the word RESET.<p>

     Follow the instructions on the computer screen.<p>

</ul>

If the data that is being transmitted is not received by EML in New York City, EML will
inform site operators by TELEX or FAX and ask operators to TELEX or FAX the status of
the RAMS.  After EML has determined the correct resolution of the problem, instructions will
be communicated to site operators.<p>

<h1><b><center>CONTAINERS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FALLOUT
AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION</b></h1><p>

</center>
<hr><p>

<h2><b><center>1.  DESCRIPTION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Samples of atmospheric deposition that are obtained using a wet/dry collector (<a
href="ad03.htm">Wet/Dry
Deposition Collector</a>) and that are to be measured for radioactive fallout or for
the chemical composition of the deposition are usually collected using a polyethylene bucket of
the type that has been used by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends
Network (NADP/NTN).<p>

<p>

These (3.5 gallon) buckets, which will hold about 13 kg of water, are constructed of high
density polyethylene.  The ears for the wire bail are integrally molded near the top of the
container.  The bucket is molded in one piece and with two reinforcing rings around the
outside diameter above the ears to provide additional container strength.  The body of the
bucket is tapered to permit one pail to nest inside another for economical shipping and storage
of empty buckets.  The inner rim of the plastic cover interlocks with the upper rim of the
bucket.  An O-ring seal in a groove just inside of the rim of the cover presses down against the
bucket rim and prevents leakage after the cover has been hammered into place, using a rubber
mallet.  The covers must be discarded after one use because their rims will have to be cut in
order to remove them from the buckets without using unreasonable force.  The buckets may be
cleaned and reused for most purposes.  <p>

<p>

We use custom made cubic fiber boxes for mailing the buckets to and from distant sampling
sites.  For mailing the boxes, we use a reversible, plastic covered address card, with the site
address on one side and our address on the other side.  We commonly glue a return address
label to the box within the frame that holds the reversible address label so that the box can be
returned to us even if the reversible label is lost during shipment.<p>

<p>

There are a few problems that have been encountered in the use of these sample buckets. 
When the buckets are cleaned routinely for reuse, some contamination may remain in them. 
The cleaning process has to be designed and monitored to prevent cross contamination of
samples.  If the rims of the lids are cut to facilitate their removal from the buckets, care must
be taken not to cut the surface of the bucket also, if the buckets are to be reused.  During the
NADP/NTN it has been shown that the O-rings are a potential source of contamination even if
they have been cleaned before use.  If the buckets are upside down or lying on their sides for
some period during shipment, the water sample may dissolve small amounts of sulfate and
other materials from the O-rings.  For most uses to which the buckets may be put, this should
not be a major problem.<p>

<body>
<h1><center><b>CALIBRATION</b></h1><p>

</center><hr>
<p>

A complete description of field gamma-ray spectrometry can be found in Beck et al. (1972) and
Miller and Shebell (1993).  To summarize, the exposure rate in air above the ground is related
to the absorption peak counting rate registered by the detector by<p>


<img src="fg02eq1.gif"><p>

where<p>

<ul>
     N<sub>o</sub>/Phi   is   the counting rate from a particular spectrum absorption
peak due to a unit
primary photon flux density of energy E incident on the detector along the
detector axis (normal to the detector face),<p>



     N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>   is   the correction required to account for
detector angular response, and<p>



     Phi/I     is   the primary photon flux density with an energy E at the detector resulting
from the decay of a particular radionuclide per unit exposure rate at the
detector from all primary and scattered photons originating from this nuclide
and any others present from its radioactive decay series.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The first two terms depend on the particular detector; Phi/I values depend only on the source
composition and geometry and can be used for any spectrometer calibration.<p>



In a like manner, the concentration or <a NAME="EQ2">inventory of a particular nuclide</a> is
related to absorption
peak counting rate by<p>

<p>

<img src="fg02eq2.gif">

<p>

where <p>

<ul>

     Phi/A     is   the total photon flux density at the detector location per unit concentration
or
inventory of the nuclide.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The three factors to compute N<sub>f</sub>/I or N<sub>f</sub>/A are discussed separately.<p>

<p>

     <b>A.  N<sub>o</sub>/Phi.</b><p>



The response to unit flux at normal incidence is evaluated for a detector using various gamma-ray
point sources.  A complete energy response curve from 40 keV to 3 MeV can be inferred with
a set made up with the reasonably long lived isotopes Eu-152, Am-241, Cs-137, Co-60, and
Th-228.  The
measurement procedure is as follows:<p>



1.   Position the source at a distance of at least 1 m and at normal incidence to the detector
face.<p>


2.   Calculate the uncollided flux density at the detector effective crystal center, which is
obtained by dividing the  emission rate by 4 pi r&#178;.  The value of r is the distance from
the source to the crystal effective center.  This can be taken to be the geometric center
for high energy (&gt; 1 MeV) rays and the crystal face for low energy (&lt; 0.1 MeV) gamma
rays.  For the energy range between these two values, an estimate of average
penetration distance can be made based on the absorption coefficient of the crystal. 
The gamma flux density is also corrected for air and source holder attenuation.<p>



3.   Collect a spectrum and determine the full absorption peak count rate.<p>


4.   Collect a spectrum without the source present and subtract out from the previously
measured count rate any contribution to the peak from background emitters.<p>



5.   Divide the corrected count rate by the flux density to determine N<sub>o</sub>/Phi.<p>



6.   Perform this measurement at different energies with either simultaneous or separate
runs.<p>


7.   Plot the values of N<sub>o</sub>/ versus energy on a log-log scale and fit the data to a
smooth
curve. <a href="3_6.gif">Figure 1</a> shows N<sub>o</sub>/Phi as function of energy
above 200 keV for the detectors
listed in <a href="fg01.htm#TB1">Table 1</a> in Instrumentation, Site Selection and Instrument
Setup.  In the energy
range shown, the response can be fit to a straight line on a log-log plot to within 3%.<p>



     <b>B.</b> <b> N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>.</b><p>


The uncollided gamma-ray flux for a soil half space source geometry is not limited to angles
normal
to the detector face.  Therefore, the complete flux density response calibration must account
for the fact that a cylindrical Ge crystal when oriented with the axis of symmetry perpendicular
to the ground plane has a variable altitudinal (zenith-angle) response.  The correction factor,
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>, is determined from point source calibrations as functions of
energy and angle in the
vertical plane and can be calculated from<p>

<p>

<img src="fg02eq3.gif">

<p>

where<p>

<ul>

     Phi(theta)/Phi is   the fraction of the total primary flux at zenith angle theta for
a given source
energy and geometry, and<p>



     N(theta)/N     is   the response of the detector at angle theta for the same energy
gamma ray relative to
the response at normal incidence.<p>
</ul>
<p>


The procedure for determining the values of N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> is as follows:<p>



1.   Measure the full absorption peak count rate (minus any background contribution to the
peak) using a point source at a fixed distance of at least 1 m to the crystal at 15&#176;
intervals between incident angles of 0&#176; (normal to detector face) and 90&#176;.<p>


2.   Plot the relative response N(theta)/N versus angle and fit the data to a smooth curve.<p>



3.   Evaluate N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> numerically for at least three different source
distributions in the
soil (surface plane, 3 cm relaxation depth, and uniform). The angular flux distribution
data can be found in Beck et al. (1972).<p>


4.   Repeat Steps 1-3 for several other energies and plot the resultant values of
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> versus
energy.  The data points can be fit to a smooth curve for each source depth distribution.<p>



As noted before, a longer crystal would tend to yield a higher count rate in the field, meaning
that the value of N<sub>f</sub</N<sub>o</sub> would be &gt; 1.  For the source distributions
generally encountered,
more than 80% of the uncollided flux is incident between theta = 30&#176;-90&#176; ( measured
from the
detector axis normal to the ground interface).  Uniformity of the zenith angular response in
this range to within a few percent assures that the value of N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> will
not vary significantly
with changes in the distribution of flux.  In general, a more uniform response is achieved with
a crystal where the diameter is close to the length dimension.  However, the variation in
N<sub>f</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>
for a detector where the crystal length/diameter is as high as 1.3 or as low as 0.7 would not be
expected to be more than about 20% for energies &gt;200 keV. <a href="3_7.gif">Figure
2</a> shows angular
correction factor data at three different energies for several detectors in a downward facing
geometry and a uniform source depth profile.<p>



     <b>C.  Phi/I and Phi/A.</b><p>


The Phi/I (and Phi/A) factors are derived from gamma-ray transport calculations.  Tabulations of
these
data along with other pertinent information on the make-up of the environmental gamma radiation
field can be found in Beck et al. (1972), Beck and de Planque (1968), and Beck (1972).  A
complete set of exposure rate values (I/A) for close to 200 common fission and activation
isotopes at various exponential depth distributions in the soil can be found in Beck (1980).<p>


<b>Notes:</b><p>


1.   The inference of exposure rates from nuclides located in the ground does not require a
precise knowledge of the distribution with depth or of the exact soil density or
composition.  This property results because the observed peak count rate in a field
spectrum is essentially a measure of the uncollided flux, and although this quantity and
the exposure rate produced by it and the associated scattered flux varies significantly
with the source depth distribution and soil characteristics, the ratio of these two
quantities, Phi/I, does not. Thus, even a crude estimate of source distribution should not
lead to a sizeable error in the exposure rate.<p>



2.   In lieu of a complete experimental calibration of a Ge detector for field spectrometry,
generic factors may be substituted at energies &gt; 200 keV (Helfer and Miller, 1988). 
The only parameters needed to apply this semiempirical calibration method are the
manufacturer's quoted efficiency at 1332 keV (5-45%), the crystal length/diameter
ratio (0.5-1.3), and the detector orientation in the field (upward or downward facing). 
The accuracy of the derived factors is estimated to be 10% for energies &gt; 500 keV
and 15% for energies between 200 and 500 keV.<p>

<center><h1><b>SPECTRUM ANALYSIS</b></h1><p>

<hr><p>

</center>
In many situations, the built-in peak area estimate features of state-of-the-art analyzers are
used in providing quick results in the field.  Prominent peaks are identified in a bench-mark
spectrum and the appropriate regions of interest are set up.  On certain analyzers, function
keys are programmed using the net peak area, counting time and calibration factor
(N<sub>f</sub>/I and
N<sub>f</sub>/A) to provide instantaneous readout of exposure rate and concentration or
inventory.<p>


For more complete data reduction, a small computer is interfaced to the analyzer to run a
spectrum analysis program.  If desired, a totally portable system may be configured using a
battery-powered laptop computer.  Our standard analysis program (Gogolak and Miller, 1977;
Gogolak, 1982) performs the following:<p>


1.   Based on a two point energy calibration as set by the operator, certain peaks which are
characteristic of typical environmental spectra are identified, namely:<p>

<ul>

     a.   the 186, 295, 352, 609, 1120 and 1765 keV peaks in the U-238 series;<p>

     b.   the 583, 911, 966 and 2615 keV peaks in the Th-232 series;<p>

     c.   the 1460 keV peak of K-40;<p>

     d.   the 662 keV peak of Cs-137.<p>

</ul>

These peaks are defined by set energy bands where the left and right channel markers
are representative of the Compton continuum.<p>



2.   The counts between the energy boundaries for each of the above peaks are summed. 
The background counts in three channels on each side of a peak are averaged and the
result is used as an estimate of the baseline under the peak.  This is multiplied by the number of
channels in the peak and subtracted out from the total counts in the peak
band to yield the net peak counts.<p>



3.   Detector specific calibration factors are applied to convert from peak count rate to
exposure rate and concentration or inventory.<p>


4.   A printout is made listing count rates, converted quantities and associated statistical
counting errors.<p>



5.   Permanent storage of the spectrum is made on either magnetic tape or diskette.<p>



6.   As an option, an automated search is performed to identify any peaks present in 
the spectrum.  Data such as nuclide, half-life, gamma-ray intensity and associated 
energy are printed out using a library of nearly 400 principal gamma-ray energies that are seen in
the environment (see <a href="rd04.htm">Gamma</a> in <a href="rd01.htm">Radionuclide
Data</a>).  Any peak can be quickly
analyzed by using an optional automated continuum strip.<p>



7.   The program enters an interactive phase where the operator examines any additional
peaks, checks the results of the automated routine, or investigates any
unusual or unexpected features of a spectrum.<p>

<H2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>
<p>
This section describes current radionuclide measurement techniques in use at EML and their
associated data.  A radionuclide is identified by its three principal characteristics: half-life, type of
emission, and energy of the emission.  Sometimes overlooked in the process are progeny
radionuclides with their own particular characteristics.<p>

In the 1960s, routine measurements were being performed at EML for alpha, beta and gamma 
radionuclides.  Measurements in both the Frisch grid ion chamber and the solid-state surface
barrier detection systems were used to identify alpha energies in sources in properly calibrated
systems.  Contained in <a href="rd02.htm">Alpha</a> is a table of alpha emitters by energy,
especially linked to the charts of the naturally occurring radionuclides, which assists in
radionuclide identification in separated samples and in radionuclide purity checks.<p>

Routine measurement of beta emitters is performed on counters designed at EML.  These
counters have a very low background count rate due to anticoincidence counting techniques.  The
overall counting efficiencies are comparable to proportional counters.  Radiochemical purity is
typically assessed by decay measurements. <a href="rd03.htm">Beta</a> contains tables of beta
emitters by half-life and energy.<p>

Use of NaI(T1) gamma spectrometry detection systems provides poorly resolved spectra
compared with the Ge(Li) and intrinsic Ge systems presently in use.  The resolution of these
present systems require sophisticated computer algorithms to identify energies associated with
particular radionuclides.  It is most important that the energies and the branching ratios used at
any facility be documented and a table of gamma emitters in the environment is included in <a
href="rd04.htm">Gamma</a>.
<p>
Contained in the <a href="rd06.htm">Natural Decay Series</a> are charts of three natural
radionuclide series and the man-made americium series.  Pertinent data are included in these
charts.<p>

<center><h2><b>1.  APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>

A field gamma-ray spectrum can also provide an estimate of the amount of activity per unit area
of
soil surface for nuclides which have been deposited on the ground.  To do this, a knowledge of
the source distribution in the soil is required in order to relate the  measured total absorption
peak count rate to the incident unscattered photon flux and then to the activity in the soil in a
manner analogous to that used for natural emitters.<p>

<p>

The activity profile with depth for deposited nuclides in undisturbed soils can be represented
by an exponential function,<p>

<img src="fg04eq1.gif">

<p>

where<p>

<ul>

     S    is   the activity per cm&#179; at depth z cm,<p>

     S<sub>o</sub>  is   the activity per cm&#179; at the soil surface,<p>

     alpha     is   the reciprocal of the relaxation length in per cm, and<p>

     rho  is   the <i>in situ</i> soil density (g/cm&#178;).<p>

</ul>

The cumulative activity, or inventory I, integrated to depth z' is, then,<p>

<img src="fg04eq2.gif">

<p>
where I<sub>o</sub> is the total inventory integrated to infinite depth.<p>
<p>

<h2><b>2.  HOMOGENEOUS TERRAIN</B></h2><P>

In the case of a freshly deposited nuclide, the depth parameter is infinite corre-sponding to a plane
source distribution and a relaxation length of zero.  In practice, the effects of ground roughness
bury the source somewhat.  Even on what appears to be flat terrain, we apply an alpha/rho value
of 6.25 cm&#178;/g, which at a typical soil density of 1.6 g/cm&#179; corresponds to a
relaxation depth of 0.1 cm.  Values of alpha/rho for aged global fallout Cs-137 have been found
to range from a high of 1.0 for an evergreen forest floor to a low of 0.03 for a flood irrigated
lawn.  At a soil density of 1.6 g/cm&#179;, these correspond to relaxation lengths of 0.6 and 21
cm, respectively.  More typical values of alpha/rho tend to range from 0.05-0.1 for open field sites
and 0.2-0.5 for wooded or desert areas.<p>

Values of the unscattered flux and its angular distribution at 1 m above the
ground have been tabulated for exponentially distributed sources in the soil for various energies
and alpha/rho values (Beck et al., 1972).  Using <a href="fg02.htm#EQ2">the equation</a> for
the concentration or inventory of a particular nuclide as related to the absorption peak counting
rate, where the term A now represents the inventory (activity per unit area), the detector response
can be calculated for a particular nuclide as a function of alpha/rho.  If the nuclide has two
reasonably strong gamma lines well separated in energy, the value of alpha/rho can be inferred
from the ratio of the measured fluxes.<p>

In the case of a monoenergetic source such as Cs-137, the value of alpha/rho can be determined
experimentally as follows:<p>

1.  A 62 cm&#178; or similar large area corer and auger is used to extract soil samples from
    different depth intervals (see <a href="sa05.htm">Soil Sampling</a>) depending upon the
    expected activity distribution.  For example, if the profile is expected to be shallow, the
    depth intervals can be 0-2.5, 2.5-5, and 5-30 cm, while if it is expected to be deep,
    intervals of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-30 cm can be used.  More than one core can be
    taken, in which case the samples from the same depth are composited.  The depth of the
    soil core should be sufficient to include essentially all of the deposited activity so that
    I<sub>o</sub> can be determined.<p>

2.  An aliquot of a sample from each depth increment is counted on a high resolution Ge
    detector to determine the concentration of the radionuclide of interest.<p>

3.  The activity per unit area for each depth is computed from the product of the con-centration and the sample mass for that depth increment divided by the area of the
    sample.<p>

4.  A fit toinventory, I,  is then applied, the variables being I<sub>o</sub> - I, the integrated
    activity per unit area and rho z , the gross <i>in situ</i> mass per unit area down to depth
    z .  Graphically, this can be performed by plotting the log(I<sub>o</sub> - I) versus rho z
    and fitting a straight line through the points, weighting the points near the surface more
    heavily since this is where most of the activity is contained.  The slope of this line is just
    alpha/rho.<p>

<b>Note:</b><p>

Although the inventory is determined using the soil sample data itself, it is quite useful to
corroborate this estimate with the field spectrum.  The soil cores may represent an area of a few
hundred square centimeters, while the field data represent the average over several hundred
square meters.<p>
<p>

<h2><b>3.  NONHOMOGENEOUS TERRAIN</h2></b>
<p>
For areas where the fallout is suspected of being unevenly distributed across the ground,
representative inventory measurements can still be made by relying on the fact that a field
spectrum averages out the local inhomogeneities in the source geometry.  This more generalized
method is applied to cases such as the measurement of aged fallout in the desert southwest of the
U.S. where blowsand tends to shift from bare soil and collect under vegetative cover.  A complete
description can be found in Miller and Helfer (1985).  The basic steps include:<p>

1.  Soil samples in depth increments are collected from the different types of ground cover
    present (grass, brush, bare soil, etc.).<p>

2.  The samples are counted and a depth profile for each type of ground cover is obtained
    using the procedure outlined above for homogeneous terrain.<p>

3.  If the depth profiles are significantly different, the approximate percentage of ground
    cover of each type is determined within a 15 x 15 m square centered at the detector.  This
    can be performed using a combination of tape measurements and eye estimates to
    approximate the dimensions of any patches of grass or shrubs and trees out to their drip
    line, or to where there is an obvious change in soil characteristics, and then calculating the
    total area of each particular type of cover.<p>

4.  The conversion factor to apply to the peak count rate in order to obtain an inventory
    estimate is given by<p>

<img src="fg04eq3.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>
   &lt;g&gt;     is   the average full absorption peak count rate to inventory conversion factor for an infinite half
                      space source distribution with randomly spaced segments of different types of ground cover,
                      each of which has its own characteristic nuclide depth distribution and inventory (inventory
                      per unit count rate), <p>

    x<sub>i</sub>     is   the fraction of the total inventory associated with the i-th type of ground cover,
                           and<p>

    g<sub>i</sub>     is   the full absorption peak count rate to inventory conversion factor for an infinite
                           half-space source distribution with a measured depth profile characteristic of the i-th type of ground cover (inventory per unit count rate).<p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><p>

The value of &lt;g&gt; exhibits a dependence on the relative inventory mix for the different
ground covers which can only be determined through soil sampling.  Nonetheless, the value of
&lt;g&gt; must fall within the range of the individual values of g<sub>i</sub>  Generally, this
range is not large.  Although the inventory may typically vary by a factor of two for the different
ground covers, the variation in the conversion factor for the different depth profiles associated
with these ground covers will average &lt;30%.  This is particularly true for sites where the
fallout is near the soil surface because the conversion factor does not vary strongly with the depth
profile for values of alpha/rho &gt; 0.2.<p>

<h2><b><center>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Presented in this section are possible uses of soil sampling and some recommended procedures
for this sampling and for the preparation of the samples.  An attempt is made to point out
some of the problems that exist in site selection, and the sampling methods that are available.<p>


A few soil sampling methods will be discussed in <a href="s02.html">Core Method</a>, <a
href="s03.html">Template Method</a>, <a href="s04.html">Trench
Method</a> and <a href="s05.html">Nonhomogeneous Terrain Method</a>.  Variations on
these techniques or alternate
methods (ASTM, 1983; Bernhardt, 1976; EPA, 1979, 1983; Gilbert, 1987) may be necessary
to accommodate site specific characteristics or the objectives of the project.  The standard
EML procedure for collecting soil is described in the section on <a href="s02.html">Core
Method</a>, i.e., 10-8.9 cm
diameter cores spaced 0.5 m apart on a flat grassy lawn are collected to a depth of 5 cm,
representing an area of 620 cm&#178;.<p>


In all the procedures discussed, it is important to consider the potential for cross-contamination. 
If depth profiles are taken, it may be necessary to decontaminate or discard
tools as different levels of contamination are sampled.<p>

<h1><center><b>SPECTRAL STRIPPING FOR GERMANIUM DETECTORS</b></h1><p>
<hr>
</center><p>


<h2><center><b>1.  APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A stripping operation can be applied to a Ge detector spectrum which has been collected in
free air in order to obtain the  flux density as a function of energy (Miller, 1984).  This flux
spectrum can be readily converted to an independent estimate of the free air exposure rate or
be used to make energy response corrections to other radiation measuring devices.  This
technique has particular applications to indoor radiation measurements, where the flux
distribution is not easily predicted because of the complex and generally unknown gamma source
geometry.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  THEORY</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

A count registered by the detector can be caused by the full or partial absorption of an incident
photon or by the passage of a cosmic ray produced charged particle.  In order to obtain a
measure of the incident photon flux spectrum, the partial absorption and cosmic-ray events
must be subtracted out and then the full absorption efficiency curve of the detector can be
applied.<p>


The stripping operation can be expressed as:<p>

<p>

<img src="fg05eq1.gif">


<p>

where<p>

<ul>
N<sub>i</sub><sup>'</sup>, N<sub>j</sub><sup>'</sup>   are  the counts in an
energy band due to the total absorption of incident gamma flux,<p>

N<sub>i</sub>  is   the observed counts in an energy band due to all sources,<p>

L    is   the energy band containing the highest energy  line (generally 2.615 keV),<p>

f<sub>ij</sub> is   the fraction of the continuum counts at energy band i due to the
partial
absorption of incident  flux at energy band j,<p>

r<sub>j</sub>  is   the ratio of total counts to full absorption peak counts for incident
flux at
energy band j, and<p>

N<sub>c</sub>  is   the counts in band i due to cosmic-ray events, assumed to be
constant in any
energy band and given by<p>

     <ul>
<img src="fg05eq2.gif"><p>
     </ul>


</ul>
where<p>

<ul>
E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>  are  the lower and upper energy bands of a pure
cosmic-ray energy (generally 3-4
MeV).<p>
</ul>


<p>

<h2><center><b>3.  DETERMINATION OF STRIPPING PARAMETERS (f and
r)</b></h2><p>

</center>


<b>Factor  f</b> - For the factor f, a multiple step function fit is used wherein the region below
the
Compton edge is divided into 10 equal size energy bands and the region above the Compton
edge is divided into four equal bands.  The fraction of the total counts in the continuum in
each band  can be experimentally determined for a particular detector by examining the shape
of the continuum below a full absorption peak from a monoenergetic  source.  Although the
shape of the continuum is a function of the energy and incident angle of the  ray, it is not
overly sensitive to these variables, particularly at the higher energies which contribute the most
to the exposure rate.<p>


<b>Factor  r</b> - In the same manner that the full absorption peak efficiency is determined for a
detector (see <a href="fg02.htm">Calibration</a> for N<sub>o</sub>/Phi), the total efficiency
can be determined and its ratio
computed.  However, effectively monoenergetic sources must be used and room background
must be subtracted from the entire spectrum.  Like the full absorption peak efficiency, the total
efficiency varies with incident angle for a cylindrical detector.  However, the ratio of the two,
r, varies more smoothly and is not a strong function of the incident angle.  A single angular
correction factor can therefore be applied which is representative of the higher gamma energies
which weigh heavily in the exposure rate computation.  This factor can be obtained by
assuming an isotropic radiation field and averaging over the entire 4 pi solid angle.  Although,
in practice, the radiation field may not be isotropic, a reasonable approximation to this ideal
can be created by accumulating a spectrum with the detector oriented in different directions,
thus averaging out the angular dependence.  To accomplish this, we routinely count for equal
lengths of time with the detector pointing in six different directions, that is, each way along
three orthogonal axes.<p>

<p>



<h2><center><b>4.  STRIPPING OPERATION</b></h2><p>

</center>

The stripping operation is performed on a portable PC using Basic and takes &lt; 1 min to
complete.  It proceeds as follows:<p>


1.   The spectrum is calibrated using two energy-channel points supplied by the operator.<p>


2.   The spectrum is compressed from 4000 channels to 400 channels for faster
computation.<p>


3.   The spectrum is stripped of the cosmic-ray events.<p>


4.   The spectrum is stripped of partial absorption events for equal size energy bands of 
10 keV each and starting at the band containing the highest energy gamma line (generally
2.615 keV), where N = N - N<sub>c</sub>.  Succeeding lower energy bands can then be
computed based on the N<sub>j</sub><sup>'</sup> values from any higher band.<p>



5.   The spectrum of counts which remains after the stripping operation is completed is
converted to the incident flux density energy distribution by applying the full
absorption peak efficiency of the detector.  As in the case of the factor r, an angular
correction based on the assumption of isotropic incidence must be applied.<p>


6.   The gamma exposure rate is computed by integrating across the spectrum the product of
the
energy, flux density, and mass energy absorption coefficient for air at each energy
band.<p>



<b>Note:</b><p>


Intercomparisons between the spectral stripping method and our own instruments and standard
procedures, as well as with those of the Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute, have
shown good agreement (Nagaoka, 1987).  Based on these measurements, we conservatively
estimate an upper limit in the total systematic error of &#177;5% when this method is applied to
spectra at background levels.  The statistical error was determined to be &lt; 2% (at the 1 sigma
level) for a 1-min spectrum at typical background levels.<p>

<h1><center><b>SODIUM  IODIDE DETECTORS</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>


<center><h2><b>1.  APPLICATION</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Although no longer used routinely by EML for field gamma-ray spectrometry, NaI detectors are
nonetheless capable of yielding satisfactory results particularly for natural background
measurements.  Like the case for Ge detector measurements, full absorption analysis can be
applied to a NaI field spectrum.  In addition, there is the technique of &quot;energy band&quot;
analysis
as well as &quot;total spectrum energy&quot; analysis.  A complete description of these methods
can be
found in Beck et al. (1972). <p>



<p>

<center><h2><b>2.  EQUIPMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>


The NaI detectors (usually 4-x-4 in cylindrical crystals attached to matched photomultiplier
tubes) are coupled through an emitter-follower preamplifier.  Either a battery powered
portable or 120 V AC vehicle-based analyzer with at least 400 channels is used to collect the
spectra.  NaI detectors are usually covered (in addition to the manufacturer's standard thin
aluminum or stainless steel window) by a 6-mm bakelite shield to reduce the beta-ray contribution
to the Compton continuum as well as to moderate thermal stresses.  The NaI detector is
transported in a rugged, foam-cushioned box to minimize mechanical and thermal shock.<p>

<p>



<center><h2><b>3.  PEAK ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

For NaI spectrometry, the N<sub>o</sub>/Phi should be obtained with source energies as close
as possible to
those environmental sources to be evaluated, usually the energies associated with the U-238 and
Th-232 series, K-40, and Cs-137.  The resulting N<sub>o</sub>/Phi versus E data do not
represent the usual NaI
response curve, because the analysis of absorption peaks does not lead to accurate estimates of
the actual peak areas, unless one engages in a complex computer program for spectral
stripping.  NaI peak areas are determined in essentially the same manner as those from Ge
detectors, though only a few absorption peaks are measurable due to the relatively poor
resolution.  Cross-calibration of a NaI detector with the more accurate Ge detector can be very
helpful.<p>


<center><h2><b>4.  ENERGY BAND ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>

When the naturally-occurring nuclides associated with the U-238 and Th-232 series and K-40
predominate at a field site, the simplified &quot;energy band&quot; method of analysis can be
applied.  In
this method, the spectrum energy is calculated as the product of the counts per channel times
the energy represented by each channel in bands of channels.  The energy bands are centered
on the 1.46 MeV K-40, the 1.76 MeV Bi-214, and the 2.62 MeV Tl-208 peaks.  The response in
each bin can then be represented by the following equations.<p>

<ul>

E<sub>1</sub> = u<sub>1</sub>U + k<sub>1</sub>K + t<sub>1</sub>T + I<sub>1</sub><p>

E<sub>2</sub> = u<sub>2</sub>U + k<sub>2</sub>K + t<sub>2</sub>T + I<sub>2</sub>
<p>

E<sub>3</sub> = t<sub>3</sub>T + I<sub>3</sub><p>
</ul>



where E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub> are the measured
&quot;energy&quot; values for some arbitrary counting period; U,
K and T represent the exposure rates to be measured; the constants represent the distribution of
spectrum energy per unit exposure rate among the three energy bands; and I<sub>1</sub>,
I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>3</sub> are the
cosmic-ray contributions.  The three equations relating the U, K and Th exposure rates to the
energy bands are determined by solving the three equations above and evaluating the coefficients
from
regression analyses of a large number of field spectra for which exposure rates had been
determined from absorption peak analyses.<p>


The following approximate equations apply for a nominal 10.16 x 10.16 cm NaI detector,
shielded with 6-mm Bakelite, though calibration of individual detectors is preferred.<p>

<ul>

U = 0.4 E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.2 E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

K = 0.08 E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.06 E<sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> - 0.02
E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

T = 0.3 E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup><p>

I = E<sub>T</sub><sup>'</sup>/37<p>
</ul>

where I is the total exposure rate from natural radioactivity in soil, and<p>

<ul>
1.32 MeV &lt; E<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 1.60 MeV,<p>

1.62 MeV &lt; E<sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 1.90 MeV,<p>

2.48 MeV &lt; E<sub>3</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 2.75 MeV,<p>

0.15 MeV &lt; E<sub>T</sub><sup>'</sup> &lt; 3.40 MeV,<p>

</ul>

the E values being in GeV per 20-min counting period.  The primes indicate that the energy
contributions from cosmic rays must be subtracted before the equations are used.<p>


Energy band analysis is performed quickly in the field by interfacing the multichannel analyzer
to a portable computer.  Using interactive software (Gogolak and Miller, 1977), the basic steps
include:<p>



1.   The spectrum is read into the computer and the operator  provides a two point energy
calibration (usually the positions of the 1460 keV K-40 and 2615 keV Tl-208 peaks) and
the altitude to the nearest thousand feet (for the cosmic-ray corrections). <p>



2.   The above equations are applied.<p>



3.   A printout is made of the total exposure rate and the contributions for K- 40 and the U-238
and Th-232 series.<p>

<p>


<h2><center><b>5.  TOTAL SPECTRUM ENERGY ANALYSIS</b></h2><p>

</center>

The exposure rate in air is proportional to <img src="fg06eq1.gif">
where Phi(E) is the flux of 
gamma rays of energy E and &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho is the mass absorption coefficient in air. 
Between a few hundred
keV and several MeV, &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho is fairly constant.  Also for low energies, the
probability of an
incident photon being totally absorbed by a large NaI detector is fairly high (on the order of
50-100% from 100 keV to 1 MeV).  About 75% of the exposure rate from the soil is due to
emitters between 100 keV and 1500 keV.  This and the fact that the spectrum of gamma rays
from
natural emitters is fairly invariant to the exact proportions of U, Th and K in the soil, indicates
that the total &quot;spectrum energy&quot; is a reasonable measure of free air exposure from
natural
radioactivity in the soil.  A large NaI or similar detector measures the flux to a fairly high
degree of accuracy and, even though sensitivity decreases somewhat at higher energies due to
the escape of secondary scattered photons, this decrease tends to be compensated by
correspondingly smaller values of &#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho for energies above 1 MeV relative to
values below 1
MeV.<p>


Unlike many NaI hand-held survey instruments, which depend on the assumption that the
counting rate above some bias level is proportional to the exposure rate, the total energy
technique requires only that the counts in a channel be proportional to Phi (E)
(&#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho) for that
energy, and is, therefore, less sensitive to spectral changes.  For example, a NaI survey meter
might indicate that the exposure rate from a unit flux of 60 keV photons as being almost equal
to the exposure rate from a unit flux of 1460 keV photons.  This would occur since the 1460
keV pulse would be recorded due to the high probability of a Compton collision in the detector
even though many of the secondaries would escape the crystal.  In the total energy technique,
the higher energy counts are weighted by the energy deposited and reflect their relative
contribution to the exposure rate more correctly.  The slightly larger total absorption at 60 keV
reflects the larger value of (&#181;<sub>e</sub>/rho) relative to higher energy gamma rays.<p>



The spectrum &quot;energy&quot; calibration factors for 10.16 x 10.16 cm detectors are
determined in
two ways:<p>


1.   The detectors are exposed to a known point source of Ra-226 in the laboratory and the
measured exposure rate is compared to an ionization chamber reading.  The
measurement should be corrected to account for the fact that the rays from the point
source are incident along the detector axis.<p>



2.   A comparison of measurements of &quot;spectrum energy&quot; from actual field spectra
is made
with simultaneous ionization chamber measurements for different environ-mental
radiation fields.<p>


The two methods give essentially the same calibration factors.<p>

<h1><center><b>REMOTE GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY STATIONS</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>



<center><h2><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>

</center>

EML's global studies are comprised of a Global Fallout Program, a Surface Air Sampling
Program, and a Remote Atmospheric Measurements Program (Sanderson et al., 1994).  These
programs currently represent EML's effort to sample, measure, and study radionuclides in the
lower troposphere and their deposition on the earth's surface (Larsen et al., 1994).<p>


Using remote atmospheric measurement systems (RAMS) in RAMP, EML is able to measure
gamma-ray emitting radionuclides having short half-lives, such as Be-7, that have been collected
by drawing air through highly efficient filters, see <a href="aer02.htm">Total Particle
Collections</a>.  The gamma-ray
spectrum is transmitted to ARGOS communications systems flown aboard polar-orbiting
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, retransmitted to ground
stations, and recovered via a telephone link by EML's computer.  The recovered sodium
iodide (NaI) gamma-ray spectrum is automatically resolved using a linear least squares
program with a library of 18 possible gamma-ray emitting radionuclides.  The last background
spectrum received is also included in the library.  When the analysis is complete, the results
are written to a report file and a computer mail message is issued to report the completion of
the analysis.  <p>



Once a RAMS station has been set up, its weekly operation requires &lt;1 h of an operator's
time.  Each week one sample, one calibration, and one background is counted.  Each month
the weekly air filter samples are sent to the University of Miami and the computer floppy disk
is sent to EML.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  COMPONENTS</b></h2><p>

</center>

     <b>A.  Gamma-ray detector.</b><p>


A 12.7 cm x 10.2 cm diameter integral inline NaI(Tl) gamma-ray detector with Am-241 doping
for gain stabilization is used in the RAMS.  The photopeak produced by the Am-241 alpha
particles should approximate a 3.5 MeV gamma ray.<p>



<b>  B.  Lead shield.</b><p>


The copper-lined shield is composed of 12 interlocking steel and lead rings with a sample
holder drawer at its base.  The rings are 27 cm in diameter at the lower half and 22 cm for the
top half of the shield and weigh either 20 kg or 9 kg, depending on the size.<p>


<b>  C.  Heated environmental chamber.</b><p>


A heated environmental chamber is used to house the lead shield, NaI detector, multiplying
phototube, and preamplifier.  The temperature inside the chamber is set ~ 5&#176;C above the
highest expected ambient temperature.<p>



     <b>D.  Lead-acid gel-cell batteries and DC charger (power supply system).</b><p>


The power supply system provides primary and backup battery power to the RAMS.  This
system uses:  a transformer to convert 240-V power to 120 V (if required); sealed, lead-acid
gel-cell batteries; and battery chargers.  The EML-designed power supply can sustain 8 h of
continuous operation when a line power failure occurs.<p>


     <b>E.  Multichannel analyzer (MCA).</b><p>


The portable MCA used in the RAMS has the following features:  4096 channel, battery
operated, CRT display, preamplifier power, detector high voltage, RS232 input/ output. 
Davidson Model #2056-C MCA or equivalent is used.<p>


     <b>F.  Laptop computer.</b><p>


A computer with backlite LCD display, either dual floppy, one fixed and one floppy disk, at
least one RS232 and one parallel port, 512K memory, and simple 12-V DC operation are
required.<p>


     <b>G.  Satellite transmitter and antenna.</b><p>


A 2 W, 401.650 MHz transmitter, 30.5 m of low-loss cable and an omnidirectional quadrafilar

<p>

<h2><center><b>4.  EML QUALITY CONTROL</b></h2></center>
<p>



All data records being received from Service ARGOS are monitored by EML personnel daily
to ensure that all sites are transmitting valid data.  This includes almost continuous monitoring
of EML VAX mail messages by EML personnel during the normal work day.  All completed
spectra received from Service ARGOS are also examined daily.  Calibration spectra are
computed and plotted as received.  Background spectra are plotted and visually compared with
previous background spectra.  The results of the analyses of the sample spectra are examined
for quality of fit and for the likelihood of fission products.  The cause of excessively high
quality of fit or fission product likelihood is determined, corrected, and a reanalysis is then
performed.<p>


All hard copy and computer files, both original data and results of analyses, are maintained at
EML.<p>

<h1><center><b>DEPLOYMENT OF TLDs</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>



<h2><b><center>1.  PREDEPLOYMENT PREPARATION OF CHIPS</b></h2><p>

</center>

     <b>A.  Batch preselection.</b><p>


Before chips are to be used for measurements, a set (typically 200 to 300 chips) from a single
manufacturing batch is tested for uniformity as follows:<p>


1.   Clean and anneal chips as described in Section B.<p>


2.   Give chips a single exposure to Cs-137 (typically on the order of 70 Gy in air, or 8
mR).<p>



3.   Read out the chips (see Table 1 for readout parameters).<p>


4.   Assign chips with readings that agree to within 30% of each other to the same group. 
Outliers should be flagged and removed from the group.  (Note: A tighter criterion of
5-10% may be used for special applications.)<p>


5.   Assign each chip a unique identification number to be permanently retained.<p>


     <b>B.  Cleaning/annealing.</b><p>

<p>

1.   Manually clean individual chips before each use with methanol and a cotton swab,
handling chips with forceps or a vacuum pen under appropriate lighting conditions (see
Table 1) (Freeswick and Shambon, 1970).<p>


2.   Anneal chips as follows:<p>
<ul>
     LiF: 1 h at 400&#176;C, 1-min cool-down on heat sink, followed by 2 h at 100&#176;C.<p>

     Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:  10 min at 300&#176;C.<p>

</ul>

3.    Cool chips to room temperature on heat sink.<p>



4.   Store chips in the lead shield if they are not going to be used immediately.  Keep
careful records of the date and time that the chips are placed in the lead shield, as well
as when they are removed for deployment.<p>


     <b>C.  Dosimeter packaging.</b><p>


Packaging should be light-tight, moisture proof, and thick enough to provide electronic
equilibrium and to shield against environmental beta radiation.  The EML dosimeter consists
of a commercially available black lucite box in which additional black lucite pieces have been
bonded in place to provide depressions for holding the individual chips (see <a
href="3_9.gif">Figure 1</a>).  It has
outside dimensions of 2.9 x 2.9 x 0.9 cm.  Each chip is surrounded by lucite with a minimum
thickness of 2.8 mm (about 320 mg/cm&#178;).  A dosimeter usually consists of five chips,
though
the container can hold up to 10 chips.  To ensure water-tightness, the lucite box is placed 
inside a thin plastic bag which is heat sealed or secured with fiber tape.<p>



<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  ENVIRONMENTAL DEPLOYMENT</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Environmental TLDs are usually deployed for 1-3 months.  A preselected uniform batch (see
Section 1A) with enough TLDs to cover at least three monitoring cycles is maintained
exclusively for use in environmental monitoring (i.e., while one set is in the field, there are
enough dosimeters for two replacement sets).  A set of environmental dosimeters for a
monitoring cycle includes six control dosimeters prepared with the field dosimeters, as
described in Section 1B.  All dosimeters are stored in the lead shield after preparation until
they can be deployed, noting date and time.  Two of the controls will be used to determine the
exposure rate in this shield (<tt> STORAGE CONTROLS</tt>) and are thus stored there for the
duration of
the field cycle.  The other four are used for calibration of the system (<TT>CALIBRATION
CONTROLS</tt>) and will be discussed in Section D of <a href="td03.htm">Readout and
Calibration</a>.<p>


If the field site is far from the laboratory, it is necessary to use additional controls to account
for exposure received in transit (<tt>TRANSIT CONTROLS</tt>).  These controls must be kept
with the
field dosimeters at all times except during field deployment, when they must be kept
somewhere where the exposure rate is known or can be measured independently.<p>



The dosimeter is hung 1 m above the ground, away from large structures that may provide
shielding or additional exposure (see <a href="3_11.gif">Figure 2</a>).  Usually the
dosimeter is left hanging freely to
rotate in the wind for isotropic angular exposure.  At the end of the field cycle, the dosimeters
are returned to the lead shield until they are read out, and a replacement set is deployed in the
field.<p>

<h2><center><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Research at EML is directed toward advancements in environmental applications of
thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD).  This includes investigations of problems associated
with low-level measurements of the gamma and cosmic-ray natural background (de Planque
and Gulbin, 1985; Julius and de Planque, 1984; Gulbin and de Planque, 1983, 1984), as well
as techniques for the separation of neutron and gamma components from artificial sources
(Azziz et al., 1994).  EML organizes the International Intercomparisons of Environmental
Dosimeters, a voluntary program of testing and research on integrating dosimeters for the
measurement of environmental radiation (Klemic et al., 1994; Maiello et al., 1990a,b, 1994;
de Planque and Gazelle, 1986) that attracts participants from around the world.<p>



Consistent procedures for the preparation, packaging, recordkeeping and readout, along with
many QC checks, are necessary to obtain reliable results.  The procedures described here have
been shown to result in high quality measurements that are suitable for low-level
environmental radiation monitoring and for TLD research purposes (see also American
National Standards Institute Report, ANSI N545-1975, and the future release of ANSI
N13.37, which will replace it).<p>

2.   Perform a preread anneal for LiF chips at 100&#176;C for 10 min.  (No preread anneal is
used for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> chips.)<p>



     <b>C.  Initial readout.</b><p>


1.   Read out <b>one </b>chip from each FIELD dosimeter.  After it returns to room
temperature,
the chip is read a second time to measure the background of the system.<p>



2.   Temporarily discontinue readout at this point to prepare the calibration dosimeters.<p>


     <b>D.  Calibration.</b><p>


Four dosimeters are used to calibrate the system during readout.  Two of these are from the
set originally prepared at the start of the field cycle, and two are taken from the set of
replacement dosimeters just prepared.  Thus, while each prepared set includes four calibration
dosimeters,
two will be used right away to calibrate the returning field set and the other two are stored in
the lead shield for the duration of the field cycle to be used at the following readout.  The
calibration is performed as follows:<p>


1.   Examine the range of reader net counts from the initial readout of each field dosimeter
to determine the calibration exposures to use.  Choose three calibration exposures to
bracket the readings given by the field dosimeters and to provide a check on the
linearity of the system.  (The approximate counts per unit exposure is known from
previous readouts.)<p>


2.   Remove the CALIBRATION CONTROLS from the lead shield, noting the date and time
of
retrieval.<p>


3.   Give one CALIBRATION CONTROL an exposure that is expected to yield net counts in
the
range of the lowest result found for the field dosimeters.  Another CALIBRATION
CONTROL is given an exposure corresponding to the highest reading, and the other two
receive an exposure in the middle of this range.<p>


     <b>E.  Resuming readout.</b><p>



1.   Remove the STORAGE CONTROL dosimeters from the lead shield, noting the date and
time.<p>



2.   Anneal all of the control dosimeters in the case of LiF TLDs (the four CALIBRATION
CONTROLS as well as the two STORAGE CONTROLS) for 10 min at 100&#176;C.<p>



3.   Intersperse the STORAGE CONTROL and CALIBRATION CONTROL dosimeters
among the
field dosimeters.  Read out one chip from each dosimeter before going to the next chip
in any dosimeter.  (This provides a QC check against any variations in the system
during readout.)<p>

<h1><center><b>ANALYSIS OF RESULTS</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>


An interactive program that runs on a personal computer (written in Fortran) handles the data
analysis.  A sample input file is shown in Table1.  It includes for each dosimeter:  date and
times of preparation, deployment, return, and readout; gross counts; background counts; and
time of exposure to the cesium source.  The program determines the field exposure by
correcting for exposure received in storage as measured by the storage controls and then
converting counts to exposure by using the calibration controls.  The user is given the option
of rejecting outliers, and the statistical error is propagated throughout each step in the
calculation.  The program returns the net field exposure and exposure rate and the field
deployment time for each field dosimeter.  It also gives information about the exposure rate in
storage, the calibration factor, and any rejected readings.  A sample output file is shown in
Table 2.  Details of the calculations are given below.<p>


     <b>A.  Computing net counts and standard error.</b><p>

<p>

The mean net counts for each dosimeter is:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq1.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     x<sub>i</sub> = gross counts - background counts of<i> i</i>th chip, and<p>

     n  = number of chips per dosimeter<i> (n = 5 usually)</i>.<p>
</ul>
<p>

The standard error of the mean for each dosimeter is:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq2.gif"><p></ul>

<p>

     <b>B.  Outlier check.</b><p>


The program checks for outliers among the individual chip readings in a dosimeter.  Two
different criteria are used:<p>


1.   <i>"Extreme Values" - </i>Individual chip net counts that are &gt; 150% or &lt; 50% of
the
dosimeter average <b>X </b>are flagged.  This test would find missing chips or noise spikes.<p>


2.   <i>"r Test"</i> - This is an outlier test for gaussian distributions (Proschan, 1969).  The
net
counts for the five chips are ranked in order of smallest to the largest, such as x<sub>1</sub>, 
x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>,
x<sub>4</sub>, x<sub>5</sub>.  If the ratio r = (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>) &#247;
(x<sub>5</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>) is larger than 0.780, chip x<sub>1</sub> is flagged. 
Similarly if the ratio r = (x<sub>5</sub> - x<sub>4</sub>) &#247; (x<sub>5</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub>) is larger than 0.780, chip x<sub>5</sub> is flagged. 
This is a more sensitive test that can identify outliers that would be missed by the
extreme value test.  While it is redundant for values beyond 150% of the mean, it could
miss the very low extreme values so both tests are needed.  (Proschan describes more
sensitive tests to apply when more than 7 chips are used.)<p>



In either criterion, the user is then given the option of omitting flagged chips from the
analysis.  No chips are automatically rejected: the final decision is made by the user.  (In
practice data are rarely rejected, and then usually for obvious reasons.)  If a chip is rejected,
the mean net counts and standard error are recalculated for that dosimeter, and a note appears
in the output file.<p>


     <b>C.  Storage exposure rate correction factor.</b><p>

<ul><img src="td04eq3.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     S    =  storage correction factor,<p>

     X<sub>SC1</sub>     =  mean net counts for STORAGE CONTROL #1,<p>

     X<sub>SC2</sub>     =  mean net counts for STORAGE CONTROL #2, and<p>

     t<sub>SC</sub> =    time storage controls were in lead shield <i>(calculated by
subroutine from dates
in input file)</i>.<p>
</ul>


The standard error is propagated through this calculation as:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq4.gif"><p></ul>

With err<sub>SC1</sub> and err<sub>SC2</sub> being the standard error of the storage
controls as defined in Section A
above.  (The error associated with the storage time is negligible, estimated at &lt; 0.01%.)<p>



     <b>D.  Calibration factor.</b><p>

<ul><img src="td04eq5.gif"><p></ul>

where <p>

<ul>

     C    =  calibration factor,<p>

     X<sub>CCi</sub>     =  mean net counts of CALIBRATION CONTROL #<i>i</i>,<p>

     t<sub>CCi</sub>     =    time<i> i</i>th CALIBRATION CONTROL was kept in
lead shield <i>(calculated by
subroutine from dates in input file)</i>, and<p>

exposure<sub>CCi</sub>   =    cesium exposure given to<i> i</i>th calibration control
<i>(calculated from decay
corrected known source strength and time of exposure)</i>.<p>

</ul>

The standard error propagated through this calculation is then:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq6.gif"><p></ul>

(Uncertainties in cesium calibration exposure are treated as systematic rather than statistical
errors and are treated separately.)<p>



The program also performs a linear regression on the corrected counts vs. exposure for the
four calibration dosimeters.  The goodness of fit is a check on the linearity of the system and
the slope may be compared to <b>C</b>.<p>


     <b>E.  Field exposure.</b><p>


     The field site exposure (f) is a function of the quantities calculated above.  The
algorithm used by the program to calculate field site exposure may be summarized as:<p>

<ul><img src="td04eq7.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>
     X<sub>F</sub>  =    mean field dosimeter counts, and<p>



     t<sub>F</sub>  =    time field dosimeters were kept in lead shield<i> (calculated
by subroutine
from dates in input file)</i>.<p>

</ul>

     <b>F.  Error analysis.</b><p>


<center>Total uncertainty = statistical error at 95% confidence + estimated systematic
error</center>
<p>


While the standard error was propagated through all the above calculations using the analytical
propagation of error formulas, for the last step it is easier to calculate the statistical error
numerically as shown below (Bevington and Robinson, 1992).<p>


<ul><img src="td04eq8.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>

     2.776     =    95% confidence interval for 5 chips (4 degrees of freedom)<p>

<img src="td04eq9.gif">
<img src="td04eq10.gif">   
<img src="td04eq11.gif"><p>

</ul>
Systematic error is estimated on a case-by-case basis and added linearly to the statistical error for
reporting the final results.  The estimated systematic uncertainty associated with EML's cesium
source is 2.5%.<p>

     <b>G.  Situations involving transit controls.</b><p>

In cases where TRANSIT CONTROLS are required, the field exposure (Section E) calculation
would instead be: <p>

<ul><img src="td04eq12.gif"><p></ul>

where<p>

<ul>
     T =  mean TRANSIT dosimeter counts corrected for exposure received in storage.<p>
</ul>
If it happens that the TRANSIT CONTROLS are stored in the same lead shield as the other
storage controls during the field cycle (time = t<sub>F</sub>), then 

<ul><img src="td04eq13.gif"><P></ul>

where <p>
<ul>
      X<sub>T</sub> =  mean TRANSIT dosimeter counts.<p>
</ul>
More likely the TRANSIT CONTROLS will be stored in a different lead shield near the field site,
in which case the storage exposure must be measured by some other means.<p>

<h1><center><b>BONNER-SPHERE NEUTRON SPECTROMETRY</b></h1><p>
</center><hr>
<p>

<center>

<h2><b>1.  SCOPE</b></h2><p>

</center>

Described here are EML's moderated multisphere neutron spectrometers, also known as
Bonner sphere neutron spectrometers, and the general principles of their use in neutron
spectrometry.  These spectrometers are used to measure neutron fields:<p>


 1.  that result from cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere (Hajnal et al., 1971;
Nakamura et al., 1987);<p>


 2.  in the containment of pressurized nuclear reactors (Hajnal et al., 1979; Nakamura et
al., 1984; Sanna et al., 1980);<p>


 3.  around unmoderated (fast) reactors (Griffith et al., 1984; Hoots and Wadsworth,
1984);<p>


 4.  in plutonium facilities (Harvey and Hajnal, 1993);<p>


 5.  Fusion test reactors (Kugel et al; 1994a,b).<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>2.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b></h2><p>

</center>

The primary Bonner sphere spectrometer system consists of 12 moderated polyethylene
spheres equipped with boron-trifluoride proportional counters.  The spectrometers are usable
either in parallel or in the independent mode.  In the parallel mode, all the spheres are exposed
simultaneously to the neutron field, while in the independent  mode they are exposed
sequentially.  Sufficient detail is given here for the basic methodology; the references cited
should be consulted for additional information (Aldrich et al., 1981; Awschalom and Sanna,
1985; Cross and Ing, 1987).<p>


At EML, neutron spectrometry is carried out on an occasional basis, usually to answer specific
research requirements or questions.  Consequently, there are not rigidly defined procedures. 
Considerable  expertise and judgement are required to perform Bonner sphere spectrometry,
and this section should be considered as a guide rather than a specific procedure.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>3.  PERSONNEL AND TRAINING</b></h2><p>

</center>


The procedures described in this section should be conducted and/or supervised by an
experienced physicist or nuclear engineer and that individual should be thoroughly familiar
with the content of the references cited in this section.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>4.  METHODOLOGY</b></h2><p>

</center>

<h3><center><b>4.1  Description of the System</b></h3><p>

</center>

Bonner sphere spectrometers have been used extensively in radiation protection practices to
determine neutron spectral distributions around particle accelerators, nuclear power stations and
other nuclear facilities, as well as in cosmic-ray neutron research
for over two decades.  The Bonner sphere spectrometer system is very useful since it is simple,
portable, has an isotropic response, covers a wide energy range, and the data can be unfolded
and interpreted fairly easily (Bramblett et al., 1960).<p>



One drawback of this method is the low energy resolution.  This is partially due to the fact that
the statistical fluctuations in the number of collisions in the neutron slowing down processes
are large,  and the capture reactions are completely indistinguishable from one another.  This
results in loss of information about the primary neutron energy and, consequently, low
resolution.<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>4.2  The Bonner Spheres</b></h3><p>

</center>

The 12 Bonner spheres are: one bare and one 0.075-cm Cd covered 5.08-cm diameter
boron-trifluoride spherical proportional counter, and 10 spherical polyethylene moderators of
7.62-cm, 7.85-cm, 10.01-cm, 10.24-cm, 12.75-cm, 14.94-cm, 15.24-cm, 19.96-cm, 25.04-cm and
30.07-cm diameters, respectively, with spherical proportional counters placed at the centers.<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>4.3  The Response Functions</b></h3><p>

</center>


The Bonner sphere spectrometer response functions must be calculated.  The calculations
should be performed using different numerical methods (such as those incorporated in the
ANISN and MORSE codes), different evaluated neutron cross section sets, and different
energy bining. The response functions of the boron-trifluoride counter equipped Bonner
spheres are calculated using DTF-IV and by ANISN  transport codes in the adjoint mode.  The
calculated detector response functions are considered sufficiently accurate if the results
obtained using different cross section sets and transport codes differ by only a few percent for
the entire energy region (Burgart and Emett, 1972; Maerker et al., 1971).<p>


<p>

<h3><center><b>4.4  Calibrations</b></h3><p>

</center>


The Bonner sphere spectrometer calibrations, whenever possible,  should be performed with
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), monoenergetic neutron beams, and
the normalization  of the overall response functions should be performed using Cf-252
spontaneous fission neutron sources.  At EML, the Cf-252 calibrations  are performed in an open
air calibration facility, where the air and ground scattering contribution in the worst case
amounts to only 3% at 1 m source-to-detector separation (Hajnal et al., 1970; Hunt,
1984a,b).<p>



<p>

<h3><center><b>4.5  Electronics</b></h3><p>

</center>

Since the boron-trifluoride counters are not sensitive to &szlig; or gamma radiation, a simple
electronic
setup is sufficient: a proportional counter is connected to a preamplifier and the signal is fed to
a linear amplifier, followed by a discriminator and a scaler to record the number of capture
reactions.  The scaler readouts can be recorded on tape, or in an appropriate logbook.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>5.  NEUTRON SPECTRUM UNFOLDING</b></h2><p>

</center>

The result of a set of measurements with Bonner spheres is a set of 12 count rates for the 12
detector configurations.  A mathematical method known as unfolding is used to obtain a
neutron spectrum from  these data.  This is accomplished using a computer program entitled
TWOGO developed at EML (Hajnal, 1981).<p>


The relative count rates obtained for a set of 12 counts made with  the Bonner spheres are a
function of the energy distribution of the neutron field.  The unfolding code provides a
reasonable estimate of neutron  fluence rate as a function of energy, i.e., a neutron spectrum
(Ing and Makra, 1978).  The user of TWOGO provides an estimate of the shape, called trial
vector, of the neutron spectrum and the computations performed by TWOGO iteratively adjust
the spectrum to fit or be consistent with the data.  The computations rely on the use of the data
available in the literature regarding the response of the detector in its various configurations, as
a function of neutron energy.  Estimates of the  relative errors of individual counts are used as
weighting factors during the iterative fitting process.<p>


Several indices are computed with the TWOGO program that serve to measure the goodness of
fit of the unfolding process.  These indices are based on determining the degree of agreement
between the data obtained by observation.  That is, count rates due to neutrons for each of the
detector configurations, and synthetic counts or estimates of these same parameters obtained by
folding together the response matrix and the spectrum obtained by the unfolding process.<p>


<p>

<h2><center><b>6.  ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION</b></h2><p>

</center>


A solution can be called exact, approximate, or appropriate (Gold, 1964).  Exact solutions
may have zero errors, and might look reasonable.  However, they may have unphysical
characteristics, such as oscillations, and the &quot;tail-wags-the-dog syndrome&quot; might
appear.
Usually, the unfolded data should not be expected to have too good a fit, at least not better
than the error of the input data.  In general, the trial vectors should contain the features of the
neutron spectra one can expect from the physics of the problem.  Similarly, the smoothing 
functions, if any, have to be properly chosen.  Appropriate solutions can be obtained from
good measurements, and considerable experience is needed to judge just when a reasonable
spectral solution is reached.<p>

<title>RADON AND THORON PROGENY</title>

<h1><center><b>MODIFIED TSIVOGLOU METHOD</b></h1></center>
<p><hr>


<p>

The modified Tsivoglou method is more complicated than the <a href="rtp02.htm">Kusnetz</a>,
but it yields additional
information: the concentration of individual radon progeny (Thomas, 1972).<p>



     <b>A.</b> <b> Procedure.</b><p>

<p>

The sampling procedure is identical to that used for the modified Kusnetz method.  (Actually all
three methods can be used with the same filter containing sampled radon progeny.)<p>


After the end of sampling, remove the filter containing radon progeny from the filter holder and
transfer it to the counting system for analysis.  The standard counting intervals are 2-5, 6-20, and
21-30 min after the end of sampling.  These intervals allow adequate time to transfer the filter
into the counting system and record the counts from the different counting intervals.  The
technician or the person who performs the test is required to stand by for 30 min unless he uses
automated counting equipment operated by a computer.<p>


     <b>B.</b> <b> Calculation.</b><p>


The equations needed to calculate the air concentrations from a 5 min sample and for the
standard counting intervals are:<p>

<img src="rtp03eq1.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq2.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq3.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq4.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>

C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>  =    the concentrations of Po-218, Pb-214, and Bi-214, respectively (Bq/m&#179;),<p>

     C<sub>p</sub>  =    the PAEC (nJ/m&#179;),<p>

     N<sub>t</sub>(...)  =    the net counts in the intervals 2-5, 6-20, and 21-30,<p>

     E    =    fractional counter efficiency [(counts/min) /(disintegrations/min)], and<p>

     Q    =    sampling air flow rate, L/min.<p>
</ul>
These coefficients were derived using 3.05 min for the half life of Po-218 (Martz et al., 1988). 
The half lives used for Pb-214 and Bi-214 were 26.8 and 19.9 min, respectively (ICRP,
1983).<p>

The standard deviation equations which calculate the precision for each radionuclide are:<p>




<img src="rtp03eq5.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq6.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq7.gif"><p>
<img src="rtp03eq8.gif"><p>

where<p>
<ul>

 S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub> = standard deviation of the Po-218, Pb-214,
and Bi-214 (Bq/m&#179;),<p>

 S<sub>p</sub> = standard deviation of the PAEC (nJ/m&#179;), and<p>

 N<sub>t</sub>(...), E and Q were defined earlier.<p>
</ul>
The coefficients in the above four equations are the squares of the corresponding coefficients in
Equations 1-4.  Terms involving the uncertainty of the background count rate have been omitted
because they are seldom significant.<p>

A computer program (<b>WWN5</b>, for a PC; see Table 1) based on the optimizing technique
of Nazaroff (1984) has been written to do the calculations in Equations 1-8.  Results can be
acquired within 15 sec after the end of counting.  The program can also do these calculations
from any three-count radon progeny measurement.
<p>
The two outlined counting procedures can be applied to the same filter sample simply by using
two counting regimes in sequence: three counting intervals [(2-5), (6-20), and (21-30)] for the
modified Tsivoglou method; a single counting interval from 35-45 min after the end of sampling
(<a href="rtp02.htm">modified Kusnetz method</a>).  This provides a useful check against
errors in transcribing data and in calculations.

<h1><center><b>GRAB SAMPLING FOR RADON</b></h1></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

Three sizes of <a href="sp27.html">scintillation flasks</a>, all based on a design described in
George
(1976), are used at EML.  Typical characteristics are shown in Table 1.  The flasks are made at
EML from methylmethacrylate stock.  The bottom plate, made from sheet, is cemented to the
body, made from tubing.  The top plate, also from sheet, slides into the body and is sealed with
an O-ring.  The top plate is fitted with two petcock valves.  All three flasks are designed to be
counted on 12.7-cm phototubes.<p>


As the radon inside the flask decays, most of the radon progeny that are produced plate out on
the interior surfaces of the flask.  The alpha particles from radon and radon progeny interact with
the ZnS(Ag) atoms to produce scintillations which are detected, amplified, and converted to an
electrical signal by the phototube.<p>


          <b>A. Flask coating procedure.</b><p>


In this procedure, we place a thin phosphor coat on all internal surfaces. The thin coating on the
bottom plate adds 15-20% to the sensitivity.  The materials and steps used in this process are
listed below.<p>


          <u><b>Coating materials</u>:</b><p>


1.   Silver activated zinc sulfide phosphor (Wm. B. Johnson Associates, PO Box 472, 216
Edgar
Ave., Ronceverte, WV  24970).<p>



2.   Bonding solution (<b>Caution-Flammable-Use Hood</b>).  Dissolve 30 mL of silicone
fluid (Dow
Corning, Midland, MI; Silicone Fluid 200) in 285 mL of reagent benzene plus 285 mL of
reagent cyclohexane.  Stir until the silicone is completely dissolved.  This is enough to coat
about 100 flasks.<p>



          <b><u>Coating steps (use a hood)</u>:</b><p>



1.   Clean the flask with a nonabrasive cleaner.  [A plastic cleaning foam (REN RP-70 cleaner)
has
been found to be excellent.]<p>



2.   Remove cover, add 50 mL of bonding solution, replace cover, close both valves, and
rotate
the flask slowly until all surfaces including the bottom are coated.  Open valves and remove
cover.<p>



3.   Pour out excess bonding mixture into a second clean flask or return to the stock bottle. 
Let
flask air dry for a few minutes.<p>



4.   Add 15-20 g of phosphor, replace cover, and close valves.<p>


5.   Shake gently until all surfaces are coated.  Open valves and remove cover.<p>



6.   Pour out the loose powder and blow off excess phosphor from the flask and from the
cover
with clean air.<p>



7.   Replace cover and purge the flask with aged (radon free) air or nitrogen for a few minutes. 
Close the valves and store the flask for use.<p>



8.   When background becomes excessive, wipe out phosphor with clean tissue, clean as
above, and rephosphor.<p>



          <b>B. Sampling and counting procedures.</b><p>



1.   Connect a high collection efficiency filter to one valve of the flask to remove particulates
and
radon progeny.  Connect the other valve to an air pump and draw air at 2-10 L/min for 2-5
min for a href="sp27.html">scintillation flasks</a> of 165-2000 mL.<p>



2.   Turn off pump and close both valves.  An alternate method for filling the flask is to
evacuate it
down to 133 Pa (1 mm Hg) of pressure prior to filling with the test atmosphere.<p>



3.   Count the scintillation flask on a 12 cm phototube beginning 3 h after sampling.<p>



4.   To convert the counting rate to radon concentration, use the calibration factor (Cf)
obtained
from a test in a known radon environment and the appropriate decay correction.  Each
scintillation flask should have its own C<sub>f</sub> which can be influenced by its size and by
the
phototube assembly.  It is very important that the entire system (scintillation flask, and
phototube) is calibrated as a unit.  Typical C<sub>f</sub> for the three scintillation flasks used at
EML are
shown in Table 1.<p>





5.   Determine the radon concentration at the time of sampling by applying the decay
correction
(Df):<p>

<IMG SRC="rt02eq1.gif">

<p>

where t is the time in hours from the midpoint of sampling to the midpoint of counting, and
T<sub>1/2</sub>
is
the half-life of radon (91.7 h).<p>

a specialized, skilled workforce and the latest in manufacturing technology.
In the first twenty years, our company produced high quality television
consoles and entertainment units for Japanese and American manufacturers
such as Mitsubishi, Hitachi, RCA, Admiral and Sanyo. As market conditions
changed, D&amp;F / Ragazzi Furniture and its product line did too. The last
five years, more than 200 employees at Ragazzi Furniture have focused solely
on the design and manufacturing of baby and juvenile furniture.<BR>
<BR>
<B>O</B>ur president, son of an Italian carpenter, is committed to old-fashioned
principles of superior quality standards and personalized customer service.
Ragazzi Furniture is designed to grow with your child as evidenced by our
sophisticated styles and nursery furniture features such as our Ragazzi
Baby Caddy and our One-Hand Crib Drop-side mechanism. Everything we do at
Ragazzi Furniture is with your needs in mind. At Ragazzi, you are not just
another customer, you are part of our extended family!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION - UP CLOSE<BR>
<BR>
T</B>he team at <I>RAGAZZI FURNITURE</I> has managed to create the perfect
balance between the traditional beauty of wood, modern design and superior
quality into each collection ....aesthetic yet functional.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>R</I></B><I>AGAZZI</I> wood tone furniture uses only the highest quality
Maple, Oak and Birch solids and veneers. Veneers are carefully &quot;flat
sliced&quot; from the same stock to ensure consistent matched grains on
doors fronts and decorative panels. Each unit is finished with a smooth,
clear, non-toxic, catalyzed<BR>
lacquer that highlights the beauty of the natural wood grain and improves
durability and scratch resistance.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>R</I></B><I>AGAZZI</I> white finished furniture uses super high grade
MDF. Medium Density Fiberboard is used to retain the working qualities of
standard wood stock, yet allow for the superior surface qualities necessary
for smooth white lacquer finishes. An attractive gloss displays a reflective
shine and resists fingerprints and scratches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All <I>RAGAZZI </I>furniture consist of the following features: 
</MENU>
<UL>
  <LI>All drawers are finished on the inside, including the backs and fronts;
  <LI>All drawers have metal drawer rollers; 
  <LI>All drawers have safety stops; 
  <LI>All drawers have 6&quot; wide drawer sides; 
  <LI>All finishes are oven cured to ensure a uniform finish; 
  <LI>All chests have corner blocks to ensure strength; 
</UL>
<MENU><BR>
All <I>RAGAZZI</I> cribs consist of the following features: 
</MENU>
<UL>
  <LI>Meet and exceed the Consumer Product Safety Commission requirements;
  <LI>A &quot;15 YEARS OR 3 CHILDREN&quot; warranty; 
  <LI>A 2- step locking dropside rail; 
  <LI>Single handed noiseless dropside rail; 
  <LI>Rodless crib hardware; 
  <LI>Plastic teething rails; 
  <LI>Casters with brakes; 
  <LI>Most cribs can convert to day bed; 
</UL>

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

The children are to<br>be tested or evaluated by a certified teacher (at your cost) once a <br>year -- there is no statutory deadline for when this is to be completed.<p>That's it!

: Homeschooling in Florida is a piece of cake!  All one needs
: to do is file a notice of intent within 30 days of
: beginning to homeschool with your county superintendent. 
: In the notice you need to include the name, address, and birthdate

: annually.  Keep good records, like a portfolio of your child's
: work because they could be subject to inspection by the superintendent

: There are no teacher qualifications for the parents.  The children are to
: be tested or evaluated by a certified teacher (at your cost) once a 
: year -- there is no statutory deadline for when this is to be completed.

: That's it!  There's nothing in your way of homeschooling your child if
: that's what you wish.

: The closest group I could find to St. Lucie is:

: Florida Parent Educators Association (FPEA)
: District Melbourne-Ft. Pierce
: 406 Dartmouth West
: Melbourne, FL  32901-6948
: 407-723-1714

: My consulting firm, The Homeschool Connection, Inc., also
: has a Florida branch office on the west coast in Spring Hill.
: Let me know if you'd like to receive more information.
