<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Common Sense Tools for the Federal Workplace</H1>

Thank you for joining our effort to make our government work better, cost less, and better serve all of our customers.<P>

The federal government is changing.  For three years, federal workers have achieved much by;
<UL>
	<LI> 	Putting customers first,
	<LI>	Cutting bureaucracy and red tape,
            <LI>	Empowering employees to achieve results,
	<LI> 	Making choices that cut back to basics.
</UL>
<P>
Federal change champions have used three over arching strategies; 1) developing leadership and vision, 2) creating customer-focused organizations, and 3) fixing the federal workplace.
<P>

The National Performance Review is using this website to create, on-line, a framework of common sense tools for federal employees who are leading and implementing these change strategies and those who wish to.  The tools are divided into <A HREF="#fifteen">15 categories.</A>  NPR is asking you for help.  Please review these 15 categories and give us your reactions and suggestions. 
In the future this page will be interactive for reinventors.  However for now, tell us of any other tool categories,  resources, and success stories which we can share with other users of this website.  <P>

<I>Brevity works!</I>  Describe in no more that 2-3 sentences how you've used a particular tool and where available provide a URL address for incorporation into NPR's electronic toolbox framework.  List useful resources or authorities, when relevant.  It's also important to include a point of contact with a phone number and/or email address if available so that reinventors can be connected.  Our 
<A HREF="#fifteen">initial 15 tool categories </A> are;

<H1>Ten Things You Can Do Now That You Couldn't Do--or Didn't Do--Before Reinvention*</H1>

	<H2>*That is, if your agency is committed to Reinvention</H2>
</CENTER>

Reinventing government means cutting red tape and ending bureaucratic hassles for federal employees as well as our customers. We've had several reforms that not only reduce administrative headaches, they save millions of dollars. These reforms resulted from legislation, executive orders, applying new technologies, getting rid of or relaxing government-wide rules, or dusting off old rules and voil&agrave; finding that we could do some things all along. 
<OL>
<LI>      Your agency can get rid of sign-in sheets and other time and attendance busywork. The General Accounting Office released a revised Title 6 of its Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies on March 22, 1996. Call Barry Grinnell, GAO, at (202) 512-9530.

<LI>      You can survey your customers without getting advance clearance from the Office of Management and Budget as long as your agency has worked out a generic umbrella agreement with OMB. You must send copies to OMB a week or so before you to to the public. Call your agency's Paperwork Reduction Act focal point. For more information, call Jeff Hill, OMB, at (202) 395-7340.

<LI>      You can buy many supplies commercially (up to $5,000 per item) instead of buying from the General Services Administration (41 CFR 101-26.301.b). For the few exceptions, call Henry Maury, GSA, (202) 208-7928, or e-mail: henry.maury@gsa.gov. Lots of information and online ordering are available from GSA Advantage! on the Web at http://www.gsa.gov.

<LI>      You can buy what you need with a government-issued credit card, up to the limits set by your agency, and anyone permitted by your agency can have a card. If it costs no more than $2,500, you can use the micro-purchase procedures in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994. These procedures, which do not require procurement expertise, will be sent to you with your credit card. Call Doris Marsh, GSA, (703) 305-7564.

<LI>      As soon as GSA completes the regulations, your procurement office can simplify its procedures for buying commercial items that cost over $100,000 but not more than $5 million. It can also reduce the number of suppliers it has to negotiate with after getting initial proposals. The Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA) was signed into law on Feb. 10, 1996.

<LI>      Your agency will soon be able to buy computer systems, regardless of value, without getting approval from the General Services Administration. The Information Technology Management Reform Act, signed into law on February 10, 1996, repealed the 1965 Brooks Act and made buying computers easier. It's effective on August 8. Call Kenneth Touloumes, GSA, at (202) 501-1126.

<LI>      You don't have to submit receipts for most travel expenses under $75 (41 CFR chapters 301-304). Exceptions are the cost of lodging under the lodgings-plus-per-diem system and a list of 18 specific items that require a receipt regardless of amount. (The receipt threshold for the 18 items is being raised to the standard $75 in a forthcoming FTR amendment.) Call Jane Groat or Joddy Garner at GSA, (202) 501-1538.<P>


Lots of reforms are coming down the pike to reduce red tape for the traveler. Call (202) 512-9201 to talk with staff of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program. Call (202) 512-6000 to get a copy of their report,  Improving Travel Management Governmentwide. <P>

The report is also on the World Wide Web. See FinanceNet (http//www.financenet.gov). You may also use Gopher. To get a menu, use this address: gopher://gopher.financenet.gov. The actual address is gopher://pula.financenet.gov:70/00/docs/central/jfmip/travel.rpt.<P>


<LI>      You can stop writing a lot of reports that almost nobody reads. The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-66), signed by the President on December 21, 1995, repealed scores of Congressionally-mandated reporting by federal agencies and requires the rest to be sunset in 5 years unless specifically extended.

<LI>      You have a choice in what you use to apply for a federal job-- a resume like the rest of the world, a new abbreviated Optional Form 612, or even the old Standard Form 171. You also don't have to bother with the 10,000-page Federal Personnel Manual because the Office of Personnel Management got rid of all of it in 1994. Contact: Richard Whitford, OPM, at (202) 606-1031. 

<LI>      You can use outside commercial recruiters and you may contract for outside temporary help. With recent changes in law, you can directly recruit, examine, and hire staff. Call Allan Heuerman at (202) 606-2800 to get a copy of the Template of Personnel Flexibilities  released by the Office of Personnel Management on March 27, 1996.<P>
</OL>

<H3>Is There a Catch?</H3>
Yes, there s a catch. Even though many legislative and central control barriers are falling, it takes agency leadership committed to reinvention to use the new flexibilities to create a more trusting, less restrictive environment for federal workers. Not every federal office is a model of reinvention.<P>

The new time and attendance procedures from GAO are guidelines, not mandates. The latest procurement law encourages use of the credit card for purchases under $2,500, but does not require it. One disgusted program official said using the card was so rule-bound in her agency that many managers refused to have anything to do with it. These constraints were imposed by her own agency.  It's short-sighted for federal agencies not to cut their internal red tape, considering the potential big dollar savings,  said NPR Deputy John Kamensky.  Travel reforms, for example, can save possibly $800 million governmentwide every year. We can't afford old ways of doing things in a balanced budget world. <P>

<H3>From the Field:  There s No Support Yet for the Multitude of Small Reforms </H3>
The Reinvention Coordinator in one agency, chafing over a mandatory publications review process and a burdensome requirement to provide receipts for small-ticket airport parking, provided feedback by way of the National Performance Review's home page (http://www.npr.gov):<P>

<I>"....Nearly every week we run into problems with offices who make or enforce requirements that need to be reformed, but aren t going to be because those in charge are either protecting their authorities or have simply not understood and/or accepted the message of Vice President Gore and the NPR to reduce red tape and eliminate existing roadblocks to progress and change.</I> <P>

<I>....The large reforms have had good NPR support, but there's no support yet for the multitude of small reforms that collectively could revitalize the government quickly and create sweeping government improvements."  </I><P>

<H2 align=center>1993 Report - Executive Summary</H2>

<H2>Chapter 1</H2>


<H3>Cutting Red Tape</H3>



About 10 years ago, two foresters returned from a hard day in the field to make plans for the coming week. Searching for a detail of agency policy,  they found themselves overwhelmed by
voluminous editions of policy manuals,  reports, and binders filled with thousands of directives. One forester recalled the very first  Forest Service manual- -small enough to fit into every ranger's shirt pocket, yet  containing everything foresters needed to know to do their jobs.
<P>
"Why is it that when we have a problem," the other forester asked, "the solution is always to add something--a report, a system, a policy--but never take something away?" 
<P>
The first replied: "What if . . . we could just start over?" 
<P>
     The federal government does at least one thing well: It generates red tape. But not one inch of that red tape appears by accident. In fact, the government creates it all with the best of intentions. It is time now to put aside our reverence for those good intentions and examine what they have created--a system that makes it hard for our civil servants to do what we pay them for, and frustrates taxpayers who rightfully expect their money's worth.
<P>
     Because we don't want politicians' families, friends, and supporters placed in "no-show" jobs, we have more than 100,000 pages of personnel rules and regulations defining in exquisite detail how to hire, promote, or fire federal employees. Because we don't want employees or private companies profiteering from federal contracts, we create procurement processes that require endless signatures and long months to buy almost anything. Because we don't want agencies using tax dollars for any
unapproved purpose, we dictate precisely how much they can spend on everything from staff to telephones to travel.
<P>
     And because we don't want state and local governments using federal funds for purposes that Congress did not intend, we write regulations telling them exactly how to run most programs that receive federal funds. We call for their partnership in dealing with our country's most urgent domestic problems, yet we do not treat them as equal partners.
<P>
     Consider some examples from the daily lives of federal workers, people for whom red tape means being unable to do their jobs as well as they can--or as well as we deserve. The district managers of Oregon's million-acre Ochoco National Forest have 53 separate budgets--one for fence maintenance, one for fence construction, one for brush burning- -divided into 557 management codes and 1,769 accounting lines. To transfer money between accounts, they need approval from headquarters. They estimate the task of tracking spending in each account consumes at least 30 days of their time every year, days they could spend doing their real jobs. It also sends a message: You are not trusted with even the simplest responsibilities.
<P>
     Or consider the federal employees who repair cars and trucks at naval bases. Each time they need a spare part, they order it through a central purchasing office--a procedure that can keep vehicles in the shop for a month. This keeps one-tenth of the fleet out of commission, so the Navy buys 10 percent more
vehicles than it needs. Or how about the new Energy Department petroleum engineer who requested a specific kind of calculator to do her job? Three months later, she received an adding machine. Six months after that, the procurement office got her a
calculator--a tiny, hand-held model that could not perform the complex calculations her work required. Disgusted, she bought her own.
<P>
     Federal managers read the same books and attend the same conferences as private sector managers. They know what good management looks like. They just can't put it into
practice--because they face constraints few managers in the private sector could imagine. 
<P>
     Hamstrung by rules and regulations, federal managers simply do not have the power to shape their organizations enjoyed by private sector managers. Their job is to make sure that every dollar is spent in the budget category and the year for which it was appropriated, that every promotion is consistent with central guidelines, and that every piece of equipment is bought through competitive bidding. In an age of personal computers, they are asked to write with quill pens.

<P>
     This thicket of rules and regulations has layer upon layer of additional oversight. Each new procedure necessitates
someone's approval. The result is fewer people doing real work, more people getting in their way. As management sage Peter Drucker once said, "So much of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to work."
<P>
     As Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, told participants at the Philadelphia Summit on Reinventing Government, "The regulations and statutes that bind federal employees from exercising discretion available in the private sector all come about as a response to the humiliations, mistakes, embarrassments of the past." Even though, as Tobias noted, "those problems are 15, 20, 30 years old," and "the regulations and the statutes don't change." The need to enforce the regulations and statutes, in turn, creates needless layers of bureaucracy.
<P>
     The layers begin with "staff" agencies, such as the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM). These staff agencies were designed originally to provide specialized support for "line" agencies,  such as the Interior and Commerce departments, that do government's real work. But as rules and regulations began to proliferate, support turned into control. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which serves the President in the budget process, runs more than 50 compliance, clearance, and review processes. Some of this review is necessary to ensure budget control and consistency of agency actions--with each other and with the President's
program--but much of it is overkill. 
<P>
     Line agencies then wrap themselves in even more red tape by creating their own budget offices, personnel offices, and
procurement offices. Largely in response to appropriations committees, budget offices divide congressional budgets into increasingly tiny line items. A few years ago, for example, base managers in one branch of the military had 26 line items for housing repairs alone. Personnel offices tell managers when they can and cannot promote, reward, or move employees. And
procurement offices force managers to buy through a central monopoly, precluding agencies from getting what they need, when they need it.
<P>
     What the staff agencies don't control, Congress does. Congressional appropriations often come with hundreds of strings attached. The Interior Department found that language in its 1992 House, Senate, and conference committee reports included some 2,150 directives, earmarks, instructions, and prohibitions.  As the federal budget tightens, lawmakers request increasingly specific report language to protect activities in their
districts. Indeed, 1993 was a record year for such requests. In one appropriations bill alone, senators required the U.S. Customs Service to add new employees to its Honolulu office, prohibited closing any small or rural post office or U.S. Forest Service offices; and forbade the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from even studying the idea of contracting out guard duties.
<P>
     Even worse, Congress often gives a single agency multiple missions, some of which are contradictory. The Agency for
International Development has more than 40 different objectives, disposing of American farm surpluses, building democratic
institutions, and even strengthening the American land grant college system. No wonder it has trouble accomplishing its real mission--promoting international development. 
<P>
     In Washington, we must work together to untangle the knots of red tape that prevent government from serving the American people well. We must give cabinet secretaries, program directors and line managers much greater authority to pursue their real purposes. 
<P>
     As Theodore Roosevelt said: "The best executive is the one who has the sense to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it."
<P>
     Our path is clear: We must shift from systems that hold people accountable for process to systems that hold them
accountable for results. We discuss accountability for results in chapter 3. In this chapter, we focus on six steps necessary to strip away the red tape that so engulfs our federal employees and frustrates the American people. 
<UL>
     <LI>First, we will streamline the budget process, to remove the manifold restrictions that consume managers' time and literally force them to waste money. 
<LI>
     Second, we will decentralize personnel policy, to give managers the tools they need to manage effectively--the authority to hire, promote, reward, and fire. 
<LI>
     Third, we will streamline procurement, to reduce the
enormous waste built into the process we use to buy &#036;200 billion a year in goods and services. 
<LI>
     Fourth, we will reorient the inspectors general, to shift their focus from punishing those who violate rules and
regulations to helping agencies learn to perform better. 
<LI>
     Fifth, we will eliminate thousands of other regulations that hamstring federal employees, to cut the final Lilliputian ropes on the federal giant.
<LI>
     Finally, we will deregulate state and local governments, to empower them to spend more time meeting customer
needs--particularly with their 600 federal grant programs--and less time jumping through bureaucratic hoops.
</ul>
<p>
     As we pare down the systems of over-control and
micromanagement in government, we must also pare down the
structures that go with them: the oversized headquarters,
multiple layers of supervisors and auditors, and offices
specializing in the arcane rules of budgeting, personnel,
procurement, and finance. We cannot entirely do without
headquarters, supervisors, auditors, or specialists, but these structures have grown twice as large as they should be. 
<P>
     Counting all personnel, budget, procurement, accounting, auditing, and headquarters staff, plus supervisory personnel in field offices, there are roughly 700,000 federal employees whose job it is to manage, control, check up on or audit others. This is one third of all federal civilian employees.
<P>
     Not counting the suffocating impact these management control structures have on line managers and workers, they consume &#036;35 billion a year in salary and benefits alone.  If Congress enacts the management reforms outlined in this report, we will
dramatically cut the cost of these structures. We will reinvest some of the savings in the new management tools we need,
including performance measurement, quality management, and training. Overall, these reforms will result in the net
elimination of approximately 252,000 positions. (This will include the 100,000 position reduction the President has already set in motion.)
<P>
     A reduction of 252,000 positions will reduce the civilian, non-postal work force by almost 12 percent--bringing it below two million for the first time since the 1966. 
<P>
     This reduction, targeted at the structures of control and micromanagement, is designed to improve working conditions for the average federal employee. We cannot empower employees to give us their best work unless we eliminate much of the red tape that now prevents it. We will do everything in the government's power to ease the transition for workers, whether they choose to stay with government, retire, or move to the private sector.
<P>
     Our commitment is this: If an employee whose job is
eliminated cannot retire through our early retirement program, and does not elect to take a cash incentive to leave government service, we will help that employee find another job offer, either with government or in the private sector. 
<P>
     Normal attrition will contribute to the reduction. In addition, we will introduce legislation to permit all agencies to offer cash payments to those who leave federal service
voluntarily, whether by retirement or resignation. The Department of Defense (DOD) and intelligence community already have this "buy-out" authority; we will ask Congress to extend it to all agencies. We will also give agencies broad authority to offer early retirement and to expand their retraining, out-placement efforts, and other tools as necessary to accomplish the 12% reduction. Agencies will be able to use these tools as long as they meet their cost reduction targets.
<P>
     These options will give federal managers the same tools commonly used to downsize private businesses. Even with these investments, the downsizing we propose will save the taxpayer billions over the next 5 years.
<P>
     None of this will be easy. Downsizing never is. But the result will not only be a smaller workforce, it will also be a more empowered, more inspired, and more productive workforce.      As one federal employee told Vice President Gore at one of his many town meetings, "If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you always got." We can no longer afford to get what we've always got.
<P>

<H2>Step 1: Streamlining The Budget Process</H2>
<P>
     Most people can't get excited about the federal budget process, with its green-eyeshade analysts, complicated
procedures, byzantine language, and reams of minutiae. Beyond such elements, however, lies a basic, unalterable reality. For organizations of all kinds, nothing is more important than the process of resource allocation: what goal is sought, how much money they have, what strings are attached to it, and what hurdles are placedble reality. For organizations of all kinds, nothing is more important than the process of resource
allocation: what goal is sought, how much money they have, what strings are attached to it, and what hurdles are placed before managers who must spend it.
<P>
     In government, budgeting is never easy.  After all, the budget is the most political of documents.  If, as the political scientist Harold D. Lasswell once said, politics is "who gets what, when, how," the budget answers that question. By crafting a budget, public officials decide who pays what taxes and who receives what benefits. The public's largesse to children, the elderly, the poor, the middle class, and others is shaped by the budgets that support cities, states, and the federal government.      But if budgeting is inherently messy, such messiness is costly. Optimally, the budget would be more than the product of struggles among competing interests. It also would reflect the thoughtful planning of our public leaders. No one can improve quality and cut costs without planning to do so.
<P>
     Unfortunately, the most deliberate planning is often
subordinated to politics, and is perhaps the last thing we do in constructing a budget. Consider our process. Early in the year, each agency estimates what it will need to run its programs in the fiscal year that begins almost 2 years later. This is like asking someone to figure out not only what they will be doing, but how much it will cost 3 years later--since that's when the money will be spent. Bureau and program managers typically examine the previous year's activity data and project the figures 3 years out, with no word from top political leaders on their priorities, or even on the total amount that they want to spend. In other words, planning budgets is like playing "pin the tail on the donkey." Blindfolded managers are asked to hit an unknown target.
<P>
     OMB, acting for the President, then crafts a proposed budget through back-and forth negotiations with departments and
agencies, still a year before the fiscal year  it will govern. Decisions are struck on dollars--dollars that, to agencies, mean people, equipment, and everything else they need for their jobs. OMB's examiners may question agency staff as they develop options papers, OMB's director considers the options during his
Director's Review meetings, OMB "passes back" recommended funding levels for the agencies, and final figures are worked out during a final appeals process. 
<P>
     Early the next year, the President presents a budget
proposal to Congress for the fiscal year beginning the following October 1. Lawmakers, the media, and interest groups pore over the document, searching for winners and losers, new spending proposals, and changes in tax laws. In the ensuing months, Congress puts its own stamp on the plan. Although House and Senate budget committees, guide Congress' action, every committee plays a role.
<P>
     Authorizing committees debate the merits of existing
programs and the President's proposals for changes within their subject areas. While they decide which programs should continue and recommend funding levels, separate appropriations committees draft the 13 annual spending bills that actually comprise the budget. 
<P>
     Congressional debates over a budget resolution,
authorization bills, and appropriations drag on, often into the fall. Frequently the President and Congress don't finish by October 1, so Congress passes one or more "continuing
resolutions" to keep the money flowing, often at the previous year's level. Until the end, agency officials troop back and forth to OMB and to the Hill to make their case. States and localities, organizations and advocates seek time to argue their cause. Budget staffs work non-stop, preparing estimates and projections on how this or that change will affect revenues or spending. All this work is focused on making a budget--not planning or delivering programs. 
<P>
     Ironies riddle the process.
<UL>
     <LI> Uncertainty reigns: Although they begin calculating their budget 2 years ahead, agency officials do not always know by October 1 how much they will have to spend and frequently don't even receive their money until well into the fiscal year.        OMB is especially prone to question unspent funds--and reduce the ensuing year's budget by that amount. Agency officials inflate their estimates, driving budget numbers higher and higher. One bureau budget director claims that many regularly ask for 90 percent more than they eventually receive.

    <LI> Despite months of debate, Congress compresses its actual decision-making on the budget into such a short time frame that many of the public's highest priorities--what to do about drug addiction, for example, or how to prepare workers for jobs in the 21st century--are discussed only briefly, if at all.

    <LI> The process is devoid of the most useful information. We do not know what last year's money, or that of the year before, actually accomplished. Agency officials devise their funding requests based on what they got before, not whether it produced results. 
</UL>

<P>
     In sum, the budget process is characterized by fictional requests and promises, an obsession with inputs rather than outcomes, and a shortage of debate about critical national needs. We must start to plan strategically--linking our spending with priorities and performance. First, we must create a rational budgeting system.
<P>

<H3>Action: The President should begin the budget process with an executive budget resolution, setting broad policy priorities and allocating funds by function for each agency.</H3>
<P>
     Federal managers should focus primarily on the content of the budget, not on the process. A new executive budget resolution will help them do that. The President should issue a directive in early 1994 to mandate the use of such a resolution in developing his fiscal year 1996 budget. It will turn the executive budget process upside down. 
<P>
     To develop the resolution, officials from the White House policy councils will meet with OMB and agency officials. In those sessions, the administration's policy leadership will make decisions on overall spending and revenue levels, deficit
reduction targets, and funding allocations for major inter-agency policy initiatives. The product of these meetings--a resolution completed by August--will provide agencies with funding ceilings and allocations for major policy missions. Then, bureaus will generate their own budget estimates, now knowing their agency's priorities and fiscal limits. 
<P>
     Our own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tried a similar approach in the 1970s as part of a zero-based budgeting trial run. Although zero-based budgeting fell short, participants said, two important advantages emerged: a new responsiveness to internal customer needs and a commitment to final decisions. When participants voted to cut research and development funds because they felt researchers ignored program needs, researchers began asking programs managers what kind of research would support their efforts. EPA also found that, after its leaders had
agonized over funding, they remained committed to common
decisions.
<P>
     Critics may view the executive budget resolution process as a top-down tool that will stifle creative, bottom-up suggestions for funding options. We think otherwise. The resolution will render top officials responsible for budget totals and policy decisions, but will encourage lower-level ingenuity to devise funding options within those guidelines. By adopting this plan, we will help discourage non-productive micro-management by senior department and agency officials.
<P>
     
<H3>Action: Institute biennial budgets and appropriations.</H3>
<P>
     We should not have to enact a budget every year. Twenty states adopt budgets for 2 years. (They retain the power to make small adjustments in off years if revenues or expenditures deviate widely from forecasts). As a result, their governors and legislatures have much more time to evaluate programs and develop longer-term plans. 
<P>
     Annual budgets consume an enormous amount of management time--time not spent serving customers. With biennial budgets, rather than losing months to a frantic "last-year's
budget-plus-X-percent" exercise, we might spend more time
examining which programs actually work.
<P>
     The idea of biennial budgeting has been around for some time. Congressman Leon Panetta, now OMB director, introduced the first biennial budgeting bill in 1977, and dozens have been offered since. Although none have passed, the government has some experience with budget plans that cover 2 years or more. In 1987, the President and Congress drafted a budget plan for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 that set spending levels for major categories, enabling Congress to enact all 13 appropriations bills on time for the first time since 1977.
<P>
     In addition, Congress directed the Defense Department to submit a biennial budget for fiscal 1988 and 1989 to give
Congress more time for broad policy oversight. At the time, Congress asserted that a biennial budget would "substantially improve DOD management and congressional oversight," and that a two-year DOD budget was an important step toward across-the-board biennial budgeting.  Administrations have continued to submit biennial budgets for DOD.
<P>
     The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act and the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act set 5-year spending limits for discretionary spending and pay-as-you-go requirements for mandatory programs. With these multi-year caps in place, neither the President nor Congress has to decide the total level of discretionary spending each year. These caps provide even more reason for biennial budgets and appropriations. In Congress, 7 out of 10 members favor a biennial process with a 2-year budget resolution and multi-year authorizations. The time is ripe.
<P>
     We recommend that Congress establish biennial budget
resolutions and appropriations and multi-year authorizations. The first biennium should begin October 1, 1996, to cover fiscal years 1997 and 1998. After that, bienniums would begin October 1 of each even-numbered year. Such timing would allow President Clinton to develop the first comprehensive biennial federal budget, built on the new executive budget resolution. In off years, the President would submit only amendments for exceptional areas of concern, emergencies, or other unforeseen circumstances. 
<P>
     Biennial budgeting will not make our budget decisions easier, for they are shaped by competing interests and
priorities. But it will eliminate an enormous amount of busy work that keeps us from evaluating programs and meeting customer needs.
<P>

<H3>Action: OMB, departments, and agencies will minimize budget restrictions such as apportionments and allotments.</H3>
<P>
     Congress typically divides its appropriations into more than 1,000 accounts. Committee reports specify thousands of other restrictions on using money. OMB apportions each account by quarter or year, and sometimes divides it into sub-accounts by line-item or object class--all to control over-spending.
Departmental budget offices further divide the money into
allotments.
<P>
     Thus, many managers find their money fenced into hundreds of separate accounts. In some agencies, they can move funds among accounts. In others, Congress or the agency limits the transfer of funds, trapping the money. When that happens, managers must spend money where they have it, not where they need it. On one military base, for example, managers had no line item to purchase snowplow equipment, but they did have a maintenance account. When the snowplow broke down they leased one, using the maintenance account. Unfortunately, the 1-year lease cost &#036;100,000--the same as the full purchase price.
<P>
     Such stories are a dime a dozen within the federal
bureaucracy. (They may be the only government cost that is coming down.) Good managers struggle to make things work, but, trapped by absurd constraints, they are driven to waste billions of dollars every year.
<P>
     Stories about the legendary end-of-the-year spending rush also abound. Managers who don't exhaust each line item at year's end usually are told to return the excess. Typically, they get less the next time around. The result: the well-known spending frenzy. The National Performance Review received more examples of this source of waste--in letters, in calls, and at town
meetings--than any other. 
<P>
     Most managers know how to save 5 or 10 percent of what they spend. But knowing they will get less money next year, they have little reason to save. Instead, smart managers spend every penny of every line item. Edwin G. Fleming, chief of the Resources Management Division of the Internal Revenue Service's Cleveland District, put it well in a letter to the Treasury Department's Reinvention Team: 
<P>
     Every manager has saved money, only to have his allocation     reduced in the subsequent year. This usually happens only     once, then the manager becomes a spender rather than a     planner. Managing becomes watching after little pots of     money that can't be put where it makes business sense     because of reprogramming restrictions. So managers, who are     monitors of these little pots of money, are rewarded for the     ability to maneuver, however limitedly, through the baroque     and bizarre world of federal finance and procurement. 
<P>
     Solutions to these problems exist. They have been tested in local governments, in state governments, even in the federal government. Essentially, they involve budget systems with fewer line items, more authority for managers to move money among line items, and freedom for agencies to keep some or all of what they save--thus minimizing the incentive for year-end spending sprees. 
     <P>
Typically, federal organizations experimenting with such budgets have found that they can achieve better productivity, sometimes with less money. 
<P>
     During an experiment at Oregon's Ochoco National Forest in the 1980s, when dozens of accounts were reduced to six,
productivity jumped 25 percent the first year and 35 percent more the second. A 1991 Forest Service study indicated that the experiment had succeeded in bringing gains in efficiency,
productivity, and morale, but had failed to provide the Forest Service region with a mechanism for complying with congressional intent. After 3 years of negotiations, Washington and Region 6, where the Ochoco Forest is located, couldn't agree. The region wanted to retain the initial emphasis on performance goals and targets so forest managers could shift money from one account to another if they met performance goals and targets. Washington argued that Congress would not regard such targets as a serious measure of congressional intent. The experiment ended in March 1993.
<P>     
When the Defense Department allowed several military bases to experiment with what was called the Unified Budget Test, base commanders estimated that they could accomplish their missions with up to 10 percent less money. If this experience could be applied to the entire government, it could mean huge savings.       Beginning with their fiscal year 1995 submissions to OMB, departments and agencies will begin consolidating accounts to minimize restrictions and manage more effectively. They will radically cut the number of allotments used to subdivide
accounts. In addition, they will consider using the Defense Department's Unified Budget plan, which permits shifts in funds between allotments and cost categories to help accomplish
missions.
<P>
     OMB will simplify the apportionment process, which
hamstrings agencies by dividing their funding into amounts that are available, bit by bit, according to specified time periods, activities, or projects. Agencies often don't get their funding on time and, after they do, must fill out reams of paperwork to show that they adhered to apportionment guidelines. OMB will also expedite the "reprogramming" process, by which agencies can move funds within congressionally appropriated accounts. Currently, OMB and congressional subcommittees approve all such
reprogrammings. OMB should automatically approve reprogramming unless it objects within a set period, such as five days.
<P>
     While understandable in some cases, such earmarks hamper agencies that seek to manage programs efficiently. Agencies should work with appropriations subcommittees on this problem. 
<P>
<H3>Action: OMB and agencies will stop using full-time equivalent ceilings, managing and budgeting instead with ceilings on
operating costs to control spending.</H3>
<P>
     In another effort to control spending, both the executive and legislative branches often limit the number of each agency's employees by using full-time equivalent (FTE) limits. When agencies prepare their budget estimates, they must state how many FTEs they need in addition to how many dollars. Then, each department or agency divides that number into a ceiling for each bureau, division, branch, or other unit. Congress occasionally complicates the situation by legislating FTE floors. 
<P>
     Federal managers often cite FTE controls as the single most oppressive restriction on their ability to manage. Under the existing system, FTE controls are the only way to make good on the President's commitment to reduce the federal bureaucracy by 100,000 positions through attrition. But as we redesign the government for greater accountability, we need to use budgets, rather than FTE controls, to drive our downsizing. FTE ceilings are usually imposed independently of--and often conflict
with--budget allocations. They are frequently arbitrary, rarely account for changing circumstances, and are normally imposed as across-the-board percentage cuts in FTEs for all of an agency's units- -regardless of changing circumstances. Organizations that face new regulations or a greater workload don't get new FTE ceilings. Consequently, they must contract out work that could be done better and cheaper in-house. One manager at Vice President Gore's meeting with foreign affairs community employees at the State Department in May 1993 offered an example: his FTE limit had forced him to contract out for a junior programmer for the Foreign Service Institute. As it turned out, the programmer's hourly rate equaled the Institute Director's, so the move cost money instead of saving it. 
<P>
     The President should direct OMB and agency heads to stop setting FTE ceilings in fiscal year 1995.
<P>
     For this transition, the agencies' accounting systems will have to separate true operating costs from program and other costs. Some agencies already have such systems in place; others must develop financial management systems to allow them to calculate these costs. We address this issue in a separate recommendation in chapter 3. 
<P>
     This recommendation fully supports the President's
commitment to maintain a reduced federal workforce. Instead of controlling the size of the federal workforce by employment ceilings--which cause inefficiencies and distortions in managers' personnel and resource allocation decisions--this new system will control the federal workforce by dollars available in operating funds.
<P>


<H3>Action: Minimize congressional restrictions such as line items, earmarks, and eliminate FTE floors.</H3>
<P>
     Congress should also minimize the restrictions and earmarks that it imposes on agencies. With virtually all federal spending under scrutiny for future cuts, Congress is increasingly applying earmarks to ensure that funding flows to favored programs and hometown projects.
<P>
     Imagine the surprise of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who a few months after taking office discovered that he was under orders from Congress to maintain 23 positions in the
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, field office of his department's anthracite reclamation program. Or that his department was required to spend &#036;100,000 to train beagles in Hawaii to sniff out brown tree snakes. Edward Derwinski, former secretary of Veteran Affairs, was once summoned before the Texas congressional delegation to explain his plan to eliminate 38 jobs in that state. 

<P>
<H3>Action: Allow agencies to roll over 50 percent of what they do not spend on internal operations during a fiscal year.</H3>
<P>
     As part of its 13 fiscal year 1995 appropriations bills, Congress should permanently allow agencies to roll over 50 percent of unobligated year-end balances in all appropriations for operations. It should allow agencies to use up to 2 percent of rolled-over funds to finance bonuses for employees involved. This approach, which the Defense Department and Forest Service have used successfully, would reward employees for finding more productive ways to work. Moreover, it would create incentives to save the taxpayers' money.
<P>
     Shared savings incentives work. In 1989, the General
Accounting Office (GAO) discovered that the Veterans
Administration had not recovered &#036;223 million in health payments from third parties, such as insurers. Congress then changed the rules, allowing the VA to hire more staff to keep up with the paperwork and also to keep a portion of recovered third-party payments for administrative costs. VA recoveries soared from &#036;24 million to &#036;530 million.
<P>
     If incentives to save are to be real, Congress and OMB will have to refrain from automatically cutting agencies' budgets by the amount they have saved when they next budget is prepared. Policy decisions to cut spending are one thing; automatic cuts to take back savings are quite another. They simply confirm
managers' fears that they will be penalized for saving money. Agencies' chief financial officers should intervene in the budget process to ensure that this does not happen.
<P>


<H2>Step 2: Decentralizing Personnel Policy</H2>

     Our federal personnel system has been evolving for more than 100 years--ever since the 1881 assassination of President James A. Garfield by a disappointed job seeker. And during that time, according to a 1988 Office of Personnel Management publication:       ...anecdotal mistakes prompted additional rules. When the     rules led to new inequities, even more rules were added.     Over time...a maze of regulations and requirements was     created, hamstringing managers...often impeding federal     managers and employees from achieving their missions and     from giving the public a high quality of service. 
<P>
     Year after year, layer after layer, the rules have piled up. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board reports there are now 850 pages of federal personnel law--augmented by 1,300 pages of OPM regulations on how to implement those laws and another 10,000 pages of guidelines from the Federal Personnel Manual.
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE Border width="70%">
<TR><TH>Catch-22</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Our federal personnel system ought to place a value on experience.  
That's not always the case. Consider the story of Rosalie Tapia. Ten 
 years ago, fresh from high school, she joined the Army and was  
assigned to Germany as a clerk. She served out her enlistment with  
an excellent record, landed a job in Germany as a civilian secretary  
for the Army, and worked her way up to assistant to the division chief. 
 When the Cold War ended, Tapia wanted to return to the U.S. and  
transfer to a government job here. Unfortunately, one of the dictates  
contained in the government's 10,000 pages of personnel rules says 
that an employee hired as a civil servant overseas is not considered  
a government employee once on home soil. Any smart employer would  
prefer to hire an experienced worker with an excellent service record  
over an unknown. But our government's policy doesn't make it easy.  
Ironically, Tapia landed a job with a government contractor, making  
more money-- and probably costing taxpayers more-- than a job in the  
bureaucracy would have paid.
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>

     On one topic alone--how to complete a standard form for a notice of a personnel action- -the Federal Personnel Manual contains 900 pages of instructions. The full stack of personnel laws, regulations, directives, case law and departmental guidance that the Agriculture Department uses weighs 1,088 pounds.
<P>
     Thousands of pages of personnel rules prompt thousands of pages of personnel forms. In 1991, for example, the Navy's Human Resources Office processed enough forms to create a "monument" 3,100 feet tall--six times the height of the Washington monument. Costs to the taxpayer for this personnel quagmire are enormous. In total, 54,000 personnel work in federal personnel positions.  We spend billions of dollars for these staff to classify each employee within a highly complex system of some 459 job series, 15 grades and 10 steps within each grade.
<P>
     Does this elaborate system work? No.
<P>
     After surveying managers, supervisors and personnel officers in a number of federal agencies, the U.S. Merit Systems
Protection Board recently concluded that federal personnel rules are too complex, too prescriptive, and often counterproductive. 
     Talk to a federal manager for 10 minutes: You likely will hear at least one personnel horror story. The system is so complex and rule-bound that most managers cannot even advise an applicant how to get a federal job. "Even when the public sector finds outstanding candidates," In 1989, Paul Volcker's National Commission on the Public Service explained, "the complexity of the hiring process often drives all but the most dedicated away." Managers who find it nearly impossible to hire the people they need sometimes flaunt the system by hiring people as consultants at higher rates than those same people would earn as federal employees. The average manager needs a year to fire an
incompetent employee, even with solid proof. During layoffs, employees slated to be laid off can "bump" employees with less seniority, regardless of their abilities or performance--putting people in jobs they don't understand and never wanted.  
<P>
     Vice President Gore heard many stories of dissatisfaction as he listened to federal workers at meetings in their agencies. A supervisor at the Centers for Disease Control complained that it can take six to eight months and as many as 15 revisions to a job description in order to get approval for a position he needs to fill. A secretary from the Justice Department told the Vice President she was discouraged and overworked in an office where some secretaries were slacking off--with no system in place to reward the hard workers and take action against the slackers. 
<P>
     A worker from the Agency for International Development expressed her frustration at being so narrowly "slotted" in a particular GS series that she wasn't allowed to apply for a job in a slightly different GS series --even though she was qualified for the job. An Air Force lieutenant colonel told the vice president that her secretary was abandoning government for the private sector because she was blocked from any more promotions in her current job series. The loss would be enormous, the colonel told Gore, because her secretary was her "right-hand person". One of the Labor Department's regional directors for unemployment insurance complained that even though he is charged with running a multimillion a year program, he isn't allowed to hire a &#036;45,000-a-year program specialist without getting approval from Washington.
<P>
     To create an effective federal government, we must reform virtually the entire personnel system: recruitment, hiring, classification, promotion, pay, and reward systems. We must make it easier for federal managers to hire the workers they need, to reward those who do good work, and to fire those who do not. As the National Academy of Public Administration concluded in 1993, "It is not a question of whether the federal government should change how it manages its human resources. It must change."  
<P>
<H3>Action: OPM will deregulate personnel policy by phasing out the 10,000-page Federal Personnel Manual and all agency implementing directives.</H3>  
<P>
     We must enable all managers to pursue their missions, freed from the cumbersome red tape of current personnel rules. The President should issue a directive phasing out the Federal Personnel Manual and all agency implementing directives. The order will require that most personnel management authority be delegated to agencies' line managers at the lowest level
practical in each agency. It will direct OPM to work with
agencies to determine which FPM chapters, provisions, or
supplements are essential, which are useful, and which are unnecessary. OPM will then replace the FPM and agency directives with manuals tailored to user needs, automated personnel
processes, and electronic decision support systems.
<P>
     Once some of the paperwork burden is eased, our next
priority must be to give agency managers more control over who comes to work for them. To accomplish this, we propose to
radically decentralize the government's hiring process. 
<P>

<H3>Action: Give all departments and agencies authority to conduct their own recruiting and examining for all positions, and abolish all central registers and standard application forms.</H3>
<P>
     We will ask Congress to pass legislation decentralizing authority over recruitment, hiring, and promotion. Under the present system, OPM controls the examination system for external candidates and recruits and screens candidates for positions that are common to all agencies, with agencies then hiring from among candidates presented by OPM. Under the new system, OPM could offer to screen candidates for agencies, but agencies need not accept OPM's offer.
<P>
     Under this decentralized system, agencies will also be allowed to make their own decisions about when to hire candidates directly--without examinations or rankings - -under guidelines to be drafted by OPM. Agencies able to do so should also be
permitted to conduct their own background investigations of potential candidates. We will make sure the system is fair and easy for job applicants to use, however, by making information about federal job openings available in one place. In place of a central register, OPM will create a government-wide, employment information system that allows the public to go to one place for information about all job opportunities in the federal
government.

<P>
     Next, we must change the classification system, introduced in 1949 to create fairness across agencies but now widely
regarded as time-consuming, expensive, cumbersome, and intensely frustrating--for both workers and managers.
<P>
     After an exhaustive 1991 study of the system, the National Academy of Public Administration recommended a complete overhaul of the system. Classification standards, NAPA argued, are "too complex, inflexible, out-of-date, and inaccurate," creating "rigid job hierarchies that cannot change with organizational structure." They drive some of the best employees out of their fields of expertise and into management positions, for higher pay. And managers seeking to create new positions often fight the system for months to get them classified and filled.
<P>
     There is strong evidence that agencies given authority to do these things themselves can do better. Using demonstration authority under the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, several agencies have experimented with simpler systems. In one
experiment, at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake,
California, and the Naval Oceans Systems Center, in San Diego, the system was simplified to a few career paths and only
four-to-six broad pay bands within each path. Known as the "China Lake Experiment," it solved many of the problems faced by the two naval facilities. It:
<UL>
     <LI> classified all jobs in just five career
paths--professional, technical, specialist, administrative and clerical;

     <LI> folded all GS (General Schedule) grades into four, five, or six pay bands within each career path;

     <LI> allowed managers to pay market salaries to recruit people, to increase the pay of outstanding employees without having to reclassify them, and to give performance-based bonuses and salary increases;

     <LI> automatically moved employees with repeated marginal performance evaluations down to the next pay band; and

     <LI> limited bumping to one career path, and based it primarily on performance ratings, not seniority. 
</UL>
     Another demonstration at McClellan Air Force Base, in Sacramento, California, involved "gainsharing"--allowing
employees to pocket some of the savings they achieved through cooperative labor-management efforts to cut costs. It generated &#036;5 million in productivity savings in four years and saw improved employee performance; fewer grievances; less sick leave and absenteeism; and improved labor-management relations. 
<P>
     A third demonstration at more than 200 Agriculture
Department sites tested a streamlined, agency-based recruiting and hiring system that replaced OPM's register process. Under OPM's system, candidates are arrayed and scored based on OPM's written tests or other examinations. In USDA's demonstration, however, the agency grouped candidates by its own criteria, such as education, experience or ability, then picked from those candidates. A candidate might qualify for a job, for example, with a 2.7 college grade point average. Agencies could create their own recruitment incentives, do their own hiring, and extend the probationary period for some new hires. Managers were far more satisfied with this system than the existing one. 

<P>
<H3>Action: Dramatically simplify the current classification system, to give agencies greater flexibility in how they classify and pay their employees.  </H3>
<P>
     We will urge Congress to remove all the 1940s-era
grade-level descriptions from the law and adopt an approach that is more modern. In addition, Congress should allow agencies to move from the General Schedule system to a broad-band system. OPM should develop such standard banding patterns, and agencies should be free to adopt one without seeking OPM's approval. 
<P>
     When agency proposals do not fit under a standard pattern, OPM should approve them as five-year demonstration projects that would be converted to permanent "alternative systems" if
successful. OPM should establish criteria for broad-banding demonstration projects, and agencies' projects meeting those criteria should receive automatic approval. 
<P>
     These changes would give agencies greater flexibility to hire, retain, and promote the best people they find. They would help agencies flatten their hierarchies and promote high
achievers without having to make them supervisors. They would eliminate much valuable time now lost to battles between managers seeking to promote or reward employees and personnel specialists administering a classification system with rigid limits. Finally, they would remove OPM from its role as "classification police." To accompany agencies' new flexibility on classification and pay, they must also be given authority to set standards for their own workers and to reward those who do well. 
<P>

<H3>Action: Agencies should be allowed to design their own
performance management and reward systems, with the objective of improving the performance of individuals and organizations.  </H3>
<P>
     The current government performance appraisal process is frequently criticized as a meaningless exercise in which most federal employees are given above-average ratings. We believe that agencies will be able to develop performance appraisals that are more meaningful to their employees. If they succeed, these new approaches will send a message that job performance is directly linked to workers' chances for promotion and higher pay. 
<P>
     Current systems to assess on-the-job performance were designed to serve multiple purposes: to enhance performance, to authorize higher pay for high performers, to retain high
performers, and to promote staff development. Not surprisingly, they serve none of these purposes well. 
<P>
     Performance management programs should have a single goal: to improve the performance of individuals and organizations. Agencies should be allowed to develop programs that meet their needs and reflect their cultures, including incentive programs, gainsharing programs, and awards that link pay and performance. If agencies--in cooperation with employees--design their own systems, managers and employees alike should feel more ownership of them. 
<P>
     Finally, if performance measures are to  be taken seriously, managers must have authority to fire workers who do not measure up. It is possible to fire a poor worker in the federal
government, but it takes far too long. We believe this undermines good management and diminishes workers' incentives to improve. 
<P>
<H3>Action: Reduce by half the time required to terminate federal managers and employees for cause and improve the system for dealing with poor performers. </H3>
<P>
     Agencies will reduce the time for terminating employees for cause by half. For example, agencies could halve the length of time during which managers and employees with unsatisfactory performance ratings are allowed to demonstrate improved
performance.  
<P>
     To support this effort, we will ask OPM to draft and
Congress to pass legislation to change the required time for notice of termination from 30 to 15 days. This legislation should also require the waiting period for a within-grade increase to be extended by the amount of time an employee's performance does not meet expectations. In other words, only the time that an employee is doing satisfactory work should be credited toward the required waiting period for a pay raise.



<H2>Step 3: Streamlining Procurement</H2>

     Every year, Washington spends about &#036;200 billion buying goods and services. That's &#036;800 per American. With a price tag like that, taxpayers have a right t Our system relies on rigid rules and procedures, extensive paperwork, detailed design specifications, and multiple inspections and audits. It is an extraordinary example of bureaucratic red tape.ore pages of agency-specific supplements. 
<P>
     These numbers document what most federal workers and many taxpayers already know: Our system relies on rigid rules and procedures, extensive paperwork, detailed design specifications, and multiple inspections and audits. It is an extraordinary example of bureaucratic red tape.
<P>
     Like the budget and personnel systems, the procurement system was designed with the best of intentions. To prevent profiteering and fraud, it includes rigid safeguards. To take advantage of bulk purchasing, it is highly centralized. But the government wrote its procurement rules when retailing was highly stratified, with many markups by intermediaries. Today the game has changed considerably. Retail giants like Wal-Mart, Office Depot and Price Club are vertically integrated, eliminating the markups of intermediaries. Federal managers can buy 90 percent of what they need over the phone, from mail-order discounters. Bulk purchasing still has its advantages, but it is not always
necessary to get the best price.
<P>
     Our overly centralized purchasing system takes decisions away from managers who know what they need, and allows
strangers--often thousands of miles away--to make purchasing decisions. The frequent result: Procurement officers, who make their own decisions about what to buy and how soon to buy it, purchase low-quality items, or even the wrong ones, that arrive too late.
<P>
     This "secondhand" approach to purchasing creates another problem. When line managers' needs and experiences are not understood by the procurement officer, the government is unable to make decisions that reward good vendors and punish bad ones. As a result, vendors often "game" contracts--exploiting loopholes to require expensive changes. For example, in a major government contract for a computerized data network a few years ago, a vendor used slight underestimates of system demand in the
contract specifications as an excuse to charge exorbitant prices for system upgrades. In the private sector, a manager could have used the incentive of future contracts to prevent such gaming; in the government, there is no such leverage.
<P>
     The symptoms of what's wrong are apparent, too, from stories about small purchases. 
<P>
     One story that Vice President Gore has repeated in
Washington over the past six months concerns steam traps. Steam traps remove condensation from steam lines in heating systems. Each costs about &#036;100. But when one breaks, it leaks as much as &#036;50 of steam a week. Obviously, a leaking steam trap should be replaced quickly. 
<P>
     When plumbers at the Sacramento Army Depot found leaking traps, however, their manager followed standard operating
procedure. He called the procurement office, where an officer, who knew nothing about steam traps, followed common practice. He waited for enough orders to buy in bulk, saving the government about &#036;10 per trap. There was no rule requiring him to wait-- just a powerful tradition. So the Sacramento Depot didn't get new steam traps for a year. In the meantime, each of their leaking traps spewed &#036;2,500 of steam. To save &#036;10, the central
procurement system wasted &#036;2,500. 
<P>
     As the Vice President visited government agencies, he heard many more stories of wasteful spending--most of them produced by the very rules we have designed to prevent it. Take the case of government travel.
<P>
     Because GSA selects a "contract airline" for each route, federal employees have few choices. If Northwest has the
Washington-Tampa route, for instance, federal employees get routed through Detroit. If Northwest has the Boston-Washington route, employees have to use Northwest--even if USAir has more frequent flights at more convenient times. Workers told the Vice President of being routed through thousands of miles out of their way even if it cost them a day's worth of time--and a day's worth of taxpayers' money. Others told of being unable to take
advantage of cheap "special fares" because they were not
"government fares." And one worker showed the National
Performance Review a memo from the Resolution Trust Corporation explaining that RTC workers would not be reimbursed for any travel expenses unless they signed their travel vouchers in blue ink!

<TABLE WIDTH="75%" BORDER CELLPADDING=3>
<tr><td><B>"Ash receivers, tobacco  (desk type)...</B>" <p>

Our federal procurement system leaves little to chance.
When the General Services Administration wanted to buy ashtrays, it has some very specific ideas how those ashtrays--better known to GSA as "ash receivers, tobacco (desk type)," should be
constructed.<p>
    In March 1993, the GSA outlined, in nine full pages of specifications and drawings, the precise dimensions, color, polish and markings required for simple glass ashtrays that would pass U.S. government standards.<p>
 A Type I, glass, square, 41/2 inch (114.3 mm) ash receiver must include several features: "A minimum of four cigarette rests, spaced equidistant around the periphery and aimed at the center of the receiver, molded into the top. The cigarette rests shall be sloped toward the center of the ash receiver. The rests shall be parallel to the outside top edge of the receiver or in each corner, at the manufacturer's option. All surfaces shall be smooth."<p>
     Government ashtrays must be sturdy too. To guard against the purchase of defective ash receivers, the GSA required that all ashtrays be tested. "The test shall be made by placing the specimen on its base upon a solid support (a 1 3/4 inch, 44.5mm maple plank), placing a steel center punch (point ground to a 60-degree included angle) in contact with the center of the inside surface of the bottom and striking with a hammer in successive blows of increasing severity until breakage occurs."     Then, according to paragraph 4.5.2., "The specimen should break into a small number of irregular shaped pieces not greater in number than 35, and it must not dice." What does "dice" mean? The paragraph goes on to explain: "Any piece 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) or more on any three of its adjacent edges (excluding the thickness dimension) shall be included in the number counted. Smaller fragments shall not be counted." <p>

Regulation AA-A-710E, (superseding Regulation AA-A-710D).</td></tr>
</TABLE>
</center>
<P>
     Beyond travel, at every federal agency the Vice President visited, employees told stories about not getting supplies and equipment they needed, getting them late, or watching the
government spend too much for them. At the Department of Health and Human Services, a worker told the Vice President that no matter how much his office needed a FAX machine--and how much time the machine would save workers--the purchase wouldn't be possible "without the signature of everyone in this room." An engineer from the National Institutes of Health added that in his agency, it takes more than a year to buy a computer, not a mainframe, but a personal computer! At the Transportation
Department, a hearing-impaired employee told the Vice President of watching with dismay as her agency spent &#036;600 to buy her a Telephone Device for the Deaf (TDD), when she knew she could buy one off the shelf for &#036;300.
<P>
     Anecdotes like these were documented in January 1993, when the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board collaborated on a survey of the
procurement system's customers: federal managers. More than 1,000 responded. Their message: The system is not achieving what its customers want. It ignores its customers' needs, pays higher prices than necessary, is filled with peripheral objectives, and assumes that line managers cannot be trusted. A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies added several other conclusions. The procurement system adds costs without adding value; it impedes government's access to state-of-the-art commercial technology; and its complexity forces businesses to alter standard procedures and raise prices when dealing with the government.
<P>
     There is little disagreement that federal procurement must be reconfigured. We must radically decentralize authority to line managers, letting them buy much of what they need. We must radically simplify procurement regulations and processes.  We must empower the system's customers by ending most government service monopolies, including those of the General Services Administration. As we detailed in Chapter 1, we must make the system competitive by allowing managers to use any procurement office that meets their needs. 
<P>
     As we take these actions, we must embrace these fundamental principles: integrity, accountability, professionalism, openness, competition--and value.   

<P>
<H3>Action: Simplify the procurement process by rewriting federal regulations--shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles.</H3> 
<P>
     The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the government's principal set of procurement regulations, contains too many rules. Rules are changed too often and are so process-oriented that they minimize discretion and stifle innovation, according to a Merit Systems Protection Board survey.  As one frustrated manager noted, the FAR does not even clearly state the main goal of procurement policy: "Is it to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse? Is it to implement a social-economic agenda? Is it to procure the government's requirements at a fair and reasonable cost?"
<P>
     This administration will rewrite the 1,600-page FAR, the 2,900 pages of agency supplements that accompany it, and
Executive Order 12352, which governs federal procurement. The new regulations will:
<UL>
    <LI> shift from rigid rules to guiding principles;

     <LI> promote decision making at the lowest possible level;      

    <LI> end unnecessary regulatory requirements;

     <LI> foster competitiveness and commercial practices;

    <LI> shift to a new emphasis on choosing "best value" products; 
     <LI> facilitate innovative contracting approaches; and

     <LI> recommend acquisition methods that reflect information technology's short life cycle. 

     <LI> develop a more effective process to listen to its
customers: line managers, government procurement officers and vendors who do business with the government. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Action: The GSA will significantly increase its delegated
authority to federal agencies for the purchase of information technology, including hardware, software, and services. </H3>    In 1965, when "automated data processing" meant large, mainframe computers --often developed specifically for one customer--Congress passed the Brooks Act. It directed GSA to purchase, lease, and maintain such equipment for the entire federal government. The Act also gave GSA authority to delegate to agencies these same authorities. In 1986, Congress extended the requirement to software and support services. 
<P>
     Today, with most computer equipment commercially available in highly competitive markets, the advantages of centralized purchasing have faded and the disadvantages grown. The federal government takes, on average, more than four years to buy major information technology systems; the private sector takes 13 months. Due to rapidly changing technology, the government often buys computers that are state-of-the-art when the purchase process begins and when prices are negotiated, but which are almost obsolete when computers are delivered. The phenomenon is what one observer calls "getting a 286 at a 486 price."
<P>
     Currently, the GSA authorizes agencies to make individual purchases up to &#036;2.5 million in equipment and services on their own. The GSA Administrator will raise authorization levels to &#036;50 million, &#036;20 million and &#036;5 million. These levels will be
calculated according to each agency's size, the size of its information technology budget, and its management record. In some cases, GSA may grant an agency greater or unlimited delegation.       GSA will also waive requirements that agencies justify their decisions to buy information technology items under &#036;500,000 that are mass-produced and offered on the open market. 

     
<P>
<H3>Action: GSA will simplify the procurement process by allowing agencies to buy where they want, and testing a fully "electronic marketplace."   </H3> 
<P>
     The government buys everything from forklifts and snowplows to flak jackets and test tubes through a system called the Multiple Award Schedule program, which includes more than one million separate items.
<P>
     Under this program, GSA negotiates and awards contracts to multiple vendors of comparable products and services, at varying prices. GSA then creates a "supply schedule" for a particular good or service, identifying all vendors that have won contracts as well as the negotiated prices. Of GSA's 154 schedules,
civilian agencies must must buy from 117. In ordering from schedules, agencies still must comply--in addition- -with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Federal Information Resources Management Regulation, and Federal Property Management
Regulation.
<P>
     In most cases, we should not limit managers to items on the supply schedules. If they can find the same or a comparable product for less, they should be free to buy it. Mandatory schedules should apply only when required by law, to ensure standardization, or when agencies voluntarily create team pools that buy in bulk for lower prices. In addition, GSA should revise regulations that currently limit agencies from buying more than &#036;300,000 of information technology items on supply schedules, raise them to &#036;500,000 and provide a higher limit for individual items costing more than &#036;500,000.
<P>
     To make supply schedules more user-friendly, GSA should conduct several pilot tests. One should test an "electronic marketplace," in which GSA would not negotiate prices. Instead, suppliers would list products and prices electronically, and agencies would electronically order the lowest-priced item that met their needs. Suppliers, at any time, would be able to add new products and change prices. Such a pilot would test whether visible price competition will cut prices and give line managers easier access to rapidly changing products.
<P>

<P>
<H3>Action: Allow agencies to make purchases under &#036;100,000 through simplified purchase procedures. </H3>
<P>
     Under current law, agencies are allowed to make purchases of less than &#036;25,000 on their own, using simple procurement
procedures. These small purchases, on average, take less than a month to complete; purchases of more than &#036;25,000 normally take more than three months. If Congress raised the threshold to &#036;100,000, agencies could use simplified procedures on another 45,550 procurements--with a total value of &#036;2.5 billion. 
<P>
     Congress should keep current rules that reserve small purchases for small businesses and should improve access to information on procurements of more than &#036;25,000. To ensure that small business receives adequate notice of possible procurements, the federal government, with OMB as the lead agency, should adopt an electronic notification system.

<P>

<H3>Action: Rely more on the commercial marketplace. </H3>
<P>
     The government can save enormous amounts of money by buying more commercial products instead of requiring products to be designed to government-unique specifications. Our government buys such items as integrated circuits, pillows, and oil pans,
designed to government specifications--even when there are equally good commercial products available.
<P>
     We recommend that all agency heads be instructed to review and revise internal purchasing procedures and rules to allow their agencies to buy commercial products whenever practical and to take advantage of market conditions. We will ask the Office of Management and Budget to draft a new federal commercial code with commercial-style procedures, and then ask Congress to adopt the new code and remove impediments to this money-saving approach to procurement. 
<P>

<H3>Action: Bring federal procurement laws up to date. </H3>
<P>
     There are four federal labor laws implemented through the federal procurement process. Each was passed because of valid and well founded concerns about the welfare of working Americans. But as part of our effort to make the government's procurement process work more efficiently, we must consider whether those laws are still necessary- -and whether the burdens they impose on the procurement system are reasonable ones. 
<P>
     The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 requires that each repair or construction contract in excess of &#036;2,000 for work on a public building specify that the prevailing area minimum wage be paid to workers on that contract. The law was passed because Congress feared that without it, federal contracts awarded through a sealed bid process could undermine local prevailing wages. While Congress shifted the government's focus to an open bidding process in 1984, we acknowledge that concerns about the impact of government contracts on prevailing wages are still valid.
<P>
     Recognizing that the original &#036;2,000 threshold in the law was set more than 60 years ago, we recommend that Congress modify the Davis-Bacon Act by raising the threshold for compliance to &#036;100,000, a change similar to that proposed by Senator Kennedy in March 1993.
<P>
     The Service Contract Act of 1965 has purposes similar to those of the Davis-Bacon Act, and applies to service contracts in excess of &#036;2,500. It requires contractors to pay the minimum prevailing wage and specified fringe benefits. To keep
contractors from "locking in" their wage agreements at low levels, the law imposes a five-year limit on service contracts and requires new wage determinations every two years. 
<P>
     We suggest that the five-year limit is inconsistent with the government's interest in entering into long-range contracts. We will urge Congress to increase the limit up to 10 years while retaining the two-year wage adjustment requirement. 
<P>
     The Copeland Anti-Kickback Act of 1934 regulates payroll deductions on federal and federally assisted construction. The law prohibits anyone from inducing employees to give up any part of their compensation and requires contractors to submit weekly statements of compliance and detailed weekly payroll reports to the Labor Department. 
<P>
     We suggest that such detailed reporting is an unreasonable burden on federal contractors, and we will urge Congress to modify the act. We suggest eliminating requirements for weekly reports and requiring contractors instead to certify with each payment that they have complied with the law. Contractors would also be required to keep records to prove their compliance for three years.
<P>
     The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act requires contractors that supply materials to the federal government through contracts in excess of &#036;10,000 to pay all workers the federal minimum wage, to agree that no employee is required to work more than 40 hours a week, and to avoid using convict labor or workers under the age of 16. 
<P>
     Over time, each of the requirements of the Walsh-Healey Act--with the exception of the provision relating to convict labor--has been superseded by other federal legislation. We therefore urge Congress to remove the burden of certifying compliance with redundant laws from federal contractors. Within 30 days of the repeal of that law, the President should amend Executive Order 11755 to include the convict labor provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act.
<P>


<H2>Step 4: --Reorienting The Inspectors  General</H2>

     Responding to growing concern about waste, fraud, and abuse in government, Congress passed the Inspector General Act in 1978. This act and subsequent amendments created the 60 Inspectors General offices that today employ 15,000 federal workers,
including postal inspectors.
<P>
     The act was broad in scope, requiring IGs to promote the efficiency, economy and integrity of federal programs with auditing program expenditures, and investigating possible fraud and abuse. 
<P>
     The inspectors general, who are independent of the agencies in which they operate, report to Congress twice a year. These reports detail how much money IG audits have recovered or put to better use and the number of convictions resulting from their criminal investigations. The IGs also send the audit reports to the heads of their agencies and forward investigations for criminal prosecution to the U.S. attorney general. The Inspector General Act's two central mandates, combined with the last two administrations' eagerness to highlight "waste, fraud and abuse," have shaped the evolution of the IG offices. The standard by which they are evaluated is finding error or fraud: The more frequently they find mistakes, the more successful they are judged to be. As a result, the IG staffs often develop
adversarial relations with agency managers--who, in trying to do things better, may break rules.  
<P>
     At virtually every agency he visited, the Vice President heard federal employees complain that the IGs' basic approach inhibits innovation and risk taking. Heavy-handed
enforcement--with the IG watchfulness compelling employees to follow every rule, document every decision, and fill out every form--has had a negative effect in some agencies.
<P>


<H3>Action: Broaden the focus of the Inspectors General from strict compliance auditing to evaluating management control systems.  </H3>
<P>
    In a government focused on results, the Inspectors General can play a key role not only in controlling managers' behavior by monitoring it, but in helping to improve it. Today, they audit for strict compliance with rules and regulations. In the future, they should help managers evaluate their management control systems. Today, they look for "waste, fraud, and abuse." In the future, they should also help improve systems to prevent waste, fraud and abuse, and ensure efficient, effective service.  
 <P>
    Many IGs have already begun to help their agencies this way. At the Justice Department, for example some offices were
inefficient in completing background and security clearances. The Inspector General's office examined the problem, then recommended setting up a central database to manage the clearance process and warn officials automatically when they are about to miss
deadlines for completing investigations. Similarly, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has long been engaged in program evaluations to help agencies uncover inefficiencies. While the Inspector General's office retains the right to conduct formal audits and criminal investigations, it also uses its role as a neutral observer to collaborate on making programs work better.
<P>
     Congress need pass no legislation to make this happen. Promoting the efficiency and integrity of government programs was part of the IGs' original mandate. But such change will require a cultural revolution within many IG offices, and we recommend two steps to help guide such a change. First-line managers, who are the IG front-line customers, should be surveyed periodically to see whether they believe the IGs are helping them improve
performance. Second, criteria should be established for judging IG performance.



<H2>Step 5: Eliminating Regulatory Overkill</H2>

     Reinventing our budget, personnel and procurement systems will strip away much--but not all--of the red tape that makes our governing processes so cumbersome. Thousands upon thousands of outdated, overlapping regulations remain in place. These
regulations affect the people inside government and those who deal with it from the outside. Inside government, we have no precise measurement of how much regulation costs or how much time it steals from productive work. But there's no disagreement that the costs are enormous. And on the matter of external regulation, a 1993 study concluded that the cost to the private sector of complying with regulations is at least &#036;430 billion annually-- 9 percent of our gross domestic product!

</DL>
<P>

     We must clear the thicket of regulation by undertaking a thorough review of the regulations already in place and
redesigning regulatory processes to end the proliferation of unnecessary and unproductive rules. We have worked closely with administration officials responsible for developing a new
approach to regulatory review, and incorporated that work into the following action.

<P>

<H3>Action: The President should issue a directive requiring all federal agencies to review internal government regulations over the next 3 years, with a goal of eliminating 50 percent of those regulations. </H3>
<P>
     Can regulations be eliminated? The answer is yes, as
evidenced by promising experiments in several federal agencies. In the Management Efficiency Pilot Program (MEPP) in five of the Department of Veterans' Affairs regional benefits offices, the offices were encouraged to do away with red tape.  At several benefits offices, 895 of 1,969 regulations were dropped, saving the staff more than 3,000 hours and &#036;640,000 in one year. And productivity at MEPP centers increased by 35 percent in one year (1988-89), more than double the increase at other centers. A similar effort by five VA medical centers redirected &#036;13.1 million to much-needed funding for acute care centers.
<P>
     An even more sweeping example of a fresh start in internal regulations comes from the Air Force, where the chief of staff has established a servicewide program to streamline the
organization and cut out bureaucracy. Under the Policy Review Initiative begun in 1992, the Air Force is replacing 1,510 regulations with 165 policy directives and 750 sets of
instructions. This effort will cut 55,000 pages of intermingled policy and procedure to about 18,000 pages clearly separating policy from procedure. This deregulation effort, managed by a staff of 10, is expected to be completed in fiscal year 1994.  
<P>
     Over the next 3 years, each federal agency will undertake a thorough and systematic review of its internal regulations. Agencies may choose their own strategies for reaching the goal of reducing internal regulations by 50 percent. 

<P>

<H3>Action: Improve inter-agency coordination of regulations to reduce unnecessary regulation and red tape. </H3>
<P>
     In 1981, frustrated at the inconsistencies and duplication among federal regulatory efforts and their burden on government and the private sector, President Reagan required the Office of Management and Budget specifically, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review all regulations proposed by executive agencies.  
<P>
     With a limited staff, many of whom are also involved with paperwork reduction issues, the review process for proposed regulations can be lengthy.  And while a lengthy review process may be appropriate for significant rules, it is a waste of time for others. In early 1993, Vice President Gore convened an informal working group to recommend changes in the regulatory review process. The working group and the National Performance Review coordinated their efforts closely.  We endorse the
recommendations of the working group and the President's
executive order, which will implement those changes and
streamline the regulatory review process. 
<P>
     The order will enhance the planning process and encourage agencies to consult with the public early in that process.  In addition, in an effort to coordinate the regulatory actions of all executive agencies, the Vice President will meet annually with agency heads, and the Administrator of OIRA will hold quarterly meetings with representatives of executive agencies and the administration.
<P>
     Improving the regulatory review process also means being selective in reviewing regulations. Through this order, the President will instruct OIRA to review only significant
regulations--not, as under the current process, all regulations. The new review process, which will take into account a broad range of costs and benefits, will be more useful and realistic.       To ease the adverse effects of regulation on citizens, businesses, and the economy as a whole, the executive order also will require an ongoing review of existing regulations. Agencies will identify regulations that are cumulative, obsolete, or inconsistent, and, where appropriate, eliminate or modify them. They will also identify legislative mandates that require them to impose unnecessary or outdated regulations. 

<P>
<H3>Action: Establish a process by which agencies can more widely obtain waivers from regulations.</H3>
<P>
     With the advent of the Government Performance and Results Act, which Congress passed in July 1993, we have begun to
acknowledge the important principle of "flexibility in return for accountability." 
<P>
     Under the act, some agencies may apply for waivers from federal regulations if they meet specific performance targets. In other words, they will be exempt from some administrative
requirements if they do their jobs better. The law applies only to internal regulations and government agencies, but it also urges wider waivers authority to test the potential benefits. In the spirit of that legislation, we seek to expand the concept of greater flexibility for greater accountability.
<P>
     The President should direct each federal agency to establish and publish,in a timely manner, an open process through which other federal agencies can obtain waivers from that agency's regulations--with an expedited appeals process. Rules adopting this new waiver process would state that all future agency regula-tions would be subject to the waiver process unless explicitly prohibited. We will also ask Congress to specify that legislation would be subject to waivers unless explicitly
prohibited.


<P>
<H3>Action: Reduce the burden of congressionally mandated reports</H3>. 
<P>
     Woodrow Wilson was right. Our country's 28th president once wrote that "there is no distincter tendency in congressional history than the tendency to subject even the details of
administration" to constant congressional supervision.  One place to start in liberating agencies from congressional
micromanagement is the issue of reporting requirements. Over the past decades, we have thrown layer upon layer of reporting requirements on federal agencies, creating an almost endless series of required audits, reports, and exhibits.
<P>
     Today the annual calendar is jammed with report deadlines. On August 31 of each year, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act requires that agencies file a 5-year financial plan and a CFO annual report. On September 1, budget exhibits for financial management activities and high risk areas are due. On November 30, IG reports are expected, along with reports required by the Prompt Payment Act. On January 31, reports under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Report Adjustment Act of 1990 come due. On March 31, financial state-ments are due and on May 1 annual single-audit reports must be filed. On May 31 another round of IG reports are due. At the end of July and December, "high-risk" reports are filed. On August 31, it all begins again. And these are just the major reports! 
<P>
     In fiscal year 1993, Congress required executive branch agencies to prepare 5,348 reports. Much of this work is
duplicative. And because there are so many different sources of information, no one gets an integrated view of an agency's condition--least of all the agency manager who needs accurate and up to date numbers. Meanwhile, trapped in this blizzard of paperwork, no one is looking at results.  We propose to
consolidate and simplify reporting requirements, and to redesign them so that the manager will have a clear picture of the
agency's financial condition, the condition of individual
programs, and the extent to which the agency is meeting its objectives. We will ask Congress to pass legislation granting OMB the flexibility to consolidate and simplify statutory reports and establishing a sunset provision in any reporting requirements adopted by Congress in the future.
<P>

<H2>Step 6: -- Empower State and  Local Governments</H2>

     What we usually call "government" is, in fact, a tangle of different levels of government agencies--some run from
Washington, some in state capitals, and some by cities and towns. In the United States, in fact, some 80,000 "governments" run everything from local schools and water supply systems to the Defense Department and overseas embassies. Few taxpayers
differentiate among levels of government, however to the average citizen, a tax is a tax--and a service a service--regardless of which level of government is responsible. To reinvent government in the public's eyes, we must address the web of
federal-state-local relations.
<P>
     Washington provides about 16 percent of the money that states and localities spend and shapes a much larger share of such spending through mandates. Much of Washington's domestic agenda, &#036;226 billion to be precise, consists of programs actually run by states, cities, and counties. But the federal government doesn't always distribute its money--or its mandates--wisely.       For starters, Washington allocates federal money through an array of more than 600 different grant programs. Many are small: 445 of them distribute less than &#036;50 million a year nationwide; some 275 distribute less than &#036;10 million. Through grants, Congress funds some 150 education and training programs, 100 social service programs, and more than 80 health care programs.       Considered individually, many categorical grant programs make sense. But together, they often work against the very purposes for which they were established. When a department operates small grant programs, it produces more bureaucracy, not more services. Thousands of public employees--at all levels of government--spend millions of hours writing regulations, writing and reviewing grant applications, filling out forms, checking on each other, and avoiding oversight. In this way, professionals and bureaucrats siphon money from the programs' intended
customers: students, the poor urban residents and others. And states, and local governments find their money fragmented into hundreds of tiny pots, each with different, often contradictory rules, procedures, and program requirements.

<P>
     Henry Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, likens federal grants to a system of pipelines spreading out across the country. The "water," says Cisneros, reaches states and localities through hundreds of individual pipelines. This means there is little chance for the water to be mixed, properly calibrated to local needs, or concentrated to address a specific problem, geographic area, or population. 
<P>
     In employment and training, for example, Washington funds training programs, literacy programs, adult education programs, tuition grant programs, and vocational education programs. Different programs are designed for different groups--welfare recipients, food stamp recipients, displaced homemakers, youth in school, drop-outs, "dislocated workers," workers displaced by foreign trade, and on and on.  
<P>
     At a plant in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, General Electric recently laid off a large group of workers. Some workers could get Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits, because their jobs were lost to foreign competition. Others could not; their jobs fell to defense cutbacks. Because they have a union, people working in one area began exercising their seniority rights and bumping people in other areas. Some workers bumped from trade-affected jobs to defense contracting jobs, then lost those a few weeks later. Under federal regulations, they could no longer get Trade Adjustment Assistance. Thus, friends who had spent years working side by side found themselves with very different benefits. Some got the standard 6 months of unemployment checks. Others got 2 years of unemployment checks and extensive retraining support. Try explaining that to people who have lost the only jobs they've ever held!
<P>
     People who run such programs struggle to knit together funds from three, four, or five programs, hoping against hope that workers get enough retraining to land decent new jobs. But the task is difficult; each program has its own requirements, funding cycles, eligibility criteria, and the like. One employment center in Allegheny County, New York, has tried hard to bring several programs together and make them appear as seamless as possible to the customers. At the end of the day, to accommodate reporting requirements, the staff enters information on each customer at four different computer terminals: one for Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, one for the JOBS program, one for the Employment Service, and one for tracking purposes.  
<P>     When Congress enacted JTPA, it sought to avoid such
problems. It let local areas tailor their training programs to local needs. But federal rules and regulations have gradually undermined the good intentions. Title III, known as the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act (EDWAA), helps states respond immediately to plant closings and large layoffs. Yet even EDWAA's most flexible money, the "national reserve fund," has become so tangled in red tape that many states won't use it. As Congress's Office of Technology Assessment put it, "the process is simply too obstacle ridden. ... many state EDWAA managers cannot handle the complexities of the grant application, and those that do know how are too busy responding to clients' urgent needs to write demanding, detailed grant proposals." 
<P>     When Congress amended JTPA in 1993, targeting more funds to those with "multiple barriers" to employment, homeless advocates thought the change would help their clients. After all, who has more barriers to employment than someone without an address or phone number? But the new JTPA formula also emphasized training over job search assistance. So a local program in Washington, D.C. that had won a Labor Department award for placing 70 percent of its clients in jobs--many of them service sector jobs paying more than the minimum wage--lost its JTPA funding. Why? It didn't offer training. It just helped the homeless find jobs.
<P>
     But federal programs rarely focus on results. As structured by Congress, they pay more attention to process than outcomes--in this case, more to training than to jobs. Even in auditing state and local programs, federal overseers often do little more than check to see whether proper forms are filed in proper folders. 
     The rules and regulations behind federal grant programs were designed with the best of intentions--to ensure that funds flow for the purposes Congress intended. Instead, they often ensure that programs don't work as well as they could--or don't work at all.        
<P>
     Virtually every expert with whom we spoke agreed that this system is fundamentally broken. No one argued for marginal or incremental change. Everyone wants dramatic change--state and local officials, federal managers, congressional staff. As in managing its own affairs, the federal government must shift the basic paradigm it uses in managing state and local affairs. It must stop holding programs accountable for process and begin holding them accountable for results.
<UL>
     <LI> The task is daunting; it will take years to accomplish. We propose several significant steps on the journey:

     <LI> Establish a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment; 

    <LI> Cut the number of unfunded mandates that Washington
imposes;

    <LI> Consolidate 55 categorical grants into broader "flexible grants;" 

     <LI> Increase state and local flexibility in using the
remaining categorical grants; 

     <LI> Let all agencies waive rules and regulations when they conflict with results; and 

     <LI> Deregulate the public housing program.
</UL>
     The likely benefits are clear: administrative savings at all levels; greater flexibility to design solutions; more effective concentration of limited resources; and programs that work for their customers.

<P>

<H3>Action: The President should establish a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment.   </H3>   The federal government needs to better organize itself to improve the way it works with states and localities. The
President should immediately establish a working group of
cabinet-level officials, with leadership from the Vice President, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Economic Council.      The Board will look for ways to empower innovative
communities by reducing red tape and regulation on federal programs. This group will be committed to solutions that respect "bottom-up" initiatives rather than "top-down" requirements. It will focus on the administration's community empowerment agenda, beginning with the 9 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise
Communities that passed Congress as part of the President's economic plan.

     In participating communities, for example, federal programs could be consolidated and planning requirements could be
simplified; waivers would be granted to assure maximum
flexibility; federal funding cycles would be synchronized; and surplus federal properties could be designated for community use. 

<P>
<H3>Action: The President should issue a directive limiting the use of unfunded mandates by the administration. </H3>
<P>
     As the federal deficit mounted in the 1980s, Congress found it more and more difficult to spend new money. Instead, it often turned to "unfunded mandates"-- passing laws for the states and localities to follow, but giving them little or no money to implement those policies. As of December 1992, there were at least 172 separate pieces of federal legislation in force that imposed requirements on state and local governments. Many of these, such as clean water standards and increased public access for disabled citizens, are unquestionably noble goals.
<P>
     But the question remains: How will state and local
governments pay to meet those goals? We recommend that Congress refrain from this practice and that the President's directive establish that the executive branch will similarly limit its use of unfunded mandates in policies, legislative proposals and regulations.  
<P>
     The directive would narrow the circumstances under which departments and agencies could impose new unfunded burdens on other governments. It also would direct federal agencies to review their existing regulations and reduce the number of mandates that interfere with effective service delivery. OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) should review all major regulations or legislation proposed by the executive branch for possible adverse impacts on states and localities. Finally, OIRA's director should create a forum in which federal, state, and local officials could develop solutions to problems involving unfunded mandates.

<P>

<H3>Action: Consolidate 55 categorical grant programs with funding of &#036;12.9 billion into six broad "flexible grants"--in job training, education, water quality, defense conversion, environmental management, and motor carrier safety.</H3>
<P>
     This proposal came from the National Governors Association (NGA) and National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), which describe it as "a first step toward broader, more ambitious reforms." It would consolidate some 20 education, employment and training programs, with a combined &#036;5.5 billion in fiscal year 1993 spending; roughly 10 other education programs (&#036;1.6
billion); 10 small environmental programs (&#036;392 million);  six water quality programs (&#036;2.66 billion); and six defense
conversion programs  (&#036;460 million).

<P>
     What does the price of a used car have to do with the federal government's family policies?
<P>
     More than it should. Caseworkers employed by state and local government to work with poor families are supposed to help those families become self-sufficient. Their job is to understand how federal programs work. But as it turns out, those caseworkers also have to know something about used cars. Used cars? That's right. Consider this example, recounted to Vice President Gore at a July 1993 Progressive Foundation conference on family policy in Nashville, Tennessee:
<P>
     Agencies administering any of the federal government's programs for the poor must verify many details about people's lives. For instance, they must verify that a family receiving funds under Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) does not own a car worth more than &#036;1,500 in equity value. To give a poor family food stamps, it must verify that the family doesn't own a car worth more than &#036;4,500 in market value. Medicaid specifies a range that it allows for the value of a recipient's car, depending on the recipient's Medicaid category. But under food stamp rules, the car is exempt if it is used for work or training or transporting a disabled person. And under AFDC, there is no exemption for the car under any circumstances.
 Recounting that story to a meeting of the nation's governors, the vice president asked this simple question: "Why can't we talk about the same car in all three programs?" </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER><P>

<H3>Action: Congress should allow states and localities to
consolidate separate grant programs from the bottom up.</H3>
<P>
     Recognizing the political and administrative obstacles to wholesale reform of more than 600 existing categorical grants in the short term, the National Performance Review focused on an innovative solution to provide flexibility and to encourage result-oriented performance at the state and local levels. 
<P>
     Our proposal calls for Congress to authorize "bottom-up" grant consolidation initiatives. Localities would have authority to mix funding from different programs, with simple notification to Washington, when combining grants smaller than &#036;10 million each. For a consolidation involving any program funded at more than &#036;10 million, the federal awarding office (and state, if applicable), would have to approve it before implementation. In return for such consolidation, the state and local governments will waive all but one of the programs' administrative payments from the federal government.
<P>
     When different grants' regulations conflict, the
consolidating agency would select which to follow. States and localities that demonstrated effective service integration through consolidation would receive preference in future grant awards. Each of the partners in the intergovernmental system must work collaboratively with others--federal, state, and local--to refine this recommendation.
<P>
     The details of this proposal will be negotiated with
important state and local organizations, such as the NGA, the NCSL, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities, before legislation is drafted. Bottom-up consolidation will be given a high priority by the administration. It
represents a way to improve state and local performance without tackling the thorny political problem involved in consolidating 600 grant programs, reconciling thousands of rules and
regulations, and anticipating every possible instance when flexibility might be necessary. It puts the burden of identifying obstacles and designing the best solution where it belongs--on those who must make the programs work. 
<P>

<H3>Action: Give all cabinet secretaries and agency heads authority to grant states and localities selective waivers from federal regulations or mandates.</H3>

</TABLE>

<P>
     For federal grant programs to work, managers must have flexibility to waive rules that get in the way. Some departments have this authority; others don't. Federal decisions on most waivers come very slowly, and states often must apply to a half-dozen agencies to get the waivers they need. Florida, for example, has a two-year waiver allowing it to provide hospice care to AIDS patients under Medicaid. Its renewal takes 18 months. So state officials have to reapply after only six months. Waiver legislation should grant broad waiver authority, with the exception of fair housing, non-discrimination, environmental, and labor standards. We will ask Congress to grant such authority to Cabinet officers. These waivers, should be granted under limited circumstances, however. They must be time-limited and designed to include performance measures. When each experiment is concluded, the granting agency should decide whether the new way of doing things should be included in standard practice. 

<P>
<H3>Action: Give control of public housing to local public housing authorities with histories of excellent management and
substantially deregulate the rest.  </H3>
<P>
     Public housing is a classic story of good intentions gone awry. When the program began in the 1930s, it was hailed as an enlightened response to European immigrants' squalid living conditions in cities across the country. Through an enormous bureaucracy stretching from Washington into virtually every city in America, the public housing program brought clean, safe, inexpensive living quarters to people who could not afford them otherwise.
<P>
     Now, however, public housing is even more troubled than our categorical grant programs. With its tight, centralized control, it epitomizes the industrial-era program: hierarchical,
rule-bound, and bureaucratic. HUD's Washington, regional, and local offices rigidly control local public housing authorities, who struggle to help the very poor. Frustrated by the failure of public housing, innovative state and local governments began to experiment with new models of developing, designing, financing, managing, and owning low-income housing. Successful efforts tailored the housing to the characteristics of the surrounding community. Local public housing authorities began to work with local governments and non-profit organizations to create
innovative new models to serve low-income people.
<P>
     HUD recognizes that local authorities with proven records of excellence can serve their customers far better if allowed to make their own decisions. We and the secretary recommend that Congress give HUD authority to create demonstration projects in which local housing authorities would continue to receive
operating subsidies as long as they met a series of performance targets, but would be free from other HUD control. Individual demonstrations could vary, but all federal rules would be open for waivers as long as HUD could measure performance in providing long-term, affordable housing to those poor enough to be eligible for public housing.
<P>
     In addition, HUD should work closely with local housing authorities, their national organizations, public housing tenant organizations, and state and local officials to eliminate
unnecessary rules, requirements, procedures, and regulations. In particular, HUD should replace its detailed procurement and operating manuals and design and site selection requirements with performance measures, using annual ranking of local housing authorities to encourage better service and greater
accountability. It should eliminate the annual budget review, an exercise in which HUD field staff spend thousands of hours reviewing and approving detailed budgets from local housing authorities --even though the reviews do not influence federal funding decisions. And it should work with Congress to change current rent rules, which create strong incentives for people to move from public housing as soon as they find jobs. Conclusion  
<P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

     The changes described above are ambitious. They will take enormous effort and enormous will. It will be many years before all of them take root. But if they succeed, the American people will have a government capable of attacking their problems with far more energy, and far less waste, than they can today imagine. 
<P>
     We must move quickly because the bureaucracy, by its nature, resists change. As Tom Peters wrote in Thriving on Chaos, "Good intentions and brilliant proposals will be dead-ended, delayed, sabotaged, massaged to death, or reversed beyond recognition or usefulness by the overlayered structures...."
<P>
     But the changes we propose will produce their own momentum to overcome bureaucratic resistance. As the red tape is being cut, federal workers will become more and more impatient with the red tape that remains. They will resist any reversal of the process. And they will be strengthened in their resistance by the steps we propose in the next chapters.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
*****************************************************************<BR>

<P>To understand the overarching role that budgeting plays in the <BR>
federal government, consider just one figure: 60 percent of all <BR>
roll call votes in Congress are on budget-related issues.<BR>

<P>However striking, this figure should not surprise us. If, after <BR>
all, Washington is a quintessentially political town, budgeting is <BR>
a quintessentially political process. A half-century ago, <BR>
political scientist Harold D. Lasswell defined politics as &quot;who <BR>
gets what, when, how.&quot; [1] The budget, in essence, answers <BR>
Lasswell's question. It shows which groups., the elderly, the <BR>
poor, children get what benefits. At the same time, it shows who <BR>
pays taxes to finance those benefits.<BR>

<P>The budget, however, should tell us much more. Indeed, budgeting <BR>
should be a managerial process that sets direction for management <BR>
improvement and efficiency. It should be a financial process that <BR>
assimilates and ties together a wealth of financial data. It <BR>
should be a marketing process, by which the government sells its <BR>
programs and services. And finally, it should be an accountability <BR>
process, through which government communicates its decisions about <BR>
priorities and expected performance.<BR>

<P>But the traditional budget process the government's procedures for <BR>
crafting a budget has not been up to par. In both the executive <BR>
branch and Congress, it has consumed far too much time, often by <BR>
forcing policymakers to address the same issues numerous times <BR>
during the course of one year. It has revolved around inputs, not <BR>
outputs, thus reducing accountability for results. It has not <BR>
forced senior officials, such as cabinet secretaries, to state <BR>
their goals and report on their progress.<BR>

<P>
<P>FOCUS ACCOUNTABILITY ON ACHIEVING RESULTS<BR>

<P>In its budgeting, the federal government needs to undergo a kind <BR>
of cultural revolution, like the one experienced by many <BR>
businesses and some states and localities. It must better link <BR>
purposes, resources, and results to help government better serve a <BR>
nation of 250 million citizens and cost less. By adopting mission-<BR>
driven, results-oriented budgeting, it can:<BR>

<P>*     provide leaders with better means to make political choices, <BR>
set goals, and establish priorities among many competing demands <BR>
and desirable ends for customer services;<BR>

<P>*     encourage long-term thinking, define goals, translate them <BR>
into desired results, and use performance measures more <BR>
effectively to make more informed decisions on program priorities <BR>
and resource allocations;<BR>

<P>*     translate choices about goals and priorities into <BR>
actions/performance objectives and standards and communicate those <BR>
objectives and standards more effectively to the 2 million federal <BR>
employees;<BR>

<P>*     remove needless constraints on managers' uses of resources <BR>
to encourage innovation and provide positive incentives to manage <BR>
effectively and cut wasteful spending; and<BR>

<P>*     convert accountability for spending money to accountability <BR>
for achieving results within resources allocated to meet or exceed <BR>
performance standards and objectives.<BR>

<P>
<P>CURRENT PROCESS NEEDS TO FOCUS MORE ON ACHIEVING RESULTS<BR>

<P>In Washington, budgeting does not occur in a vacuum. It is <BR>
strongly influenced by two basic realities: the federal <BR>
government's budget deficits, and the relatively small share of <BR>
federal spending that must, by law, come up for executive and <BR>
congressional review each year.<BR>

<P>Spending in FY 1993 totaled about $1.4 trillion, while revenues <BR>
tot<BR>
financed by borrowing, thus adding to the national debt. At the <BR>
same time, only a third of the budget about $540 billion is <BR>
subject to annual decisions. This &quot;discretionary&quot; spending <BR>
includes most of the grant funding for education, law enforcement, <BR>
Head Start, and environmental protection. It also includes total <BR>
spending for the operation of the federal government defense, <BR>
national parks, salaries of federal employees, etc.<BR>

<P>About half of annual spending goes for &quot;mandatory&quot; spending, such <BR>
as social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Aid to Families with <BR>
Dependent Children. The rest about 14 percent of annual spending <BR>
pays net interest costs on the debt.<BR>

<P>The massive size of the budget, when combined with year-to-year <BR>
adjustments, means that small changes in interest rates, <BR>
inflation, employment levels, or the size of beneficiary <BR>
populations can add or subtract billions in federal spending. For <BR>
instance, a 1 percent rise in unemployment increases Food Stamp <BR>
participation by about a million persons, costing about $1 billion <BR>
a year.<BR>

<P>Were it easy to greatly reduce the deficit, past Presidents and <BR>
Congresses would have done so. Needs greatly outweigh resources, <BR>
so demand far exceeds supply. Everyone wants more, feels justified <BR>
in seeking more, organizes to get more. Changes in the budget <BR>
process won't alter that reality. Nor, alone, will they close the <BR>
gap between revenues and spending. Nevertheless, changes in the <BR>
budget process can make the solutions more obvious and easier to <BR>
implement and will create a focus on achieving results.<BR>

<P>
<P>CHANGING THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT MORE MEANINGFUL<BR>

<P>During the budget process, most attention focuses on justifying <BR>
new spending proposals, not examining what the money buys or <BR>
ensuring that it accomplishes its purpose. Managers often do not <BR>
get clear instructions on which results have the highest priority, <BR>
nor on the results-oriented performance measures to which they <BR>
will be held accountable. Few government managers get the clear <BR>
charge, tools, and flexibility to provide quality services to <BR>
customers. Because programs' purposes and priorities are not <BR>
always clear, and recipients' interests are, the process focuses <BR>
on complying with controls to ensure that the money goes for those <BR>
interests. <BR>

<P>A Focus on Performance. Congressional testimony in support of the <BR>
Government Performance and Results Act2 (which President Clinton <BR>
signed August 3, 1993) stressed the need for a fundamental shift <BR>
in the federal government's accountability system from one <BR>
oriented to accountability for processes and who gets which <BR>
&quot;inputs&quot; (in this case, fiscal resources) to one focusing <BR>
accountability on performance and results. <BR>

<P>A 1992 General Accounting Office (GAO) survey on program <BR>
performance measures found that nearly two-thirds of 103 agencies <BR>
contacted had long-term strategic plans, and more than three-<BR>
quarters said they were collecting various program performance <BR>
data. But fewer than half made substantial use of performance <BR>
information in assessing progress toward strategic objectives. <BR>
Even fewer used performance measures for external performance and <BR>
accountability reporting. In a more detailed examination of 14 <BR>
sample agencies, GAO found only a very limited application of <BR>
performance information in program and policy decision making.3<BR>

<P>No wonder. The budget process does not focus on performance <BR>
information. It wastes inordinate time on detail and numbers only <BR>
loosely tied to achieving missions and results. The effort diverts <BR>
time and energy from the tough policy and managerial judgments <BR>
needed to cut the deficit.<BR>

<P>A labor-intensive Process. Specifically, budgetmaking is a labor-<BR>
intensive process, full of incentives to request maximum funding <BR>
and spend all appropriations, and a control-oriented process, in <BR>
which who makes spending decisions and who gets the money is more <BR>
important than results. It focuses more on the demands of <BR>
individual agencies than on interagency missions to meet broader <BR>
administration goals. It deals primarily with marginal spending <BR>
changes, not the base from which those changes are made, to <BR>
achieve missions, goals, and results. And it devotes an inordinate <BR>
amount of time to debating the use of discretionary funds compared <BR>
with the mandatory spending and tax expenditures that, more than <BR>
ever, fuel the ever-growing national debt.<BR>

<P>Transforming the Process. This administration has already begun to <BR>
transform these processes. The focus of the budget is moving away <BR>
from seeking more, more, more. The process must be transformed to <BR>
focus on what managers produce and citizens get for their <BR>
money/results, performance, value, quality, and customer service. <BR>

<P>As veteran public servant Elliot Richardson put it: &quot;Whether or <BR>
not an administration succeeds or fails depends on how clearly, <BR>
forcefully, and persuasively it defines its goals and creates <BR>
understanding of the necessity for sacrificing desirable ends that <BR>
do not have sufficient priority to claim a share of the available <BR>
[time and monetary] resources. Given the deficit on the one side <BR>
and ever-increasing demands on the other, the crunch between <BR>
claims and resources is more brutal than ever. Leadership that <BR>
squarely addresses this crunch is therefore more needed than <BR>
ever.&quot;4<BR>

<P>The deficit is fueling the rethinking, but our recommendations <BR>
represent a logical, rational way for government to plan for, <BR>
allocate, and manage resources with or without a deficit. <BR>
Underpinning the recommendations is a commitment to deliver the <BR>
best value, quality, and service for taxpayers' money.<BR>

<P>For government to meet 21st century challenges and regain taxpayer <BR>
confidence, its focus on processes and inputs must give way to <BR>
results and outputs. This report lays out three major initiatives <BR>
to develop mission-driven, results-oriented budgeting that <BR>
empowers policy leaders and managers to link purposes, resources, <BR>
and results to make government work better and cost less. These <BR>
three initiatives, and the recommendations that go with them, are <BR>
summarized below.<BR>

<P>1. Strengthen accountability for results, with political <BR>
leadership defining political priorities first, then reaching <BR>
agreements with managers on what they are expected to accomplish <BR>
and how their accomplishments will be measured.<BR>

<P>*     The President should establish performance agreements with <BR>
his cabinet officers and agency heads to articulate what is <BR>
expected of them and how they will be accountable for their <BR>
performance.<BR>

<P>*     Each agency should develop a clear strategic plan, as <BR>
mandated by the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act, and <BR>
agency heads should use performance agreements to forge an <BR>
effective team committed to the accomplishment of organizational <BR>
goals and objectives.5<BR>

<P>*     Each agency and its sub-units should strive to be the &quot;best <BR>
in its class&quot;i.e., compare favorably in benchmark standards for <BR>
quality, service, and cost with other organizations carrying out <BR>
the same or similar operations.<BR>

<P>*     Policy officials, managers, agency budget offices, and OMB <BR>
should incorporate performance objectives and results as key <BR>
elements in management and budget development, review, and <BR>
deliberations.<BR>

<P>*     Agencies should identify teams, led by line managers, to <BR>
develop and coordinate the development and use of measures to <BR>
improve performance and ensure the quality and validity of <BR>
performance information.<BR>

<P>2. Once decisions have been reached, empower managers to achieve <BR>
expected results by providing the necessary resources, unburdened <BR>
by excessively detailed restrictions.<BR>

<P>*     To enable managers to use resources effectively and <BR>
efficiently to achieve desired results, the number of detailed, <BR>
itemized limitations on spending should be substantially <BR>
decreased, including overly detailed and minutely divided <BR>
appropriation line items, earmarks in report language, object <BR>
class limitations, apportionments, allotments, and sub-allotments. <BR>
Appropriation accounts and line items ought to be more aligned <BR>
with programs designed to carry out policy decisions and charged <BR>
with the costs that their programs generate.<BR>

<P>*     Operational plans and performance goals should be updated <BR>
after enactment of appropriations. Agency heads should adjust <BR>
their operating plans to clarify performance goals and results <BR>
sought.<BR>

<P>*     Budgeting for, and managing within, funds provided for the <BR>
cost of direct federal operations should replace use of employment <BR>
ceilings and floors as a tool to control overall federal <BR>
employment levels.<BR>

<P>*     More appropriations should be converted from annual to multi <BR>
or no-year availability, and 50 percent of unobligated yearend <BR>
balances of operating funds in annual accounts should be rolled <BR>
over into the next year for use by managers to address unnecessary <BR>
end-of-year spending.<BR>

<P>*     The executive branch should evaluate its handling of <BR>
requests to move funds from one line item or organization to <BR>
another (i.e., for handling reapportionments, reprogrammings, and <BR>
reallotments), eliminating burdensome procedures that add little <BR>
or no value. Negotiations should be conducted with Congress toward <BR>
greater flexibility to transfer between appropriations and to <BR>
reprogram funds within appropriation accounts. <BR>

<P>*     Agency heads should submit reprogrammings to Congress, after <BR>
the advance notification and approval of OMB. OMB should <BR>
automatically approve reprogramming unless it objects within a set <BR>
period of time, such as five days.<BR>

<P>*     Revolving or working capital funds should be established to <BR>
finance administrative and other support services, where <BR>
appropriate.<BR>

<P>*     Managers should make greater use of flexibility currently <BR>
available to achieve results within limitations set by policy <BR>
determinations.<BR>

<P>3. Streamline and improve the budget development process to give <BR>
managers more time to manage their programs, to provide them with <BR>
more timely information on policy priorities and funding levels in <BR>
order to more effectively use resources, and to provide links <BR>
between budgetary resources, missions, goals, and results.<BR>

<P>*     The President should propose a biennial budget. Congress <BR>
should adopt biennial budget resolutions and appropriations.<BR>

<P>*     The administration should develop  an internal mechanism for <BR>
communicating total fiscal limits, allocating resources within <BR>
those limits, and enunciating multiyear spending targets. This <BR>
mechanism, analagous to the Congressional Budget Resolution, <BR>
should allocate funding by the broad missions of government cross-<BR>
tabulated by agency, thus avoiding months of effort spent <BR>
developing unrealistic budget requests. Policy discussions should <BR>
involve all affected agencies.<BR>

<P>*     The President should make extensive use of White House <BR>
policy staff to strengthen budget developments on priority issues <BR>
that involve multiple federal agencies.<BR>

<P>*     The former secretive, hierarchical development of the <BR>
President's budget should be replaced with a coordinated team <BR>
approach focused on achieving results.<BR>

<P>*     The President should have expedited rescission authority, a <BR>
form of line item veto, to support his managerial role in <BR>
effecting savings in government operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>CHANGING THE PROCESS<BR>

<P>The key recommendations summarized here and additional ones in the <BR>
following report are intertwined with other NPR recommendations, <BR>
especially those relating to leadership and management, financial <BR>
management, organizational structures, human resources, program <BR>
design, and customer service. Together, these recommendations <BR>
create the framework for changing the management culture in the <BR>
federal government to focus on results, quality, and customer <BR>
service. Major changes such as these will require years of hard <BR>
work.<BR>

<P>*******************<BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
*******************<BR>

<P>When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was assigned to command the <BR>
Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II, the mission order <BR>
he received was clear and measurable: &quot;You will enter the <BR>
continent of Europe and, in conjunction with the other United <BR>
Nations, undertake operations aimed at the heart of Germany and <BR>
the destruction of her armed forces.&quot;1 This simple, direct order <BR>
spelled out expectations for a vast organization of more than 1.5 <BR>
million American men and women at its peak, required a working <BR>
relationship with other services and countries, and empowered one <BR>
of this century's great generals to change the course of history.2<BR>

<P>Civilian government has been slow to set such clear expectations <BR>
for the performance of its top leaders. In general, there have not <BR>
been written agreementsor any other systematic approachesl inking <BR>
the goals of the President to the performance of top political <BR>
appointees and, in turn, to the civil servants below. Thus, the <BR>
chain of command in the executive branch is weakened at the <BR>
highest levels. <BR>

<P>Faced with severe fiscal constraints and a desire to improve their <BR>
efficiency and effectiveness, a number of countries, states, and <BR>
localities as well as numerous American corporations are using <BR>
performance agreements with senior officials to set mutually <BR>
agreed upon objectives for organizational performance. For <BR>
example, many senior officials in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, <BR>
and the United Kingdom now have written agreements that are tied <BR>
to agency specific strategic plans (similar to those strategic <BR>
plans envisioned in the Government Performance and Results Act of <BR>
1993).3 The agreements establish priorities, set understandings <BR>
about expected performance, and grant specific delegations of <BR>
authority. Senior officials in these countries said that <BR>
performance agreements probably had a greater impact on <BR>
organizational performance than any other single aspect of <BR>
government reform.4<BR>

<P>In the United States, a number of states and localities, from Ohio <BR>
to Seattle, Washington, have developed some type of performance <BR>
agreement with senior managers. For example, in Sunnyvale, <BR>
California, managers from the city manager on down have written <BR>
agreements that support city objectives. The experience of AT&amp;T, <BR>
Microsoft, and many other American corporations has underlined the <BR>
importance of linking performance agreements to organizational <BR>
goals and team performance.5<BR>

<P>At the federal level, there are precedents besides the military. <BR>
Ambassadors customarily receive two letters before going to a new <BR>
country a State Department letter of instruction describing a few <BR>
objectives for the ambassador to pursue and a presidential letter <BR>
that lays out the relationships among cabinet agencies with <BR>
overseas representation.6 In 1991, following a series of <BR>
management problems, the Deputy Director for Management of the <BR>
Office of Management and Budget and the three members of the <BR>
Railroad Retirement Board exchanged letters that committed the <BR>
resources and set out the actions necessary to achieve operational <BR>
improvements and &quot;restore confidence in the operations and <BR>
integrity of the railroad retirement system.&quot;7<BR>

<P>All career federal employees participate in some form of <BR>
performance evaluation system. Federal law requires that the <BR>
compensation, retention, and tenure of top civil servants, the <BR>
Senior Executive Service, be based on &quot;individual and <BR>
organizational performance (including such factors as improvements <BR>
in efficiency, productivity, quality of work or service, cost <BR>
efficiency, and timeliness of performance and success in meeting <BR>
equal opportunity goals).&quot;8 <BR>

<P>
<P>*********************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
*********************<BR>

<P>There are two critical weaknesses in the chain of command between <BR>
the President and the performance of federal agencies. One is the <BR>
lack of a systematic way to establish objectives for the <BR>
performance of presidential appointees with respect to their <BR>
agencies' performance. The second is the break between the <BR>
organizational and policy goals of political appointees who lead <BR>
the agencies and the career civil servants who carry out the <BR>
policies and programs. These two weaknesses undermine the <BR>
performance of the federal government in several ways. They <BR>
encourage distrust between political appointees and career <BR>
officials, contribute to confusion about organizational and policy <BR>
goals, diffuse lines of authority and accountability, and <BR>
undermine a sense of organizational cohesion, direction, and <BR>
fairness. These key weaknesses in line authority invite <BR>
intervention and interpretation by those in staff positions. Thus, <BR>
the lack of guidance and agreement on priorities results, not in <BR>
decentralized authority, but in the imposition of top-down <BR>
controls and micro-management.<BR>

<P>The federal performance appraisal system traces its roots to 1842, <BR>
when the head of each agency was required to submit an &quot;annual <BR>
individual employee service report&quot; to Congress. Today, <BR>
presidential appointees belong to the only federal personnel <BR>
category without written performance agreements or a system of <BR>
accountability other than to the President.9<BR>

<P>Surprisingly, regardless of political party there is no <BR>
established process by which senior appointees or even Cabinet <BR>
members of a new administration are oriented to policies and <BR>
priorities and reach consensus about an administration's goals and <BR>
objectives for departmental performance. Two months after he <BR>
arrived from Merrill Lynch to became Secretary of the Treasury, <BR>
Donald Regan recorded, &quot;Never has [President Reagan], or anyone <BR>
else, sat down in private to explain to me what is expected of me, <BR>
what goals he would like to see me accomplish, what results he <BR>
wants. Since I am accustomed to management by objective, where <BR>
people have in writing what is expected, and explicit standards <BR>
are set, this has been most disconcerting. How can one do a job if <BR>
the job is not defined? I have been struggling to do what I <BR>
consider the job to be. . . . This is dangerous.&quot; He recalled <BR>
later, &quot;From the first day to last at Treasury, I was flying by <BR>
the seat of my pants. The President never told me what he believed <BR>
or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had <BR>
to figure those things out like any other American, by studying <BR>
his speeches and reading the newspapers.&quot;10 While this may be an <BR>
extreme case, senior government officials have confirmed that, at <BR>
least in the last several administrations, appointees have rarely <BR>
been given upfront guidance on priorities for their agencies' <BR>
policy or management agenda. <BR>

<P>Although members of the Senior Executive Service, both career and <BR>
appointed, do have performance agreements, the effect of these <BR>
agreements is weakened since they are not effectively tied to <BR>
organizational goals or to the political leadership. In a General <BR>
Accounting Office study of the use of performance measures by <BR>
federal agencies, nearly half the agencies reported that the <BR>
goals, standards, or objectives of the organization were not <BR>
reflected at all or, if so, to only a minor or moderate extent in <BR>
Senior Executive Service or other senior management performance <BR>
contracts.11 Even where they are tied to organizational goals in a <BR>
personnel evaluation document, performance agreements do little to <BR>
enhance organizational performance when the document and the <BR>
system that produces it become ends in themselves.12<BR>

<P>What is important is not the paperwork system but the fact that <BR>
priorities are established and that people in an organization both <BR>
political and career come to an understanding of clear <BR>
organizational goals.13 Only then can employees plan how to work <BR>
together to accomplish their objectives, obtain support and <BR>
feedback from their customers and colleagues, give and receive <BR>
assistance when groups are failing to meet their objectives, and <BR>
be fairly recognized for their contribution to the achievement of <BR>
organizational goals.<BR>

<P>Having this kind of process flowing from the top can only <BR>
strengthen the effectiveness of the performance agreement system <BR>
below. Having such a process by which a public sector manager's <BR>
&quot;mandate for action&quot; or &quot;bottom line&quot; is negotiated is the <BR>
concrete way to establish the substantive terms of a manager's <BR>
accountability.14<BR>

<P>As the federal government reinvents its human resource and other <BR>
systems and moves increasingly toward managing for results, <BR>
political appointees, senior career executives, and other civil <BR>
servants need to be joined in fair and coherent systems of <BR>
organizational accountability. It is essential to develop a more <BR>
effective link and clearer consensus with career executives about <BR>
the objectives and goals of the organizations that they are <BR>
leading and to base accountability and incentive systems on <BR>
progress toward the accomplishment of these goals and <BR>
objectives.15 <BR>

<P>The need to develop a more systematic approach is more urgent <BR>
today because of the number and importance of management roles <BR>
that political appointees have come to play in the federal <BR>
government. The Volcker Commission, the General Accounting Office, <BR>
and others have expressed concern about the growing number of <BR>
political appointees in management positions in federal agencies <BR>
over several administrations and, because of their short average <BR>
tenure, the impact of these appointees on program stability and <BR>
continuity.16 A more coherent system firmly based on <BR>
organizational mission and goals is needed to help ensure greater <BR>
continuity and stability in achieving organizational and policy <BR>
objectives.<BR>

<P>Performance agreements should not only be vehicles for <BR>
accountability but also for empowerment. For example, a <BR>
performance agreement could include delegations of authority to <BR>
support the achievement of objectives. For example, limitations on <BR>
personnel, administration of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and <BR>
other authorities could be delegated from central agencies to <BR>
agency heads or designees as part of a performance agreement <BR>
between the President and an agency head.17 Agreement in advance <BR>
about priorities could also reduce the micromanagement that may <BR>
occur when priorities are not clear.<BR>

<P>Certainly corporate and other organizational experience suggests <BR>
that managers at all levels should be held accountable for <BR>
achieving results from the activities under their direct <BR>
control.18 Managing for results, however, speaks about leadership. <BR>
It requires benchmarking performance against higher standards and <BR>
reaching beyond those things within the manager's direct control <BR>
and working with other organizations to achieve higher order <BR>
outcomes. It also requires continuous change to refine strategies, <BR>
respond to customer and employee feedback, and take advantage of <BR>
new information and technology.     <BR>

<P>Managing for results also requires making adjustments when desired <BR>
outcomes are not achieved and understanding the reasons for <BR>
success or failure. It means a willingness to terminate programs, <BR>
substantially alter them, increase or decrease funding, and <BR>
conduct research and evaluation to identify the sources of and <BR>
solutions to problems. Managers, in other words, can succeed even <BR>
when programs fail or fail even when everything is delivered. <BR>
Managers who aim high should not be penalized because ambitious <BR>
objectives are not achieved, if they are effectively managing for <BR>
results.<BR>

<P>
<P>*********************<BR>
ACTIONS<BR>
*********************<BR>

<P>1. The President should develop written performance agreements <BR>
with department and agency heads. (2)<BR>

<P>The President should develop performance agreements with agency <BR>
heads that reflect a mutual understanding of key organizational <BR>
objectives and delegations. These performance agreements should:<BR>

<P>*     focus on broad goals important enough to be followed by the <BR>
President;<BR>

<P>*     focus on a very limited number of mutually agreed upon <BR>
objectives specific to the organization and supportive of its <BR>
mission;<BR>

<P>*     include agreed upon delegations of authorities and <BR>
managerial flexibility that are within the power of the executive <BR>
branch and are related to areas of performance;<BR>

<P>*     be verifiable, reviewed on a regular basis, and updated as <BR>
appropriate; and<BR>

<P>*     avoid extensive reporting.<BR>

<P>Performance agreements should be introduced incrementally by <BR>
beginning with: (1) the heads of the 14 cabinet departments and <BR>
the 10 largest agencies, and (2) very limited priority goals or <BR>
objectives as few as one, perhaps no more than three. The best <BR>
performance agreements are clear, simple, and measurable.19<BR>

<P>There are many models for the content of agreements and for the <BR>
process by which the content is developed. New Zealand's <BR>
ministerial level agreements, for example, contain elements of <BR>
personal, organizational, and managerial performance. Agreements <BR>
with heads of agencies that are engaged with reform in the United <BR>
Kingdom called Next Steps Agencies are based on the strategic <BR>
plans of the agencies. The letters of instruction for ambassadors <BR>
are often prepared by a country desk officer and then widely <BR>
reviewed in the Department of State. <BR>

<P>Whatever approach and model are adopted, they will need to be <BR>
flexible to reflect different agency missions, capacities, <BR>
approaches, and organizational cultures. For example, if <BR>
performance agreements contain budgetary agreements between the <BR>
agency head and the President, they will need to be adjusted if <BR>
appropriated funds are significantly higher or lower than planned. <BR>
Senior officials in agencies that have formulated clear goals and <BR>
a well developed capacity to measure their performance might have <BR>
agreements that include considerable delegation of authority and <BR>
administrative flexibility to manage within their agreed upon <BR>
budget. Although approaches may vary, key features of effective <BR>
performance agreements should include: &quot;the substantive values, <BR>
goals or objectives that are to guide the manager's ACTIONS,&quot; an <BR>
agreement on how objectives will be measured, a method for <BR>
reporting and verification, and a system for making adjustments.20 <BR>

<P>Although there are compelling reasons to move to performance <BR>
agreements with senior political officials, there are also strong <BR>
reasons to proceed cautiously and incrementally. Perhaps the <BR>
greatest single risk is overloading the system and thereby sowing <BR>
the seeds of its collapse. This is what happened with efforts to <BR>
establish management by objectives during previous administrations <BR>
and contributed to their brief tenures. Too many objectives <BR>
diffuse focus. Too much reporting clogs critical communication <BR>
channels and will tend to be delegated to staff and lose <BR>
importance.<BR>

<P>2. In every federal agency, use performance agreements and other <BR>
approaches to forge an effective team committed to the <BR>
accomplishment of organizational goals and objectives. (1)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should lead, first, by example and, second, by <BR>
encouraging the development of mission-oriented, empowering <BR>
performance agreements throughout their departments and agencies. <BR>
Agency heads should ensure that performance contracts in the <BR>
Senior Executive Service focus clearly on organizational <BR>
objectives and inspire organizational performance. In most <BR>
agencies, this will require significant changes in how the Senior <BR>
Executive Service system of contract, evaluation, and rewards <BR>
functions. According to the Office of Personnel Management, <BR>
current laws and regulations governing personnel performance <BR>
evaluation also permit the use of other federal performance <BR>
planning and evaluation systems to reinforce organizational <BR>
performance; it is practice that has failed to make an effective <BR>
linkage.<BR>

<P>If effectively used, the Senior Executive Service and other <BR>
performance systems should be important vehicles to link political <BR>
and career employees in common cause, set and reinforce <BR>
expectations for organizational performance, give senior managers <BR>
the authority and flexibility they need to perform, and hold them <BR>
accountable for managing for results. Giving managers the <BR>
authority and flexibility to perform effectively is an essential <BR>
complement to performance measurement systems, as described later <BR>
in BGT03, BGT04, and BGT05.<BR>

<P>There are many approaches to implementing this recommendation. For <BR>
example, this past spring Secretary Henry Cisneros at the <BR>
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began the <BR>
process by developing a vision statement for his agency. He and <BR>
his senior staff led workshops, involving all 13,500 HUD employees <BR>
across the country, that clarified HUD's values and mission. Based <BR>
on this vision statement, Secretary Cisneros led his senior staff <BR>
in establishing agreements on program and management priorities <BR>
that will guide the specific ACTIONS of each department and be the <BR>
basis of benchmarks for HUD's performance. In the late 1970's, <BR>
General Bill Creech in the U.S. Tactical Air Command focused his <BR>
organization on two expectations: flying and fighting. &quot;Wing <BR>
commanders (executives) were ordered to resume flying and wear <BR>
their flying suits around the base. . . . Every squadron member . <BR>
. . knew precisely what he/she had to do to meet the <BR>
flying/fighting expectations.&quot;21 As a result, the Tactical Air <BR>
Command was able to increase sorties an average of 11 percent <BR>
annually and reduce its budget 40 percent.<BR>

<P>Agency heads and managers will need to use approaches that best <BR>
suit their organizational needs and culture. However, as one <BR>
management expert advised, &quot;it's the last 3 million employees in <BR>
the federal government who really count.&quot;22 In other words, <BR>
everyone from the top leader to the person answering the phone <BR>
needs to understand and feel part of a mission-driven, results-<BR>
oriented agency. As Vice President Al Gore said in a talk to NPR, <BR>
&quot;Part of the secret of any high-performing organization is having <BR>
a clear mission that is well known and internalized by every <BR>
single man and woman in that organization.&quot;23 <BR>

of 1993<BR>

BACKGROUND<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>To manage federal programs more effectively to &quot;do the right <BR>
things better&quot;managers need to know what the &quot;right things&quot; are <BR>
and how much they need to achieve. There are innovative federal <BR>
agencies that have clear, results-oriented objectives and use <BR>
performance measurement to continuously improve their programs. <BR>
However, surveys by the General Accounting Office and the <BR>
Congressional Budget Office suggest that strategic planning and <BR>
performance measurement remain a veneer in most federal agencies, <BR>
having little effect on program operations.1 Earlier efforts to <BR>
improve the performance or effectiveness of federal programs from <BR>
the &quot;performance government&quot; of the 1940's and 1950's and <BR>
programming, planning, and budgeting in the 1960's through zero <BR>
based budgeting of the 1970's and management by objectives in the <BR>
1980'shave had a limited impact.2<BR>

<P>Current processes cause federal managers to be more concerned with <BR>
following rules and procedures, justifying new resources, and <BR>
reporting on compliance than with developing strategic plans, <BR>
measuring progress, and achieving results. In a sad parody of a <BR>
well known corporate motto, one federal employee lamented, <BR>
&quot;Process is our most important product.&quot;<BR>

<P>Since the 1970's, American industry has changed in response to <BR>
international competition. It has decentralized and streamlined <BR>
its operations, reoriented its focus toward customer service, and <BR>
placed an overall emphasis on quality. Managers are being asked to <BR>
measure their performance and make continuous improvements in <BR>
processes and products. Many managers are using bench marking <BR>
measuring performance, comparing it against a standard, and <BR>
constantly seeking to improve results. For example, Xerox <BR>
Corporation, a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award winner, <BR>
continuously benchmarks its performance against similar functions <BR>
in such companies as Nordstrom and L.L. Bean.<BR>

<P>An emphasis on managing for results is also permeating state and <BR>
local government. As early as 1973, Sunnyvale, California, began <BR>
adopting comprehensive performance planning, measurement, and <BR>
budgeting as part of a new approach to city management. <BR>
Sunnyvale's success has stimulated results-oriented management in <BR>
other states and cities. Florida, Minnesota, Texas, and Phoenix, <BR>
Arizona, are among those that are changing their management <BR>
practices to emphasize results and improve performance.3 <BR>

<P>Oregon, for example, is using what it calls benchmarks &quot;to guide <BR>
our state to a better future as a people, as a place, and as an <BR>
economy.&quot;4 The legislature adopted statewide measures unanimously. <BR>
According to Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts, &quot;In state government <BR>
the benchmarks have already been adopted as a tool for stating <BR>
concrete objectives, setting program and budget priorities and <BR>
measuring performance. They are helping our agencies to focus <BR>
differently, work more closely together, and make better use of <BR>
existing resources.5 Other countries the United Kingdom, <BR>
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, and others as cited <BR>
earlier have also increased their use of performance measurement <BR>
to guide management and budgeting over the last decade.6<BR>

<P>Today, concerns with government inefficiency and mounting deficits <BR>
are spurring federal programs to improve performance. Building on <BR>
the total quality movement of the 1980's and the Chief Financial <BR>
Officers Act of 1990, a number of federal agencies are making <BR>
substantial progress. For example, the Internal Revenue Service <BR>
(IRS) has developed a strategic plan with a strong customer-<BR>
oriented mission, explicit performance objectives, and a strategy <BR>
for achieving those objectives. IRS pilot sites in Cincinnati and <BR>
elsewhere are collecting performance data and beginning to relate <BR>
them to financial measures. The Agency for International <BR>
Development (AID) is implementing a bottom-up strategic planning <BR>
and performance measurement system; more than 60 of its field <BR>
missions have begun to use performance information in program <BR>
decision making. AID programs, such as child survival and family <BR>
planning, have set clear goals and strategies, invested for more <BR>
than a decade in the development and collection of performance <BR>
indicators, and widely use performance information for planning, <BR>
operational decisions, and reporting.<BR>

<P>The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) provides <BR>
a sound basis for strengthening these and other ongoing agency <BR>
efforts to use strategic planning and performance measurement to <BR>
improve results. Signed by President Clinton on August 3, 1993, <BR>
the law's purposes are to:<BR>

<P>*     improve the confidence of the American people in the <BR>
capability of the federal government, by systematically holding <BR>
federal agencies accountable for achieving program results;<BR>

<P>*     initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot <BR>
projects in setting program goals, measuring program performance <BR>
against those goals, and reporting publicly on their progress;<BR>

<P>*     improve federal program effectiveness and public <BR>
accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service <BR>
quality, and customer satisfaction;<BR>

<P>*     help federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring <BR>
that they plan for meeting program objectives and by providing <BR>
them with information about program results and service quality;<BR>

<P>*     improve congressional decision making by providing more <BR>
objective information on achieving statutory objectives, and on <BR>
the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and <BR>
spending; and<BR>

<P>*     improve internal management of the federal government.7<BR>

<P>This law requires all agencies to define their long-term goals, <BR>
set specific annual performance targets, and report annually on <BR>
performance compared to targets. It calls for some key components <BR>
strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance <BR>
reports and provides the managerial flexibility that is crucial to <BR>
mission-driven, results-oriented budgeting and management. The law <BR>
begins with pilot programs in fiscal year 1994 before proceeding <BR>
to government-wide implementation in fiscal year 1999. In signing <BR>
the bill, President Clinton summarized the GPRA's provisions: &quot;The <BR>
law simply requires that we chart a course for every endeavor that <BR>
we take the people's money for, see how well we are progressing, <BR>
tell the public how we are doing, stop the things that don't work, <BR>
and never stop improving the things that we think are worth <BR>
investing in.&quot;8<BR>

NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
******************<BR>

<P>As President Clinton noted when signing the GPRA, &quot;This is an <BR>
effort that is long, long overdue.&quot;9 Testimony in support of the <BR>
GPRA and many government experts have emphasized the need for a <BR>
fundamental shift in the system of accountability in the federal <BR>
government from one oriented around accountability for processes <BR>
and &quot;inputs&quot; (i.e., activities or resources to achieve results) to <BR>
one that measures performance and is accountable for results <BR>
actually achieved. As a U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) <BR>
report noted, &quot;Whether the goal is defending the nation or <BR>
immunizing children against disease, government officials and the <BR>
public need to know how well government is accomplishing its <BR>
intended objectives.&quot;10 <BR>

<P>A recent survey of leaders in 75 major American corporations, <BR>
conducted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, concluded that <BR>
federal program managers could learn &quot;immeasurably&quot; from corporate <BR>
best practices. The report noted that &quot;measurement of the <BR>
effectiveness, efficiency and economy of products, services and <BR>
processes is the keystone for assessing current circumstances, <BR>
planning strategic goals, and monitoring incremental and <BR>
comprehensive improvements.&quot;11<BR>

<P>A 1992 GAO survey on program performance measures found that <BR>
twothirds of the 103 agencies contacted had strategic plans and <BR>
more than three-quarters collected program performance data. <BR>
However, fewer than half of these agencies were making substantial <BR>
use of performance information in assessing progress toward <BR>
strategic goals and objectives. Even fewer were using performance <BR>
measures in external performance and accountability reporting. The <BR>
GAO's more detailed look at 14 sample agencies found only a very <BR>
limited application of performance information in program and <BR>
policy decision making.12 <BR>

<P>In contrast, when one looks at the most successful federal <BR>
programs and managers, it is clear that they not only measure <BR>
their performance, they act on what they learn. For example, <BR>
whenever one Assistant Commissioner at the Treasury Department's <BR>
Financial Management Service learns that checks going to <BR>
particular zip codes are arriving late, his staff immediately meet <BR>
with the Postal Service to resolve the problem. With this kind of <BR>
commitment, it's not surprising that this manager can attest that <BR>
he &quot;directs the largest, most reliable, low-cost and productive <BR>
payment disbursing operation in the world and that he has the <BR>
data to support his claim.13<BR>

<P>Agencies that have undertaken comprehensive strategic planning <BR>
exercises have usually emerged with a much clearer sense both of <BR>
the objectives they can reasonably achieve and how these <BR>
objectives should be pursued. Strategic planning at the Social <BR>
Security Administration, for example, resulted in measurable <BR>
customer service objectives and a set of activities to achieve <BR>
them. At the National Archives, strategic planning improved <BR>
employee motivation and helped managers make more informed <BR>
decisions by providing information about results. Strategic <BR>
planning has long characterized programs in the Department of <BR>
Defense (DOD). Recently, DOD has applied &quot;business process <BR>
reengineering&quot; and developed new corporate information management <BR>
systems to reorient its operations around common missions and <BR>
priority objectives.14<BR>

<P>Everyone agrees that it is important to measure and manage for <BR>
results. Nonetheless, there are a number of challenges facing <BR>
federal managers. First, many federal programs encompass multiple, <BR>
contradictory, ambiguous, changing, or even unfunded objectives. <BR>
Yet, just as America's military commanders have insisted that no <BR>
American troops be committed to combat without clear objectives, <BR>
&quot;if a public agency is asked to attack a particular problem, it <BR>
ought to be given a clear goal; it ought to know what it takes to <BR>
reach the goal and what intermediate successes can be achieved <BR>
along the way.&quot;15 This is not always easy. Setting objectives <BR>
requires choices. It can require careful consideration and <BR>
possible tradeoffs between competing objectives, between long and <BR>
short-term goals, or between innovation and certainty. What are <BR>
the tradeoffs between clean air and short-term economic growth? <BR>
What are the risks that expanding the availability of credit will <BR>
increase the number of bank failures? <BR>

<P>Second, federal programs are diverse ranging from income security <BR>
to diplomacy, from research to national defense. These diverse <BR>
programs produce very different outputs, resulting in very <BR>
different outcomes, requiring very different performance measures. <BR>
Many federal programs co-fund activities administered by state and <BR>
local governments or private and nonprofit organizations and <BR>
interact only indirectly with the ultimate users or recipients of <BR>
these programs. Because of this diversity, federal managers <BR>
developing performance measurement will find some of their best <BR>
assistance from managers of programs similar to theirs who have <BR>
found useful ways to measure performance.<BR>

<P>Third, federal managers need to keep performance measurement <BR>
simple and useful. The goal should be to adopt a few relatively <BR>
simple measures that tell line managers how programs are <BR>
performing, to use that information to find potential problems and <BR>
solutions, and to stimulate continuous improvement. <BR>

<P>Finally, the relationship between customers and federal programs <BR>
is often less direct than in state or local government or in the <BR>
private sector, and customer feedback has rarely been built into <BR>
the assessment of federal programs. In reality, however, the <BR>
federal government has hundreds of millions of direct contacts <BR>
with the public every year. Better feedback from these customers <BR>
would provide extremely useful information about the performance <BR>
of many federal programs.<BR>

<P>These are the challenges that federal managers will need to <BR>
address to implement the GPRA effectively. The findings and <BR>
recommendations in this report are consistent with the GPRA and, <BR>
in some cases, go beyond certain provisions of the legislation to <BR>
capitalize on the momentum as federal employees across the country <BR>
realize how they can make an important contribution toward <BR>
reinventing the federal government. Successfully implementing the <BR>
GPRA will improve federal program effectiveness and public <BR>
accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service <BR>
quality, and customer satisfaction. This will require strong <BR>
leadership from the top and from line managers across the federal <BR>
government. It will need caution to avoid establishing new <BR>
performance information bureaucracies. It will need active <BR>
participation from the bottom, expanded use of performance <BR>
information in management and budget decision making, and <BR>
effective systems for assuring that performance information is <BR>
valid and reliable. <BR>

<P>******************<BR> 
ACTIONS<BR>
******************<BR>

<P>1. Accelerate planning and measurement to improve performance in <BR>
every federal program and agency. (2)<BR>

<P>OMB, through its GPRA leadership role, and the Office of Personnel <BR>
Management (OPM), through its training, should encourage all <BR>
agencies to make greater use of performance planning and <BR>
measurement now, whether or not they are designated as pilot <BR>
agencies. Every agency, for example, could identify prototype <BR>
sites, assess current status, identify benchmarks, formulate <BR>
implementation milestones to cover its major mission areas, and <BR>
make much better use of currently available data. Agencies should <BR>
be encouraged to display performance measures in internal budget <BR>
submissions and to tie performance to budget decisions, where <BR>
possible, even before formal implementation of the performance <BR>
budgeting portions of GPRA. Although this will be difficult for <BR>
some agencies, others are in a position to try early <BR>
implementation and should be encouraged to do so. <BR>

<P>Even small differences in federal program performance can make <BR>
large differences in people's lives whether they want a reliable <BR>
weather report before going on a picnic, the right answer to a tax <BR>
question, or the timely arrival of a government check before the <BR>
rent is due. The Department of Treasury's Financial Management <BR>
Service, for example, delivers 99.8 percent of its checks on time. <BR>
If this performance were to fall just one fifth of one percent to <BR>
99.6 percent an additional 1.6 million social security or other <BR>
payments would be late.<BR>

<P>Some federal programs are already the best in their class. They <BR>
have established goals and standards for program achievements the <BR>
quantity and quality of goods and services the program will <BR>
deliver and can compare their performance with other programs, <BR>
agencies, or organizations delivering similar goods and services.<BR>

<P>Other agencies and programs have farther to go. They need to begin <BR>
by establishing a clear understanding of their mission and goals <BR>
and of the strategies they will be pursuing to achieve those <BR>
goals, drawing on program legislation and policy, historical and <BR>
current data on program activities, and the needs and expectations <BR>
of the program's customers and stakeholders. Once the program's <BR>
objectives, and the kinds of goods and services it delivers, are <BR>
clear, managers can begin comparing the program with other, <BR>
similar programs in its &quot;class&quot; and establish performance <BR>
benchmarks based on what other programs in that class are <BR>
accomplishing. Finally, managers can develop operational plans and <BR>
short-term performance targets for reaching these benchmarks, <BR>
based on realistic appraisals of current activities and practical <BR>
steps for improvement.<BR>

<P>For many federal programs, the only appropriate benchmarks might <BR>
come from another federal agency or from state government. For <BR>
some agencies, such as the Department of State's counselor <BR>
services, the best benchmarks might come from another country. <BR>
Other programs might look to industry for comparisons as, for <BR>
example, the Air Force commander who replaced lengthy written <BR>
guidelines for the quality of visiting airmen's temporary quarters <BR>
with a pithy benchmark: comparable to &quot;a moderately priced hotel, <BR>
like Ramada.&quot;<BR>

<P>Such a process can help managers more rationally identify customer <BR>
needs and serve as a powerful process for fact-based continuous <BR>
improvement by providing a broader, outward-looking perspective <BR>
that enables managers to challenge &quot;business as usual.&quot; There will <BR>
be additional benefits from benchmarking. Identifying similar <BR>
activities in other organizations helps sharpen managers' <BR>
understanding of constraints and opportunities. It also provides a <BR>
framework for discussing and managing expectations with customers <BR>
and stakeholders. &quot;What special legislative or other governmental <BR>
constraints make us different from industry?&quot; &quot;Are our patients <BR>
older or younger than another hospital's?&quot; &quot;Why can't our cars be <BR>
as clean as the cars at Hertz or Dollar?&quot; Seeking external <BR>
standards taps into external expertise and experience that can be <BR>
immediately relevant to one's own activities. And, the standards <BR>
and measures for program achievement are drawn from actual <BR>
practices, rather than theoretical models of causality. In effect, <BR>
one can jump-start performance measurement by beginning not with <BR>
complex models or training on abstract principles of strategic <BR>
planning and indicator development, but with the people who are <BR>
already doing something similar.<BR>

<P>2. Build effective teams to improve performance and strengthen <BR>
organizational accountability. (1)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should assign line managers, not staff offices or <BR>
central agencies, to lead strategic planning and performance <BR>
measurement in the programs for which they are accountable. Line <BR>
managers should establish networks and teams to develop program <BR>
strategies, identify performance indicators and targets, and <BR>
collect and use performance data. These teams should include other <BR>
program managers and staff as well as outside persons to provide a <BR>
broader perspective, ensure that line managers aim high enough and <BR>
consult their customers, encourage work across organizational <BR>
boundaries, provide training, and ensure that indicators are valid <BR>
and data are reliable. Staff offices and central agencies should <BR>
report, verify, and consolidate information, but not manage agency <BR>
efforts.<BR>

<P>In addition to program staff, teams might typically include <BR>
persons from other programs in the agency; from other agencies <BR>
that have similar programs; from planning, evaluation, budget, and <BR>
finance staffs; and from some central agency analytical group such <BR>
as OMB. Information technology specialists could also be included <BR>
to ensure that information is integrated into existing systems and <BR>
that paperwork is minimized. The team should identify <BR>
characteristics of importance to customers and stakeholders in the <BR>
program. The team might invite staff of legislative committees <BR>
with oversight over their programs, or the General Accounting <BR>
Office. To obtain customer input, the agency could, for example, <BR>
include customer representatives on the team, use focus groups <BR>
covering major categories of customers, and have the team role-<BR>
play as customers and public interest groups. This team procedure <BR>
worked well with the State of Minnesota's Department of Trade and <BR>
Economic Development and the State of Maryland's Department of <BR>
Economic and Employment Development. Both departments convened <BR>
working groups and held focus groups of customers to help identify <BR>
performance indicators for selected programs in their <BR>
departments.16<BR>

<P>Line managers are generally in the best position to chose relevant <BR>
and useful performance indicators, and the full participation of <BR>
line managers in selecting performance measures and using <BR>
performance information is critical. Indeed, the single most <BR>
important element for ensuring both the quality of performance <BR>
information and the achievement of improved results is the <BR>
effective use of that information in program decision making. If <BR>
performance information is used by line managers to make <BR>
operational decisions that improve programs' outcomes, those <BR>
managers who are accountable for the management of the programs <BR>
will have a direct interest in ensuring the accuracy and integrity <BR>
of that information. <BR>

<P>Teams can help ensure that, whatever objectives and indicators are <BR>
chosen, performance information is simple, valid, and reliable. <BR>
For example, the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and <BR>
Human Services have created performance indicator teams including <BR>
line managers, financial managers, strategic planners, and budget <BR>
analysts. Teams help ensure that performance information is <BR>
relevant to actual program activities. Negotiations and <BR>
discussions across the organization also provide checks and <BR>
balances that will keep performance information valid and <BR>
honest.17<BR>

<P>3. Develop common goals and data collection efforts for <BR>
crosscutting issues. (2)<BR>

<P>The multi-agency coordination initiated by OMB under the Chief <BR>
Financial Officers (CFO) Act to encourage cooperative development <BR>
of common measures, benchmarking, and data collection in programs <BR>
with a similar commercial function provides some useful experience <BR>
in this area. The selection of common goals should not be <BR>
prescribed by OMB, but should be the joint responsibility of the <BR>
agencies involved. Interagency groups should develop a limited <BR>
number of core goals and measures in related programs and reduce <BR>
the costs and burden of data collection where a common approach is <BR>
appropriate. Agencies could add agency specific measures and data <BR>
collection as needed to reflect the unique aspects of their <BR>
programs. The interagency group working on ecosystem management <BR>
and the President's Community Enterprise Board's community <BR>
empowerment efforts are examples where these interagency measures <BR>
could be considered.18 <BR>

<P>4.  Incorporate performance objectives and results as key elements <BR>
in budget and management reviews. (2)<BR>

<P>Over time, both the Executive Office of the President and <BR>
individual agencies should use performance information as a key <BR>
element in program and policy decision making and as a basis for <BR>
management and budget reviews. The incorporation of performance <BR>
objectives and results as key elements of budget and management <BR>
reviews should be clearly reflected in White House policy <BR>
guidance; in a substantially revised OMB Circular A11 (which <BR>
guides budget formulation); in agency budget guidance and review <BR>
procedures; in strategic and operational plans; and in revised <BR>
position descriptions and training for budget, management, and <BR>
program analysts. This recommendation can be more fully <BR>
implemented as agencies develop strategic plans, performance <BR>
measures, and targets by September 30, 1997, as required by the <BR>
GPRA.<BR>

<P>At first, managers may not have sufficient experience to set <BR>
reasonable performance targets. Even with indicators on which a <BR>
program has been collecting data for many years, the program is <BR>
likely to have quite limited information on the relationship <BR>
between outcomes and the program's staffing and budget. Users of <BR>
information comparing annual goals to actual achievement need to <BR>
understand these inherent difficulties. The numerical goals will <BR>
likely be much less useful than the data on actual outcomes. The <BR>
process by which the program attempts to link resources to <BR>
outcomes may itself, however, help agencies in their annual <BR>
planning. It should also be remembered that performance <BR>
measurement is not meant to replace research or evaluation, but <BR>
rather to signal potential problems for which more information or <BR>
attention is needed.<BR>

<P>Agencies should reallocate sufficient resources for performance <BR>
planning and measurement for the long term. This reallocation of <BR>
human and financial resources to performance planning and <BR>
measurement should occur as part of the normal budget development <BR>
and review process. While some funds may need to be reallocated <BR>
explicitly to performance data collection and analysis, the <BR>
primary issue is ensuring that managers devote sufficient time and <BR>
attention to planning for results and to applying performance <BR>
information in decision making.<BR>

<P>OMB's budget analysts can provide some of the feedback and broad <BR>
oversight that is necessary for an effective system for example, <BR>
by asking agencies to improve on indicators that are clearly <BR>
inadequate. OMB should, for example, actively discourage the use <BR>
of work activity measures masquerading as output or outcome <BR>
measures. Since there can be disagreement, even among &quot;experts,&quot; <BR>
over what is or is not an outcome measure, OMB's Deputy Director <BR>
for Management should probably exercise overall oversight of the <BR>
appropriateness of outcome measures to avoid uneven implementation <BR>
across OMB divisions and performance indicator shopping.<BR>

<P>Other action steps to ensure more results-oriented program and <BR>
budget reviews by agencies and OMB include formal training <BR>
programs for staff, internal consulting arrangements, and joint <BR>
management/budget review teams. Training is needed, for example, <BR>
to counter the frequent misconception that outcome data indicates <BR>
that the government alone produced (caused) those outcomes. This <BR>
leads to employee blame-setting that is usually unwarranted and is <BR>
also a major source of manager resistance to outcome measurement. <BR>
An explicit educational effort will be needed to clarify that in <BR>
most, if not all, cases, outcomes are produced only in part by <BR>
program activities. <BR>

<P>5. Clarify the objectives of federal programs. (3)<BR>

<P>The executive branch should work with Congress to clarify the <BR>
goals and objectives of federal programs and identify those <BR>
programs where lack of clarity about legislative intent is <BR>
affecting execution. Congress should review existing and new <BR>
legislation for clarity of objectives and, where needed, take <BR>
steps to clarify legislative intent so as to encourage and <BR>
facilitate improved executive branch performance in executing <BR>
legislation.<BR>

Empower Managers to Achieve Results<BR>

<P>BGT03:<BR>
******************************************************************<BR>
Empower Managers to Perform <BR>

<P>
<P>************<BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Managers find that funds arrive in many small, separate &quot;checking <BR>
accounts,&quot; each with restricted purposes and other detailed <BR>
limitations. Some of these detailed limitations take away the <BR>
manager's capacity to decide how to do the job, defining the use <BR>
of inputs like personnel, travel, or purchase of computers, for <BR>
example. These detailed restrictions absorb excessive time and <BR>
energy as managers figure out how to comply and yet get results.<BR>

<P>As Dale Robertson, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, has observed, <BR>
&quot;On our best days government will be only mediocre in performance <BR>
unless we can figure out how to focus more of our time and energy <BR>
on the end results that benefit the American people.&quot;<BR>

<P>Some restrictions on spending are necessary to reflect policy <BR>
priorities and decision show much to spend on which food and <BR>
nutrition programs, for example. But restrictions frequently run <BR>
to the other extreme, becoming excessively detailed and intrusive <BR>
for no real policy purpose mousemilking&quot; was the term one budget <BR>
officer used to describe them. <BR>

<P>Two ACTIONS are necessary to empower managers to perform better:<BR>

<P>*     To develop with managers what they are expected to <BR>
accomplish and how it will be measured. This is the theme of Part <BR>
1 of this report.<BR>

<P>*     To provide the necessary resources without excessively <BR>
detailed restrictions. Removing or decreasing these itemized <BR>
limitations is the major theme of this section of the report.<BR>

<P>Excessively detailed limitations are restrictions on spending <BR>
money that are not needed for policy control, take away the <BR>
manager's capacity to perform, and impede the accomplishment of <BR>
results.1 These detailed limitations are imposed on line managers <BR>
by several means.<BR>

<P>*     Enacting statutory requirements in appropriations, such as <BR>
defining periods of availability for funds, earmarking funds for <BR>
certain projects or activities, and breaking accounts down into <BR>
subaccounts (activities). In addition, Congress may include <BR>
detailed instructions and earmarkings in the committee reports <BR>
that accompany appropriation bills.<BR>

<P>*     Inserting footnotes in apportionments, the means by which <BR>
the President makes appropriations available to ensure that funds <BR>
are spent without either overspending the appropriation or <BR>
creating pressures for a supplemental appropriation to complete <BR>
the year.<BR>

<P>*     Including restrictions in allotments, the system of <BR>
documents by which agencies (1) ensure that deficiencies will be <BR>
prevented, usually referred to as administrative control of funds, <BR>
and (2) allocate, distribute, and delegate spending authority down <BR>
the chain of command to program and field managers, often <BR>
accomplished through a financial operating plan.<BR>

<P>Appropriations. There are over 1,000 appropriation accounts in the <BR>
federal budget the number varies slightly from year to year. <BR>
Appropriation account totals are usually divided into activities <BR>
and sometimes subactivities, for which separate funding totals are <BR>
provided (i.e., line items). For example, in the President's <BR>
budget, appropriations for military construction are divided among <BR>
the three activities of major construction, minor construction, <BR>
and planning, each with a discrete funding total.<BR>

<P>Congressional subdivision of appropriation amounts into line items <BR>
is usually more detailed than is shown in the President's budget. <BR>
For example, the President's budget divides the appropriation for <BR>
the Office of the Secretary in the Department of the Interior into <BR>
six activities; the support table for the Interior and Related <BR>
Agencies appropriation for the same office subdivides the <BR>
appropriation among 29 line items.2 Overall, there are many <BR>
thousands of activities, subactivities, and projects subject to <BR>
line item control in appropriations acts; the total number is <BR>
unknown.<BR>

<P>General provisions in each appropriations bill impose additional <BR>
limitations on how funds should or should not be spent. The 1993 <BR>
Defense Appropriations Act has 219 general provisions, compared to <BR>
47 in the 1963 Act.3 Report language adds an extensive array of <BR>
earmarks and instructions. For example, the Department of the <BR>
Interior found that language in the House, Senate, and Conference <BR>
Committee Reports and the 1992 Appropriations Act for Interior and <BR>
Related Agencies contained about 2,150 directives, earmarks, <BR>
instructions, guidance, and prohibitions.4<BR>

<P>Report language is not law, but agencies not following report <BR>
language may be cross-examined closely in future hearings and may <BR>
find the language written into the general provisions of future <BR>
appropriations acts.<BR>

<P>Any member of Congress may request the insertion of earmarking and <BR>
report language. If the appropriations committee agrees, the <BR>
earmarking and report language is inserted in the House, Senate, <BR>
or Conference Committee Reports. The House Appropriations <BR>
Committee received more requests for such report language in 1993 <BR>
than in any prior year. The requests are thought to be in reaction <BR>
to the need to cut back to meet the caps on discretionary spending <BR>
set in the Budget Enforcement Act, which in turn places a premium <BR>
on protecting spending in a member's district or items of <BR>
particular interest to a member. There are also instances where <BR>
federal employees have asked members of Congress to include items <BR>
in report language. In the years when Congress was controlled by <BR>
one political party and the presidency by another, report language <BR>
was a mechanism used by Congress to ensure that its will was <BR>
carried out. The House Appropriations Committee is moving, in the <BR>
fiscal year 1994 appropriation bills, to have fewer requirements <BR>
in report language.5     <BR>

<P>Apportionments. OMB has been delegated the President's authority <BR>
to apportion make available for obligation almost all <BR>
appropriation and fund accounts.6 The statutes specify that &quot;any <BR>
appropriation subject to apportionment shall be distributed by <BR>
months, time periods, or by activities, functions, projects, or <BR>
objects, or by a combination thereof.&quot;7 Apportionments:<BR>

<P>*     Provide a mechanism by which the President can prevent <BR>
agencies from spending money too quickly by limiting the amount <BR>
that can be spent by month or by quarter of the year. For example, <BR>
spending funds meant to last the whole fiscal year in the first <BR>
half of the year would create pressure for supplemental <BR>
appropriations to continue operations. Funds can be apportioned so <BR>
that only one-half of the amount appropriated is available in the <BR>
first half of the year, avoiding a second-half shortfall.<BR>

<P>*     Provide a mechanism to effect management ACTIONS, such as <BR>
(a) achieving savings made possible by changes in requirements or <BR>
greater efficiency of operations, (b) providing for contingencies, <BR>
or (c) those specifically provided by law, such as carrying out <BR>
sequestrations. Proposed savings for reasons (a) and (b) are <BR>
required to be reported to Congress for their action as deferrals <BR>
or rescission proposals.8<BR>

<P>Spending in excess of the amount in an appropriation or fund <BR>
account has been less of a problem in the last decade than in <BR>
earlier periods. Between 1982 and 1993, there have been 51 <BR>
violations of the Anti-deficiency Act (which restricts both <BR>
obligations and expenditures from each appropriation to the amount <BR>
available in the appropriation or fund) reported to the President. <BR>
This time period coincides with the installation of better <BR>
financial management systems in federal agencies at the urging of <BR>
the General Accounting Office, OMB, Treasury, and Congress.9     <BR>

<P>Apportionments can be more extensive than appropriations in <BR>
setting detailed limitations, since for example they can break <BR>
down spending authority by time period during the fiscal year, by <BR>
object class, or by program activity. Also, OMB sometimes includes <BR>
footnotes with instructions concerning spending or requiring <BR>
reports to be submitted.<BR>

<P>Allotments. Allotments subdivide apportionments and incorporate <BR>
appropriation limitations within agency accounting systems.10 Most <BR>
federal agencies develop financial operating plans that include <BR>
appropriation limitations and distribute funds among <BR>
organizational components as the appropriation process draws to a <BR>
close in August and September. Financial operating plans are <BR>
finalized after enactment of appropriations and include the means <BR>
by which allotments are issued to organizational components. <BR>

<P>It is in the carrying out of statutory requirements, apportionment <BR>
footnotes, and allotment restrictions that problems and costs <BR>
occur. Each limitation usually involves a system of controls and <BR>
reports to ensure that the limitations are not exceeded and/or are <BR>
carried out as set in the law or report. The control system <BR>
requires subdividing the total amount of funds from discrete <BR>
appropriation accounts among the managers who will be responsible <BR>
for spending those funds. Control also requires an information <BR>
system that feeds back to the managers and to monitors along the <BR>
chain of command,current status compared to the limitation and <BR>
assurance that the money is properly spent. Depending upon <BR>
organizational structure, this subdivision of funds and controls <BR>
can multiply into ever smaller allocations through the whole <BR>
pyramid of managers and staff. Allotment control systems and <BR>
efforts to manage large numbers of restrictions on small <BR>
allocations of funds are labor and overhead-intensive.<BR>

<P>For example, the Forest Service, a bureau in the U.S. Department <BR>
of Agriculture, has managers who receive allotments and sub-<BR>
allotments from the Forest Service's 29 appropriations activity <BR>
accounts through nine regional offices, 122 forest supervisor <BR>
offices, 633 ranger districts, and 69 research locations.11 One of <BR>
these national forests, the Ochoco National Forest in central <BR>
Oregon, administers funds from 19 of these 29 activities. For <BR>
financial management, these 19 activities translate into 70 <BR>
separate accounts, 556 separate management codes, and 1,769 <BR>
accounting lines for the Ochoco National Forest. The budget is <BR>
split into such small increments that tracking and balancing <BR>
amounts becomes the major consumer of managers' time.12<BR>

<P>Ochoco participated in a Forest Service pilot project to test the <BR>
results of greater managerial flexibility.13 The 70 internal <BR>
accounts were reduced to six and the emphasis was changed to <BR>
&quot;output targets accomplished&quot; rather than maintaining elaborate <BR>
records to control how the individual allocations of money were <BR>
spent. Productivity in terms of &quot;output targets accomplished&quot; <BR>
jumped 25 percent in the first year and an additional 35 percent <BR>
in the second year. Resource managers who had spent 4560 days a <BR>
year in the office &quot;crunching numbers&quot; found they could adequately <BR>
develop budgets in one day.14<BR>

<P>Operating Costs. Operating costs are sometimes defined as the <BR>
costs associated with direct federal operations. The National Park <BR>
Service is a direct federal operation providing services to the <BR>
public, and the operating costs associated with providing these <BR>
services are in an account aptly named &quot;Operation of the National <BR>
Park System.&quot; The Social Security Administration provides payments <BR>
to beneficiaries. The payments themselves are not direct federal <BR>
operations, but the staff and machinery to make those payments are <BR>
direct federal operations. In some federal programs, the direct <BR>
federal operating portion and the grant or service provider <BR>
portion are mixed and not easily identified or separated. The <BR>
intramural and extramural research programs of the Public Health <BR>
Service are an example. Cancer research serves the same goal, <BR>
whether done in-house or by contract or grant.<BR>

<P>For sound management, it is important to identify, monitor, and <BR>
control all direct operating costs. This does not require that <BR>
they be subject to detailed limitations; rather, that the <BR>
financial system provide management with timely, accurate, ongoing <BR>
reports on the cost of operations. Ideally, these costs should <BR>
include full costs, not only of federal personnel but also all <BR>
support of direct operations, so that financial analyses and <BR>
comparisons are even and tell the full story. Presently, federal <BR>
operations do not include the full costs of federal employee <BR>
benefits, excluding some expenses for retirees. The National <BR>
Performance Review Accompanying Report Improving Financial <BR>
Management includes a recommendation (FM13) to charge agencies for <BR>
the full cost of employee benefits. The Federal Accounting <BR>
Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) has a project under way to <BR>
account for costs, which is intended to address this problem.<BR>

<P>Revolving Funds. The Department of Defense (DOD) has used the <BR>
revolving fund concept in many of its support operations for more <BR>
than 40 years. Most of its shipyards and aircraft repair depots <BR>
have operated under this financing arrangement since 1975. <BR>
Revolving fund activities operate with no, or very little, direct <BR>
appropriated funds. They are instead financed on a reimbursable <BR>
basis from appropriated funds. These funds are appropriated to <BR>
customers of those activities a Navy sea command or an Air Force <BR>
tactical fighter squadron who in turn purchase goods and services <BR>
from the revolving fund activity much like any private business. <BR>
These support activities financed by revolving funds operate more <BR>
efficiently and effectively without the constraints of fiscal year <BR>
limitations and excessively detailed administrative restrictions. <BR>

<P>Separating support activities from their customers and giving the <BR>
customer the funding create a check and balance situation that <BR>
ensures the revolving fund activity engages only in efforts for <BR>
which there is customer demand. Better yet, there is competition <BR>
for customers based on price and quality of service, and customers <BR>
have a choice of suppliers.<BR>

<P>DOD has developed a method of budgeting called Unit Cost <BR>
Resourcing, used primarily for organizations that operate within a <BR>
revolving fund. Unit Cost Resourcing accounts for expenditures in <BR>
terms of their impact upon work outputs/buying uniforms or payroll <BR>
account processing. Budget authority is given to an activity in <BR>
terms of cost per output. That is, if the output's estimated cost <BR>
is $100, then the activity &quot;earns&quot; $100 per output. There are no <BR>
frontend limitations imposed on the activity, such as spending <BR>
only so much for personnel, training, travel, etc. Budget <BR>
formulation and execution are based on cost per output and <BR>
mission-oriented measures, such as the percentage of tactical <BR>
aircraft that are mission-capable. Managers make the same <BR>
essential tradeoff decisions among various outputs and their costs <BR>
that are taken for granted by private industry managers.15<BR>

<P>In some federal activities, this type of budgeting would be <BR>
difficult, but many federal organizations can learn from DOD's and <BR>
other agencies' experience to manage their resources to achieve <BR>
results more efficiently. While some agencies work to overcome <BR>
difficulties in performance budgeting for their operations, others <BR>
will make progress based on their experience with working capital <BR>
funds and cooperative administrative service units (CASU's).<BR>

<P>Matching Mission with Appropriations.  Historically there has been <BR>
no mechanism by which the decisions reached in proposing missions <BR>
and functions in the president's budget are updated and adjusted <BR>
after final appropriations action. If agencies jointly put <BR>
considerable effort into mission and functional planning and <BR>
budget formulation, agencies should then follow up, after <BR>
appropriations became available, to make necessary updates and <BR>
adjustments to manage resources made available in the budget for <BR>
results.<BR>

<P>The apportionment and allotment systems required under the Anti-<BR>
deficiency Act focus on administrative control of funds. While <BR>
such compliance is important, there are other critical issues that <BR>
must be considered in budget execution in order to manage for <BR>
results. The missions of the federal government will be more <BR>
effectively accomplished if some executive branch staff and <BR>
attention are shifted from budget development to policy <BR>
implementation, budget execution, and review of results being <BR>
achieved.<BR>

<P>
<P>*****************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
*****************<BR>

<P>As long as the emphasis is on compliance with detailed <BR>
restrictions on inputs rather than outputs and accomplishment, <BR>
many managers will see the goal of federal programs as spending <BR>
money or preserving options to do so. Incentives for savings are <BR>
absent. As one manager put it, &quot;If you as a manager showed at the <BR>
end of the year that you spent less money than you had been <BR>
allocated at the beginning of the year, the difference is taken <BR>
away from you for the upcoming year on the assumption you don't <BR>
need it. However, no manager likes to be faced with a shrinking <BR>
budget, i.e., fewer resources, since 1) your budget tends to be <BR>
symbolic of your program's importance and your own sphere of <BR>
influence and 2) because you never know what new responsibilities <BR>
may come your way during the next fiscal year that you need <BR>
resources for. Since new responsibilities often come unfunded and <BR>
pools of resources are generally not available (OMB and Congress <BR>
are the first ones to strike any such pool of unallocated <BR>
reserves) it is currently not in any manager's interest to &quot;admit <BR>
to&quot; savings. It is much more rewarding to spend all your money and <BR>
then claim a need for more next year than to show genuine <BR>
savings.&quot;16<BR>

<P>There should be incentives to save money, to attend less to new <BR>
budget requests and detailed control of inputs and more to <BR>
performance and results. Excessively detailed limitations and <BR>
failure to focus on outputs cost money adding several percent or <BR>
more in direct federal operations than would otherwise be <BR>
necessary. Such constraints force managers to spend large amounts <BR>
of time in the financial administration of their work, distort <BR>
work program priorities, encourage spending, and bloat overhead <BR>
and support costs through labor-intensive activities to maintain <BR>
and monitor all of the controls. Many of these limitations direct <BR>
spending to matters of political concern; efficient or effective <BR>
management is not a consideration.<BR>

<P>Operations that have consolidated resources into a small number of <BR>
accounts without excessively detailed front-end limitations and <BR>
have simplified other internal rules have reduced operating costs <BR>
by 10 percent or more while improving the quality of their <BR>
services.17 To achieve both savings and productivity improvements, <BR>
there is a need to eliminate expensive but unnecessary itemized <BR>
restrictions while reducing the mind-numbing volume of internal <BR>
regulation, as recommended in the National Performance Review <BR>
Accompanying Report Streamlining Management Control.<BR>

<P>There must be an explicit agreement here: more flexibility, fewer <BR>
restrictions, more accountability for managers, but also smaller <BR>
budgets. Some of the savings will go for training, tools to <BR>
enhance productivity, and positive incentives, like bonuses, but <BR>
some must also go to reduce the overall cost of government.<BR>

<P>The executive branch uses too much time developing and justifying <BR>
budget proposals for which there is little hope of approval and <BR>
then takes too little time to examine how to use appropriations <BR>
enacted to meet mission needs and priorities more effectively. <BR>
Strategic planning is sketchy. Managers haven't been told what <BR>
results to achieve and then held accountable for results. Tools <BR>
like revolving funds, full cost accounting, and competition among <BR>
suppliers are underutilized in efforts to supply quality services <BR>
to customers at lower costs.<BR>

<P>Accountability for resources and results without detailed <BR>
limitations can be maintained through sound financial management <BR>
systems and through reporting systems on accomplishments. Given <BR>
timely, accurate information, management can intervene in <BR>
operations and take action to achieve performance objectives <BR>
during the operating year, based on spending patterns and results <BR>
they see emerging through their information systems and other <BR>
feedback mechanisms.     <BR>

<P>
<P>***************<BR>
ACTIONS<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>1. Revise operational plans and performance goals to reflect <BR>
actual appropriations by mission and function. (2)<BR>

<P>The President should direct agency heads to review appropriations <BR>
to determine if changes are needed in policy priorities and <BR>
performance goals. Agency heads should consult with the White <BR>
House Policy Councils and the Office of Management and Budget <BR>
about suitable modifications to operating plans. This update <BR>
should begin with the fiscal year 1995 appropriations and spread <BR>
in subsequent years as performance measurement is implemented more <BR>
broadly throughout government.<BR>

<P>After appropriations are enacted, agencies develop their financial <BR>
operating plans and internal allocations. It is also at this point <BR>
that senior managers need to revisit presidential policies and <BR>
priorities presented in proposals to Congress and to adjust for <BR>
final appropriations action.<BR>

<P>Agency heads need to review appropriations as soon as <BR>
congressional directions are known and discuss with the White <BR>
House Policy Councils and the Office of Management and Budget how <BR>
to match policy priorities and performance goals with the revised <BR>
availability of funds. Performance plans and targets throughout <BR>
the agency should be updated and refined based upon the enacted <BR>
availability of resources. <BR>

<P>2. Restructure appropriations accounts to reduce over-itemization <BR>
and to align them with programs. (3)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should begin now to identify appropriation accounts <BR>
and overly itemized limitations that seriously impede cost-<BR>
effective management and to develop and propose better structures. <BR>
Restructuring should begin as quickly as possible, although early <BR>
discussions with OMB and with appropriations subcommittees are <BR>
recommended. A long-term and more extensive restructuring should <BR>
be proposed to Congress in the fiscal year 1996 budget. <BR>
Congressional consideration and action is necessary, since the <BR>
support tables to the appropriations bills establishing line items <BR>
are usually more detailed than the information submitted in the <BR>
Budget Appendix.<BR>

<P>The goals of this restructuring are to consolidate appropriations <BR>
accounts and activities more closely along the lines of programs <BR>
providing services to the public or internally and to minimize the <BR>
number of detailed limitations that impede efficient management. <BR>
These program accounts would receive appropriations for the full <BR>
cost of the program, including the usual administrative expenses <BR>
as well as the accruing cost of retiree benefits.18 The <BR>
appropriation would also cover the purchase of support services <BR>
(e.g., supplies, equipment, payroll services) from support <BR>
accounts in or outside the agency or from the private sector. This <BR>
restructuring should be undertaken in conjunction with the <BR>
implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act <BR>
(GPRA) of 1993.<BR>

<P>3. Ensure that direct operating costs can be identified. (1)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should issue internal guidance to ensure that <BR>
operating costs can be readily identified and to implement any <BR>
changes necessary in financial management systems in the execution <BR>
of the fiscal year 1995 budget.<BR>

<P>It is important that total operating costs be readily identifiable <BR>
under any restructuring, so that the direct operating costs of <BR>
programs can be measured, compared to results, and controlled by <BR>
policy decisions, incentives, and good management rather than by <BR>
detailed spending limitations. They can also be weighed against <BR>
total program costs, including amounts for grants to <BR>
beneficiaries, to ensure that program operating costs are not <BR>
excessive. The capacity to identify, track, and control operating <BR>
costs is necessary to trade across-the-board full-time equivalent <BR>
(FTE) limitations for a managerially more sound control through <BR>
funding allocations. <BR>

<P>Operating costs need not be set in separate appropriation accounts <BR>
with detailed restrictions and breakdowns. Estimates for operating <BR>
costs can be shown in the budget, and financial management systems <BR>
can track actual expenditures during the operating year. <BR>
Deviations from plan, inevitable with the passage of time and <BR>
dynamic management, should be documented and justified. There is <BR>
ample precedent for this treatment.<BR>

<P>The effort to identify and track operating costs should be <BR>
initiated for the fiscal year 1996 budget formulation cycle.<BR>

<P>4. Propose revolving funds for those agencies that do not have <BR>
them. (3)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should assess their needs for revolving or working <BR>
capital funds and propose legislation for them where appropriate <BR>
in the fiscal year 1996 budget cycle.<BR>

<P>Support accounts should be organized in the form of revolving fund <BR>
accounts, replacing separate line items for administrative <BR>
activities and services.19 Support accounts would cover most <BR>
commercially available items, such as office space, supplies, <BR>
automobiles, personnel and payroll services, building maintenance, <BR>
and legal, accounting, and auditing services. This effort should <BR>
be completed in the fiscal year 1996 cycle. <BR>

<P>DOD is a good model of the desired approach. The DOD revolving <BR>
fund approach incorporates many of DOD's support activities as <BR>
business areas that provide goods and services to mission-related <BR>
activities or customers. The appropriation-funded, mission-related <BR>
activities purchase goods and services from organizations or <BR>
business areas that operate within the fund. The Unit Cost <BR>
Resources methodology allows DOD to budget by mission (showing <BR>
full costs of the mission) and to control unit costs at the same <BR>
time. Incentives in the form of bonuses to employees are provided <BR>
to those organizational elements that show savings below their <BR>
unit cost targets. Other agencies, such as the General Services <BR>
Administration and the Department of Justice, also have <BR>
reimbursable revolving funds through which support services are <BR>
purchased.<BR>

<P>Revolving funds do require good financial management systems to <BR>
succeed. Review of periodic financial management statements is <BR>
also required. Concerns have been expressed that working capital <BR>
and revolving funds will build up &quot;profits&quot; that amount to &quot;slush <BR>
funds&quot; and that any such funds could potentially be used to avoid <BR>
the detailed limitations on other funds. Appropriate policy and <BR>
management oversight is therefore necessary.<BR>

<P>5. Reduce overly detailed restrictions and earmarks in <BR>
appropriation and report language. (3)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should identify the overly detailed restrictions and <BR>
earmarks in the fiscal year 1995 appropriations and reports that <BR>
seriously impede the missions or the most efficient management of <BR>
their agencies. They should be prepared to discuss how to <BR>
eliminate or reduce the need for them with the chairpersons of <BR>
their appropriations subcommittees.<BR>

<P>Restrictions and earmarks in appropriation and report language add <BR>
expensive limitations to management ACTIONS and take time and <BR>
attention to track. A number of agencies have been working with <BR>
their appropriations subcommittee staffs to document concerns with <BR>
and reduce general language provisions and earmarks and directives <BR>
in report language that are expensive to administer for the <BR>
advantage gained. Some may be there as a matter of history rather <BR>
than current need. This effort should be continued and accelerated <BR>
in the fiscal year 1995 and 1996 budgets. <BR>

<P>6. Simplify the apportionment process. (2)<BR>

<P>The OMB Director should immediately issue internal guidance to <BR>
staff to use simple letter apportionments and process <BR>
apportionments within the time frames called for in the law (i.e., <BR>
within 30 calendar days after approval of the appropriations act <BR>
or by September 10, whichever is later).20 Policy decisions should <BR>
be relayed by OMB policy officials to agency policy officials by <BR>
means other than apportionments. OMB is already encouraging <BR>
automation of apportionment submissions and working with the <BR>
Department of the Treasury on an automated monthly reporting <BR>
system. These efforts should be completed by fiscal year 1995 to <BR>
assist in timely review.<BR>

<P>Any exceptions to the letter apportionment process should be <BR>
explained to the affected agency. Examples of reasons for <BR>
exceptions are:<BR>

<P>*     to force discipline on an agency that is violating the Anti-<BR>
deficiency Act;<BR>

<P>*     to sequester funds under the Budget Enforcement Act;<BR>

<P>*     where the time phasing of obligations during the fiscal year <BR>
is of critical interest to government-wide management; or<BR>

<P>*     when rescissions or deferrals are proposed that require <BR>
formal apportionment action.<BR>

<P>This change in the apportionment process would be implemented by <BR>
OMB internal instructions to its staff. Changes to the <BR>
apportionment process should be developed in consultation with <BR>
Department of the Treasury and agency staff as in the past. Any <BR>
revisions to OMB Circular A34, &quot;Instructions on Budget Execution,&quot; <BR>
necessary to accommodate the changes should also be made.<BR>

<P>Related to this recommendation, OMB, the Department of the <BR>
Treasury, and federal agencies should proceed as soon as possible <BR>
with an integrated budgeting and financial management information <BR>
system to promote better and more effective use of financial <BR>
management information in budget formulation and more effective <BR>
oversight of budget execution.21<BR>

<P>7. Reduce the excessive administrative subdivision of funds in <BR>
financial operating plans. (1)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should internally review their procedures for <BR>
developing financial operating plans at the beginning of the <BR>
operating year to reduce the excessive subdivision of allotments <BR>
subject to Anti-deficiency Act controls and penalties. This review <BR>
should be completed in fiscal year 1995.<BR>

<P>The standard for developing and implementing financial operating <BR>
plans is that allotments and allocations are made to responsible <BR>
managers within 30 days of enactment of an appropriation or <BR>
continuing resolution. Any agencies not able to meet this standard <BR>
should be held accountable for corrective action first by their <BR>
internal managers at all levels and, failing there, by OMB, <BR>
Treasury, and GAO.<BR>

<P>Experience by agencies that have looked into simplifying detailed <BR>
limitations is that the majority of the problem limitations are <BR>
self-inflicted by the agency and can be corrected internally. The <BR>
concern frequently expressed is that some managers deliberately <BR>
overspend their budgets, leaving to the official accountable under <BR>
Anti-deficiency Act penalties the problem of balancing accounts.<BR>

<P>Good financial management and other support information systems <BR>
(e.g., personnel/payroll, procurement) can amply provide <BR>
accountability for the use of inputs. Those systems should be <BR>
upgraded to provide real-time, on-line information feedback to all <BR>
managers and on-line, read-only summary reports to higher levels <BR>
of management and external monitors, such as Inspectors General, <BR>
without separate systems for reports. Two effective incentives for <BR>
better accountability in open systems are peer pressure, where <BR>
managers serve as a check and balance on one another, and <BR>
visibility, where there is less ability to hide questionable <BR>
transactions to delay their discovery until an audit years later.<BR>

Eliminate Employment Ceilings and Floors by Managing Within Budget<BR>
BGT04:<BR>
******************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>****************<BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
****************<BR>

<P>Employment ceilings were instituted in 1964 by the Bureau of the <BR>
Budget in Circular A64 to ensure the most effective use of <BR>
government resources.1 At that time, agency heads were charged <BR>
with monitoring the employment ceilings and pursuing a position <BR>
management program that provided a proper balance among mission <BR>
needs, efficiency of operations, and effective employee <BR>
utilization. This meant &quot;achieving lower employment levels and <BR>
increasing productivity through tighter management, redeployment <BR>
of personnel, simplification of procedures, and stripping work to <BR>
essentials.&quot;2 <BR>

<P>Since the early 1980's, nondefense agencies have been required to <BR>
use the full-time equivalent (FTE) as a limitation on the size of <BR>
their workforce. One FTE is equal to one compensable work year or <BR>
2,080 hours. Before that time, a control of head counts on the <BR>
last day of the year was used. Under this system, some agencies <BR>
would spend the entire last month of the year processing personnel <BR>
ACTIONS to ensure they met but did not exceed the Office of <BR>
Management and Budget (OMB) employment ceiling. Agencies were <BR>
concerned that failure to be fully staffed at the end of the year <BR>
would signal that assigned staff levels were too high. However, <BR>
what often resulted was a freeze or slowdown of productivity until <BR>
later in the year, at which time managers started this cycle <BR>
again. The objective of the FTE ceiling approach was to provide <BR>
agencies with greater flexibility in managing the &quot;mix&quot; of their <BR>
workforcefulltime and part-time, permanent and temporary <BR>
throughout the year.<BR>

<P>While the use of employment ceilings has, for the most part, been <BR>
successful in keeping the number of federal civilian personnel <BR>
within desired limits, it has been neither the most efficient nor <BR>
effective means of achieving overall management improvement and <BR>
economies. <BR>

<P>Current Process. OMB Circular A11 (which replaced Circular A64) <BR>
requires agencies to prepare estimates relating to personnel <BR>
requirements in terms of FTE. Subsequent employment ceilings <BR>
reflect budget proposals and assumptions with regard to workload, <BR>
efficiency, proposed legislation, interagency reimbursable <BR>
arrangements, and other special financing methods. Maximum <BR>
allowable personnel resources are determined at the time of the <BR>
annual budget review for the fiscal year then in progress, and for <BR>
the succeeding two fiscal years. Agencies are advised of their <BR>
ceilings formally in allowance letters that are sent shortly after <BR>
transmittal of the annual budget to Congress.3 FTEs are allocated <BR>
as follows: <BR>

<P>*     OMB allocates the FTE ceilings among departments and <BR>
agencies as required by Presidential Executive Order, then <BR>
notifies departments and agencies of their ceilings.<BR>

<P>*     Department/agency budget staff receive ceiling numbers and <BR>
determine the breakdown by departmental components.<BR>

<P>*     Further breakdowns are determined by departments and <BR>
agencies through the organizational levels to offices, bureaus, <BR>
divisions, branches, units, etc.<BR>

<P>*     These smaller entities then comply according to their <BR>
individual FTE ceiling, budgeting separately general grade levels <BR>
and overall dollars.<BR>

<P>
<P>****************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
****************<BR>

<P>We spend an awful lot of time arguing with the personnel bureau <BR>
about the levels of FTE usage, and yet there is no consideration <BR>
of the dollars. And a perfect example of that is, at least 18 <BR>
months ago, we justified saving perhaps $100,000  $200,000 by <BR>
hiring government workers to do work that was being done by <BR>
contractors. My first experience with this was at the Foreign <BR>
Service Institute, when I was responsible for managing million <BR>
dollar contracts, and I found that the cost of a junior <BR>
programmer, his hourly rate, was equivalent to the head of the <BR>
institute. Now, that did not make sense, and doesn't make sense <BR>
today.4<BR>

<P>Federal managers have frequently mentioned employment ceilings as <BR>
their most oppressive limitation. Some of the problems are as <BR>
follows:<BR>

<P>*     Ceilings or floors requiring fewer or more employees than <BR>
needed to accomplish a mission can create mismatches with agreed <BR>
upon allocations of dollars. Managers have dollars for positions, <BR>
but can't hire because of the FTE ceiling, or they have to fill <BR>
unneeded positions because of the floor.<BR>

<P>*     Ceilings are frequently arbitrary and reduced across-the-<BR>
board, without adequate assessment as to how reductions fit with <BR>
operations and priorities.<BR>

<P>*     Ceilings are frequently not synchronized with the imposition <BR>
of rules, regulations, and demands that cause more work. Ceilings <BR>
are not adjusted for changes made in the appropriations process. <BR>
Managers are left with mandates and limited means of fulfilling <BR>
them.<BR>

<P>*     Ceilings force work to be contracted out that could be done <BR>
less expensively in-house or that is more appropriately <BR>
accomplished by government employees rather than the private <BR>
sector.<BR>

<P>*     Ceilings limit the effectiveness of customer-driven <BR>
operations financed by revolving and working capital funds, <BR>
particularly where competition is involved.<BR>

<P>*     Employment ceilings inhibit managers' ability to balance <BR>
dollars optimally among costs salaries and benefits, space, <BR>
equipment, supplies, travel, and training. <BR>

<P>*     All employees count equally under FTE ceilings regardless of <BR>
grade; thus, managers often hire employees at a higher grade than <BR>
necessary since they do not have the flexibility to hire the two <BR>
or more lower-graded employees they would prefer.<BR>

<P>Central agency employment requirements, as well as special <BR>
congressional employment earmarks or constraints such as FTE <BR>
floors, significantly influence the general management of all <BR>
government agencies: they create confusion, increase workloads, <BR>
and detract from the commonsense principles of good management. <BR>

<P>For instance, at the National Institutes of Health, FTE ceilings <BR>
have been an obstacle to carrying out the biomedical research <BR>
mission of the agency and actually have a deleterious effect on <BR>
the institutional research base there. Often, scientific <BR>
investigation requires personnel who are skilled in modern <BR>
research techniques and familiar with modern biotechnology. This <BR>
science also requires a stable research environment in that a <BR>
relatively long period of time is required to conclude complex <BR>
investigations. Because of the FTE ceilings, investigators <BR>
frequently must engage training fellows, who do not count against <BR>
FTE ceilings, to support this research, instead of more <BR>
experienced postdoctoral investigators, who must be appointed <BR>
against the FTE ceilings. The same salaries and expenses accounts <BR>
finance both. This artificial FTE barrier hinders scientific <BR>
investigation because it slows down the pace of research, creates <BR>
an unstable environment (trainees have a much higher turnover <BR>
rate), and enhances the institutional research base of outside <BR>
institutions rather than the government's.5<BR>

<P>In some cases there is an essential step to be accomplished before <BR>
FTE ceilings are removed. Currently, some agencies' budgeting and <BR>
financial management systems do not break out operational costs as <BR>
separate expenditure categories; therefore, some program <BR>
operations cannot be budgeted and managed within the agency on <BR>
that basis. In those cases, an alternative means of controlling <BR>
workforce levels is necessary. <BR>

<P>
<P>****************<BR>
ACTIONS<BR>
****************<BR>

<P>1. Budget and manage on the basis of operating costs rather than <BR>
full-time equivalents or employment ceilings. (2)<BR>

<P>The President should direct OMB and agency heads to manage within <BR>
operating costs rather than using FTE or employment ceilings. <BR>
Employment ceilings should be phased out as soon as there is <BR>
assurance that the employment reduction targets will be met.<BR>

<P>It is envisioned that eventually employment ceilings will be <BR>
lifted for most agencies and organizational subcomponents within <BR>
agencies, and certainly for fully reimbursable organizations <BR>
(i.e., organizations that do not receive appropriations for <BR>
operating costs, but are reimbursed by other organizations for <BR>
services provided to those organizations). Organizations that <BR>
cannot separately identify, track, and report operating costs <BR>
should propose to OMB (in the case of agency heads) or to agency <BR>
heads (in the case of subcomponents)alternatives for managing the <BR>
size of their workforce prior to removal of employment ceilings.<BR>

<P>This recommendation fully supports President Clinton's commitment <BR>
to maintain a reduced federal workforce. Instead of controlling <BR>
the size of the federal workforce by employment ceilings which <BR>
clearly cause inefficient distortions in managers' personnel and <BR>
resource allocation decisions the size of the workforce will be <BR>
controlled by the dollars available in federal operating funds. <BR>

<P>2. Request Congress to remove FTE floors.(3)<BR>

<P>The fiscal year 1996 budget requests prepared for Congress should <BR>
include provisions for the removal of FTE floors from <BR>
appropriation bill and report language. Examples of agencies that <BR>
have had FTE floors in the past include the Food and Drug <BR>
Administration, the Farmers Home Administration, a Coast Guard <BR>
yard, and certain fossil energy research and development <BR>
facilities in the Department of Energy. Most of these floors have <BR>
been established by the Congress in reaction to FTE ceilings <BR>
imposed by the executive branch. Managing within appropriated <BR>
funds without FTE ceilings leaves little reason for FTE floors, <BR>
which also impede management decisions on the most efficient use <BR>
of funds to achieve results.<BR>

<P>*****************************************************************<BR>
Provide Line Managers with Greater Flexibility to Achieve Results<BR>
BGT05:<BR>
*****************************************************************<BR>

<P>***************<BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>There are several mechanisms permitting managerial flexibility <BR>
within resource limitations or adjusting those limitations, that <BR>
is, moving funds from one restricted account to another. Some of <BR>
these involve Congress, such as requests for reprogrammings and <BR>
appropriation transfers; others can be implemented within the <BR>
executive branch, either through requesting reapportionments (if <BR>
required) or reallotments. Flexibility frequently involves <BR>
charting a course among different mechanisms for adjusting <BR>
restrictions. The following example illustrates the interplay of <BR>
restrictions and mechanisms for adjustment.<BR>

<P>Appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) fall in the <BR>
general categories of military personnel, operations and <BR>
maintenance, procurement, research, development, test and <BR>
evaluation, military construction, family housing, and management <BR>
funds. The appropriation specifies how much should be spent on <BR>
each category by military service. The appropriation does not <BR>
specify how much should be spent for each category at each <BR>
military installation. Each service breaks down each appropriation <BR>
into sub-allotments for each installation. Each installation <BR>
commander then has a number of small, restricted sub-allotments <BR>
for specific purposes based on a budget prepared two or three <BR>
years earlier that does not reflect current conditions and <BR>
requirements. Due to the complications related to reprogramming or <BR>
some other formal transfer mechanism, there is an incentive to <BR>
spend the funds in each suballotment even though such spending may <BR>
not reflect current needs and priorities.<BR>

<P>It is worth noting that the DOD appropriations structure has <BR>
little to do with military missions, such as strategic deterrence <BR>
or antisubmarine warfare. In effect, by using categories that <BR>
relate neither to missions nor installations, Congress has <BR>
provided DOD and the military services with incentives to use <BR>
initiative to apply their appropriations to meet their needs.1<BR>

<P>DOD developed a methodology in 1986 to make wise and flexible use <BR>
of appropriation and activity accounts and applied it at a set of <BR>
pilot installations. This methodology, the Unified Budget Plan, <BR>
gave installation commanders flexibility to transfer funds among <BR>
allotments and cost categories. Although about 90 to 93 percent of <BR>
their funds were spent exactly as budgeted and allocated, the <BR>
installation commanders were able to move the remaining 7 to 10 <BR>
percent out of their original accounts and thereby meet the <BR>
highest priorities of the installation. At Fort Leonard Wood, for <BR>
example, money not needed for medical testing was used to <BR>
refurbish substandard housing. The pilot test showed that more <BR>
needs were met, funds were used more efficiently, and readiness <BR>
was enhanced.2<BR>

<P>Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the Unified Budget Plan, <BR>
DOD did not adopt the concept or continue the test. The primary <BR>
reason given for abandoning the plan was that greater central <BR>
budgetary control was needed to handle major unbudgeted activities <BR>
such as medical cost overruns, Desert Storm, and emergency <BR>
disaster assistance. <BR>

<P>Nevertheless, the example illustrates a restriction and a means to <BR>
work with it. In addition, there are other major mechanisms to <BR>
create managerial flexibility.<BR>

<P>Appropriation Transfer Authority. A source of flexibility for <BR>
agency management is appropriation transfer authority. Various <BR>
statutes grant agencies some limited authority to transfer between <BR>
appropriations accounts when emergencies arise during the <BR>
operating year. For example, the Department of the Interior can <BR>
transfer appropriations with the approval of the secretary for the <BR>
emergency reconstruction, replacement, or repair of aircraft, <BR>
buildings, utilities, or other facilities or equipment damaged or <BR>
destroyed by fire, flood, storm, or other unavoidable causes. The <BR>
secretary can also transfer funds from any no-year appropriation <BR>
to an annual appropriation for the suppression or prevention of <BR>
forest and range fires.3<BR>

<P>Reprogramming. Departments and agencies propose adjustments to <BR>
current year financial operating plans that require congressional <BR>
notification or concurrence through the reprogramming process. <BR>
Reprogramming is the reallocation of funds from one budget <BR>
activity or line item to another within the same appropriation <BR>
account. For construction or land acquisition accounts, <BR>
reprogramming usually entails the reallocation of funds from one <BR>
project to another. Most reprogramming guidelines are not <BR>
statutory; they are procedures mutually agreed upon between <BR>
appropriations subcommittees and agencies. The reprogramming <BR>
guidelines ensure that the content of appropriations acts and <BR>
accompanying reports are implemented rigorously and also encourage <BR>
all changes to be included in annual budget justifications. <BR>

<P>As noted by a National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) <BR>
study in 1985, reprogramming guidelines vary considerably for each <BR>
federal agency depending on its appropriations subcommittee.4 <BR>
Contributing to strengthening reprogramming limitations has been <BR>
the budgetary pressure to cut appropriations, which has put a <BR>
premium on preserving particular programs, projects, and <BR>
activities from executive branch as well as congressional action. <BR>
The National Performance Review surveyed several federal agencies <BR>
to determine their current reprogramming guidelines. It found they <BR>
still vary considerably but are more widespread and tighter than <BR>
at the time of the NAPA survey. <BR>

<P>Detailed, minimal reprogramming thresholds pose numerous problems <BR>
for agency and program management. For example, the smaller of the <BR>
giving or receiving line items determines the threshold. The more <BR>
detailed the agency's appropriation and line item structure, the <BR>
more likely that reprogrammings, sometimes involving relatively <BR>
small amounts of money, will be required. This means in some <BR>
instances that program changes of as little as $25,000 in <BR>
Interior's $6 billion of appropriated funds can trigger a <BR>
reprogramming action.<BR>

<P>Some agencies have worked with their congressional appropriations <BR>
subcommittees to achieve greater flexibility in their ability to <BR>
reprogram funds. For example, the former Deputy Executive Director <BR>
of the Consumer Products Safety Commission found that he had a <BR>
large number of accounts, one for each hazard, with little money <BR>
attached to each, so that reprogrammings were a constant headache. <BR>
After negotiations, the appropriations subcommittees agreed to <BR>
reduce the hazard accounts from 10 to three and thereby solved the <BR>
reprogramming problem.<BR>

<P>Reapportionments and Allotment Revisions. Reapportionments of <BR>
appropriation accounts can be necessary when limitations in <BR>
previous apportionments need to be revised. Action in response to <BR>
agency reapportionment requests is taken by the Office of <BR>
Management and Budget (OMB). <BR>

<P>Allotments, on the other hand, are controlled by agencies, but may <BR>
be the cause of most of the inflexibilities perceived by field <BR>
managers. Allotments and sub-allotments distribute apportioned <BR>
funds to program and field offices and are more detailed than <BR>
apportionments. Most field installations receive funds from a <BR>
number of different apportionments through the allotment process. <BR>
Procedures for amending allotments and sub-allotments are <BR>
determined by each agency. The Department of Defense, the Forest <BR>
Service, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have all found <BR>
through their studies that 70 to 95 percent of the ACTIONS needed <BR>
to empower managers were within existing agency authorities and <BR>
available resources. In these agencies senior managers sometimes <BR>
did not realize they had the authority to take action. Sometimes, <BR>
financial management systems did not provide timely, <BR>
understandable information to managers to aid decision making <BR>
about reallocations. <BR>

<P>Year end Spending. Many managers and much of the public <BR>
correspondence to the Vice President and to the National <BR>
Performance Review commented on the rush to spend money, <BR>
particularly at year end.5 Some feel caught between the Anti-<BR>
deficiency Act, which cautions managers against the risk of <BR>
overspending an appropriation, and the Impoundment Control Act, <BR>
which cautions managers against not spending what the <BR>
appropriations act intended be spent. <BR>

<P>Pressure to spend all funds appropriated comes from many sources: <BR>
interest groups, members of Congress, headquarters personnel, and <BR>
managers themselves, whose performance is partially judged by <BR>
success in fully obligating all funds. The pressure to spend is <BR>
particularly acute when the funds come from an annual <BR>
appropriation, for those funds are either obligated within the <BR>
fiscal year or returned to the Treasury. Subsequent year <BR>
allocations may be reduced because of such returns, since failure <BR>
to spend funds weakens justifications for the same level of <BR>
funding the following year. The perception that funds are spent to <BR>
avoid returning them to Treasury elicits frequent complaints about <BR>
wasteful end-of-year spending.<BR>

<P>A review by OMB indicates that yearend spending is not the problem <BR>
it once was, due to statutory ACTIONS, OMB efforts, and better <BR>
agency management practices.6<BR>

<P>Some spending late in the year is intentional. Some managers do <BR>
maintain a small contingency amount until late in the fiscal year <BR>
to be able to cover unanticipated problems without running a <BR>
deficiency. In other cases, they save during the year to be able <BR>
to upgrade office equipment at yearend to improve future <BR>
productivity. Federal contracting procedures are so complicated <BR>
that managers have difficulty accurately estimating when contracts <BR>
will be awarded and do contingency planning. There have been <BR>
efforts to overcome yearend spending problems:<BR>

<P>*     Congress has helped the Forest Service solve some of its <BR>
yearend spending dilemmas by providing an appropriation available <BR>
for two years. Because Forest Service activities such as <BR>
construction, maintenance, and fire suppression continue after the <BR>
end of the fiscal year on September 30th, the two-year <BR>
appropriation availability smooths the transition and avoids an <BR>
artificial accounting problem.<BR>

<P>*     The Department of Justice has been given authority by <BR>
Congress to roll unobligated balances from its annual salaries and <BR>
expenses accounts to its no-year revolving fund account and to use <BR>
some of those balances for program or management improvements. <BR>
These funds may be used, for example, to buy law enforcement <BR>
vehicles or pay for automated litigation support.7<BR>

<P>*     The Department of Defense has used the revolving fund <BR>
concept in many of its support operations for more than 40 years. <BR>
Revolving fund activities operate with no, or very little, direct <BR>
appropriated funding. They are instead funded on a fully <BR>
reimbursable basis. Appropriated funds are provided to the <BR>
customers of these activities who in turn purchase goods and <BR>
services from the activity financed by the revolving fund much <BR>
like any private business. These support activities operate more <BR>
efficiently and effectively without the constraints of fiscal year <BR>
limitations. By separating support activities from their customers <BR>
and giving the customer the funding, DOD creates a check and <BR>
balance that ensures the revolving fund activity engages only in <BR>
efforts for which there is customer demand.8<BR>

NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>The present managerial culture encourages spending, discourages <BR>
innovation and investment, and uses managers' time poorly. <BR>

<P>Every manager has saved money, only to have his allocation reduced <BR>
in the subsequent year. This usually happens only once, then the <BR>
manager becomes a spender rather than a planner. Managing becomes <BR>
watching after little pots of money that can't be put where it <BR>
makes business sense because of reprogramming restrictions. So <BR>
managers who are monitors of these little pots of money are <BR>
rewarded for the ability to maneuver, however limitedly, through <BR>
the baroque and bizarre world of federal finance and procurement. <BR>
In a program year that runs in reality from January 1 to June 30, <BR>
due to typically late allocations and the need to close out <BR>
(versus roll over) the current fiscal year, most managers must <BR>
focus on custodial activities versus creative management.9<BR>

<P>The problems cited in this quote can be categorized as follows:<BR>

<P>*     Too many small, restricted sub-allotments: The subdivision <BR>
of restricted appropriation accounts as they come down to the <BR>
field manager leaves the latter little discretion to apply them to <BR>
the highest priority needs.<BR>

<P>*     &quot;Use it or lose it&quot;: Annual appropriations are spent by the <BR>
end of the fiscal year or lost by the recipient manager.<BR>

<P>*     Disincentives to change sub-allotments: attempts to make <BR>
changes in sub-allotments, even though the mechanisms are there, <BR>
run a high risk of the loss of funds for the field manager, as <BR>
headquarters managers reallocate them to their own priorities.<BR>

<P>*     Late action and delay: Late allotment of funds or delays in <BR>
approving requested changes cause field managers to be slow in <BR>
taking ACTIONS to improve services to customers or to make <BR>
improvements in operations.<BR>

<P>The implications of these problems are:<BR>

<P>*     Customers aren't served in a timely fashion; the federal <BR>
government appears bureaucratic and indifferent.<BR>

<P>*     Managers hold onto funds and spend them in accordance with <BR>
restrictions, not where there would be the greatest gain in <BR>
product or service for the least cost.<BR>

<P>*     There is little flexibility or incentive to improve <BR>
operations.<BR>

<P>*     Overcoming these perceptions and habits of working within <BR>
restrictions requires both a change of behavior on the part of <BR>
those imposing restrictions and constructive use of available <BR>
mechanisms to increase flexibility.<BR>

<P>
<P>***************<BR>
ACTIONS<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>1. Identify those appropriations that should be converted to multi <BR>
or no-year status. (3)<BR>

<P>OMB should issue guidance to assist agencies in a review of <BR>
appropriation accounts to determine where it may be appropriate to <BR>
propose conversion of annual accounts to multi-year or no-year <BR>
availability. The proposals should be prepared for inclusion in <BR>
the fiscal year 1996 budget. Agency heads should develop proposals <BR>
and be prepared to work with OMB and the appropriations <BR>
subcommittees on their review.<BR>

<P>An answer to &quot;end of year&quot; spending problems is to change annual <BR>
appropriations to multi or no-year availability. The number of <BR>
such appropriations should be increased. Where the normal flow of <BR>
activities such as repair and maintenance or the administrative <BR>
requirements in contracting make the end of the fiscal year an <BR>
artificial barrier to managing effectively, a two-year <BR>
availability for an appropriation can be a constructive answer. In <BR>
some cases, agencies have prepared proposals and justifications <BR>
for change; in other cases, more work remains to be done. Ready <BR>
changes should be included in the fiscal year 1996 President's <BR>
budget; others may need to wait for the fiscal year 1997 budget. <BR>
If changes are proposed in the President's budget, the changes <BR>
will need to be negotiated with the appropriations subcommittees.<BR>

<P>The Forest Service received support from the General Accounting <BR>
Office for two-year appropriations availabilities, which bolstered <BR>
its case with the appropriations subcommittees.10<BR>

<P>2. Permit agencies to roll over 50 percent of their unobligated <BR>
yearend balances in annual operating costs to the next year. (3)<BR>

<P>Agency heads should seek from Congress new general provisions in <BR>
their fiscal year 1996 appropriations to permit the rollover of <BR>
unobligated yearend balances in annual operations appropriations <BR>
into the next fiscal year. A small portion perhaps 2 percent <BR>
should be used to provide bonuses to the employees involved. This <BR>
practice creates a strong incentive for field managers and their <BR>
employees not to indulge in yearend spending and to look for cost <BR>
savings and ways to improve efficiency. The practice has been <BR>
successfully applied at DOD, the General Services Administration, <BR>
and the Forest Service, all of which have offered bonuses to <BR>
employees who contributed to yearend savings.11 OMB and Congress <BR>
should not automatically reduce operating costs in the next <BR>
cycle's budget because of savings. Chief Financial Officers in <BR>
agencies should review this process to ensure that managers are <BR>
not unduly penalized for savings in future budget decisions.<BR>

<P>3. Expedite reprogramming of funds within agencies. (2)<BR>

<P>Agency Chief Financial Officers should examine internal processes <BR>
to ensure timely response to program managers and to expedite the <BR>
review of reprogrammings (e.g., 30 working days within an agency <BR>
from time of program manager's request to correspondence to <BR>
appropriations subcommittee). <BR>

<P>Necessary actions to reprogram funds from one line item to another <BR>
within an appropriation account should be sent directly from the <BR>
agency head (or the agency head's designee) to the appropriations <BR>
subcommittee, after the advance notification and approval of OMB. <BR>
OMB should automatically approve reprogramming unless it objects <BR>
within a set period of time, such as five days. This change should <BR>
be made for the fiscal year 1995 budget's execution.<BR>

<P>Agencies will need to work with appropriations subcommittees to <BR>
meet the latter's concerns and to develop best practices to ensure <BR>
concurrence as quickly as possible.<BR>

<P>4. Formulate financial operating plans and adjust allotments/sub-<BR>
allotments on a timely basis. (1)<BR>

<P>Financial operating plans with allotments and sub-allotments <BR>
should be established by some set target date after appropriations <BR>
and apportionment action. Agency Chief Financial Officers should <BR>
review the process to ensure timely response to program managers <BR>
and establish a standard for timely response, say, 15 working days <BR>
for a reallotment action. This action should be completed during <BR>
fiscal year 1995 for full implementation with fiscal year 1996 <BR>
appropriations. <BR>

<P>The best and least costly defense against fraud, waste, and abuse <BR>
is not a system of detailed budget limitations, but timely, <BR>
accurate, accessible financial and program performance information <BR>
that quickly divulges trends and problems to attentive management. <BR>
Detailed limitations won't work well if the financial management <BR>
system can't adequately process, track, and report on <BR>
transactions, but neither will efforts to develop more flexibility <BR>
in financial operations, such as through the Unified Budget Plan. <BR>
Many agencies have adequate financial management systems; others <BR>
may need to upgrade their own or contract with another agency for <BR>
financial services if their own are inadequate.<BR>

<P>5. Adapt and apply the Unified Budget Plan throughout DOD and to <BR>
civilian agencies, where appropriate. (1)<BR>

<P>The Secretary of Defense, at his discretion, should implement the <BR>
Unified Budget Plan by internal directive, where appropriate, <BR>
during fiscal year 1995. Other agency heads may want to apply the <BR>
Unified Budget Plan on a voluntary pilot basis if it appears <BR>
useful and can be done within their statutory constraints. The <BR>
Unified Budget Plan constructively addresses the problem of <BR>
meeting priorities within predetermined restrictions. DOD should <BR>
grant installation commanders flexibility to transfer funds, as <BR>
needed, among allotments and cost categories within statutory <BR>
constraints to improve mission capability, cope with unforeseen <BR>
contingencies, and take advantage of opportunities to use monies <BR>
more effectively.<BR>

<P>Commanders and managers will require information systems to ensure <BR>
compliance with reprogramming thresholds and legislative mandates. <BR>
Accurate and timely monitoring can provide feedback to managers at <BR>
all levels if transfers are approaching reprogramming thresholds.<BR>

<P>Civilian agencies should consider the use of the Unified Budget <BR>
Plan to allow funds to be shifted at the program, regional or <BR>
district office, and/or field installation levels. A system <BR>
whereby field offices can move funds without a long delay awaiting <BR>
approval by headquarters is desirable.<BR>

<P>The problem encountered by DOD that higher levels will take and <BR>
use elsewhere any excess funds that a lower level office or <BR>
installation identifies can be a serious disincentive for the <BR>
Unified Budget Plan to operate effectively. Reallocation is, after <BR>
all, a responsibility of higher headquarters as well. There does <BR>
need to be discussion and understanding over the ground rules <BR>
among levels in the chain of command. The Chief Financial Officer <BR>
of an agency should be designated to facilitate the smooth <BR>
operation of the Unified Budget Plan, including the reallocation <BR>
of funds among installations that have identified those funds for <BR>
trade and prevention of the taking away of savings that are being <BR>
applied to management improvements.<BR>

<P>*************** <BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
***************<BR>
The President's budget formulation process is a tool to be used in <BR>
support of policy decision making. The process requires input from <BR>
front-line managers, bureau and agency budget offices, and <BR>
departmental budget and policy offices, culminating in the <BR>
preparation of the President's budget by the Office of Management <BR>
and Budget. The content of the  the processs should be of primary <BR>
concern to every manager at every level of the federal government. <BR>
At the same time, it is important to ensure that the process is <BR>
designed to clearly identify national goals and to efficiently <BR>
determine resource allocations in a manner fully supporting the <BR>
achievement of the identified goals.<BR>

<P>Ideally, the budget should evolve from discussions between <BR>
policymakers and program managers. Flexibility should be built <BR>
into the process to allow overall policy decisions to be molded, <BR>
as necessary, to fit the needs of diverse federal activities. <BR>

<P>Traditional Process Has Been Too Bureaucratic. The traditional <BR>
executive branch budget formulation process has departed from this <BR>
ideal in significant ways. The traditional process has been <BR>
layered rather than collaborative; it has been laden with controls <BR>
that inhibit flexibility; and within the agencies it begins so far <BR>
in advance of the budget year that initial decisions are based on <BR>
guesses, not data. Furthermore, the traditional process has been <BR>
better at generating claims for new resources than at allowing <BR>
informed choices within available resources. In addition, the <BR>
traditional process has not been well designed to identify <BR>
national goals or to encourage efficient allocation of resources <BR>
between competing areas of national needs. Because the budget is <BR>
primarily formulated around organizational structures rather than <BR>
around categories of national need, review of similar or related <BR>
programs across agency lines has been rare.<BR>

<P>The problems in the budget process have been process problems, not <BR>
problems related to the federal personnel responsible for budget <BR>
formulation activities. Most federal budget specialists are <BR>
sharply focused and hardworking professionals. They pride <BR>
themselves on being able to respond to requests for information on <BR>
the time schedule and in the format required by the federal budget <BR>
hierarchy. <BR>

<P>The Budget is Process-Driven, Not Results-Driven. Consider our <BR>
process. Early in the year, each agency estimates what it will <BR>
need to run its programs in the fiscal year that begins almost 2 <BR>
years later. This is like asking someone to figure out not only <BR>
what they will be doing, but how much it will cost 3 years later <BR>
since that's when the money will be spent. (See Appendix C.) <BR>
Bureau and program managers typically examine the previous year's <BR>
activity data and project the figures 3 years out, with no word <BR>
from top political leaders on their priorities, or even on the <BR>
total amount that they want to spend. In other words, planning <BR>
budgets is like playing &quot;pin the tail on the donkey.&quot; Blindfolded <BR>
managers are asked to hit an unknown target.<BR>

<P>OMB, acting for the President, then crafts a proposed budget <BR>
through back and forth negotiations with departments and agencies, <BR>
still a year before the fiscal year it will govern. Decisions are <BR>
struck on dollars Congress may never appropriate dollars that, to <BR>
agencies, mean people, equipment, and everything else they need to <BR>
do their jobs. OMB's director considers options during a series of <BR>
Director's Review meetings, each one focused on a different <BR>
department or agency. Then, OMB &quot;passes back&quot; recommended funding <BR>
levels for the agencies, and final figures are worked out during a <BR>
final appeals process.<BR>

<P>Early the next year, the President presents a budget proposal to <BR>
Congress for the fiscal year beginning the following October 1. <BR>
Lawmakers, the media, and interest groups pore over the document, <BR>
searching for winners and losers, new spending proposals, and <BR>
changes in tax laws. In the ensuing months, Congress puts its own <BR>
stamp on the plan.<BR>

<P>Although House and Senate budget committees guide congressional <BR>
action, every committee plays a role. Authorizing committees <BR>
debate the merits of existing programs and the President's <BR>
proposals for changes within their subject areas. While they <BR>
decide which programs should continue and recommend funding <BR>
levels, separate appropriations committees draft the 13 annual <BR>
spending bills that actually constitute the budget.<BR>

<P>Congressional debates over its own budget resolution, <BR>
authorization bills, and appropriations often extend into the <BR>
fall. Frequently the President and Congress pass one or more <BR>
&quot;continuing resolutions&quot; to keep the money flowing, often at the <BR>
previous year's level. Until the end, agency officials troop back <BR>
and forth to OMB and to the Hill to make their case. States and <BR>
localities, interest groups, and advocates seek time to argue <BR>
their cause. Budget staffs work nonstop, preparing estimates and <BR>
projections on how this or that change will affect revenues or <BR>
spending. All this work is focused on making a budget not planning <BR>
or delivering programs. <BR>

<P>Additional Complications. As if the budget process in itself were <BR>
not awkward enough, it also suffers from other factors that divert <BR>
attention from coherent policy making. For example, much of the <BR>
material produced by budget specialists for the internal agency <BR>
budget process is irrelevant to and unnecessary for policy <BR>
decision making. The materials produced, in many cases, are in <BR>
response to attempts by higher levels to micro-manage lower levels <BR>
in the government organization structure. Requests for information <BR>
are often a way of restricting the amount of decision making <BR>
delegated to agency heads or line managers. <BR>

<P>In addition, the current process tends to mask the fact that <BR>
agencies' budgets and programs are interdependent. No single <BR>
agency includes all the programs and activities necessary to <BR>
reform welfare, to meet the needs of children and their families, <BR>
or to reduce crime. Replenishment of Pacific salmon requires the <BR>
coordinated efforts of the Departments of Commerce, Energy, <BR>
Interior, and Agriculture, plus several states and Indian tribes.<BR>

<P>Yet for all its weaknesses, the budget formulation process remains <BR>
the most effective tool in the executive branch for enforcing <BR>
discipline in the policy development process. In order for <BR>
resource allocations to be made in accordance with policy <BR>
priorities, policy decisions must be made on a time schedule that <BR>
coincides with the budget formulation process. At the outset of <BR>
this administration it was clearly time to review the executive <BR>
branch budget formulation process to make it more efficient and <BR>
meaningful.<BR>

<P>Obviously, formulation of the federal budget is not exclusively an <BR>
executive branch issue. The U. S. Constitution gives Congress the <BR>
primary power of the purse in our nation's government structure. <BR>
In recognition of the respective roles of Congress and the <BR>
executive branch in the federal budget formulation process, the <BR>
NPR budget team met with staff members from several congressional <BR>
committees in the development of this report. However, most of the <BR>
discussion and recommendations in this report concern potential <BR>
changes in the executive branch budget formulation process rather <BR>
than the legislative branch budget process.<BR>

<P>
<P>***************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>No change in the federal budget process will solve our nation's <BR>
debt dilemma. Deficit reduction is a policy decision, not the <BR>
result of a process. As the director of the Congressional Budget <BR>
Office, Robert D. Reischauer, testified before the Joint Committee <BR>
on the Organization of Congress in March 1993, &quot;[P]rocedures are <BR>
no substitute for substantive policy agreement and action.&quot;2<BR>

<P>There have been, however, a number of potential improvements to <BR>
the budget formulation process that have been apparent to this <BR>
administration. In particular, it certainly appears that the <BR>
executive budget development process could benefit from procedures <BR>
similar to those used by Congress in its budget development. <BR>
Congress substantially revamped its internal budget process in <BR>
1974. Before then, each appropriations subcommittee, working <BR>
individually and in an information vacuum, had designated and <BR>
approved spending levels for its particular area of oversight. <BR>
Until all the subcommittees had finalized their appropriations <BR>
levels, no one knew what total level of spending had been <BR>
approved, or for what purpose. In 1974, Congress adopted the <BR>
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, requiring <BR>
congressional agreement on budget totals and functional <BR>
allocations before the appropriations subcommittees began their <BR>
analysis. Now, in approving appropriated funds, the subcommittees <BR>
work with an understanding of available resources and negotiated <BR>
priorities.<BR>

<P>Describing the importance of this concurrent budget resolution, <BR>
Reischauer said it would be hard to imagine the current deficit <BR>
reduction effort if this change had not occurred. Specifically, <BR>
Reischauer noted that &quot;under the pre-1974 system, Congress had no <BR>
capacity to focus comprehensively on budget totals and never had <BR>
to vote on overall spending or overall revenues.&quot; He went on the <BR>
say that Congress today is forced to make tradeoffs among <BR>
conflicting priorities &quot;because it has to vote on the whole and on <BR>
the deficit.&quot;3 The importance of the budget resolution was also <BR>
noted by budget expert Allen Schick in his study of budget <BR>
reforms. In the report he completed for the Congressional Research <BR>
Service, Schick noted, &quot;the heart of the [congressional] budget <BR>
process is the budget resolution setting forth budget totals and <BR>
functional allocations.&quot;4<BR>

<P>Traditional Process Fails Decisionmakers. Unfortunately, the <BR>
traditional executive budget formulation process more closely <BR>
mirrors the pre-1974 congressional model. Decisions have seemed ad <BR>
hoc because there is no requirement for a mission-driven budget <BR>
framework or resolution to set forth the policy and fiscal <BR>
guidance within which decisions must be made.<BR>

<P>As a result, the budget requests submitted by federal agencies <BR>
have often exceeded affordable limits and are of little value to <BR>
the decision making process. Agency heads and program managers <BR>
have been often greatly disappointed if not disgruntled by the <BR>
final totals for their programs. Agency heads have sometimes been <BR>
ill-prepared to explain, let alone support with any enthusiasm, <BR>
the final decisions made in the President's budget.<BR>

<P>The traditional federal policy and budget planning processes were <BR>
developed in a time when resources were increasing and agency <BR>
interdependence was less of a problem. Emphasis has been given to <BR>
bottom-up justification for the use of new resources. Although <BR>
there have been pockets of innovation across the federal <BR>
government, the traditional budget and planning process has been, <BR>
for the most part, poorly designed for a time of belt-tightening. <BR>
Decision-makers can no longer merely decide to create a new <BR>
program; they must now determine where to find the resources for <BR>
the new program and the implications of reducing current programs <BR>
and activities. It has been difficult to make informed choices <BR>
across program lines and garner the necessary political agreement <BR>
to make reductions, when there are few effective mechanisms for <BR>
establishing priorities that cross agency lines. The traditional <BR>
policy development system has not had adequate tools to identify <BR>
potential consolidations or termination of activities or to make <BR>
comparisons of different approaches to achieve the same mission.<BR>

<P>At the outset of this administration, personnel involved at all <BR>
levels of the executive branch expressed to the National <BR>
Performance Review (NPR) a desire for more definitive guidance at <BR>
the beginning of the budget formulation process. Many expressed <BR>
concern that the traditional process concentrated a <BR>
disproportionate amount of effort on incremental increases or <BR>
decreases in discretionary activities, particularly in operational <BR>
accounts, while spending relatively little time on policies <BR>
related to mandatory programs and tax expenditures. Many described <BR>
frustration over lack of comprehensive policy reviews across <BR>
agency lines. Finally, it was often noted that in past <BR>
administrations, key policy personnel Cabinet-level appointees and <BR>
members of the White House staff had not been well integrated into <BR>
budget formulation processes. <BR>

<P>The incoming administration had to change traditional practices to <BR>
put together an economic plan by mid-February and a budget by <BR>
early April.  It shifted from limited participation to more <BR>
collegial decision making. This paid immediate dividends a new <BR>
budget plan adopted almost in its entirety by Congress. To expand <BR>
this collegial decision making, the White House policy councils <BR>
and OMB have continued to modify and update traditional practices.<BR>

<P>
<P>***************<BR>
ACTIONS<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>1. Begin budget formulation with a more collegial and open process <BR>
like an &quot;executive budget resolution&quot; to provide early guidance to <BR>
the departments and agencies. (2)<BR>

<P>A revised executive budget formulation process will reduce, to the <BR>
extent possible, the burdens that accompany the traditional budget <BR>
development process by providing definitive guidance early, using <BR>
an approach similar to the congressional budget resolution <BR>
process.<BR>

<P>Revisions to the traditional process were piloted shortly after <BR>
President Clinton took office. This revised process was more open; <BR>
it set broad policy priorities; and it considered crosscutting <BR>
policy initiatives affecting each agency. OMB expanded the roles <BR>
of the White House staff and other policy groups, such as the <BR>
National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the <BR>
National Security Council. OMB went to great lengths to involve <BR>
executive branch leaders in budget decisions and to communicate <BR>
priorities.<BR>

<P>The FY 1995 budget process has expanded on this. OMB held meetings <BR>
with agencies during the summer of 1993 to discuss major issues <BR>
and priorities, especially those cutting across agencies. Cabinet <BR>
members and other key agency heads will be involved in discussions <BR>
with the President on their budgets before final decisions are <BR>
made.<BR>

<P>For the FY 1996 budget process, agencies should receive earlier <BR>
guidance from OMB regarding their allocations under the <BR>
discretionary spending limits established by law. This would be <BR>
similar to the process that Congress uses in developing its budget <BR>
resolution. OMB, Treasury, and other White House policy groups <BR>
should take the lead in discussing crosscutting budget <BR>
initiatives.<BR>

<P>The resulting fiscal and policy guidance early in the budget <BR>
process should render top officials responsible for budget totals <BR>
and policy decisions and will encourage low-level ingenuity to <BR>
devise funding options within those guidelines. This will also <BR>
make the budget process more meaningful by allowing agencies to <BR>
make their budget decisions with full knowledge of the available <BR>
resources. As a result, it should eliminate multiple requirements <BR>
at the agency level for detailed budget justification materials <BR>
prior to issuance of OMB guidance.<BR>

<P>Use of an executive budget resolution process that determines <BR>
funding allocations through a collaborative process should yield <BR>
greater understanding of and support for the President's budget <BR>
throughout the executive branch.<BR>

<P>2. Replace hierarchical budget development and review with team <BR>
approaches. (2) <BR>

<P>Teamwork should be encouraged at all stages of budget development. <BR>
Replacing the past hierarchical process with teamwork will <BR>
streamline the process, provide better information to make <BR>
decisions, improve communication about expected results, recognize <BR>
agency interdependence in achieving the administration's goals, <BR>
and increase buy-in to the decisions.<BR>

<P>At the White House policy council, OMB, and agency head level, <BR>
teamwork has already involved agency heads attending the <BR>
leadership and interagency meetings held for the purpose of <BR>
developing the budget. <BR>

<P>The expectation is that OMB and agency staffs work collaboratively <BR>
in budget development as well. The Department of Defense (DOD) is <BR>
further along in this respect than civilian agencies, as DOD and <BR>
OMB have had a joint budget review process for many years. <BR>

<P>Other agencies can learn from the DOD process, and DOD as well as <BR>
civilian agencies can apply this type of team approach to internal <BR>
agency budget development. Agency heads and bureau directors <BR>
within agencies should engage, whenever possible, all levels of <BR>
the bureaucracy involved in issues under discussion within their <BR>
agency. <BR>

<P>If the issues under discussion concern activities that cross <BR>
agency lines, meetings should include representatives from <BR>
different organizations involved in the activity. The Department <BR>
of Commerce requires its bureaus that ask for funds for activities <BR>
or initiatives that relate to other bureaus' work to submit joint <BR>
funding requests or the agency budget office will not consider the <BR>
request.<BR>

<P>Teams will greatly reduce the amount of time spent in the current <BR>
budget development process, in which each level in the bureaucracy <BR>
prepares issues and options in secret until they are passed to the <BR>
next level.<BR>

<P>3. Review functional categories used in the budget process and <BR>
streamline budget justification details provided to Congress. (2)<BR>

<P>OMB should expedite the already initiated review of the 19 <BR>
functional funding categories used in the current federal budget <BR>
and consult with Congress and executive branch agencies in <BR>
developing new categories. The current categories were developed <BR>
in 1975 and are outdated. Consideration should be given to tying <BR>
revised categories to the performance and planning requirements of <BR>
the recently enacted Government Performance and Results Act.<BR>

<P>OMB should also work with agencies and congressional leaders to <BR>
develop more effective ways to produce and coordinate the <BR>
submission of budget justification materials to Congress. For <BR>
example, an agreement might be reached to focus congressional <BR>
appropriation hearings more along mission than organizational <BR>
lines, or to allow for joint presentations by agencies with <BR>
related missions or joint committee hearings on issues of concern <BR>
to multiple committees. The goal of the negotiations should be to <BR>
(1) reduce significantly the amount of repetitive information <BR>
produced and provided sometimes in only a slightly different <BR>
configuration to multiple congressional committees, and (2) better <BR>
take into consideration the interrelationships of programs and <BR>
activities with similar missions.<BR>

BACKGROUND<BR>
**************<BR>

<P>The President currently submits an annual budget request to <BR>
Congress by the first Monday in February.1 Congress adopts annual <BR>
budget resolutions and enacts appropriation bills covering all <BR>
discretionary budget accounts each year. An annual process, <BR>
however, is not the only choice available.<BR>

<P>The idea of biennial budgeting has been around for some time. The <BR>
first biennial budgeting bill was introduced by then Congressman <BR>
Leon Panetta in 1977, and many dozens have been introduced since.2 <BR>
Although none have passed, an increasing deficit and pressure to <BR>
reduce that deficit has made budget decisions more difficult and <BR>
the budget process more time consuming. Accordingly, the time is <BR>
ripe for biennial budgeting.<BR>

<P>The government has had some experience with two-year or longer <BR>
budget plans. In 1987, for example, Congress and the President <BR>
agreed to a two-year budget plan for fiscal years 1988 and 1989. <BR>
The November 1987 legislative executive branch budget summit <BR>
agreement set two-year spending levels for major programs, <BR>
demonstrating the success possible from this kind of budgeting. <BR>
This accord streamlined the budget process significantly and <BR>
allowed Congress for the first time since 1977 to enact all 13 <BR>
appropriations bills without using continuing resolutions.3<BR>

<P>The Budget Enforcement Act, enacted in 1990, set 5-year spending <BR>
limits for discretionary programs and pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) <BR>
requirements for mandatory programs. With these multi-year caps <BR>
agreed upon, neither the President nor Congress has to decide the <BR>
total level of discretionary spending each year. The fact that <BR>
these caps are now set in advance provides even more reason to <BR>
move to biennial budget and appropriation cycles.<BR>

<P>In another test of biennial budgeting, Congress directed the <BR>
Department of Defense (DOD) to submit a biennial budget for fiscal <BR>
years 1988 and 1989. It was anticipated that a biennial budget <BR>
would help Congress move away from detailed annual budget reviews <BR>
and provide more time for broad policy oversight. Congress <BR>
expressed its belief that a biennial budget would &quot;substantially <BR>
improve DOD management and congressional oversight,&quot; and that <BR>
while it was preferable to subject all federal spending to a two-<BR>
year budget, &quot;beginning with the DOD budget is important.&quot;4 The <BR>
administration continued to submit biennial budgets for DOD, as <BR>
well as for the Coast Guard.<BR>

<P>Thus far, however, Congress has been dissuaded from enacting <BR>
biennial appropriations for DOD or the Coast Guard or from passing <BR>
a general biennial budget measure. Congressional reluctance is <BR>
due, in part, to unanswered questions about what aspects of the <BR>
process should be included the budget resolution, authorizations, <BR>
appropriations, or some combination thereof. Equally vital are <BR>
questions about whether the reduced workload envisioned would <BR>
actually be achieved, or if the need for mid-cycle revisions would <BR>
make this impossible, as well as what implications such a change <BR>
might have for the balance of power between the President and <BR>
Congress.5<BR>

<P>At the state level, 21 states adopt biennial budgets. The General <BR>
Accounting Office (GAO) has reported that in states with biennial <BR>
budgeting, off-year budget adjustments did not consume as much <BR>
time as regular budgeting, leaving more time for other legislative <BR>
activities.6<BR>

<P>
<P>**************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
**************<BR>

<P>Formulation of the President's budget is an incredibly time <BR>
consuming and expensive process, as described throughout this <BR>
report. After an election, a new President sworn into office on <BR>
January 20 has approximately two weeks before he or she must <BR>
present a budget to Congress. Clearly, this timing does not allow <BR>
for full development of a President's priorities and analyses of <BR>
those priorities within total fiscal limitations and the condition <BR>
of the U.S. economy.<BR>

<P>The congressional budget process is also extremely time consuming <BR>
for Congress and the agencies and can result in significant delays <BR>
in funding. One primary congressional complaint about the budget <BR>
process in recent years has been the amount of time it requires.7 <BR>
Some 60 percent of all congressional roll call votes now involve <BR>
budget-related issues.8 Consideration of such budget questions as <BR>
concurrent resolutions on the budget, authorization measures, <BR>
continuing resolutions, and reconciliation bills has been <BR>
criticized as repetitive and redundant. Since DOD is under annual <BR>
authorizations, for example, there are at least 18 votes for DOD <BR>
alone each year for the subcommittee, full committee, and floor <BR>
votes for an annual budget resolution, authorization, and <BR>
appropriation. These votes occurred even when Defense had its own <BR>
spending cap in law, so all these votes were essentially on the <BR>
same total number.<BR>

<P>Sometimes all or some of the 13 appropriation bills are not passed <BR>
by the required October 1 deadline, thus requiring one or more <BR>
continuing resolutions. GAO found that continuing resolutions <BR>
covered 10 of the 13 appropriations bills during at least part of <BR>
the year for 20 of the 26 years reviewed (196085). Based on a <BR>
calculation of the total number of days an appropriation operated <BR>
under continuing resolutions each year, GAO found that Foreign <BR>
Assistance, LaborHealth and Human Services (HHS)Education, and <BR>
Commerce Justice State Judiciary appropriations ranked above the <BR>
rest, operating under a continuing resolution almost one-third to <BR>
one-half of the time over the 26 years.9 Lack of final <BR>
appropriation action by October 1 results in uncertainty among <BR>
agencies of funding levels and resultant delays in program <BR>
operations. These delays cause problems for all programs, but <BR>
particularly for programs that need most of their funds early in a <BR>
fiscal year, such as HHS's low-income home energy assistance <BR>
program, primarily a winter program providing home heating support <BR>
to low-income individuals and families.<BR>

<P>On the agency side, agencies spend an inordinate amount of time <BR>
preparing for appropriation hearings that usually occur between <BR>
March and May each year. This preparation includes developing <BR>
material for witnesses on every line item, since the issues on <BR>
which the appropriation committee has chosen to focus often are <BR>
not known to the executive branch. In the HHS Budget Office, for <BR>
example, a briefing book that usually exceeds 700 pages is <BR>
prepared for use in as many as 60 appropriation hearings.10 The <BR>
major HHS organizational operating components (i.e., Social <BR>
Security Administration, Health Care Financing Administration, <BR>
Public Health Service, Administration for Children and Families, <BR>
Administration on Aging) also prepare their own briefing books for <BR>
their assistant secretaries or commissioners who must testify.<BR>

<P>In our review of numerous studies and interviews throughout the <BR>
government, we found that many people favor some form of biennial <BR>
budgeting. A 1993 survey of members of Congress, conducted by the <BR>
Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, showed that 70 <BR>
percent favor a biennial process with a two-year concurrent budget <BR>
resolution and multi-year authorizations, and 57 percent favor <BR>
multi-year authorizations and two-year appropriations. The table <BR>
below shows the level of support for multi-year authorizations and <BR>
two-year appropriations by type of respondent. As shown, 57 <BR>
percent of all respondents and 55 percent of both House and Senate <BR>
members favor or strongly favor multi-year authorizations and two-<BR>
year appropriations. Reasons cited for their support include the <BR>
advantages of more time for congressional decision making, <BR>
reduction in repetitive ACTIONS by Congress, and opportunities for <BR>
better budgeting by allowing time for more detailed analysis on <BR>
individual issues. Members of appropriations committees are a <BR>
notable exception, citing for the most part the advantages of <BR>
annual congressional over sight. The Joint Committee found that 23 <BR>
percent of Representatives and 18 percent of Senators responding <BR>
to the committee's survey opposed or strongly opposed multi-year <BR>
authorizations and two-year appropriations.<BR>

<P>Executive branch staff mentioned as benefits of biennial budgeting <BR>
the increase in predictability of budget ACTIONS and more time for <BR>
better budget analysis, program planning, budget execution, and <BR>
program evaluation.<BR>

<P>Considerable time could be saved and used more effectively in both <BR>
the executive and legislative branches of government if budgets <BR>
and appropriations were moved to a biennial cycle. The chief <BR>
benefits include:<BR>

<P>*     greater stability and rationality of the budget process;<BR>

<P>*     better management as managers have more time to manage their <BR>
programs and more time to think about their programs and put new <BR>
policies in place;<BR>

<P>*     increased ability for oversight by both Congress and the <BR>
executive branch, including more time for program evaluation;<BR>

<P>*     increased predictability for those served by government <BR>
programs and for those who administer them; and<BR>

<P>*     less waste, by reducing the opportunities to enact wasteful <BR>
spending.<BR>

ACTIONS<BR>
************<BR>
1. Enact legislation to move from an annual to a biennial budget <BR>
submission by the President. (3)<BR>

<P>The President should submit legislation to Congress to move to a <BR>
biennial budget, including a biennial budget submission from the <BR>
President to Congress. In the second year of a biennium, the <BR>
President should submit not a new budget, but only amendments to <BR>
the previously submitted budget for exceptional areas of concern <BR>
or change, emergencies, or other unforeseen circumstances. <BR>
Supplementals, rescissions, deferrals, and reprogramming could <BR>
continue to be considered any time. Regular updates of estimates <BR>
for mandatory programs (which are more volatile and most of which <BR>
are not subject to annual appropriations) would continue.<BR>

<P>The President can submit a two-year request without legislative <BR>
change. To avoid having to present such a budget every year, <BR>
however, the President should submit a legislative proposal to <BR>
move the requirements related to the President's budget submission <BR>
from an annual to a biennial cycle. This recommendation should be <BR>
pursued regardless of whether Congress chooses to switch to <BR>
biennial budget resolutions and/or appropriations. OMB should <BR>
revise OMB circular A11 by March 1995 to accommodate this change.<BR>

<P>Biennial budgeting will not make the budget decisions facing our <BR>
nation any easier, but it may create an environment that will <BR>
better facilitate the hard decision making process. Considerable <BR>
time would be saved and used more effectivelyif budgets were moved <BR>
to a streamlined biennial cycle.<BR>

<P>The time-consuming processes of developing the President's budget <BR>
(albeit a process shortened by other NPR recommendations) and of <BR>
defending every line item of that budget in congressional <BR>
justifications would occur once every two years rather than <BR>
annually. Program managers would have more time to manage their <BR>
programs, and policy and budget analysts more time to conduct more <BR>
in-depth analysis of program structure, effectiveness, results, <BR>
and results-oriented performance measures. <BR>

<P>Agencies would not spend less time interacting with Congress, but <BR>
the time would be better spent. Instead of agencies and Congress <BR>
spending months in appropriation hearings covering line item <BR>
detail, more time would likely be spent on longer term budget <BR>
issues and effective programmatic and evaluation oversight.<BR>

<P>There is more than one reasonable alternative to when a biennium <BR>
begins and which years it covers. The first biennium could begin <BR>
October 1, 1996, to cover fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Subsequent <BR>
biennia would begin October 1 of each even-numbered year. This <BR>
timing permits a newly elected President slightly over one year to <BR>
fully develop a complete package of policy and spending priorities <BR>
(both increases and decreases) in the context of total fiscal <BR>
limitations and the condition of the U.S. economy. This timing for <BR>
a biennial budget was recently supported by former Vice President <BR>
Walter Mondale who testified, before the Joint Committee on the <BR>
Organization of Congress, &quot;First of all, I suspect that a new <BR>
administration would feel pretty good about having an existing <BR>
appropriation in place when they took over, so that they didn't <BR>
have to start from scratch.&quot;11 This timing would allow sufficient <BR>
time for President Clinton to fully develop the first <BR>
comprehensive biennial federal budget, using the proposed <BR>
executive budget resolution based on missions.<BR>

<P>Alternatively, a biennium could begin October 1 of odd-numbered <BR>
years. This timing would permit budgets to be adopted during the <BR>
first year of a President's term and at the start of a new <BR>
Congress, thus giving a new President and Congress the ability to <BR>
more quickly enact their programs rather than having to operate <BR>
for two years under an earlier approved budget. This would also <BR>
allow difficult budget votes to come in non-election years. If <BR>
this timing is selected, however, provisions should be made to <BR>
postpone beyond the first week in February the required date of <BR>
submission of the President's budget to Congress in the year a new <BR>
President takes office. Such a provision must allow a new <BR>
President sufficient time in office to finalize his or her first <BR>
biennial budget request. A delayed submission of the President's <BR>
budget could be coupled with an automatic continuing resolution so <BR>
Congress also has sufficient time to consider the President's <BR>
request and enact appropriations.<BR>

<P>2. Establish biennial budget resolution and appropriations <BR>
processes. (3)<BR>

<P>Congress should establish biennial budget resolutions and <BR>
appropriations. NPR also recommends that Congress adopt multi-year <BR>
authorizations since it does not make sense to have annual <BR>
authorizations once there are biennial appropriations. The current <BR>
annual process of adopting a concurrent resolution on the budget <BR>
would be replaced with one that requires congressional action only <BR>
every other year. Congress could enact appropriations bills once <BR>
every two years, including annual or multi-year appropriations for <BR>
all accounts in the federal budget that are subject to <BR>
appropriations.12<BR>

<P>Considerable time would be saved and used more effectively by both <BR>
the legislative and executive branches if budgets and <BR>
appropriations were moved to a biennial cycle. Details need to be <BR>
closely worked out with agencies, OMB, and congressional <BR>
appropriations committees to avoid the potential for setting in <BR>
place an even more complex process.<BR>

<P>Congressional budget workload would be reduced, allowing more time <BR>
for congressional review and other legislative activities, such as <BR>
considering authorizations. Most budget-related votes would be <BR>
concentrated in a single year, freeing up time in the off-year for <BR>
more productive activities. Reducing the number of spending <BR>
decisions that have to be made and the resultant level of conflict <BR>
would leave additional time for congressional evaluation and <BR>
oversight of program results.<BR>

<P>With biennial appropriations, there would only be half as many <BR>
potential crises for being without funds, or operating under <BR>
continuing resolutions, on October 1. Since the stakes are higher <BR>
with biennial budgets and appropriations (since policy and <BR>
spending decisions are made for two rather than one years), it may <BR>
be more difficult to get agreement on the President's budget, the <BR>
budget resolution, and appropriations within Congress and between <BR>
the President and Congress. However, once agreements are reached, <BR>
federal, state, and local program managers will have relative <BR>
certainty for two years.<BR>

<P>As an alternative to biennial appropriations for all functions, <BR>
Congress could consider retaining annual appropriations for <BR>
selected programs where funding levels are relatively <BR>
unpredictable and biennial appropriations might result in an <BR>
increase in the likelihood for supplemental appropriations. The <BR>
National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) recommended such <BR>
an approach in 1983.13 Because it is possible that a biennial <BR>
cycle is appropriate for some but not all annually appropriated <BR>
accounts, NAPA argued, experiments could first be limited to only <BR>
those cases where there is little fluctuation in resource <BR>
requirements from year to year. <BR>

<P>With this in mind, the current Joint Committee on the Organization <BR>
of Congress asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to <BR>
identify those programs in which annual, rather than multi-year, <BR>
appropriations might be more desirable based on the following <BR>
criteria:<BR>

<P>*     funding patterns heavily dependent on economic factors;<BR>

<P>*     emergency items; and<BR>

<P>*     other programs with unpredictable funding demands. <BR>

<P>CBO's analysis led to a list of 30 programs that met the Joint <BR>
Committee's criteria. This list represented a total of $18.5 <BR>
billion in fiscal year 1993 budget authority, or less than 4 <BR>
percent of total discretionary spending. More than one-third of <BR>
the programs identified are in the international affairs area, in <BR>
large part because uncertainties in the world make needs for <BR>
security assistance, migration and refugee assistance, <BR>
international peacekeeping, and food aid highly unpredictable from <BR>
year to year. Other programs susceptible to changes in funding <BR>
needs because of unforeseen emergencies include the firefighting <BR>
activities of the Interior and Agriculture departments and the <BR>
disaster assistance activities of the Small Business <BR>
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <BR>
Activities such as the administration of unemployment insurance <BR>
are tied to economic trends that are difficult to predict. Still <BR>
other programs, like the renewal of contracts for housing <BR>
subsidies, have proved difficult to predict for other reasons.14 <BR>
Congress could use this list as a starting point to determine the <BR>
few programs that would remain on an annual cycle.<BR>

<P>3. Evaluate program effectiveness and refine performance measures <BR>
in the off-year. (3)<BR>

<P>The off year in a biennial budget cycle should be used by both the <BR>
executive branch and Congress to thoroughly review and analyze all <BR>
federal programs within programs and organizations and across <BR>
organizational boundaries to:<BR>

<P>*     focus on long-term planning than currently feasible due to <BR>
the time constraints and products required by an annual budget <BR>
cycle;<BR>

<P>*     evaluate program effectiveness in terms of the achievement <BR>
of results in the context of missions and goals;<BR>

<P>*     thoroughly examine the base funding of programs rather than <BR>
only incremental changes;<BR>

<P>*     review and refine performance measures and targets; and<BR>

<P>*     update goals and timetables for meeting standards and <BR>
outside benchmarks.<BR>

<P>These reviews and analyses should be conducted by program <BR>
managers, as well as by agency budget and evaluation staff, OMB <BR>
management and budget staff, executive branch policy officials, <BR>
and the legislative branch. Moving to a biennial cycle beginning <BR>
with a budget for fiscal years 199798 would allow these thorough <BR>
reviews to begin in 1996 and 1997 when development of a fiscal <BR>
year 1998 budget would have occurred.<BR>

<P>States and localities with biennial budgeting report that their <BR>
long-range planning is enhanced, less time is spent on budgeting, <BR>
and more time is spent on other matters.15 Sunnyvale, California, <BR>
for example, does not modify its base budget in the second year <BR>
except through a budget supplement process to reflect a specific <BR>
service level change.16 What routinely happens in Sunnyvale during <BR>
the off-year is that program managers take a closer look at the <BR>
established service (performance target) level, by assessing and <BR>
analyzing specific data, to decide whether the program structure <BR>
in place (i.e., program objectives, performance indicators, and <BR>

<P>************<BR>
BACKGROUND<BR>
************<BR>

<P>&quot;A Vision of Change for America,&quot; issued on February 17, 1993, to <BR>
outline President Clinton's economic plan, declared that a <BR>
&quot;strong, workable enforcement mechanism is essential to the <BR>
credibility of any deficit reduction package.&quot; As a part of the <BR>
President's commitment to support mechanisms to enforce deficit <BR>
reduction, &quot;A Vision of Change for America&quot; expressed support for <BR>
enactment of enhanced rescission authority legislation that would <BR>
require expeditious congressional action on Presidential <BR>
rescissions.1<BR>

<P>On April 1, 1993, the House Rules Committee reported out a rule <BR>
&quot;Providing For The Consideration of H.R. 1578,&quot; a bill known as <BR>
the Expedited Rescission Act of 1993. In an April 27, 1993 letter <BR>
to the Speaker of the House Tom Foley, President Clinton expressed <BR>
support for H.R. 1578, saying the bill &quot;would increase the <BR>
accountability of both the executive and legislative branches for <BR>
reducing wasteful spending. It would provide an effective means <BR>
for curbing unnecessary or inappropriate expenditures without <BR>
blocking enactment of critical appropriations bills.&quot; Further, in <BR>
recognition of the concerns related to lineitem veto proposals, <BR>
President Clinton's letter expressed his feeling that the <BR>
expedited rescission procedures proposed in H.R. 1578 &quot;would [not] <BR>
shift the constitutional balance of powers that is so critical to <BR>
the success of our form of government.&quot;2 In effect, the bill would <BR>
enable the President to reject items in an appropriations bill.<BR>

<P>On April 29, 1993, H.R. 1578 passed the House of Representatives <BR>
by a vote of 258157. To date, no action has been taken on the bill <BR>
in the Senate.<BR>

<P>***************<BR>
NEED FOR CHANGE<BR>
***************<BR>
Under current law the President must sign or veto appropriations <BR>
acts in their entirety. The President has no authority to approve <BR>
some items and reject others. As a result, enactment of <BR>
appropriations for necessary and needed activities is sometimes <BR>
held up pending the resolution of a controversy related to only <BR>
one item in an appropriations act. A recent example of this <BR>
situation was at the beginning of fiscal year 1990 when operations <BR>
of nearly the entire federal government ceased because President <BR>
Bush vetoed a Continuing Resolution passed by Congress as a result <BR>
of disagreements over specific line items in the legislation.<BR>

<P>Over the past several years, several proposals, both in the form <BR>
of statutes and in the form of constitutional amendments, have <BR>
been made to allow the President &quot;lineitem veto&quot; authority; in <BR>
other words, to allow the President to veto specific line items <BR>
from an appropriations act. Supporters of line-item veto authority <BR>
argue that such a procedure will enable the President to reject <BR>
wasteful items, or items that escape scrutiny because of their <BR>
inclusion in large appropriations bills, and will require Congress <BR>
to cast a separate vote on those items. Congress, however, has <BR>
been reluctant to confer on the President directly any sort of <BR>
item veto authority. This reluctance reflects, at least in part, a <BR>
fear that a shift in spending power from the legislative to the <BR>
executive branch might result.3<BR>

<P>Under current procedures, as provided by the Congressional Budget <BR>
Impoundment and Control Act of 1974, the President is required to <BR>
submit to Congress proposed rescissions (the permanent <BR>
cancellation of previously appropriated budget authority) <BR>
throughout the year.4 To propose a rescission, the President must <BR>
submit a message to Congress specifying the amount to be <BR>
rescinded, the accounts and programs involved, the estimated <BR>
fiscal and program effects, and the reasons for the rescission. <BR>
Multiple rescissions can be grouped in a single message. Congress <BR>
then has 45 days of &quot;continuous session&quot; (usually a larger number <BR>
of calendar days) during which it can pass a rescission bill. <BR>
Congress may rescind all, part, or none of the amount proposed by <BR>
the President.5<BR>

<P>The major weakness in current rescission authority, however, is <BR>
that Congress is not required to vote on the President's <BR>
rescissions proposals. Under the current procedures, if Congress <BR>
does not approve a rescission in legislation by the expiration of <BR>
this period, the President must make the funds available for <BR>
obligation and expenditure.6 In others words, if Congress takes no <BR>
action whatsoever, the President must make the funds available.<BR>

<P>Moreover, under current provisions, it is difficult for Members of <BR>
Congress supporting a rescission proposal to even bring the <BR>
proposal out of committee for floor consideration. According to <BR>
current law, if the Appropriations Committee fails to report a <BR>
rescission proposal within 25 days, a Member supporting a <BR>
rescission proposal must have the support of 20 percent of the <BR>
House to secure a discharge of the rescission proposal from the <BR>
Appropriations Committee.<BR>

<P>***************<BR>
Action<BR>
***************<BR>

<P>Pursue negotiations with the leadership of the House and Senate to <BR>
gain enactment of expedited rescission authority. (3)<BR>

<P>As part of congressional ACTIONS anticipated in regard to fiscal <BR>
year 1994 funding levels, the Clinton Administration encourages <BR>
the leadership of the House and Senate to continue negotiations on <BR>
Senate consideration of H.R. 1578, the Expedited Rescission Act of <BR>
1993, with an aim toward passage of the bill before the end of the <BR>
first session of the 103rd Congress. Expedited rescission <BR>
authority is good public policy that will help restore fiscal <BR>
discipline.<BR>

<P>H.R. 1578, as passed by the House, would expedite consideration of <BR>
rescission proposals and provide a simpler procedure for bringing <BR>
rescission proposals to a vote on the floor of the House of <BR>
Representatives. The procedure set forth in H.R. 1578 would apply <BR>
to Presidential rescission proposals submitted to the Congress <BR>
within three days of signing an appropriation act. If the <BR>
rescission bill is not introduced by the congressional leadership <BR>
within two days of being received, any member may introduce it. <BR>
Once introduced, the bill must be referred to the House Committee <BR>
on Appropriations, which shall report the bill, without <BR>
substantive revision, not later than the seventh day after receipt <BR>
of the proposal from the President. <BR>

<P>If the Appropriations Committee fails to report the bill within <BR>
the sevenday period, the bill shall be automatically discharged <BR>
from the committee and placed on the appropriate calendar for <BR>
floor consideration. A  vote on final passage of the bill must be <BR>
taken in the House of Representatives on or before the close of <BR>
the 10th day after the date of the introduction of the bill in the <BR>
House. If the bill is passed by the House, it must be transmitted <BR>
to the Senate within one calendar day of the day on which it <BR>
passed the House.<BR>

<P>Then, expedited procedures similar to those described for the <BR>
House would apply to consideration of the bill in the Senate.<BR>

<P>Congress would not be allowed to amend the President's rescission <BR>
proposals. Either House, though, could reject the President's <BR>
proposal and could consider an alternative bill under the <BR>
expedited procedures. An alternative bill, however, could only be <BR>
considered under the expedited procedures if it rescinds amounts <BR>
in the same appropriations act covered by the President's proposal <BR>
and in at least the same aggregate amount as the President's <BR>
proposal.<BR>

<P>In remarks on April 27, 1993, President Clinton expressed his <BR>
strong support for the expedited rescission procedures proposed in <BR>
H.R. 1578. In that speech, he noted that the proposal was like a <BR>
&quot;line-item veto,&quot; since the proposal would give the President <BR>
power to cut individual spending items while allowing the rest of <BR>
the bill to go into effect. He went on to explain that under the <BR>
proposal, &quot;these items would be out there by themselves, not <BR>
buried in some big bill, so that when the votes were taken . . . <BR>
they would be taken in view of the press and the public and you <BR>
could draw your own conclusions. . . . It respects the separation <BR>
of powers. It ultimately respects the right of the United States <BR>
Congress to do what the Constitution gives it and not the <BR>
President the power to do. But it makes both of us more <BR>
responsible in how your money is spent.&quot;7<BR>

**************<BR>

<P>The Traditional Budget Process<BR>

<P>The traditional budget process is complex and arcane to most <BR>
people. It involves the simultaneous consideration of policy <BR>
priorities, the resource needs of individual programs, the <BR>
appropriate allocation of resources among the varying functions of <BR>
government, the effect of government outlays or revenue <BR>
collections on the current and prospective condition of the <BR>
national economy, and the statutory or regulatory constraints <BR>
governing federal expenditures or income. Also, with the massive <BR>
increase in the national debt, the budget process has been used to <BR>
reduce budget deficits.<BR>

<P>The traditional budget process is a five-year-plus process with <BR>
three main phases:<BR>

<P>*     Phase 1: Formulation of the President's budget.<BR>

<P>*     Phase 2: Congressional review and action on the federal <BR>
budget.<BR>

<P>*     Phase 3: Agency implementation and management execution of <BR>
enacted budget.<BR>

<P>At any given point in time at least three budgets are in the <BR>
process of being either formulated, reviewed, or implemented. In <BR>
addition, during the formulation and review of any one budget, <BR>
numerous parties in the agencies, at OMB, and in Congress are <BR>
working on the specifics, both jointly and independently. This is <BR>
hardly a linear process. A series of formal and informal <BR>
communications among the agencies, OMB, and congressional staff <BR>
occur as the budget moves forward.<BR>

<P>Phase 1: Formulation of the President's Budget<BR>

<P>Getting a Head Start Without Knowing Where the Finish Line Is. <BR>
Depending on the agency, the formulation of the new President's <BR>
budget begins around February each year 12 months before the <BR>
budget is to be released and 20 months before the beginning of the <BR>
fiscal year to be covered by the budget.1 As an example, some <BR>
bureaus began preparing the fiscal year 1995 President's budget <BR>
around February 1993 less than half way through fiscal year 1993 <BR>
and months before macro level fiscal and policy guidance are <BR>
determined, and before any congressional action has been taken on <BR>
fiscal year 1994 appropriation levels.<BR>

<P>Besides lacking definitive fiscal data at the beginning of the <BR>
process, budget formulation often begins without any specific <BR>
guidance on total budget levels or on presidential priorities. In <BR>
addition, there has often been little guidance about internal <BR>
priorities from the agency head. As noted by one bureau director, <BR>
bureau options are usually based upon &quot;flashes of information&quot; <BR>
regarding administration policies. For the most part, this results <BR>
in bureaus putting together budget requests that discuss the need <BR>
for additional resources. <BR>

<P>What limited presidential guidance is received often comes <BR>
immediately after the annual budget is transmitted to Congress in <BR>
February. On behalf of the President, OMB prepares allowance <BR>
letters for executive branch agencies. The letters formally convey <BR>
the new five-year budget authority and outlay estimates in the <BR>
President's budget as allowances, offer guidance on employment <BR>
levels, and outline specific information requests and other <BR>
instructions related to future agency budget requests.<BR>

<P>Frequently these allowance letters are updated during the spring <BR>
or summer with revised formal planning guidance for the upcoming <BR>
budget cycle. In addition, guidance is normally issued to agencies <BR>
during the summer months in an updated version of OMB Circular <BR>
A11, which &quot;provides detailed instructions and guidance on the <BR>
preparation and submission of agency budget requests and related <BR>
materials.&quot;2 A general OMB letter may accompany the updated <BR>
circular, but no specific discussions are held on policy <BR>
priorities, total budget levels, or agency allocations at this <BR>
time.<BR>

<P>Beginning the Formal Process at the Agency Level. At the agency <BR>
level the formal budget formulation process ordinarily begins in <BR>
March or April of each year with the issuance of a &quot;call memo&quot; <BR>
from the agency level budget office to agency bureaus. Typically, <BR>
agency call memos for the fiscal year 1995 budget would be <BR>
released in March or April of 1993. Usually, the call memo asks <BR>
bureaus to develop a series of budget options for each account <BR>
within their jurisdiction. For example, the call memo may ask for <BR>
two or three levels of budgetary resources for each account. The <BR> 
call memo may ask for the bureau's proposed level, a current <BR>
services level (i.e., last year's level plus inflation), and a <BR>
level 5 percent or more below the estimated current services level <BR>
or below the level in the most recent President's budget (which is <BR>
the only known level at the time the process begins). In recent <BR>
years, the President's budget request was required to appear as <BR>
the middle column of the budget materials prepared by agencies. In <BR>
other words, the materials being prepared for each account in the <BR>
fiscal year 1995 budget show fiscal year 1993 spending levels, the <BR>
President's fiscal year 1994 budget request level (which had not <BR>
yet been acted upon by Congress), and the fiscal year 1995 request <BR>
level. Note that none of these numbers are actuals; they are all <BR>
estimates at this point.<BR>

<P>Internal Agency Review. Normally, bureaus are asked in the agency <BR>
call memo to submit their budget requests to the agency head by a <BR>
specified date in late June or early July. Most agencies conduct a <BR>
hearings process on the bureau budget requests during June, July, <BR>
or August each year. The hearings process allows bureaus to make <BR>
presentations of their requests before agency-level policy and/or <BR>
budget personnel. The hearings process is often the first time <BR>
bureau personnel are informed about agency-level policy <BR>
priorities. At this point, however, neither the bureaus nor the <BR>
agencies have received specific presidential guidance.<BR>

<P>Internal Agency Decision Sessions. Upon completion of the bureau <BR>
budget hearings, agency heads consult with staff offices to decide <BR>
funding requests for each of the accounts within the agency's <BR>
jurisdiction. Since the agency's total funding request usually <BR>
must be kept within a target figure, the agency's policy <BR>
priorities are ultimately revealed through the process of <BR>
determining the requested funding level for each account within <BR>
the agency's jurisdiction. However, since the policy choice must <BR>
be made among programs solely within the agency's jurisdiction, <BR>
the choices are often made between very diverse and unrelated <BR>
activities such as between the farm support and food stamp <BR>
programs of the Department of Agriculture. At this point in the <BR>
budget formulation process, however, there is no mechanism for <BR>
making policy priority decisions on a mission or functional basis <BR>
across agency lines.<BR>

<P>Further, with the exception of the unique process for the <BR>
Department of Defense (DOD), bureau officials and/or OMB budget <BR>
personnel may not be a part of the decision sessions held to <BR>
determine agency request levels. In some cases, the bureau level <BR>
involvement may only be through an appeals process once agency-<BR>
level decisions are made.<BR>

<P>Submitting Estimates to OMB. Historically, agency budget estimates <BR>
have been submitted to OMB on September 1 each year. Between <BR>
September and late November, OMB personnel and sometimes other <BR>
Executive Office of the President personnel review the agency <BR>
estimates. Agency staff are asked to supply data on various topics <BR>
in answer to questions posed by OMB examiners, who are in the <BR>
process of drafting OMB option papers.<BR>

<P>Matching Presidential Policy with Budget Estimates OMB Director's <BR>
Review. After receiving budget estimates from each of the <BR>
agencies, OMB has traditionally held a series of director's review <BR>
meetings, in part based on the option papers drafted by OMB <BR>
examiners. These meetings constitute the first point in the <BR>
current process formally designated for discussion of <BR>
administration policy priorities across agency lines. These <BR>
meetings also constitute the point in the process when decisions <BR>
are made on total budget levels, including revenue estimates and <BR>
deficit reduction goals.<BR>

<P>Unfortunately, agency heads or their designees are usually not <BR>
involved in any of the boundary spanning issue discussions that <BR>
may be held or in the discussions concerning total budget levels. <BR>
Moreover, agency personnel usually have not seen or been told <BR>
anything about the OMB option papers used in the director's review <BR>
process. Agencies are already locked into their budget decisions <BR>
by their submissions to OMB.<BR>

<P>Communicating the President's Guidance. The OMB review of agency <BR>
estimates ordinarily finishes in late November or early December. <BR>
At that point, agency heads are called to a &quot;passback&quot; session to <BR>
receive the decisions reached at through the OMB review process. <BR>
The passback session with agency heads is often the first time <BR>
agency heads are formally advised of the President's specific <BR>
policy priorities and the funding level within which the agency <BR>
budget must be developed. Also, it may be the first time they are <BR>
given information on issues that have been raised by OMB <BR>
examiners, issues that cross agency lines, or issues related to <BR>
total budget levels.<BR>

<P>Decision making by Default the Appeals Process. Traditionally, the <BR>
agency head is given 72 hours after receipt of the passback <BR>
materials to file an appeal to OMB on the passback <BR>
recommendations. Given the short turn around, program manager <BR>
involvement in the appeals process may be severely limited or <BR>
nonexistent. As a result, the appeals made by agencies often lack <BR>
staff analysis, and issues of importance to program management are <BR>
not taken into consideration. This lack of adequate response time <BR>
is the root of much frustration expressed with regard to the <BR>
current appeals process a process that seems to foster decision by <BR>
default, rather than decision based on analysis.<BR>

<P>Appeals Filed with the OMB Director. In some cases, though, the <BR>
issue may be raised to the President for decision. The appeals <BR>
process may last through several weeks in December as negotiations <BR>
take place between agency, OMB, and other presidential policy <BR>
personnel. In fact, the appeals process is usually stopped only at <BR>
the point where no time is left to enter figures into the budget <BR>
system database prior to the printing of the President's budget.<BR>

<P>Presentation of the President's Budget. The President is required <BR>
by law to submit the fiscal year 1995 budget to Congress no later <BR>
than the first Monday in February 1994.3 Traditionally, the <BR>
President's budget is released shortly after the State of the <BR>
Union address to Congress. Besides the physical submission of the <BR>
budget documents to Congress, each agency usually holds a press <BR>
conference, briefs congressional staff, and issues materials to <BR>
explain the agency's portions of the budget to the public and to <BR>
justify estimates to the Congress.<BR>

<P>Phase 2: Congressional Review and Enactment<BR>

<P>Reaching Agreement in Congress. Congress begins its budget cycle <BR>
after submission of the President's budget. The first step to be <BR>
completed by May 15 each year is the drafting of a Concurrent <BR>
Budget Resolution by the House and Senate budget Committees on the <BR>
basis of estimates submitted from each authorizing committee, <BR>
consideration of congressional priorities, and consideration of <BR>
the proposals in the President's budget submission. The Concurrent <BR>
Budget Resolution sets the broad outlines of fiscal policy with <BR>
regard to national needs, including both spending and taxation. It <BR>
sets targets for total receipts and for budget authority and <BR>
outlays, in total and by functional category, without regard to <BR>
agency or congressional committee jurisdiction. <BR>

<P>Once adopted, the Concurrent Budget Resolution reflects agreed <BR>
upon aggregate funding levels by defined functional categories in <BR>
the federal budget. (Appendix D lists the functions and <BR>
subfunctions used in the federal budget.) A report accompanying <BR>
the budget resolution provides guidance on the assumptions made to <BR>
arrive at the functional totals, but neither the report language <BR>
nor the functional totals are binding on other committees. Only <BR>
the total discretionary spending caps and the pay-as-you-go <BR>
(PAYGO) provisions are binding limitations. The Concurrent Budget <BR>
Resolution is not enacted as a law and does not require <BR>
Presidential approval.<BR>

<P>Congressional Hearings. During the debate over the Concurrent <BR>
Budget Resolution, the appropriations subcommittees are also <BR>
holding hearings on the President's budget submission. Each agency <BR>
head and bureau head testifies before the committees on the <BR>
contents of the budget submission. The extensiveness of the <BR>
questions vary greatly, but budget offices spend a good deal of <BR>
time preparing administrators for the hearings.<BR>

<P>Appropriating and Authorizing Spending. After passage of the <BR>
Concurrent Budget Resolution, authorizing and appropriations <BR>
committees begin drafting legislation to meet the budget <BR>
resolution targets for the upcoming fiscal year. Authorizing <BR>
committees work on legislation that will increase or decrease <BR>
spending from entitlement programs or increase or decrease <BR>
receipts from user fees. For example, a change in eligibility <BR>
criteria for the Food Stamp or Medicaid programs will increase or <BR>
decrease the spending for these programs. Similarly, a change in <BR>
the requirements concerning meat and poultry inspection could <BR>
increase or decrease user fee receipts.<BR>

<P>The appropriations committees must keep discretionary spending <BR>
within the Budget Enforcement Act discretionary spending cap. <BR>
Spending targets for the various appropriations subcommittees are <BR>
devolved under an allocation process. Appropriation bills must be <BR>
signed by the President by October 1 for most federal agencies to <BR>
have funds to continue operations. When appropriation action <BR>
cannot be completed by October 1, a continuing resolution is <BR>
passed, permitting a continuation of agencies' operations at some <BR>
stipulated rate.<BR>

<P>A sequestration process is triggered if discretionary spending <BR>
caps are exceeded, if new mandatory spending resulting from an act <BR>
of Congress is not offset by spending reductions or revenue <BR>
increases, or if a maximum deficit amount is exceeded. <BR>
Sequestration is the mandatory reduction of appropriation levels <BR>
and direct spending in nonexempt accounts. OMB is the final <BR>
arbiter in determining if sequestration is to be invoked.<BR>

<P>Phase 3: Budget Execution Process<BR>

<P>Managing and spending of resources the actual budget execution <BR>
occurs throughout the fiscal year and (especially with multi-year <BR>
appropriations) beyond. It may involve budget amendments, <BR>
rescissions, deferrals, or supplemental, if necessary, to reflect <BR>
changing priorities and requirements. It includes close-out of <BR>
appropriations, including contracts and other obligations. For <BR>
fiscal year 1995, the bulk of budget execution will occur between <BR>
October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995. Outlays from obligation <BR>
authority made available with fiscal year 1995 appropriations will <BR>
take place over several subsequent years.<BR>

<P>Most funds made available to federal agencies are subject to the <BR>
apportionment process established by the Anti-deficiency Act and <BR>
delegated by the President to OMB. The primary purpose of the <BR>
apportionment process is to ensure that resources are available <BR>
throughout the fiscal year so as to avoid overspending of an <BR>
appropriation that would force Congress to pass a supplemental <BR>
appropriation. OMB sometimes apportions by time periods (e.g., <BR>
quarter of the fiscal year) and sometimes by activities or object <BR>
classes. Agencies may request that an account be reapportioned <BR>
during the year to accommodate changing circumstances.<BR>

<P>Most agencies develop a financial operating plan as soon as <BR>
appropriation levels are known. The financial operating plan sets <BR>
the various appropriations committee and OMB apportionment funding <BR>
limitations into the financial management control system of the <BR>
agency and includes allotments for the agency's organizational <BR>
elements and programs, projects, and activities, as defined by <BR>
congressional action.<BR>

<P>In addition to prohibitions on overspending, government officials <BR>
cannot impound (i.e., not spend) appropriated funds. If funds are <BR>
not needed, the President may propose rescissions (in essence, <BR>
negative appropriations) or deferrals (postponed spending) within <BR>
certain guidelines established by Congress. Funds must be spent on <BR>
the programs, projects, and activities for which they were <BR>
appropriated unless a transfer of funds has been approved or <BR>
Congress is notified of and consents to a reprogramming. <BR>
Supplemental funding requests may be submitted to Congress at any <BR>
time during the year, but under the Budget Enforcement Act must be <BR>
offset as necessary to ensure that spending is under the Act's <BR>
caps, unless the President declares an emergency.<BR>

<P>Most agencies do periodic reviews of year-to-date progress against <BR>
their financial operating plans, make adjustments within <BR>
reprogramming thresholds, and identify issues requiring <BR>
reprogramming or supplemental action. These reviews usually occur <BR>
more frequently late in the fiscal year when management decisions <BR>
are needed to ensure that spending targets are met (e.g., whether <BR>
contracts can be awarded by the end of the fiscal year, whether <BR>
grants will be awarded, etc.). Close-out of appropriations is also <BR>
required after the end of the fiscal year to ensure that <BR>
obligations are liquidated.<BR>

<H1><B>Executive</B></H1>
<P>
<H1><B>Summary</B></H1>
<P>What happens when a major corporation, headquartered in the Washington area, wants to buy supplies or other items? For a small purchase one under $25,000&quot;it needs about four days to process the request with its purchasing office and select a vendor. For purchases of about $100,000, it needs from one to four weeks, with the average being two weeks.1 The company is not encumbered by myriad regulations with minute details on how it should proceed.<BR>

<P>What happens, though, when the area's biggest employer, the federal government, tries to buy something? Even for relatively small and simple items, the process is time-consuming. While small purchases require less than a month under simplified procedures, larger purchases need much more time. Even simple procurements under $100,000 require at least three months, and individual contracts often take much longer. Excessive bureaucracy and the inability to do smart buying result in high administrative costs that, in turn, adversely affect the timeliness, quality, and price of purchased items. Additional effects include stifled innovation, lower mission performance, and missed chances for lowering total life-cycle costs.<BR>
Does the System Work? To be sure, much of the federal procurement system works reasonably well in terms of fairness and equity. Given the relatively huge volumes of activity and money involved, corruption is remarkably rare and federal contractors contribute much in value. Nevertheless, vendors, government managers, procurement professionals, oversight agencies, the press, and the public are frustrated with the system.2 The administrative costs are enormous&quot;over $7 billion in salaries and benefits alone&quot;and the time needed to acquire goods and services is excessive. Studies&quot;and tales like the one about the Washington area company&quot;show that the administrative costs of supplying the government far exceed comparable costs for private organizations.3<BR>

<P>Not infrequently, for instance, a request for proposal on an information technology (IT) procurement of equipment and software that's sold widely in the commercial market will run hundreds of pages; the proposals themselves run thousands of pages. The time required to complete such an acquisition often exceeds the market life of the technology being acquired4&quot;about 49 months for the federal government, as opposed to 13 for the private sector.5 Private sector documents, meanwhile, are much shorter and less costly to prepare.<BR>

<P>Overall, the federal government buys a huge amount of goods and services from private vendors. Recent annual expenditures are over $200 billion, about 15 percent of the federal budget&quot;that is, $800 per American every year or, for the nation, about $28,000 every working second of every working day. If implemented, the National Performance Review's (NPR's) recommendations for reinventing federal procurement will save an estimated $22.5 billion from fiscal 1995 to 1999. <BR>

<P>NPR recommendations will affect federal costs in two ways. They will reduce administrative costs by reducing personnel and personnel-related expenses, and they will reduce the burdens on vendors doing business with government, thereby resulting in lower costs for the goods and services the government purchases.<BR>

<P>These estimates reflect $40 billion in savings less $17.5 billion related to personnel reductions that are reflected in the NPR Accompanying Report <I>Transforming Organizational Structures</I>. Estimates are problematic, however, because the changes involve the entire procurement culture and system and thousands of federal and business organizations and people. In addition, procurement spending levels in future years cannot accurately be predicted. If spending falls significantly below existing levels, the potential dollars saved could drop as well.<BR>

<P>Think Big, Act Small. The stakes are huge, for the government and the nation. Over the past several decades, a revolutionary managerial reform movement has been building momentum in the public and private sectors, showing no sign of abating. The &quot;new wave&quot; seeks to de-bureaucratize bureaucracies, believing we must think big and act small in order to survive in an increasingly global competitive marketplace. The federal procurement bureaucracy's excessive rules and regulations clearly place a heavy burden on the government's successful delivery of services and on the ability of U.S. companies to stay competitive. Arcane and out-of-date bureaucratic rules seem an end in themselves, not merely a means to an end. The result is forcing governmental attention inward, stifling innovation and choking off responsiveness to customers.<BR>

<P>In the private sector, procurement has risen from a back-office, low-level concern to an increasingly strategic corporate one. Today, few companies are &quot;vertically integrated&quot;i.e., making everything they use. Corporate survival depends on &quot;focus<I>,&quot;</I> where corporations own only those resources that give them a competitive advantage in the market. For everything else, they buy (or &quot;outsource&quot;) from suppliers (increasingly viewed as strategic partners). In a world of focus and outsourcing, procurement systems indeed become strategic.<BR>

<P>Evolution of the Existing Procurement System. History helps to explain our current system. When John Augustus Roebling built the Brooklyn Bridge, popular legend tells us that he designed it to endure stress levels more than 20 times the expected daily levels. Why? Because New York City procurement systems were supposedly so corrupt, Roebling feared that materials normally ordered for such construction would fall short of critical standards. Admittedly, federal procurement systems have never suffered the same corruption as those in patronage-plagued, late-19th-century New York City. But even today, the assumption underlying many federal procurement regulations, laws, and policies is similar to the one Roebling held about New York Citythat everyone is trying to cheat the government and, thus, every possible circumstance must be controlled.<BR>

<P>In the early 20th century's Progressive Movement, reformers used bureaucratic tools to control the worst excesses of then-prevalent political machines. Bureaucratic regulation relied on central budgeting offices, personnel offices with civil service protection for government employees, and procurement procedures to ensure relative efficiency and fairness in purchasing. In later years, the government enacted many bureaucratic reforms that were so successful, the private sector adopted them widely. Today's federal procurement system still has its roots in Progressive Era reforms.<BR>

<P>The system is based on openness and competition, the primary guarantees of integrity, equity, and efficiency. To ensure that procurements are open and objective, the government has limited the discretion of its public officials. In the Defense Depart-ment, at least 889 laws affect procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is 1,600 pages, supplemented by another 2,900 pages of agency-specific procurement regulations. These thousands of pages, along with thousands more of additional agency instructions and case law involving protests, contrast sharply with the Australian government's 93 pages of regulations in 13 separate, easy-to-read guidebooks on procurement.6<BR>

<P>Australia reinvented its procurement system on the belief that freeing good people to make smart business decisions will generate huge administrative and contract cost savings. Officials believe it has worked exceptionally well. Our system of excessive laws, regulations, and overseers is premised on a very different assumptionthat, if given discretion, line managers and procurement employees will cheat and act with poor judgment with taxpayer money. The concept of letting managers get value for money, make smart business decisions, and be accountable for results remains foreign to our government. <BR>

<P>Problems with the Existing System. Our increasingly complex and bureaucratic procurement rules have given us a larger, but less productive, procurement workforce. The core procurement workforce employed across the government grew from 42,000 in 1980 to 67,000 in 1992, while average productivity per contract specialist fell from $9.4 million in 1980 (in 1992 dollars) to only $6.3 million in contract costs in 1992.7 In fact, the core workforce and related functions (i.e., people working in supply depots and other logistics functions) equals 142,000 about 6 percent of the total federal workforce!<BR>

<P>Generally, federal procurement policies stress prior specification of needs, competitive bidding, and accountability through external review and appeals. While procurement personnel do not always automatically choose the low-cost bidder, they face strong pressure to be as objective (and defensible) as possible in selecting vendors who aren't the lowest bidders. The system ensures objectivity by restricting the evaluation to criteria mandated by the agency's mission and published in advance; by limiting the information used for evaluation to that submitted by proposing vendors (lest government exercise bias in selecting information); and, typically, by placing a heavy emphasis on costs. Many line managers and procurement professionals believe the system is designed to protect marginal players in the procurement process and not allow for good management practices, like rewarding contractors who have records of excellence. Over the years, and often in response to an isolated, non-systemic scandal, the government has imposed further controls to restrain employee discretion.<BR>

<P>Nowhere is the system's failure more glaringly apparent in not meeting its customers' needs for timely product delivery, at reasonable prices, and with little red tape, than in purchasing IT products. &quot;What takes one year for the private sector to do, we're taking four to five years to do, and the half-life of this stuff is about a year,&quot; said former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg, Jr. &quot;It's a process designed to fail.&quot;8 Angry customers or Members of Congress have lambasted nearly every agency contracting official for taking months or years to deliver obsolete computer products that were available, at a cheaper price, at a nearby store or from a catalog. To buy a personal computer through her agency's procurement process, one employee complained that she needed 23 signatures. &quot;Government is the largest purchaser of information technology products,&quot; said John Sculley, Apple Computer's former CEO, &quot;and yet it is paying the highest prices and buying the oldest technology.&quot;9<BR>

<P>High administrative costs might be justified if they produced superior results, such as lower product costs, better quality, or some other desired effect (minority employment, local job development, environmental protection, etc.). But do they? According to surveys of public and private managers and vendors:<BR>
	<BR>
*	public managers are far less happy <BR>
than private managers with their <BR>
vendors;<BR>

<P>	*	vendors often work harder for private clients than public clients (because government procurement so restricts the use of past performance in awarding contracts, vendors can &quot;game&quot; the contract i.e., exploit the rules for short-term profits rather than build long-term relationships);10 and<BR>

<P>	*	more vendors, particularly in the technology area, refuse to do business with the government, or they create separate organizations/distribution channels to deal with it. In this way, they insulate the commercial part of the company from the onerous federal requirements and disclosures and develop specialized people to deal with the maze of regulations, policies, and procedures.<BR>

<P>The government often does not even have access to some of the best, least expensive products. Companies have voluntarily removed themselves from the procurement process, or the government only gets access through specialized people and organizations that, in and of themselves, create more expensive, less flexible channels. In the case of the IBM Federal Systems Company, for instance, the government does not get to buy from the same IBM that deals with other commercial purchasing activities like those of Ford Motor Company or K-Mart.<BR>

<P>Perhaps procurement's major problem is its hidden cost in hindering innovation and excellence. Globally, with private and public organizations undergoing major upheavals and restructuring, innovation is becoming key to survival. Outsourcing and electronic commerce are emerging as strategic issues. In this context, federal practices seem excessively bureaucratic and obsolete. In private contracting, a major study concluded, organizations look for reliable suppliers of quality goods at reasonable prices. But in public contracting, regulations designed to avoid political favoritism insist on a compart-mentalized bidding process that most companies would find ludicrous. Only rarely can the government consider, let alone reward, a contractor's successful past performance when assessing competitive bids for government work. The result: a system that too often delivers goods too late, at too high a price, and too inadequate to do the job. Not surprisingly, public sector buyers are far more frequently dissatisfied than their private sector counterparts with the performance of their vendors.11<BR>

<P>A<B> </B>reinvention agenda.  This report presents a comprehensive agenda for fundamental procurement reform. In some cases, the solutions require legislation. But most importantly, they require a new direction and model for organizational control one that depends on empowered employees held accountable primarily for external results, not internal rules. Empowered employees should be freed from excessive laws, all accompanying regulations, and internal agency barriers that stifle innovative customer service. The federal procurement system needs to be recognized as an administrative process that balances the costs of the system to taxpayers and vendors, the line manager's needs, and the nation's socioeconomic goals. The law's main role should be to set public policy goals and sensibly protect the system against fraud.<BR>

<P>A procurement system must have more customer service and less bureaucracy, and be based primarily on getting value for money. Federal line managers need responsive, efficient, and innovative procurement services delivered by procurement officers with whom they can develop a tested, long-term relationship. Together, line managers and procurement officers must shift from procurement focusing on regulation for the sake of regulation to a system balancing value, price, and fairness to produce a truly cost-effective system.<BR>

<P>To create such a system, NPR's recommendations for procurement are based on the following five major themes, which should remain the focus for continuing change even after each process-oriented recommendation is completed.<BR>

<P>1. Move from Rigid Rules to Guiding Principles. Corporations and other governments have reduced detailed controls, replacing them with broad guidelines and accountability for results. As we have said, Australia's new procurement regulations cover only 93 pages. Similarly, the federal government needs to revamp its procure-ment policy framework and legitimize the shift from rules to guiding principles. Along with giving broader discretion to front-line managers, the government should build a more professional workforce and encourage innovation. Such changes will encourage procurement officers and line managers to be accountable to their customers.<BR>

<P>2. Get Bureaucracy Out of the Way. The government should reduce unneeded burdens and bureaucratic procedures along with adding guiding principles and accountability for results. For federal procurement, NPR recommends a new simplified acquisition threshold that also simplifies procurements from small businesses and small disadvantaged business firms, streamlines labor provisions, and reforms elements of IT procurements.<BR>

<P>3. Give Line Managers More Authority and Accountability. The procurement professional should work with, not against, the line manager. Managers should be able to acquire needed tools without going through a procurement office. Thus, line managers should be allowed to expand their use of commercially available purchase cards for relatively small-dollar items. Procurement should focus more on understanding the customer's needs and identifying the best way to satisfy them. With these changes, the effectiveness of procurement organizations can then be measured on results (with input from the customer), as well as compliance with rules. Authority and accountability also would be clarified by revising ethics laws to make them comprehensible and strength-ening their impact, while simultaneously preventing them from stifling essential communications between vendors and the government.<BR>

<P>4. Give Line Managers Expanded Access to Competitive Sources of Supply. The federal, state, and local governments should be allowed to cooperate in procurement actions. Federal customers should also be able to use whichever procurement office can provide the best service.<BR>

<P>5. Foster Competition, Commercial Practices, and Excellence in Vendor Performance. In general, the nation could reap many benefits by moving federal procurement practices closer to the private sector's best commercial practices. Elements include the increased use of standard commercially available products, expanded use of electronic data interchange and electronic commerce, more emphasis on excellence in vendor performance, and greater reliance on best value (not just least cost) procurements.<BR>

<P>The federal government can create a system that works based on these themes. The reinvented procurement system will be much like modern commercial procurement systems, but also will ensure fairness and the other social values and goals uniquely important to public procurements.<BR>

<P>Although the recommended reforms will produce immediate and appreciable improvements, they are just the start of a procurement reform process, not its end. Long-term success will require continued cooperation and support from all stake-holders: Congress, the procurement community, agency line managers, vendors, and most importantly the public. These recommendations should not be viewed on an individual basis; each is not a significant change in and of itself. They must be seen as part of a comprehensive view of reforms necessary to produce an efficient and economic procurement system that serves the line manager, taxpayers, and strategic partners (vendors), and accomplishes other societal goals in a well-balanced manner. This report builds a foundation for this fundamental reform.<BR>

<H1><B>Move to Guiding Principles from Rigid Rules</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<P>In procurement, as in other areas of human endeavor, controls, guidance, and rules are needed. &quot;No rules&quot; is a mistake. But so are rules that are too many and too rigid. Adequate guidance to federal procurement officials should not require the 1,600 pages of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and another 2,900 pages of agency-specific supplements. With the heads of procurement offices buried under an avalanche of regulations and thousands of overseers watching closely for violations of these rigid rules how can procurement offices be expected to pay much attention to their end-result effects on line agency service delivery?<BR>

<P>Consequently, the federal procurement policy framework needs to shift to broad guidance in order to encourage both procurement officers and line managers to get closer to the customers, better understand their needs, and produce accordingly. Corporations and other governments have learned to reduce detailed controls and successfully replace them with broad guidelines and clear accountability for results. So can the federal government.<BR>

<P>Private sector suppliers also need to be treated as partners to be trusted and valued for their integrity rather than only as potential sources of collusion and other forms of waste, fraud, and abuse.<BR>

<P>Some specific actions for shifting federal procurement from rigid rules to guiding principles are to:<BR>
	<BR>
*	reframe acquisition policy at all levels (e.g., Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council);<BR>

<P>	*	improve the education, training, and skills of federal procurement officials; and<BR>

<P>	*	encourage more procurement innovation by authorizing waivers from laws on a test basis.<BR>
The background, need, and details of each of these actions is presented in this section.<BR>

<P>
<H2>PROC01:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Reframe Acquisition Policy </B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Congress directed that the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), within the Office of Management and Budget, be responsible for providing overall direction of procurement policy and leadership in the development of procurement systems of federal agencies.1 <BR>

<P>In meeting these responsibilities, the Administrator issues policy letters that are incorporated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR is a massive document exceeding 1,600 pages. In addition to the FAR, the regulatory system includes supplements by federal agencies totaling an additional 2,900 pages, almost twice as large as the FAR.<BR>
As described in the basic OFPP legislation, Congress intended the FAR to:<BR>

<P>	*	provide federal procurement officials with a set of uniform, governmentwide acquisition policies, regulations, pro-cedures, contract clauses, and forms;<BR>

<P>	*	be well-written, easy to read, and logically organized;<BR>

<P>	*	reduce excessive paperwork;<BR>

<P>	*	ease doing business with the federal government;<BR>

<P>	*	facilitate agency, industry, and public participation in the process of developing and maintaining the FAR and its supplements;<BR>

<P>	*	limit individual agency regulations to those that are essential to implement-ing governmentwide policies and procedures within the agency; and<BR>

<P>	*	represent policies and procedures required to satisfy the agency's unique needs.<BR>

<P>The FAR is issued and maintained jointly by the Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration (NASA), known as the regulatory agencies.2 The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FARC) is composed of the regulatory agencies and OFPP to direct and coordinate governmentwide procure-ment policy and procurement regulatory activities.3 The regulations are developed by two sub-councils the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC), chaired by GSA and composed of representatives of 12 other civilian agencies, and the Defense Acquisition Regulation Council (DARC), chaired by DOD and composed of DOD and NASA representatives.4<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>	The FAR is complex and prescriptive. This complexity and specificity primarily results from hundreds of process-oriented legislative requirements affecting the acquisition process, as well as additional administrative requirements imposed by executive branch regulators. Fundamental reform of the acquisition system requires basic changes in the statutory underpinnings and cumulative administrative burdens.<BR>

<P>The Section 800 Panel. The Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law (Section 800 Panel) recognized in its recent report to Congress that the FAR system has grown increasingly complex due to requirements mandated by statute.5 The panel identified 889 provisions of law related to DOD acquisition. Many of these are also applicable to civilian agencies. The acquisition system is burdened with so many diverse statutory requirements and competing goals that the procurement system's efficiency has been significantly reduced. <BR>

<P>The MSPB Survey.  A survey conducted by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) indicates that line managers widely believe that there are too many procurement regulations that are changed too often and are so process-oriented that they minimize contracting officer discretion and stifle innovation.6 When asked in a follow-up survey whether they felt the procurement process appropriately balances the use of public funds with the material needs and requirements of customers, only 26 percent of the line managers surveyed agreed. The survey comments indicate that there are numerous other objectives that receive priority over the line managers. One manager expressed confusion over the ultimate objective of the entire procurement process by stating, &quot;The FAR system does not make it clear what the principal goal of the federal procurement system is. Is it to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse? Is it to implement a social economic agenda? Is it to procure the government's requirements at a fair and reasonable cost?&quot; To be sure, the FAR itself does not state its principal goal.<BR>

<P>The CSIS Study.  A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that government procurement laws and regulations add cost without value, impede government access to commercial state-of-the-art technology, and adversely affect U.S. competitiveness by fracturing the nation's high-technology enterprise. The CSIS study finds that companies alter their standard business procedures when the federal government is the customer, leading to higher prices for the government.7 From industry's perspective, policymakers do not allow industry to participate in the development of policy and regulations early enough in the process to have meaningful input.<BR>

<P>The GSA Survey.  Efforts have been undertaken to reform the system. In 1990, GSA initiated a survey of FAR users to obtain feedback on the document and how it could be improved. Over 2,400 responses were received. Ninety-five percent of respondents suggested one or more ways in which the FAR could be improved. The most common suggestions are to provide greater flexibility for exercising business judgment, consult users in developing regulations, and provide more guidance but less regulation. Based on survey results and additional input from focus groups of government and industry users, a report and recommendations were developed. The FARC also approved a FAR Improvement Project Report and established 19 implementation projects scheduled for completion by 1995.8 Although these changes will help, they do not involve fundamental reform.<BR>

<P>Examples of Success.  In October 1988, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) issued a new procurement manual containing innovative procurement regulations. This was made possible by the relatively permissive statute for USPS procurement.9 These regulations incorporated the best of federal and commercial purchasing policies and practices to ensure fairness to offerors and contractors. These regulations permitted more efficient contracting with greater discretion to use good business judgment to obtain the best possible deal for the USPS.<BR>

<P>Efforts to reform national procurement systems have also succeeded in other countries. An example is Australia, which several years ago transformed its procure-ment regulations into a set of guiding principles. Australia's equivalent of the FAR is contained in 13 pamphlets totaling 93 pages. These pamphlets state the goals of the procurement system and general operating principles for government officials on all aspects of procurement such as competition, getting best value for the government, specification development, and ethics. They are graphically attractive, written in plain English to maximize understanding by government employees and contractors, and leave no doubts as to expected results.<BR>

<P>The other examples cited above reflect simplified procurement policies, rules, and regulations without adversely affecting product quality and costs, system integrity, or public policy goals that the federal government should emulate. The federal government needs to reclaim its procurement policy framework to recognize it as an administrative process governed by clear and simply stated guiding principles while holding line managers and procurement professionals accountable for results.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Convert the Federal Acquisition Regulation from rigid rules to guiding principles. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By July 1994, the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the FAR Council, agency procurement professionals, line managers, and industry, should develop a plan that includes goals, resources, and milestones to:<BR>

<P>	*	rewrite the FAR and its supplements to move it from a system of rigid rules to guiding principles. <BR>

<P>	*	promote decisionmaking at the lowest level possible;<BR>

<P>	*	eliminate unnecessary regulatory requirements;<BR>

<P>	*	facilitate innovative contracting;<BR>

<P>	*	recommend acquisition methods that reflect the short technological life cycle of information technology (IT) and the need to put up-to-date IT tools in the hands of IT and line managers;<BR>

<P>	*	determine the most effective administrative structure for setting governmentwide policy through guidelines in a timely manner; and<BR>

<P>	*	develop a process for obtaining input from those affected by procurement policies.<BR>
The plan should be submitted to the chair of the President's Management Council.<BR>

<P><B>2. Implement the procurement reform plan. (2)</B><BR>

<P>Upon completion and approval of the plan, the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), should facilitate implementation of the recommendations. This should include issuing policy letters and tasking the FARC and other affected parties with revising appropriate documents. Agency procurement executives should also implement recommendations and take appropriate action to reduce internal regulations that supplement the FAR.<BR>

<P>Although full implementation may require statutory changes, non-statutory solutions should be aggressively pursued.<BR>

<P>The OMB Director should report periodically to the President's Management Council on the status of implementing the recommendations.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Background </B></H3>
<P>No matter how good a policy may be on paper, it will not be effective without well-motivated, competent people to implement it. Finding, training, and retaining these people will allow the federal government to move the procurement culture from one of doggedly following rules and procedures to one that encourages the use of more discretion through guiding principles. By law, the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), can foster and promote professionalism of the governmentwide procurement workforce through the Federal Acquisition Institute located in the General Services Administration (GSA).1<BR>

<P>The core procurement workforce of general business, purchasing, and contracting personnel has increased by 25,000 since 1980, from 42,000 in that year to 67,000 in 1992. While the procurement workforce has grown, average governmentwide productivity has declined. Contract expenditures per contract specialist were $9.4 million in 1980 (in 1992 dollars), but only $6.3 million in 1992. This is only an approximate measure of performance. However, it is indicative of an increasingly complex procurement process. The core procurement workforce is only a small proportion of the total of 142,000 that also includes people working in supply depots and other logistics functions. The total procurement workforce exceeds 6 percent of the total federal workforce!2<BR>

<P>It is important to consider both the quantity and quality of the procurement workforce. Following are highlights from more than a decade of data on federal contract specialists.3<BR>

<P>	*	Roughly two-thirds of all hires for the contracting profession have come from internal placement or promotion of personnel from clerical, technical, and other such fields. By comparison, few have been recruited from sources external to the government (e.g., recent college graduates).<BR>

<P>	*	Throughout the 1980's, 10 percent of the contract specialists on average left the profession every year. In the 1990's, however, turnover slowed to a loss rate of just 7 percent.<BR>

<P>	*	Because of the relatively high past turnover of 10 percent and the large net growth in the profession, a number of contract specialists are relatively inexperienced. As of September 1992, 47 percent of the contracting workforce had less than seven years of experience in their jobs.<BR>

<P>	*	Only 53 percent of the contract specialists have graduated from a college or university with a bachelor's or post-graduate degree. Sixty percent of these college graduates majored in business, law, or public administration.<BR>

<P>Given this data, the long-term challenge facing procurement executives is to take the large number of relatively inexperienced personnel and equip them with the professional skills and knowledge necessary to act competently as agents for the government in their contractual dealings with the private sector.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>	Improving the procurement process requires improving the workforce. One of the consequences of a procurement system dominated by rigid rules versus guidelines is that most procurement people are experts in contracting that is, <I>process</I> instead of <I>buying, </I>which connotes market and product expertise. The change in overall policy from rigid rules to guidelines from centralized to decentralized authority will require a major shift in the procurement skills mix. A better trained, more capable workforce will give improved support to line managers. Steps must therefore be taken to authorize a comprehensive, governmentwide program of procurement workforce improvement to identify, develop, and retain high-quality personnel. This program is needed to meet the staffing requirements in procurement organizations, encourage employees who desire a procurement career to develop their decisionmaking and customer service skills and abilities, and stimulate employees to engage in self-development activities.<BR>

<P>The performance of the procurement workforce continues to be questioned. A recent Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) report concludes that while the quality of the workforce is generally good, it is not keeping pace with the demands placed upon it by an increasingly complex procurement process. The report notes that supervisors believe employees need to innovate more. Finally, the MSPB report recommends that procurement officials receive additional training to ensure that they are fully competent.4<BR>

<P>The Secretary of Defense was recently given authority by Congress to specially manage the defense acquisition workforce.5 Included in this legislation were specific criteria for ensuring a standard of education and experience for people entering the contracting field as well as other acquisition occupations. Highly qualified procurement personnel are needed in civilian agencies, as well as in defense agencies. In the words of a General Accounting Office study of contract administration in civilian agencies, &quot;The contracting deficiencies that we identified generally resulted from people failing to properly carry out their responsibilities, rather than from a need for additional rules and regulations governing what should be done when writing or administering contracts.&quot;6<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions </B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1.	Establish an interagency program to improve the federal government's procurement workforce. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By December 1993, the Administrator, General Services Administration, should develop a three-year resource plan for the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) program consistent with governmentwide procurement workforce objectives established by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).<BR>

<P>By March 1994, the Administrator, OFPP, should establish an interagency Council on Procurement Professionalism to coordinate and recommend policy guidance on career management programs, including training facilities for all agencies. The council should be supported in its policy making by the FAI and the Defense Acquisition University. Steps similar to those taken to enhance the procurement workforce in DOD should be taken in all federal agencies so that a comprehensive acquisition workforce improvement effort can be implemented.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Provide civilian agencies with authority similar to DOD's for improving the acquisition workforce. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to amend the OFPP Act to give executive branch agencies necessary additional authority to improve their procurement workforces similar to that provided to the Secretary of Defense. Examples of authorities needed for all procurement agencies include special authorities for:<BR>
*	authorizing agency heads to require satisfactory completion of mandatory training as a prerequisite for promotion to a higher level position;7<BR>
*	an acquisition corps;8 and<BR>
*	other programs to enable improved training, tuition reimbursement, and an acquisition university with special faculty arrangements.9<BR>

<H1><B>More Procurement Innovation</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>A Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) study of the contracting workforce found that the ability to innovate was needed but not being developed by supervisors.1 There is no effective organized means for promoting innovation among agencies, even though many federal agencies are doing business in different ways. For example, agencies are using new automation techniques and procuring goods and services using different methods. In addition, many state, local, and foreign governments and commercial enterprises are testing new contracting concepts. It is likely that the majority of federal government contracting professionals are not even aware of the innovations taking place in corporations and in governments like those of Australia and Texas. The federal government, however, benefits when contracting officials learn new ways of doing business and profit from the lessons learned by others. This knowledge also spurs agencies to improve cumbersome processes. At present, there are legal limits on procurement innovations since, to test a new idea, waivers of existing laws may be required.<BR>

<P>The Office of Personnel Management has authority under its statute to conduct demonstration programs and waive personnel laws on a test basis after notification to Congress.2 Similarly, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI), located in the General Services Administration (GSA) but under the policy direction of OFPP, to promote and coordinate governmentwide research and studies to improve the procurement process and the laws, policies, methods, regulations, procedures, and forms relating to procure-ment by the executive agencies.3 However, FAI has insufficient resources to  do so.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>	Currently, the procurement system's many control mechanisms discourage innovation. Good ideas are often squashed by any or all of these mechanisms or by the procurement culture itself. The procurement culture includes the system of policymakers and overseers who create and monitor the procurement system. Many of these individuals, not feeling the negative impact of the system of rigid rules, believe no changes are necessary. Thus, they create a climate and a correspondingly cumbersome process where requests for deviations from laws or rules are often viewed suspiciously. These requests are often viewed as attacks on an efficient system they value or simply as self-serving requests to cut corners and, thereby, sacrifice a noble objective of the system. Given the internal hurdles to overcome in terms of the layers of reviews and the usual reaction to requests to try something different, many line managers and contracting officers simply say, why bother? Furthermore, one of the larger barriers to the pursuit of new ideas is the burdensome process of going to Congress to get its approval for waiving applicable laws for pilot tests. Congress has given OFPP authority to request such waivers in P.L. 98-191. However, because the request process is so difficult, it has not been possible to start meaningful pilot tests.<BR>

<P>An effective test program, which includes the authority to waive laws for purposes of tests, is essential to promote innovation in federal procurement. Pilot tests are a crucial means to experiment formally with new and innovative ways of doing business and to determine whether these new ideas have merit for expansion past the pilot stage. Further, the federal government needs a means to receive new ideas and communi-cate them quickly to line managers as acceptable procurement system alternatives.<BR>

<P>FAI can assist agencies in this testing and dissemination process. In the past, various federal programs have invested heavily in research that has had no practical application, let alone addressed the most pressing concerns of procurement executives, industry, or Congress. By contrast, the FAI has established various committees and working groups to successfully oversee and support FAI career development initiatives. However, the FAI needs an advisory committee to oversee and support its research programs as well. This committee would help the FAI:<BR>
	*	coordinate its work with other federal research activities,<BR>
	*	direct its research to the most pressing needs of the procurement community,<BR>
	*	identify products and services already developed by various contracting activities that could meet those needs if made available governmentwide,<BR>
	*	obtain access to agency facilities and work sites for the conduct of research, and<BR>
	*	identify and benefit from research being done in academia and the private sector.<BR>
		The lack of a governmentwide vehicle to gather and quickly disseminate successful innovations and new methodologies to contracting professionals hurts the government's ability to continually benefit from others' best practices.<BR>

<P><B>1. Provide new legislative authority to test innovative procurement methods. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act to give OFPP authority to test innovative procurement methods and to waive laws for purposes of such tests. This would grant OFPP authority similar to that of the Office of Personnel Management.<BR>

<H1><B>Get Bureaucracy Out of the Way</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<P>Rules require compliance, but good rules also offer something in return, like fairness, opportunity, or predictability. We will always need rules, but the rules should never be an end in themselves. If we add guiding principles and accountability for results, we also need to reduce unnecessary burdens from the inevitable bureaucratic accretions of the past decades.<BR>

<P>While federal purchasing must continue to consider fairness, minimum wage laws, and other public values, in addition to the usefulness and cost of goods and services being purchased, the rules governing these considerations should be as simple and sensible as possible. To constructively get bureaucracy out of the way, we need to:<BR>
	*	establish a new simplified acquisition threshold and procedures,<BR>
	*	systematically reform labor laws and regulations to reduce their impact on procurement while simultaneously preserving their guarantees for labor,<BR>
	*	amend protest rules to protect rights of protesters while increasing the speed and reducing the costs of the protest forum,<BR>
	*	enhance programs for small business and small disadvantaged business concerns, and<BR>
	*	reform information technology procurement.<BR>
The background, need, and details of each of these actions is presented in this section.<BR>

<P>
<H2>PROC04:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Establish New Simplified Acquisition Threshold and Procedures</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Congress has long recognized federal agencies' need for a simple, low-cost process for making relatively small-dollar-value purchases. For more than 40 years, Congress has required that procurement regulations provide for such procedures. Under small purchase procedures currently $25,000 or less competitive purchases can be made simply by obtaining quotations from contractors by telephone, mail, or in some cases electronically. The simplified purchase procedures expedite the procurement process; it normally takes less than one month to conduct these transactions because only a reasonable number of price quotations must be obtained to achieve competition. In contrast, larger purchases over $25,000, even simple ones, normally take at least three months to complete. For example, to compete a $40,000 janitorial contract to clean a building for one year requires an extremely cumbersome process that is excessive considering the size of the acquisition.<BR>

<P>Small Business Set-Asides.  The Small Business Act requires that all small purchases using simplified acquisition procedures be reserved exclusively for small businesses if there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining from two or more small businesses price quotations that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery.1 Under a small business reserve, a small business may provide products of a large business. If the proposed procurement is expected to exceed $10,000 ($5,000 for defense agencies), but is not expected to exceed $25,000, the Small Business Act and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act require that agencies post either a notice describing the proposed procurement or a copy of the solicitation. The posting must be for a period of not less than 10 days in a public place at the contracting office issuing the solicitation.<BR>

<P>Small Purchase Floors.  In the past, when Congress enacted legislation that increased the complexity of the federal acquisition process, it accommodated the need for economy and efficiency in the procurement process by exempting small purchases made using simplified procedures. This typically was accomplished by establishing a &quot;floor&quot; so that the new legislation did not apply to contracts written at dollar values below the existing statutory threshold for use of small purchase procedures. For example, when the Service Contract Act of 1965 was enacted, it specified $2,500 as the floor; that was also the small purchase threshold at that time. However, while the ceiling or threshold for small purchases was regularly adjusted to account for the declining purchasing power of the dollar, the statutory floors for applying other statutory requirements, like the Service Contract Act, were not adjusted. Similarly, the President often included a floor tied to the current threshold for use of simplified procedures when issuing executive orders affecting the procurement process, but did not provide for these thresholds to be adjusted for inflation. In addition, a number of other laws and executive orders require contract clauses be included in all contracts regardless of dollar amount.<BR>

<P>As if small purchase procedures originally designed to be a simple method of buying were not complex enough with government laws and rules, individual agencies often add further limitations or additional administrative burdens on their use. For example, agencies have placed additional limits on use of imprest funds or require more documentation than contemplated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>Government line managers and procure-ment officers are frustrated with the procure-ment process when trying to buy supplies or services under $100,000 because the administrative costs, burdensome rules, and time frames seem so far out of proportion with the cost and nature of the things being acquired. The result is that managers cannot get small-dollar items and services quickly and with a reasonable administrative burden. The federal procurement process requires a minimum of three months for purchases under $100,000. Contrast this with a major company local to Washington, D.C., that averages one to four weeks from the time a request is submitted to the purchasing office to the time a contract is awarded to a vendor for purchases in the range of $100,000.2<BR>

<P>The Current Threshold.  The current threshold of $25,000 was established in 1986. The OFPP Act provides for periodic review every five years beginning in 1995, with adjustments limited to the rate of inflation.3 The Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law (Section 800 Panel) has recommended that Congress raise the threshold to $100,000 for DOD.4 Congress has also begun to think in terms of a higher threshold by setting $100,000 as the amount that triggers application of several recent statutes (e.g., procurement integrity and anti-lobbying).<BR>

<P>Raising the Threshold.  A compelling reason to raise the threshold for use of simplified procedures to $100,000 governmentwide is that it would simplify the paperwork burden for a significant number of procurement transactions without adversely impacting the socioeconomic programs and competitive aspects of most federal spending. For example, during fiscal year 1992, the federal government purchased $200 billion in goods and services. Fifty-seven percent, or 11.5 million, of the total transactions were made using small purchase procedures, yet these transactions represented only 5.6 percent, or $11.3 billion, of the total amount spent. Based on fiscal year 1992 data, if the threshold were raised to $100,000, an additional 45,500 procure-ments per year could be made using simplified acquisition procedures. The increased threshold would capture a large number of additional transactions, thereby significantly reducing the paperwork burden and its associated costs, but would only increase the total federal spending using this simplified process from $11.3 billion to $13.8 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion.5 The vast majority of federal procurement dollars would still be spent under the umbrella of all socioeconomic laws and regulations.<BR>

<P>Conforming Other Requirements to the New Threshold.  Adjusting the floors of the other statutory requirements consistent with the simplified acquisition threshold would eliminate 1,600 federal jobs. In addition, it would save $50 million in administrative costs by reducing the paperwork burden caused by the current threshold. Further savings could also accrue up to $800 million per year and be passed to the government and taxpayers from lower contractor costs for goods and services. For example, the threshold for the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA), which sets wage rates for contracts for construction, alteration, or repair (including painting and decorating) of public buildings or public works, is $2,000. This threshold has remained unchanged since enactment in 1931. As a result, if the government hires a contractor to perform a $2,500 painting job at a federal building, the contracting official is required to:<BR>

<P>	*	find and select a wage determination (a list of minimum wage rates) or request a wage determination from the Department of Labor (DOL) if none of the published wage determinations apply;<BR>
	*	include the wage determination in the solicitation and contract;<BR>
	*	give the contractor a poster explaining the DBA that is posted at the job site along with the wage determination;<BR>
	*	collect and review the contractor's and subcontractor's weekly payroll records and statements of compliance with the minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements;<BR>
	*	return payroll records for correction if discrepancies are found;<BR>
	*	periodically interview contractor employees to ensure they are being paid the proper wages and provided applicable benefits; and<BR>
	*	withhold contract payments and take other steps, if necessary, to enforce the requirements of the DBA.<BR>

<P>When Congress originally established the DBA threshold in 1931, it apparently intended that the DBA apply to larger purchases.6 However, because the thresholds for applying the DBA and other statutes have not been raised over the years, these requirements continue to be applied to what are now very small purchases. The require-ments of the various statutes, identified in Table 1, place significant administrative burdens, especially on small businesses, on a process originally intended to be free from such burdens. Raising the thresholds of other statutes to the same threshold for using simplified procedures and eliminating requirements for contract clauses would make more than 11 million small purchases (that would fall under the new simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000) simpler and less expensive to execute and administer.<BR>

<P>As the Davis-Bacon example illustrates, the administrative requirements of these laws are highly complex and cause heavy paperwork burdens to government and businesses alike. The cumulative effects of these outmoded thresholds applied to the millions of small purchase transactions annually is enormous. In passing the original legislation for each program, Congress recognized the need to balance the cost of these social requirements with their benefits to various segments of the public and established thresholds below which the requirements do not apply. In failing to raise these thresholds commensurate with inflation, that balance has been lost with large resulting costs to the taxpayer. Amending these requirements will result in large savings to the government and businesses while restoring the balance originally intended between costs to the government and benefits to the public. Opening purchases of $2,500 or less to both small and large businesses will simplify the many very small purchases most needed to provide line managers their working tools.<BR>

<P>Introducing Technology.  Finally, application of electronic data interchange (EDI) technology will facilitate the simplified acquisition process by ensuring full access by small businesses to government contracting opportunities and minimizing procurement lead time. Use of EDI can replace transactions traditionally conducted on paper with paperless transactions conducted electronically by automated processes. <BR>

<P>Under current law, purchases over $25,000 must be advertised in the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I> (CBD). The advertisement process is intended to provide adequate notice to businesses of the government's requirements and normally takes a period of 45 days.7 The threshold for the requirement to advertise in the CBD would automatically increase to the new threshold of $100,000 for simplified acquisition procedures as recommended by NPR. Below the new level, the requirement for CBD advertisement would be eliminated. Even though most purchases below that level would be set aside for small businesses, there is substantial concern in the small business community about this increase. While federal managers would benefit from a reduction of the 45-day lead time, small businesses fear that there would be insufficient visibility of and access to federal contracting opportunities due to the loss of the public announcement in the CBD. <BR>

<P>Use of EDI in the contracting process should allay these fears. The Canadian government has established an electronic bulletin board to provide on-line access to information on contracting opportunities similar to the information published in the CBD. The bulletin board provides timely information and easy access for business. By establishing a similar capability to replace the CBD, the federal government can ensure small business access to information on contracting opportunities while at the same time reducing the 45-day delay associated with advertising in the CBD and reducing printing and mailing costs. <BR>

<P>In addition, the private sector is increasingly turning to EDI to conduct business, and some federal agencies have started using EDI to conduct purchasing activities. This trend is highly promising because purchases made through simplified acquisition procedures are the most easily adaptable to an electronic environment.8<BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to (a) increase the threshold for use of simplified acquisition procedures from $25,000 to $100,000; (b) continue to reserve purchases in excess of $2,500 made using simplified procedures for small business; (c) amend the requirements for posting contracting opportunities to provide improved access to information on procurements in excess of $25,000 through the use of electronic techniques (e.g., an electronic bulletin board or electronic commerce); and (d) repeal or amend the statutes identified in Table 1 to either tie their applicability to the new threshold for use of simplified acquisition procedures or eliminate the requirement for a written contract clause for purchases made using such procedures. Unless all of these changes are made simultaneously, the government's efforts to simplify the process and shift to an electronic commerce environment will be frustrated. Simply raising the threshold for small purchases without making the other recommended changes will have minimal impact because the complexities and burdens associated with the other statutory requirements will continue to exist.9<BR>

<P><B>2. Enact legislation simplifying Department of Defense (DOD) unique procurement requirements. (3)</B><BR>
Congress should amend those DOD-unique requirements as identified by the Section 800 Panel in order to simplify procedures for procurements under the simplified acquisition threshold.<BR>

<P><B>3. Establish a single electronic bulletin board capability to provide access to information on contracting opportunities. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By July 1995, the President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of OMB and in consultation with the Administrator, General Services Administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Commerce, should establish an electronic bulletin board capability to be used by all agencies to post purchase opportunities in excess of $25,000. This electronic bulletin board capacity shall be implemented through the governmentwide electronic commerce federal acquisition system.10 This will enable the entire business community, and especially small businesses, to access information pending full implementation of electronic commerce.<BR>

<P><B>4. Revise agency acquisition-related regulations to eliminate internal </B><BR>
<B>barriers. (1)</B><BR>
By November 30, 1995, the heads of federal agencies should charge their senior procurement executives to review and revise agency regulations and internal agency guidance to ensure they do not inappropriately impede the objectives of simplified purchasing. Such regulations should not add additional administrative burdens, limits, or documentation beyond FAR requirements.<BR>

<P><B>5. Develop a pamphlet on statutory acquisition requirements for distribution to small businesses. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Within 60 days of threshold changes, the Director, OMB, should develop, in consultation with the Administrator, Small Business Administration (SBA), a pamphlet on the statutory requirements that will continue to apply to purchases made using simplified acquisition procedures, but that will not be included in written contract clauses. The pamphlet should be distributed to the small business community through SBA and procuring agencies.<BR>

<H1><B>Reform Labor Laws and Transform the Labor Department into an Efficient Partner for Meeting Public </B></H1>
<P>
<H1><B>Policy Goals</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Five labor laws are implemented through the federal procurement system. They are:<BR>

<P>	*	The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which requires each contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or works in excess of $2,000 to specify the minimum wages to be paid to various classes of laborers and mechanics.1 The minimum wages, including fringe benefits, are those the Secretary of Labor determines to be &quot;prevailing&quot; for the laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a similar character in the area in which the work is to be performed. The requirements of the <B>a</B>ct are incorporated in more than 70 other statutes that authorize federally assisted construction.<BR>

<P>	*	The Copeland Anti-Kickback Act of 1934, which regulates payroll deductions on federal or federally assisted construction.2 This law prohibits anyone, under penalty of fine and/or imprisonment, from inducing an employee to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is entitled under his contract of employment and requires contractors to submit a weekly statement of compliance to the agency contracting officer. Further, the <B>a</B>ct's implementing regulations require contractors on federal projects to submit and certify weekly payroll reports detailing daily hours worked, wage rates, total earnings, and any deductions.<BR>

<P>	*	The Service Contract Act of 1965, which requires contractors on covered contracts in excess of $2,500 to pay service employees the minimum wage prevailing in the locality and provide specified minimum fringe benefits. The <B>a</B>ct applies to federal contracts if the principal purpose of the contract is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees.3 It also prohibits employment under hazardous or unsanitary conditions.<BR>

<P>	*	The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, which requires contractors manufacturing or furnishing materials, supplies, articles, and equipment to the federal government under contracts that exceed $10,000 to qualify as a manufacturer or regular dealer, pay all employees working under the contract at least the minimum wage as determined by the Secretary of Labor, agree that no employee will be required to work in excess of 40 hours a week unless paid overtime, avoid use of convict labor or persons under 16 years of age, and agree that no part of the contract will be performed in unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous work places.4 <BR>

<P>	*	The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which requires that certain contracts contain a clause specifying that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work required by the contract be permitted or required to work more than 40 hours in any work-week unless paid for all such overtime hours at not less than 11&Uacute;2 times the basic rate of pay.5<BR>

<P>These prevailing wage laws were enacted because the federal procurement system generally required that contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder through a sealed bid process. Unfortunately, in labor-intensive industries, like construction and service, the most expedient way to lower a bid may be to lower labor costs. In recognition of the influence that the government's buying power had on the economies of local areas, Congress enacted laws to protect minimum wages and benefits. The objective was to require contractors to compete by becoming more efficient, applying new technologies, or using a more productive workforce instead of simply lowering wages. With the enactment of the Competition in Contracting Act in 1984, Congress shifted the focus away from the sealed bidding process to the concept of providing full and open competition using the most appropriate method of procurement. This change, however, did not diminish the underlying purpose and need for prevailing wage laws. Even though procuring agencies may have greater flexibility to consider other factors in addition to price in selecting contractors, price remains a principal selection criterion for almost all covered contracts, whereas employee labor standards are not considered in the selection process.<BR>

<P>In addition, Executive Order 11246, &quot;Equal Employment Opportunity,&quot; requires federal contractors with contracts in excess of $10,000 to not discriminate in employment because of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin and to take affirmative steps to promote the employment opportunities of these protected groups.6<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The government and industry bear significant costs in implementing these laws. These administrative costs need to be balanced against the intended social benefits. Alternative methods should be explored for achieving these benefits at lower cost. For example, savings from amending the Copeland Act to modify the requirement for submission of certified weekly payrolls alone would require 600 fewer federal employees per year to fulfill the administrative requirements, thereby saving the government $20 million per year. In addition, the construction industry would benefit significantly. During fiscal year 1992, federal construction contracts over $100,000 totaled $11.1 billion. Modification of the weekly payroll requirement would eliminate a great deal of paperwork burden for construction businesses and should result in a 1 percent savings to these businesses or up to $111 million in savings per year that could be passed onto the government and taxpayer. Significant savings can also be expected from amending the Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act.7<BR>

<P><B>The following statutory and regulatory authorities must be re-examined.</B><BR>
Davis-Bacon Act and Copeland Anti-Kickback Act. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a recurring public policy issue, as well as the subject of a number of government and private studies. These studies have produced recommendations ranging from repeal of the Act to amendments to supplemental regulations. Some procurement experts contend that the requirements of the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts for submission of payrolls and statements of compliance are burdensome. Others argue that both acts are impediments to small and minority business participation in federal construction contracting. For example, the more than 1,600 delegates to the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business ranked repealing the Davis-Bacon Act as their seventh most important recommendation out of 60 reported to the President and Congress. <BR>

<P>The 1992 Budget Resolution passed by the House of Representatives urged the House Committee with jurisdiction over the Davis-Bacon Act to study the potential for possible savings to the federal government from the reform of the Act and report committee findings to the full House of Representatives.8<BR>

<P>Service Contract Act. The Service Contract Act places a five-year limitation on the term of service contracts subject to the Act and requires a new wage determination to be incorporated in multiyear contracts at least every two years. The five-year limitation is inconsistent with the government's need to enter into long-term contracts.9 It is contrary to the objectives of the Act to limit the term of contracts. As long as the Act requires the incorporation of a new wage determination every two years, service employees' interests are protected. Longer-term contracts provide more stable employment for service employees.<BR>

<P>Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. Over time, the protections provided by the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act have been superseded or duplicated by subsequent legislation and congressional action. The overtime pay provisions are the same as those in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Walsh-Healey's minimum wage provisions are also essentially the same as the FLSA because the Secretary of Labor has not issued a wage determination since 1963. The <B>a</B>ct's prohibition against purchasing goods made with child labor is duplicated by the FLSA, which prohibits oppressive child labor in any facility that ships goods in interstate commerce. The convict labor provisions are the only provisions that have not been overtaken by events; these provisions could easily be incorporated into the provisions of the existing executive order on convict labor.<BR>

<P>The Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law (Section 800 Panel) recommended the thresholds for application of the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts be increased to $100,000, the requirement for submission of weekly payrolls be modified, the Davis-Bacon Act wage schedules be issued annually per locality, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act be repealed except for the provisions of the <B>a</B>ct dealing with convict labor.10<BR>

<P>Debarment Provisions. In addition to changes in labor laws, the statutory provisions related to debarment need to be simplified. Currently, the Davis-Bacon Act authorizes the Comptroller General to debar contractors for violations and to disburse back wages to employees. The Service Contract Act, the Walsh-Healey Act, and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act require the Department of Labor (DOL) to notify the Comptroller General when it debars a contractor for violating the law. Under each statute, the Comptroller General is required to prepare and distribute a list of the parties debarred. Currently the Comptroller General distributes a list to various government entities, including the General Services Administration (GSA), so the information may be included on the <I>List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs </I>that GSA maintains and distributes through the Superintendent of Documents. The requirement to process recommendations for debarment and/or notices of debarment to the Comptroller General for distribution has become an unnecessary duplication of effort. The information should be sent directly to GSA for inclusion on the <I>List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.</I><BR>

<P>Use of Information Technology. Further, due to budget limitations, DOL has not been able to maximize the use of information technology in implementing the various labor laws. For example, most wage determinations under the Davis-Bacon Act are published, and contracting officers select the one that applies to a particular construction project if the cost is estimated to exceed $2,000. Improvements are also needed in DOL regulations, especially those allowing interested parties to challenge a wage determination issued under the Service Contract Act as being at substantial variance with the wages prevailing in the locality or regulations that do not provide time frames for resolving cases. Wage determinations that are based on collective bargaining agreements may also be challenged when there is a question of whether the collective bargaining agreement was a product of arm's-length negotiations. DOL's track record in terms of providing a timely hearing and resolution of substantial variance cases is not good. For example, some cases are dismissed as moot because the government contract involved has already expired.11<BR>

<P>Equal Employment Opportunity. Finally, regulations implementing the executive order on equal employment opportunity (EEO) provide for a paper-intensive process that adds little or no value but delays contract award. The regulations issued by DOL implementing the executive order require contracting officers to request a preaward EEO compliance review or clearance before awarding a contract in excess of $1 million.12 Contracting officers submit requests for preaward clearances to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at DOL. DOL processes the request and notifies the contracting officer in writing that the clearance is granted or that a full review is scheduled. In either case, the contract is awarded. During fiscal year 1992, approximately 23,000 requests were submitted but only 185 full reviews were conducted.13 (Due to reduced staff and budget, most requests were automatically approved because an on-site review could not be conducted within 30 days.) <BR>

<P>The small number of full reviews conducted by DOL does not justify the cost associated with processing every action over $1 million through DOL. DOL can enhance enforcement of the executive order by using its resources more effectively to conduct more on-site reviews.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Enact legislation to simplify acquisition labor laws. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Davis-Bacon Act should be amended to:<BR>
	*	apply the new simplified acquisition threshold to federally funded and assisted contracts,<BR>
	*	authorize the Secretary of Labor to debar individuals and firms for violations and to disburse payments to employees directly from payments withheld under the terms of contracts, and<BR>
	*	use the listing of persons or firms debarred on the <I>List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs</I> maintained by GSA to eliminate the current duplications.<BR>
<B>T</B>he Copeland Act should be amended to:<BR>
	*	eliminate the requirement for submission of certified payrolls and substitute a requirement that the contractor submit, along with each request for a progress or final payment, a certification that all persons employed on the project have been paid the full wages earned without unauthorized deductions;<BR>
	*	require the contractor to maintain payroll and other basic records relating to payroll for a period of three years after completion of the work, submit them to the contracting officer if instructed to do so, and make them available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Department of Labor or the contracting agency;<BR>
	*	require the contracting agency to suspend all payments to the contractor if the contractor fails to respond to a request for payrolls; and<BR>
	*	authorize the Secretary of Labor to debar contractors who fail to submit payrolls when requested to do so or who otherwise refuse to make records available for inspection. The certification would be submitted as a part of the normal progress and final payment request to avoid an additional submission and certification. The contractor would be required to maintain records for each employee on hours worked daily and during the payroll period, hourly rates of wages paid (including rate of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits), all deductions made, and actual wages paid.<BR>
The Service Contract Act should be amended to:<BR>
	*	eliminate the five-year limitation on the term of contracts but retain the requirement for adjustment of wages and benefits under multiyear contracts at a minimum every two years, and<BR>
	*	provide for a listing of persons or firms debarred for violations of the Act to be included on GSA's <I>List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.</I><BR>

<P>The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act should be amended to provide for a listing of names of persons or firms debarred for violations of the Act to be included on GSA's <I>List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs</I>.<BR>
The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act should be repealed.<BR>

<P><B>2. Amend the executive order on convict labor. (2)</B><BR>

<P>Within 30 days of repeal of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, the President should amend Executive Order 11755 to incorporate the convict labor provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. This will provide for the continued option for agencies to procure goods from the Federal Prison Industries, as well as goods made by federal and state prisoners, inside or outside of prison.<BR>

<P><B>3. Provide on-line access to Davis-Bacon Act wage schedules through an electronic system. (1)</B><BR>
By January 1995, the Secretary of Labor should establish an electronic system to provide on-line access to Davis-Bacon Act wage determinations. The system should be compatible with the system recommended for the Service Contract Act wage determinations and provide a mechanism for electronically requesting specific project wage determinations under the <B>a</B>ct.14<BR>
<B>4. Revise labor regulations to improve service. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1995, the Secretary of Labor should revise labor regulations to:<BR>
	*	require hearings be held on substantial variance cases under section 4(c) of the Service Contract Act and decisions rendered within 60 calendar days, or the Secretary be notified of the delay and provided with an explanation; and<BR>
	*	eliminate the requirement for a preaward equal employment opportunity clearance before awarding contracts or first-tier subcontracts for an estimated or actual amount of $1 million or more.<BR>

<P>
<H2>PROC06:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Amend Protest Rules</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Protests, both before and after contract award, are an important means for objectively reviewing meritorious grievances of disappointed bidders of government actions. Forcing a review of questionable or improper actions strengthens the procurement system and maintains the integrity and accountabil-ity of government. However, unless the protest is clearly frivolous, and thus subject to summary dismissal, it delays further action on the procurement no matter how likely it is that the government's actions were correct. This delay can force all competitors and the government to freeze their actions until the protest is resolved unless the government can demonstrate that the acquisition is &quot;urgent and compelling.&quot; Even a frivolous protest can cause some delay and additional workload prior to summary dismissal if the agency has to notify all other competitors and the agency and interested competitors have to respond as to whether the protest is frivolous. <BR>

<P>In 1992, 3,200 protests were filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO). Another 350 protests involving the acquisition of information technology (IT) under the Brooks Act were filed with the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA).1 A protester can file a protest under a solicitation with the contracting agency, GAO, the Court of Federal Claims, District Courts, or the GSBCA (if IT is involved). Protests submitted to the contracting officer at the contracting agency are less costly and do not necessarily involve significant delays.2 The various protest forums are set forth in Table 1.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>People in industry and government believe that communication during the procurement process has been curtailed because of the fear that a statement by a government official will be misunderstood and will inadvertently trigger a protest.3 This causes inadequate debriefings of offerors, which in turn creates suspicion and can generate a protest that could have otherwise been avoided. The procurement system cannot improve without better channels of communication between buyers and sellers.<BR>

<P>In addition, fear of protests has had unintended adverse consequences on the procurement system. Protests have caused procurement officers to redirect their attention away from service to the customer to following rules and procedures rigidly and compiling paperwork in an effort to make their decisions &quot;protest-proof.&quot; This, of course, results in costly additional paperwork, delays in procurements of goods and services required to meet public needs, and greater administrative costs to the government and taxpayer. Moreover, a high-ranking Treasury Department Information Resources Management (IRM) official recently said, &quot;The internal costs of increased staff hours [to avert protests] may not be immediately noticeable in the government's budget, but it does become noticeable when the attention and energy of the IRM staffs are diverted from implementing quality systems to merely managing the process.&quot;4 <BR>
A recent survey of over 1,000 line managers confirms these contentions. Over 80 percent of federal managers surveyed believe that their contracting officers cause delays by rigidly following procurement rules, and over 60 percent believe that contracting officers are most concerned about making awards protest-proof.5<BR>

<P>Evolution of Existing Systems. Prior to 1984, administrative protests were an inexpensive administrative procedure for contractors to force an objective review of contracting agency actions. The system became more complex in 1984 when the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) vested both GAO and GSBCA with explicit statutory authority to undertake ever more formal reviews using independent standards. Where company presidents or marketing executives once argued their protest cases, attorneys now usually do so. This is primarily because the GSBCA uses more court-like procedures such as discovery and fact finding and the entire contract record is reviewed anew (or &quot;de novo&quot;). GAO has indicated that if it too employed certain GSBCA practices, like allowing depositions, it could lead to higher costs that could make the protest system less accessible and affordable.6 However, through such practices, the GSBCA, a quasi-independent body, can potentially substitute its judgment for that of agency contracting officials. Many contractors think this allows more effective review of agency actions as was intended by CICA. Most procurement professionals and line managers, however, believe GSBCA should use the same test used by the courts that would protect contractors against abuses of discretion and not second-guess agency judgments. The 1984 CICA changes were to be tested for three years. However, after 18 months, the protest provisions became permanent through other legislation.7<BR>

<P>Administrative Protests.  The vast majority of protests are filed in the administrative forums the GAO or the GSBCA. If a protest is filed in the agency before award, the government must suspend work on the procurement except in urgent and compelling situations. A protest generally can be filed at any time prior to the closing date for receipt of offers (e.g., challenging the fairness of a solicitation document) or within 10 days of contract award (e.g., challenging the award). If the protester wins, the government may be required to resolicit the requirement, reevaluate the offers, cancel the contract (if already awarded), or take other appropriate action. In many instances the protester is entitled to recover his bid or proposal preparation costs, as well as attorney fees.<BR>

<P>These above-cited remedies were intended to protect disappointed bidders, but do so at the expense of the government. For example, while the government can be directed to pay a protester's legal fees, a protester cannot be assessed any penalty for delaying a govern-ment contract award or for the government defense against a frivolous protest. Avoiding delays in government programs is the current incentive for the government to painstak-ingly document procurement conformance with the many applicable statutes and regulations. However, this practice adds time to the procurement process and ultimately delays contract award and the delivery of goods and services that line managers critically need. Given the significant consequences of contracting officer decisions, a uniform standard for judging the correctness of those decisions is needed to ensure that accountable decisions are not second-guessed.<BR>
Further, the Report of the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law (Section 800 Panel) reviewed the protest process. A key recommendation of this panel was that the Court of Federal Claims should be the single judicial forum to consider all protests that now can be considered by any District Court or the Court of Federal Claims.8 This change would allow expert judges of the Court of Federal Claims to resolve these sometimes complex contracting issues.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Establish a uniform standard of review for all protest forums by changing the standard of review at the GSBCA to conform to that used in the courts. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act should be amended to change the standard of review at the GSBCA to mirror the judicial standard specifically, &quot;was there a rational basis for the government action?&quot;9<BR>

<P><B>2. Allow penalties for frivolous protests. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to require protestors who tie up agency procurements by filing frivolous protests to pay respondents' costs and fees.<BR>

<P><B>3. Establish a single forum within the judicial branch to consider protests. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to establish the Court of Federal Claims as the sole court with jurisdiction over bid protests filed in the judicial forums. The Court should retain the remedy scheme contained in the Equal Access to Justice Act.<BR>

<P><B>4. Allow continued performance of contracting functions up to the point of contract award as part of any pre-award suspension of the delegation of procurement authority when a protest is filed with the GSBCA. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Legislation should be enacted to amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to make clear that any suspension as a result of a pre-award protest shall not preclude the agency head from continuing actions under the procurement that the agency head deems in the best interests of the United States, up to the point of award of a contract.<BR>

<P><B>5. Identify costs to the government and contractors of responding to protests. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Chairman, GSBCA, and the Comptroller General should begin collecting and reporting annually the total cost to the government (e.g., GSBCA and other agencies) and other parties for protests. This will aid the General Accounting Office and GSBCA in measuring their performance in terms of providing an affordable means to resolve meritorious grievances.<BR>

<P><B>6. Identify and eliminate causes of protests and improve agency processes. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By November 1994, the Administrator, General Services Administration, and the Secretary, Department of Defense, should identify the top reasons for protests and provide to the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), recommendations for changes in processes, including agency-level protest resolution, and procedures with the objective of significantly reducing the number of protests. The recommendations should be developed in consultation with a panel of suppliers and contracting officers.<BR>

2. The Professional Services Council has noted that one clearly objective agency protest system is the Headquarters Level Protest Program of the Army Materiel Command (AMC). This alternative dispute resolution program has been very successful as a high-level agency review of bid protests. The filing times and procedures used by AMC were published in a set of AMC guidelines that are routinely included in AMC procurements. The AMC Pilot Program resulted in effective relief for protesters in approximately 20 percent of the cases filed. Only one AMC decision has been overturned by GAO since initiation of the HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program in April 1991. The Pilot Program has now been made permanent. The AMC procedures provide for 10 working days to file a protest from the date the affected offeror knew or should have known of the grounds for the protest, per FAR 33.103(b)(2). A protester to AMC also agrees not to file a protest at GAO, GSBCA, or any other forum while the AMC protest is pending. AMC review of the protest is made at the headquarters level and the decision is binding on the contracting officer. <BR>

<P>
<H1><B>for Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>The federal government has a policy to place a fair proportion of its contracts with small business and small disadvantaged business concerns. It also has a policy to grant small business and small disadvantaged business concerns the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in performance of federal contracts as subcontractors.1 To implement these policies, the Small Business Act requires federal agencies to obtain small business subcontracting plans from prime contractors when the value of the procurement exceeds $500,000 ($1 million for construction) and offers subcontracting possibilities.2 This requirement also applies when contracting with state and local governments or with entities that are controlled or regulated by state and local governmental bodies (e.g., public utilities).<BR>

<P>The Small Business Act requires the President to establish annual government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business and small disadvantaged business concerns. The governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns must be established at not less than 20 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. As part of this, a goal for participation by small disadvantaged business concerns must also be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.3<BR>

<P>The Small Business Set-Aside Program.  A number of programs have been established to implement the policies and facilitate agency achievement of the above-cited goals. The most commonly used programs are the small business set-aside program, the 8(a) program, and the program for subcon-tracting with small business and small disadvantaged business concerns.4<BR>

<P>The small business set-aside program authorizes agencies to reserve individual procurements exclusively for participation by small business concerns. The 8(a) program is a business development program adminis-tered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged U.S. citizens. To participate, firms must apply and meet eligibility criteria. Program participation is limited to nine years. Participants may receive a variety of business development services including management and technical assistance, direct SBA loans, surety bond waivers, the transfer of government surplus property, and government contracts awarded under special procedures. SBA's subcontractors are referred to as &quot;8(a) contractors.&quot; Federal agencies award contracts to SBA, which in turn subcontracts with eligible 8(a) firms either on a sole-source or competitive basis for performance of the agencies' work.<BR>

<P>Small businesses awarded contracts under the small business set-aside and 8(a) programs are limited in the amount of subcontracting during the contract's term. For service and supply contracts, the small business concern must perform at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel with its own employees. For construction, small business general contractors must perform at least 15 percent of the contract cost, not including cost of materials, with their own employees. Small business special trade contractors must perform at least 25 percent of the contract with their own employees.5 In addition, small businesses must supply the product of another small business under the small business set-aside and 8(a) programs.<BR>

<P>Other small business programs.  In addition to the small business set-aside and 8(a) programs, which apply government-wide, the Department of Defense (DOD) has special statutory authority to conduct small disadvantaged business set-asides.6 Under the set-aside program, DOD has the authority to limit competition on a specific procurement exclusively to small disadvan-taged businesses. The program requires a self-certification that the offeror is a small disadvantaged business as defined in the Small Business Act. This certification may be challenged, but SBA precertification is not required.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The administrative burden imposed on small business by the limitation on subcontracting is enormous. Every quotation a small business obtains from a prospective supplier or subcontractor must be evaluated not only from a &quot;make or buy&quot; standpoint prior to contract award, but also from a large or small business supplier perspective. The small business must compare costs from each source and consider the expertise of the small business supplier to meet the requirements of the solicitation as a subcontractor, even if the large business supplier is a known acceptable source. The small business submitting an offer to the government must expend extra time locating sources in order to comply with the limitation on subcontracting, instead of selecting a supplier or service provider based on price or other factors important to that small business. This limitation is prejudicial to small businesses, as large businesses do not have to comply with such requirements.<BR>

<P>Civilian agencies need authority to conduct small disadvantaged business set-asides because the 8(a) program does not encompass all small disadvantaged businesses. Some firms have graduated from the 8(a) program but still qualify as small businesses under the applicable size standard, while others have never applied to the 8(a) program. To the extent that these firms are not included in competitions for 8(a) awards, the procuring agency's options for cost and capability are limited. Procuring agencies need the flexibility to use either the 8(a) program or small disadvantaged business set-asides as means to achieve the statutory goals.<BR>

<P>Federal agencies have difficulty getting subcontracting plans when contracting with state and local governments or entities they regulate. The problem is most prevalent in the monopolistic public utilities industry, where the federal government has few options to enforce the requirements for subcontracting plans. Currently, thousands of staff hours and dollars are expended annually debating the issue, trying to persuade utilities of the merits of the federal government's position, or otherwise litigating conflicts. For all the effort, few benefits accrue to the small business community.<BR>

<P>Attempts to resolve the problem have been unsuccessful. Public utilities refuse to enter into contracts, insisting that the federal government can procure service under tariffs like every other customer. When the federal government does procure service under tariffs, many utilities insist they are not sub-ject to the requirement for a subcontracting plan because they do not have a contract with the federal government. Some utilities maintain this position notwithstanding written opinions from the General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice that the subcontracting plan requirements apply even in the absence of a written contract.<BR>

<P>Additionally, utilities and state and local governments complain that the federal subcontracting plan requirements overlap with state or local laws requiring similar plans providing contracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns.7 Utilities and state and local governments add that the overlap creates an unnecessary intrusion by the federal government on state and local affairs and a duplication of effort, paperwork, and reporting.<BR>

<P>Resolution of these issues will help federal managers by allowing them to use their resources in more productive endeavors.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Repeal statutory limitations on subcontracting and substitute regulatory limitations to provide greater flexibility. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Small Business Act should be amended to repeal the limitations on subcontracting. Such limitations should be addressed by the Administrator, Small Business Administration, through regulations governing the small business status of offerors. Small business status should require a contractor to perform a significant proportion of the work and have manage-ment control over performance. A firm's status as a small business would be subject to self-certification, protest, and appeal procedures in size determinations by SBA.<BR>

<P><B>2. Authorize civilian agencies to conduct small disadvantaged business set-asides. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Small Business Act should be amended to give civilian agencies the same authority that DOD currently has for establishing its own set-aside competitions. The legislative amendments should be structured to ensure the continued support of the 8(a) program by precluding agencies from reducing the number and dollar value of 8(a) contracts. Giving civilian agencies the same authority as DOD to seek small disadvantaged business participation has three benefits: (1) the federal manager has a wider range of choice on capability and cost, (2) agencies are in a better position to meet their 8(a) goals, and (3) small disadvantaged businesses potentially gain greater access to federal business.<BR>

<P><B>3. Permit state and local governments to substitute descriptions of their own programs for subcontracting and exempt monopolies regulated by governmental bodies. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Small Business Act should be amended to:<BR>
	*	permit the substitution, by state and local governments acting as contractors, of a description of their own similar programs for otherwise required small business subcontracting plans, if the contracting officer determines the description satisfies the purposes of the plan; and<BR>
	*	exempt entities that are monopolies providing services under rates regulated by a federal, state, or local governmental body from providing the otherwise required plan.<BR>

<P>By recognizing state and local government programs serving the same purpose as the federal subcontracting plan requirement, the federal government would eliminate duplication of effort, which results when various levels of government impose similar requirements having similar purposes. The requirement for the contracting officer to determine whether the description satisfies the requirement will protect the small business community at large.<BR>

<P><B>4. Demonstrate the continued commitment to small and small disadvantaged businesses. (2)</B><BR>
The President should issue a directive that demonstrates the administration's continued commitment to ensure that a fair proportion of federal contracts and purchases will be placed with small and small disadvantaged businesses and that revisions to the procurement process should not adversely affect the ability of these small businesses to obtain a fair share of government procurements.<BR>

<P>
<H2>PROC08:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Reform Information Technology Procurement</B></H1>
<P>
<H3><B>Background </B></H3>
<P>The Brooks Act authorizes and directs the Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), to coordinate and provide for the economic and efficient purchase, lease, and maintenance of automated data processing (ADP) equipment by federal agencies.1 The Act was passed in 1965 at the start of the era of large mainframe computers, when ADP was a new and highly specialized product controlled by a few large companies. The Act originally covered only contracts for ADP hardware. Amendments to the Act in 1986 broadened its coverage to include contracts for ADP software and support services. The Act was also expanded to cover any contracts that included an ADP component, except for certain contracts of the Department of Defense and contracts for telecommunications systems and services. The term &quot;information resources management&quot; refers to the management of agency information activities and resources, including the use of ADP and telecommuni-cations hardware, software, and services. The term &quot;information technology&quot; (IT) used in this report is the contemporary term describing ADP and telecommunications hardware, software, and services.<BR>

<P>The Act authorizes GSA to delegate to other federal agencies its authority to procure IT. GSA normally delegates such procure-ment authority up to a total of $2.5 million for individual acquisitions of IT equipment and services. GSA sometimes makes exceptions based upon reviews of an agency's management of IT systems; exceptional delegations of up to $17.5 million have been made. Agency procurement requests above these levels are reviewed by GSA. GSA reviews about 700 agency requests per year.<BR>

<P>GSA establishes governmentwide policy for the acquisition, management, and use of IT through the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR). The FIRMR requires agencies to analyze their IT requirements, identify possible alternatives, and justify all IT procurements over $50,000.2 Though the regulation states that the amount of justification and documentation should be commensurate with the cost of the IT item being acquired, agencies have over-interpreted the regulation to require significant amounts of paperwork to justify even simple acquisitions.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>IT procurements in the federal government take too long. A sample of major IT procurements in one agency showed that the government acquisition lead time was 49 months for these procurements as compared to an estimated 13 months for similar procurements in the private sector (see diagram).3<BR>

<P>As a result, IT resources that are being bought to support critical federal program delivery do not satisfy current business requirements because by the time the IT items are delivered they are out-of-date. They also cost too much for the value received.<BR>

<P>Rapid and effective acquisition of IT resources is a vital ingredient of the effort to reinvent government. A recent Harvard study states, &quot;Transformational change is being unleashed in organizational performance and service through use of IT resources.&quot; However, it further states that &quot;agencies must typically work through procurement procedures that are widely felt to be costly, slow, and excessively detailed. Procurement is seen as a barrier to strategic IT use.&quot;4 These concerns are echoed in a second report representing a survey of senior federal IT management officials. The report notes that many of these officials feel that the &quot;delays are so long, in fact, that they end up acquiring out-of-date products.&quot;5 Finally, the National Performance Review Accompanying Report <I>Reengineering Through Information Technology </I>emphasizes the importance of obtaining state-of-the-art IT resources in a timely and cost-effective manner and states, &quot;Information technology provides the means to remove the barriers of distance, time, and physical location. It is key to a system of government wherein customers have timely and simplified access to federal, state, and local government services via easy-to-use information technology systems. Information technology is a strategic tool to integrate activities and remove duplication of effort among government agencies.&quot;6<BR>

<P>Challenges <B>c</B>onfronting <B>m</B>anagers.  The following seven major challenges confront federal managers as they attempt to acquire and integrate IT into the work environment.<BR>
	<BR>
1.	The computer industry is in the middle of a transition from one that is characterized by highly specialized and unique (proprietary) products to an industry that will someday have products that are almost completely commercialized and interchangeable. The government's practices and policies must be altered to take advantage of this trend but also recognize that it is not yet complete. Although it is moving rapidly, the industry still exhibits significant unique characteristics.<BR>
	<BR>
2. 	According to reports issued by such organizations as the General Accounting Office (GAO), GSA, and the Inspectors General (IGs) of certain agencies, the government has major problems acquiring complex IT products and services.7 These include failure by agencies to clearly define their requirements, failure to reengineer existing systems for rational and efficient processes before beginning automation, inadequate leadership on IT procurements by agency management, inadequate linkage of IT strategies to agency strategic plans, and other management failures. GSA, GAO, and private organizations agree that techniques of good management must be part of sound plans to manage IT procurements. These include mobilizing the right team, clearly defining requirements, tying IT procurement strategy to overall agency strategy, providing strong senior management support, and automating systems only when they have been reengineered for maximum efficiency.<BR>
	<BR>
3. 	The law and the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) fail to recognize that many IT resources are &quot;commodities&quot; commercial products and services mass-produced and offered for sale, lease, or license on the open market. System conversion, obsolescence management, interoperability, process reengineering, security, and other IT issues important in large procurements need not be emphasized for small IT procurements. Many of the smaller dollar acquisitions are for commodities readily available in the marketplace. The laws and regulations underlying IT acquisitions do not currently differentiate between acquisition of commodity and non-commodity items or products.<BR>
	<BR>
4. 	The federal acquisition process is so time-consuming that it fails to keep pace with technology. The federal acquisition cycle is estimated to be more than three times longer than that of private industry. While comprehen-sive lead time data is not collected, studies by Treasury, the General Services Administration, and Harvard University and incidental reports indicate that this is due to lengthy agency reviews with unnecessary rules and procedures, excessive documentation of transactions to forestall protests before the GSBCA, time added by GSA review of large agency procurement requests, and the existence of FIRMR provisions that duplicate agencies' normal IT acquisition planning procedures.8<BR>
	<BR>
5. 	Some IT procurements involve benefits that transcend the mission of a single agency, such as volume discounts from large purchases, learning the lessons and best practices of other agencies, and understanding common technology issues underlying multi-program activities (e.g., &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; efforts to provide services across agency lines). Agency acquisition planning must include outreach to, and teamwork with, other agencies where an acquisition produces such benefits.<BR>

<P>	6. 	The party responsible and accountable for good management of agency programs, including IT acquisitions, should be identified clearly and unambiguously.<BR>
	<BR>
7. 	Although computer products and services have taken on many characteristics of a commodity i.e., many suppliers, highly competitive pricing, similar features, etc. they also have unique characteristics that make them quite different from TVs, VCRs, calculators, or refrigerators, to name a few other products currently classified as commodities. Their primary differentiating characteristics are:<BR>
		<BR>
*	continued rapid advance of technology and continuous lower	production costs, and therefore continuously lower prices decreasing 20 to 40 percent per year; and<BR>
		<BR>
*	rapidly changing technology affecting form, fit, and function,which yields much higher performance for much lower costs.<BR>

<P>GSA strives to meet these challenges through innovative training programs, an aggressive triennial review program of agency IT management capabilities, sponsorship of various forums, and cooperation with concerned agencies. However, the problems continue. There is reason to doubt that any central management agency, no matter how excellent, can solve problems that are essentially institutional problems. <BR>

<P>Information technology evolution is so rapid that a continuous influx of talent and state-of-the-art knowledge is necessary if any central management organization is to handle the role GSA currently plays. Given scarce resources and the limitations in pay and personnel management practices inherent in the federal government, it is unlikely that such a central management organization could amass and continually replenish the talent required to guide agency procurements. <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions </B></H3>
<P><B>1. Establish an interagency team to develop a plan for improving federal information technology (IT) acquisitions. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By December 1993, the Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), should establish an interagency team to develop a governmentwide approach to improve management of IT acquisitions. This effort should operate within the overall context of IT reinvention activities within the federal government. The team should function as a sub-element of the Government Information Technology Services Working Group.9 The team should:<BR>

<P>	*	review agency IT program plans, goals, and objectives by March 1994, and recommend specific delegations;<BR>
	*	act on behalf of all agencies with the goal of obtaining their agreement  to work within the team's recommendations;<BR>
	*	be chaired by an agency team member who will report the team's findings and recommendations to the Administra-tor, GSA;<BR>
	*	be composed primarily of senior agency management officials able to consult with IT officials, private sector experts, Congress, and central management agencies (OMB, OFPP, NIST, etc.) to analyze issues and develop guiding principles, best practices, and performance measures for a streamlined, well-managed IT acquisition process;<BR>
	*	develop an interagency team approach for managing those IT procurements that have potential effects beyond a single agency;<BR>
	*	review GSA's ongoing role in IT with the goal of placing maximum accountability for IT with agency heads and emphasizing GSA's role and capability of being a &quot;center of expertise,&quot; providing acquisition consultation and management services consistent with current law; and<BR>
	*	examine the issue of commodities to define better the boundary between acquisitions that do and do not need special authority and oversight in the law and the FIRMR. This includes advising the Administrator, GSA, prior to January 1994, regarding the pilot identified in action item 4, below.<BR>

<P>By April 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should provide the Vice President with the team's findings, recommendations, and plans for implementation.<BR>

<P><B>2. Increase IT delegation of authority to agencies. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By May 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should change agency delegation amounts for competitive procurements based on the interagency team's recommendations. It is possible that agency delegations may be reduced, but more probable and expected that some agencies will receive greater or unlimited delegations while other agencies will receive delegations as follows.<BR>
	*	For agencies with information technology budgets reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Circular No. A-11, section 43, information technology exhibits 43A and 43B, over $1 billion in the prior fiscal year: $20 million.<BR>
	*	For agencies with information technology budgets reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Circular No. A-11, section 43, information technology exhibits 43A and 43B, from $100 million through $1 billion in the prior fiscal year: $10 million.<BR>
	*	For agencies with information technology budgets reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Circular No. A-11, section 43, information technology exhibits 43A and 43B, from zero through $100 million in the prior fiscal year: $5 million.<BR>
GSA should cooperate with agency heads to ensure that these delegations are passed through to operating components and line managers with minimum restrictions and with an emphasis on expected performance outcomes and measures of success.<BR>

<P>It is very important to increase delegation authorities and revise the FIRMR rules to more accurately reflect and take advantage of the commodity-like characteristics of computer products, services, and software. <BR>

<P>It is also still essential to have a &quot;center of expertise&quot; that can keep track of rapid changes in technology and performance, ensure that the types of relationships with the American computer industry provide vehicles to maximize the advantages to government of their capabilities; and ensure that the agencies with delegated authority have necessary skills, management controls, and motivations to take maximum advantage of what American industry can offer. The &quot;center of expertise&quot; probably best fits in GSA and would fit into a broad mandate of the existing law. One of the primary tasks of the interagency team (referred to in action item 1) would be to develop a plan to enable the above transition to happen as easily as possible.<BR>

<P><B>3. Eliminate requirements and alternatives analyses for commodity IT acquisitions. (1)</B><BR>
By December 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should, on an interim basis, authorize a waiver from the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation provisions on requirements and alternatives analyses for individual competitive acquisitions of commodity IT resources valued under $500,000 for products and $2.5 million for services over the life of the contract. This change recognizes that risk and complexity are greatly reduced in these smaller IT acquisitions and this additional paperwork and compliance with current regulations is unnecessary.<BR>

<P><B>4. Pilot test alternatives for commodity IT acquisitions. (1)</B><BR>

<P>Beginning December 1993, the administrator, GSA, should commence a two-year pilot for excluding commodity products and services from coverage by the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation. The definition of &quot;commodity&quot; to be used in the pilot should be developed in consultation with appropriate congressional officials, the interagency task team recommended above, and industry.<BR>

<P><B>5. Identify and test innovative procurement strategies that reduce the costs for IT items. (1)</B><BR>
By January 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should identify and begin pilot testing alternative procurement strategies to achieve greater cost savings and efficiencies for IT items. The goal of the procurement strategies would be to buy more IT items for the same or less cost.<BR>

<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<P>
<P>Procurement professionals need to work with, not against, the line manager to meet mission goals. Managers should have the ability to acquire many of the tools needed to do their job without going through a procurement office. This can be accomplished by allowing line managers to expand their use of commercially available purchase cards. Procurement professionals also need to focus more on understanding the customer's needs. The effectiveness of procurement organizations needs to be measured by results, as well as compliance with rules and regulations. We should achieve this by:<BR>
	*	expanding the use of commercial purchasing cards,<BR>
	*	focusing procurement people and organizations on customer needs and expectations, and<BR>
	*	streamlining procurement ethics laws.<BR>
The background, need, and details of each of these actions is presented in this section.<BR>

<H2>PROC09:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Lower Costs and Reduce Bureaucracy in Small Purchases Through the Use of Purchase Cards</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>In most federal agencies, employees have two ways to obtain needed goods and services. They can either submit a procurement request to a contracting officer or go to a central stockroom. Managers are frustrated because the cost of paperwork to obtain the items often exceeds the cost of the item, the process is very time-consuming, and they must go through procurement personnel to buy even simple, small-dollar items. A more efficient method is the use of a commercial purchase card service available through a General Services Administration (GSA) contract.1 The use of the purchase card is particularly effective for acquiring small amounts of supplies or services. For example, a manager or a procurement official can quickly acquire a single, fully equipped personal computer, software, and related supplies using the purchase card.<BR>

<P>Currently, federal agencies may choose to participate in the purchase card program. Under the program, authorized federal employees (including line managers) may use a commercial purchase card to pay for goods and services bought on behalf of the federal government. The card, called IMPAC (International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card), is recognized internationally and is accepted wherever the Visa card is accepted. Within the govern-ment, GSA is now the only supply source that accepts IMPAC. The card is used for purchases or for payments to settle outstanding contracts. The latter use is a less expensive alternative to traditional invoicing procedures.<BR>

<P>A very effective system exists to ensure accountability in the use of the card. The card is restricted to purchases and payments of less than $25,000, which by law are treated as small purchases. IMPAC may not be used to obtain cash advances. Average total purchases under the IMPAC program are $1.7 million per day. However, IMPAC can handle significantly larger volumes. The average individual purchase is $271. A fraction of a percent of all invoice amounts is currently charged to the government under the IMPAC contract. However, GSA is looking to reduce these costs by recompeting the contract with a provision for the successful contractor to provide the government with a rebate based on the total amount of purchases made on the card.<BR>

<P>IMPAC payments are processed using the same procedures established for holders of standard Visa cards. The employee signs the sales draft and receives a copy. Merchants receive prompt payment through Visa's international settlement system. Various daily, monthly, and quarterly reports are available to the government so that use of the cards can be monitored and controlled. Card holders receive monthly statements to verify billings. After the billings on a particular statement are verified by the card-holding employee, the statement is independently reviewed for approval before being sent to the agency's finance office for payment.<BR>

<P>Many agencies do not permit the use of IMPAC or heavily restrict its use, thereby making it impossible for most managers to use the card. Agencies that do use IMPAC determine the employees who get the cards and set limits on the types and amounts of small purchases that can be made by each employee. In some cases, agencies place spending limits directly on their IMPAC accounts.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The reasons to expand the use of IMPAC are significant. First, nearly all managers complain about the inability to get basic office tools on a timely basis. For example, if a manager has a need for commercially available personal computers and software for a special project or for a new employee, the manager should be able to get it quickly to satisfy the need. The use of the purchase card would be especially helpful here.<BR>

<P>Second, using IMPAC will result in major cost savings to the government and the taxpayers. Its use should virtually eliminate the paperwork normally required in preparing a purchase order and processing a government invoice. This is significant when applied to the 11 million purchases the government makes annually under the simplified acquisition procedures. If only 50 percent of all small purchase transactions made annually are done using the purchase card, a conservative estimate is that $180 million can be saved annually in federal administrative costs. Moreover, IMPAC costs less than traditional methods of making small purchases. The General Accounting Office estimates that using the purchase card instead of a purchase order saves between $29 and $227 per transaction.2 These savings are significant and achievable.<BR>

<P>Third, use of IMPAC enables managers to better manage cash, control funds, and reduce the cost of keeping imprest (petty cash) funds on hand. The reports of IMPAC activity permit careful tracking of the amount, type, and timing of small purchases. All transactions under IMPAC are more readily verified through a consolidated review, approval, and payment process. This permits managers to carefully and efficiently verify the transaction, receipt, and dollar value of every small purchase while eliminating the paperwork burdens and controls that imprest funds require.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Provide managers with the ability to authorize employees who have a bona fide need to buy small-dollar items directly using a purchase card. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By May 1994, the heads of all federal agencies should ensure that managers are able to make small purchases directly through the IMPAC program. In addition, they should:<BR>
	*	direct their respective comptrollers and procurement executives to adopt internal procedures to govern the use of IMPAC; such procedures should provide for dealing with fraud or misuse swiftly and sternly and provide assurance that small and small disad-vantaged businesses and mandated sources of supply are accorded all statutorily required considerations in use of the purchase card;<BR>
	*	ensure that anyone authorized to use the purchase card has appropriate training in simplified acquisition procedures and in small business and small disadvantaged business programs;<BR>
	*	encourage vendors who do not accept IMPAC to make arrangements to do so and provide information on how they can register for the program;<BR>
	*	direct contracting activities to review IMPAC purchases to identify high-dollar aggregate purchases from individual merchants so they can negotiate discounts with these vendors;<BR>
	*	limit internal procedures to those necessary to ensure the maximum effective use of IMPAC; and<BR>
	*	reduce the number and use of imprest funds in favor of IMPAC to save money through improved cash management.<BR>

<P><B>2. Encourage all government supply sources to accept the purchase card. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By May 1994, the heads of all agencies operating as government supply sources (Federal Prison Industries, Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Veterans Affairs, etc.) should start accepting IMPAC. In order to do so, the agencies must establish themselves as merchants under the IMPAC program.<BR>

<P><B>3. Amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to promote use of the purchase card. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By April 1995, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council should amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to promote and facilitate the use of purchase cards in making small purchases and ordering off of established contracts. The implementing regulation should also reduce paperwork to the absolute minimum amount necessary when using the purchase card.<BR>

<P><B>4. Amend Department of the Treasury regulations to authorize the use of the purchase card for cash advances. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By May 1994, the Secretary, Department of the Treasury, should amend regulations to authorize use of the purchase card for cash advances. The authorization should be limited to employees who currently serve as imprest fund cashiers. The card should be coded so only authorized employees many obtain cash advances. These employees could go to a local bank to obtain cash as needed instead of holding cash in imprest funds and filing vouchers to replenish the imprest fund. Documentation for cash expenditures can be processed as a normal part of the monthly reconciliation and payment of the purchase card bill. This will improve cash management and reduce paperwork and administrative controls associated with maintaining imprest funds.<BR>

<H1><B>Ensure Customer Focus in Procurement</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>In most federal agencies, an internal office assesses procurements by utilizing a variety of review activities, including Procurement Management Reviews (PMRs). A 1982 executive order directs agency heads and procurement executives to implement effective procurement systems.1 It also requires agency procurement executives to evaluate the performance of the agency's procurement system against specific criteria and certify that such criteria have been met. System criteria guidelines were established by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in 1984 and were intended to serve as guides for agencies in establishing and reviewing their procurement systems. While the system criteria established by OFPP address the effectiveness and efficiency of the system, they tend to focus on the process as opposed to the outcomes of procurements. The criteria fail to reflect the reinventing principles advocated by the National Performance Review, including a focus on results for the line manager.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>An ever-growing body of rules and regulations has emerged as the government has tried to reduce the incidence of fraud and prevent waste of taxpayer dollars. An OFPP survey of federal line managers indicates that many managers believe procurement professionals focus on meeting process requirements and rules at the expense of fast and reliable service, quality results, and customer needs. The survey also documents considerable miscommunication and lack of trust between line managers and procure-ment professionals, a further impediment to effective procurement programs.2<BR>

<P>The OFPP survey supports the conclusion that customer input should be considered in measuring the effectiveness of procurement services. The goal of procurement organiza-tions is to provide quality supplies and services required by users when they are needed, at a reasonable price, and in accord-ance with applicable laws and regulations. Line managers the customers should determine quality and timeliness, not the procurement organization that supports them. Compliance with laws and regulations should be one criterion in assessing the effectiveness of procurement services, but so too should customer input regarding the quality and timeliness of services provided.<BR>

<P>Some agencies have recognized the importance of and need for considering customer input. For example, one procurement organization within the Department of Commerce is establishing a board of directors, composed of senior-level customers, to rate the procurement organization against mutually agreed-upon standards.3 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration now includes customer input as one of its PMR elements.<BR>

<P>Good customer relations will restore balance to the contracting officer's basic role of providing excellent customer service within the limitations of law and regulations. Customer-oriented procurement programs will refocus attention from the means to the ends. <BR>

<H2>PROC11:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Improve Procurement Ethics Laws</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Integrity and accountability are two fundamental principles of the federal acquisition process that cannot be compromised. The laws and regulations governing government and contractor behavior must be clear and understood by all affected parties and the consequences must be severe for breaches of improper behavior.<BR>

<P>Under current laws, procurement officials and contractors are required to sign integrity certifications that identify a number of ethics provisions, including prohibitions against the disclosure of information and post-employment restrictions. Those who violate these statutory prohibitions are subject to a maximum period of imprisonment of five years, as well as criminal and civil fines.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The need for procurement ethics standards is best illustrated by the Pentagon &quot;Ill Wind&quot; investigations, which revealed many instances where individuals or companies were trafficking in procurement-sensitive information. Such conduct undermines the integrity of the federal procurement process and can result in increased contract costs. When those competing for government contracts are not treated fairly, or perceive their treatment as unfair, the government pays more than it would otherwise pay for products or services. Contract costs are increased because the government may be deceived into selecting a company or individual who does not provide the best value or performance. Also, percep-tions of unfair treatment can cause contractors to decide not to compete for certain procurements, thus depriving the government of lower contract costs that otherwise would result from increased competition.<BR>

<P>The procurement integrity laws include provisions to protect certain procurement-sensitive information (i.e., proprietary and source selection information) from improper disclosure. But they do not provide clear guidance because of their complexity and the difficulty of applying their restrictions to particular procurements. For example, the statutory definitions are so confusing as to when a procurement has begun or who is a procurement official or a competing contractor that those individuals who must follow these rules do not always know when they apply or whether they are violating a specific provision.<BR>

<P>Impediments to Open Communications Between Buyers and Sellers.  The procurement integrity laws have also had a chilling effect on legitimate and necessary discussions and exchange of information between contractors and federal agencies. In the commercial world, customers expect suppliers to provide them with valuable information regarding new product or service offerings, as well as to suggest solutions the supplier can provide to customer problems. Government customers should be able to gain the benefits of such information. However, the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law, known as the Section 800 Panel, found that despite their laudable objectives and purpose, the provisions of the procurement integrity laws seem to have generated more uncertainty and anxiety in the procurement community. By virtue of their complexity and the severity of the penalties for noncompliance, the information disclosure restrictions have imposed what some have characterized as a &quot;code of silence&quot; on both government and industry personnel during the course of a procurement. The former have often feared to offer and the latter feared to seek even the most routine information without specific authorization or, frequently, legal guidance.<BR>

<P>The Section 800 Panel quoted a senior NASA official who stated that &quot;if there is any doubt about whether a document or information should be discussed during a source selection, it does not get communicated. To guard against the enormous penalties for error, some corporations and government activities are said to have furnished their representatives with &Ocirc;Miranda cards' that coach them through a litany of preliminary questions each ought to ask the other before safely addressing the business at hand.&quot;1<BR>

<P>Increased <B>c</B>osts for <B>c</B>ertifications.  The procurement integrity laws also contain certification requirements that increase government costs and provide questionable value in return. A lesson learned from the Ill Wind investigations was that the conduct prosecuted was conscious, deliberate, and in some cases highly sophisticated criminal behavior. Such deliberate criminal conduct is unlikely to be deterred by the risk of additional penalties for false certification statement violations or detected as part of the certification process. But these measures are certain to mean higher costs for the government.<BR>

<P>Contract prices and agency administrative costs are increased by the need to obtain procurement integrity certifications from the thousands of contractors and agency employees who participate in procurements. For example, in at least four sealed bid procurements at the General Services Administration (GSA), the low bidder forgot to sign the certificate and GSA was forced to accept the next lowest bidder who had signed the form.2 GSAincurred the increased costs of going to a higher priced bidder, not because there was any wrongdoing, but because the rules regarding sealed bids did not allow GSA to let that low bidder come back and sign the form. In one of these four cases, the first, second, and third lowest bidders all forgot to sign the form and GSA was forced to go to the fourth lowest bidder. The original low bid was $109,777, and the fourth lowest bid was $133,000.3 The government paid $23,233 more than it should have because of this provision. The costs to the government and taxpayers are significant because GSA's experiences are not unique; they typify the governmentwide experience.<BR>

<P>Post-Employment <B>r</B>estrictions.  Finally, a problem exists with the procurement ethics laws regarding post-employment restrictions. The accumulation over time of several duplicative post-employment (revolving door) provisions applicable to agency employees who participate in procurements has resulted in considerable confusion. In this regard, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) stated, &quot;Little by little, rule by rule, we have addressed a problem here and a problem there with a quick statutory fix, stacking one on top of another until we have reached a point today that an employee who sincerely wants to do the right thing simply cannot understand what it is he has to do to comply.&quot;4<BR>

<P>A <B>s</B>olution.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and OGE have proposed revisions to the ethics laws through their legislative proposal jointly submitted to Congress in 1990 and 1991.5 This proposal addresses the issues and problems described above and strikes a proper balance between safeguarding the public against conflicts of interest and deterring qualified people from entering public service, while at the same time removing administrative impediments and barriers to effective communication between government and its business partners.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Action</B></H3>
<P><B>Strengthen and simplify procurement ethics laws. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Current ethics laws should be amended to:<BR>
	*	make them consistent govern-mentwide; <BR>
	* 	increase penalties from 5 to 15 years for the disclosure or receipt of certain sensitive source selection or proprietary information, thus placing prohibition of such conduct on a par with the crime of bribery of public officials, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years; <BR>
	* 	eliminate the procurement integrity certifications that increase government administrative and contract costs while adding little or no deterrence value; <BR>
	* 	add a new provision to the govern-mentwide post-employment (revolving door) law that would prohibit former government employees from using certain procurement-sensitive information to represent, aid, or advise others for one year after government service, and eliminate several overlapping or duplicative statutory provisions; and<BR>
	*	eliminate the certification requirement for purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold. <BR>
These changes would strengthen and streamline current ethics laws by more effectively punishing deliberate offenders, providing clearer guidance on procurement ethics, reducing unnecessary contract and agency administrative costs, and removing administrative barriers to effective communication between government and private sector vendors.<BR>

<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<P>
<P>Line managers must have expanded access to competitively priced supplies and services. The procurement system seeks to foster &quot;full and open competition.&quot; Competition is perhaps the most powerful means available for keeping suppliers efficient and responsive. To support line managers effectively, the procurement system should, to the fullest extent possible, offer competitively priced supply sources. <BR>

<P>One effective way to do this would be as suggested in our proposed action to open federal, state, and local governmental supply schedules to use by all government agencies and to cooperate on other procurement needs. The details of this idea are presented in this section.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Consolidated government procurement actions tend to maximize the economic advantage of volume buying with lower costs for the taxpayer. Currently, governments at various levels cannot enter into arrangements to consolidate their procurement requirements and then place orders under one another's contracts. In addition, federal grantees and qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind and others with severe disabilities, which are awarded government contracts under the program operated by the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled, are not authorized to use federal supply services.<BR>

<P>The federal government supply sources, such as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), consolidate the requirements of various federal agencies for procurement purposes. As a result, these procuring agencies secure price advantages from volume buying. In certain circumstances, it is to the federal government's advantage to use supply sources established by state and local governments.<BR>

<P>Federal government supply sources are currently authorized to procure and supply personal property and non-personal services for the use of executive agencies, mixed-ownership government corporations,1 the District of Columbia, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol, and certain other organizations authorized by law to use federal supply sources. However, they cannot acquire items for state or local governments, nor may federal agencies use state or local supply sources.<BR>

<P>Federal agencies must acquire certain supplies and services from qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind or others with severe disabilities approved by the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled.2 Normally the contracts with these nonprofit agencies are fixed-price contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides that agencies may authorize certain contractors (generally cost-reimbursement contractors) to use government supply sources if it is in the government's interest to do so.3<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>Federal managers will benefit if they have the option of entering into arrangements with state and local governments to consolidate requirements for procurements under a single contract.<BR>

<P>One recent example involving the Department of Veterans Affairs demonstrates the potential benefits. A state Veterans Home was constructed on the federal VA Medical Center site in Albany, New York. This provided veterans with convenient access to both VA and state medical facilities. Even though the state home was located on federal property, the VA and the state could not consolidate their common service requirements under one contract. Both VA and the state had to enter into separate contracts for services such as snow removal, trash removal, and laundering. As a result, the VA and state were unable to achieve the cost efficiencies that would have resulted from single contracts.<BR>

<P>Allowing governments at various levels to enter into agreements to use one another's contracts represents a win-win situation for the governments and the taxpayers. Governments at all levels will reduce administrative staffs and costs if they are authorized to use one another's contracts. In addition, all levels of government will be able to negotiate better prices as a result of the increased volume of sales under the contracts. Contract consolidation will be particularly beneficial to governments in the areas of new technology, such as alternate fuel vehicles, energy-efficient computers, and products containing recycled material. Governments at all levels would have a greater impact on the marketplace and could acquire products and services at lower cost.<BR>

<P>If grantees could use federal supply sources, specifically the Multiple Award Schedules, they would be able to do more with the funds provided to them through the grant. Similarly, nonprofit agencies awarded contracts under the program administered by the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled would be able to reduce the cost of the supplies or services provided to federal agencies under such contracts if they were able to acquire the supplies used to produce the item or service at a lower cost. The workforce and procurement systems are already in place at the federal level to accomplish this.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Allow state and local governments, grantees, and certain nonprofit agencies to use federal supply contracts. (3)</B><BR>

<P>State and local governments (including Indian tribal governments), grantees, and nonprofit agencies awarded contracts under the program administered by the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled should be authorized to use nonmandatory federal contracts as sources of supply or services. Grantees and nonprofit agencies should only be authorized to use federal supply sources (e.g. nonmandatory Multiple Award Schedules) if authorized by the federal agency awarding the grant or contract. In addition, they could only use or acquire items to be used in direct performance of the grant or contract. The use of federal contract sources would be optional for all these non-federal entities.<BR>

<P>2. Allow federal agencies to enter into agreements to share state and local government supply sources. (3)<BR>

<P>Federal agencies should be authorized to enter into agreements to allow the federal government to use contracts awarded by state or local governments when it is cost-effective to do so. Such agreements should ensure federal social and economic policy goals are properly considered.<BR>

<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<P>
<P>The government market, while large, is not as dominant as it once was. It can no longer mandate special practices and treatment if it desires commercial items at competitive prices. In general, citizens and services will benefit most by aligning government procurement practices with those of the commercial sector, especially with the worldwide movement to electronic document interchange and electronic commerce. The government will benefit by reduced product costs and faster product delivery. <BR>

<P>To foster competition, commercial practices, and excellence of vendor performance, we should:<BR>
	*	foster reliance on the commercial marketplace,<BR>
	*	expand electronic commerce,<BR>
	*	encourage best value procurement,<BR>
	*	promote excellence in vendor performance,<BR>
	*	authorize a two-phase competitive source selection process,<BR>
	*	authorize multiyear contracts,<BR>

<H1><B>Foster Reliance on </B></H1>
<P>
<H1><B>the Commercial Marketplace</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Line managers often have difficulty acquiring items commonly sold in the commercial marketplace because the federal procurement system generally relies on complex, rigid rules and procedures, excessive paperwork, detailed design specifications, and in-process inspections and audits to buy goods and services. To make matters worse for the government, some contractors feel pressured to separate their government production facilities from their commercial facilities to minimize the burden of government regulations as they compete in the world marketplace. The IBM Federal Systems Company is a good example; it provides quality products and services to the federal government, yet federal agencies cannot normally buy from commercial IBM companies that serve other large private sector businesses.<BR>

<P>Controls on buying unique items developed for the federal government help ensure accountability, but are costly when applied to commercial products. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reports that it costs five times more to bid on a government requirement than on a commercial job. Once a contractor has obtained a government contract, it costs that contractor three times its usual administrative expenses to comply with government controls.1 For example, the Defense Science Board found that integrated circuits built to military specifications cost the government up to 15 times as much as better circuits cost private buyers.2<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Fostering reliance on the commercial marketplace should result in substantial savings to the government and its business partners. The current cost to industry of doing business with the government is high. A recent study done for the Defense Systems Management College indicates the added costs for all federally imposed requirements range up to 12 percent or more of total contract costs, depending on the contractor and the individual contract.3 While it is difficult to accurately estimate the savings that will accrue from greater reliance on the commercial marketplace, it is clear that the potential for savings is significant. Should savings of only 1 percent annually occur in total federal purchases of equipment and supplies, up to $700 million in savings per year could be passed to the government and taxpayer.4<BR>

<P>The Use of Government Specifications.  When the government contracts with commercial vendors, it sometimes imposes extensive detailed requirements. Take, for example, the Department of Defense's solicitations for bed pillows, cleaning cloths, and automotive drain pans. The specifica-tions for these items are contained in 14, 14, and 8 pages respectively.5 Such requirements are often unlike anything a commercial firm includes in its contracts for commercial supplies. To help reduce the effect of these impediments and increase the use of commercial items, Congress directed the Department of Defense to prepare a simplified uniform contract.6 However, even a simplified contract may contain about 100 clauses, due to statutory requirements, with the average solicitation containing 30 to 70 clauses.7<BR>

<P>The report <I>Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law</I> by the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress (known as the Section 800 Panel) addressed this problem and recommended changes in statutes.8 The Panel identified 889 provisions of law related to defense acquisition and found that many of the statutes create barriers for commercial firms because they disrupt established manufacturing methods, sources of supply, and personnel practices. When the commercial item is on the shelf and the government asks a firm to certify it has used special sources for components, the firm cannot easily do so. To build a new item using government-required practices is generally not economical for the government or the firm, especially if it is a small business.<BR>

<P>Where the size of the procurement is suitable to pay a contractor to apply contract provisions unique to the government, it costs the contractor, and eventually the govern-ment, more money. Any burdens the government imposes on U.S. suppliers affects the competitiveness of U.S. industry, because such burdens raise suppliers' thresholds of profitability. The procurement system should require only those extra costs that are absolutely necessary to satisfy public interests. In general, the more we rely on commercial techniques in the commercial marketplace, the more economic benefits will accrue. The government, and hence the taxpayers, will pay less to buy better products faster.<BR>

<P>A <B>s</B>uccess <B>s</B>tory.  FTS2000 procurement is an excellent success story of saving contract costs and taxpayer dollars by relying more on the commercial marketplace and commercial practices. The federal govern-ment started in the early 1960s to slowly build its own long-distance network by leasing long-distance telephone lines and switches. This resulted in a rate of 30 to 40 cents per minute in the 1980s while commercial customers were paying 20 cents a minute. GSA developed a strategy to pay only for minutes used, like other commercial customers, and not lease equipment, which it had done previously. The competed FTS2000 contracts resulted in a per-minute price of 8 cents by taking advantage of commercially optimized networks and good commercial practices. These contracts are saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year.<BR>

<P>Barriers to <B>c</B>hange.  The major impediments to increased government-commercial integration can be grouped into five areas:<BR>

<P>	*	complex federal rules and procedures make it difficult for contracting officials to perform market research, evaluate different ways of meeting needs, and select the best values;<BR>
	*	government-unique &quot;how to&quot; specifications and standards limit competition and creativity by failing to use existing commercial specifications for form, fit, function, and performance;<BR>
	*	cost and pricing data submission requirements and special cost accounting standards impose substantial burdens and risks on contractors;<BR>
	*	technical data rights provisions discourage contractors from investing in and applying advanced commercial technologies to solve government problems; and<BR>
	*	the determination of a domestic end product under the Buy American Act9 is difficult to use and conflicts with the Trade Agreements Ac&quot;0 test of &quot;substantial transformation&quot; of components into end products, often putting U.S. suppliers at a disadvan-tage compared with suppliers from other countries.<BR>

<P>A number of recommendations for reform and removal of impediments have already been identified. The Section 800 Panel considered these challenges and recom-mended specific changes in statutes. The President's Report on High Technology, issued in February 1993, includes recommendations to ease the burden on commercial contractors.11 In addition, because of the economic impact of a shrinking defense budget on major employers in the United States, the National Economic Council is also addressing the issue in its study of conversion of the defense industry.<BR>

<P>Without changes to the current system, the inability of the federal government to reap the benefits of commercial technology at good commercially discounted prices will inanely continue. Moreover, it will be a continuing drain on the resources of U.S. suppliers as they compete on a global scale and a hindrance to the ability of defense contractors to quickly convert their unique products and practices into commercial enterprises.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Action</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>Make it easier to buy commercial items. (3)</B><BR>
Legislation should be enacted to:<BR>
	*	amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to provide a better definition of commercial items;<BR>
	*	amend the Truth in Negotiation Act to relax the requirements for cost and pricing data when a contract for commercial items is involved and to provide an expanded definition of adequate price competition;<BR>
	*	provide new exemptions to technical data requirements in commercial item acquisitions;<BR>
	*	amend the Buy American Act to increase competitiveness of U.S. firms by adopting the &quot;substantial transformation&quot; test now applied under the Trade Agreements Ac&quot;2 to determine whether an offered product is from a foreign source; and<BR>
	*	provide for a new federal government commercial code, which would contain &quot;commercial-style procedures&quot; and eliminate selected provisions of law for specialized, social, or economic provisions.<BR>

<H1><B>Expand Electronic Commerce for Federal Acquisition</B></H1>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Electronic commerce (EC) is the comprehensive, end-to-end electronic exchange of information needed to conduct business.<BR>

<P>Since 1979, the private sector and the Accredited Standards Committee of the American National Standards Institute have aggressively sponsored electronic data interchange (EDI). Within the federal government, the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 161 established the EDI standard.1 In EDI, data that would traditionally be conveyed in paper documents are transmitted or communicated electronically according to established rules and formats. Major industry associations and their member firms are committing significant resources to EDI. Even many small businesses have voiced their support and encouragement for the government to use EDI to provide electronic notification of small purchase opportunities.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The potential for savings from reengineering and automating the federal procurement system is enormous considering that the federal acquisition system involves over 20 million transactions and $200 billion each year. A test of EC at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base illustrates the significant savings that can be achieved. This test validated that EDI can reduce the cost of purchased goods by almost 10 percent while reducing lead time by one-third and doubling buyer productivity. If applied governmentwide, this system has the potential for saving the government and taxpayers up to $500 million per year and eliminating 1,200 federal jobs due to increased competition among vendors and reduced federal paperwork.2 Another significant side benefit of EC, as derived from the pilot, is that it increased awards going to small businesses.<BR>

<P>The private sector has been turning to EDI for some time now because it saves money. The federal government must catch up with the private sector to reduce its costs of doing business. Several federal acquisition organizations have recognized this need and started implementing local versions of EDI. However, if the federal acquisition community is to maintain an effective and efficient interface with the vendor community, it must implement EDI in a standard and consistent manner. Vendors should be able to connect with the federal EC system through a single implementation standard and should not be required to comply with varying implementations to conduct business with different federal agencies.<BR>

<P>The government should build its EC system in consideration of the following private sector EDI community findings and observations:<BR>

<P>	*	Successful implementation of EDI requires the full commitment of a company's top management, without which company-wide implementation of EDI will not only be wasteful and disorganized, but will likely fail.<BR>
	*	The requirement to use EDI should be based on a business decision, and its implementation should be assigned to the functional organization (e.g. purchasing) that it supports not the Information Resources Management (IRM) organization.<BR>
	*	Implementation of EDI and the development of specific EDI transaction guidelines and conventions should begin with basic business transactions, such as requests for quotations and purchase orders. More complex transactions, such as contracts, should follow.<BR>
	*	Reengineering functional processes (i.e., eliminating a particular step in a process to avoid the expense of automation) is necessary to realize the full benefits of EDI.3<BR>

<P>Recent operational tests have verified that both industry and the government benefit from using EDI for small purchases. For industry, the benefits include one-time governmentwide registration, elimination of the need for local company representatives, and increased access to procurement information. For government, the benefits include increased competition, improved customer support, the ability to use existing agency automated acquisition systems, and access to commercial Value Added Network services (e.g. subscription computer services such as Prodigy or CompuServe) at no cost to the government.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Establish a governmentwide acquisition program for engaging in electronic commerce. (2)</B><BR>

<P>The President should issue a directive that requires the President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, to provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce for federal acquisition through the following actions: <BR>

<P>	*	by March 1994, define the architecture for the governmentwide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the federal electronic system;<BR>
	*	by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the federal government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests4 for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin governmentwide implementation;<BR>
	*	by July 1995, implement a full-scale federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and<BR>
	*	by January 1997, require the heads of all agencies to have completed implementation of the federal electronic commerce system in their respective agencies.<BR>

<P><B>2. Amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to facilitate electronic commerce. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By May 1994, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council should revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation to support full implementation of EDI and EC by the federal acquisition community.<BR>

<H1><B>Encourage Best Value Procurement</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Determining the successful competitor for a government contract requires a full assessment of available information. The award of a contract to a supplier based on lowest price alone can be a false economy if there is subsequent default, late delivery, or other unsatisfactory performance resulting in additional contractual or administrative costs. It is essential that all vendors are treated fairly in the competitive process. However, the needs of a vendor should not supersede those of the taxpayers and federal agencies. Competent, cost-efficient suppliers provide the best value to the government. While it is important that government purchases be made at a reasonable price, this should not require that an award be made to a supplier solely because the supplier submits the lowest offer.1<BR>

<P>There are two basic methods of procurement sealed bid and negotiation. When sealed bid procedures are used, there is a public bid opening and the award must be made to the responsible offeror submitting the lowest offer based on price and price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges). When the negotiated method of procure-ment is used, however, the government has considerable latitude in structuring the procurement and can consider both price and other factors (e.g., technical capabilities, qualifications of key personnel, etc.) in selecting the contractor. Agencies have broad discretion in selecting factors to be considered, but must always consider price or cost to the government.<BR>

<P>Allowing for the possibility of selecting other than the lowest offeror does not mean buying a Cadillac or buying supplies or services beyond the government's minimum needs. It simply means considering value differences between offers such as past performance records, quality of proposed solutions, and cost differences, and then choosing the best overall value. It means permitting the consideration of all factors when buying goods and services the way smart buyers in business make trade-off decisions to determine best value. The benefits of making best overall value source selection decisions can result in improved mission performance and lower life-cycle costs. It can also help to encourage vendors to provide their best products and services to the government.<BR>

<P>When a procurement is structured to consider both price and other factors in making the selection to provide the greatest value<I> </I>to the government, it is often referred to as a &quot;best value&quot;<I> </I>procurement. The average person makes purchases on the basis of best value or greatest value every day. For example, if brand A batteries cost $1.00 and last 10 hours, and brand B batteries cost $1.50 but last 20 hours, the average person would consider brand B to be the best value.<BR>

<P>Federal regulations provide for awards based on the greatest value and cite examples where the approach can be used.2 Examples cited are in the acquisition of research and development, professional services, or cost-reimbursement contracts. However, the process outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation for greatest value or best value procurements is complex and requires far more time and resources than other types of procurements. As a result, many procure-ment officials feel more comfortable awarding contracts based on lowest cost rather than best value.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>Many federal agencies rely heavily on support from contractors to accomplish agency missions. Unless the contractors share an agency's commitment to quality, the agency cannot improve the quality of service provided to taxpayers. The government must find ways to reward contractors who perform and remove from the federal acquisition system those who do not. Acquisition strategies designed to support and foster the quality revolution need to be promoted and used to the fullest extent.<BR>

<P>The federal government faces many problems implementing this quality revolu-tion in the procurement process. Even though the federal regulations clearly state that a prospective contractor must demon-strate that it is responsible, many contracting officers feel that the burden of proof is instead theirs. Contracting officers are often reluctant to reject offers from contractors who have a poor past performance record or who otherwise do not appear to be capable of performing. The reluctance is, in part, due to the fear of being second-guessed by reviewers, protests, or other legal action.3<BR>

<P>Agencies do not always consider innovative ways to include quality considerations, such as past performance, when developing acquisition strategies. There needs to be a total rethinking and redefining of what best value means and how it can be used in all types of procurement strategies. This includes not only negotiated procurements that use price and other factors, but also other negotiated and sealed bid procurements.<BR>

<P>In the area of &quot;greatest value&quot;<I> </I>or so-called &quot;best value&quot;<I> </I>procurement, many protests before the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) have identified the need to train the procurement workforce on when and how to effectively use the technique in source selection. In addition, a survey of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) users conducted by the General Services Administration (GSA) indicates that the FAR coverage on source selection or use of the greatest value needs to provide better guidance, but not detailed or prescriptive regulations.4<BR>

<P>Several agencies (e.g., the Defense Logistics Agency, GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have undertaken efforts to streamline the source selection process, share information on best practices, and educate contracting personnel on when and how to use the process effectively. Despite these efforts, the federal procurement workforce, as a whole, needs further training on the use of source selection techniques.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Define &quot;best value&quot; and provide regulatory guidance to implement a program for buying on a best value basis. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By April 1995, the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in cooperation with the FAR Council and regulatory agencies, should formally define the concept of &quot;best value.<I>&quot; </I>In doing so, the definition and related policy and regulatory guidance should be structured so that it (a) applies to all procurements, (b) fosters the notion that the government will measure vendor performance and only deal with contractors who demonstrate a commitment to quality, and (c) promotes the concept of &quot;value for money.&quot;<I> </I>The FAR should be reviewed and appropriately revised as a part of this effort. In developing FAR coverage, every effort should be made to minimize complexity and provide for a streamlined process of making contract awards when price and other factors are considered in the evaluation process. Guidance should be provided on issues such as drafting solicitation language to clearly communicate the award factors to be considered and their relative weight, making cost/technical trade-off decisions, and debriefing offerors.<BR>

<P><B>2. Issue a guide on the use of &quot;best practices&quot; source selection techniques. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By April 1995, the Director, OMB, should identify agencies with successful programs for the use of the greatest value approach and, with their and the FAR Council's help, develop a best practices guide or series of guides on the elements of best value, such as past performance, price/technical trade-offs, evaluation of key personnel, and cost realism. These guides  should share the lessons learned by the agencies with procurement personnel throughout the government.<BR>

<P><B>3. Train procurement officials on source selection techniques. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Administrator, General Services Administration, should direct the Federal Acquisition Institute to develop a competency-based course to provide training to government contracting officials on the use of various source selection techniques. The course content should be revised as appropriate to reflect the regulatory and management guidance developed from the completion of action items 1 and 2.<BR>

<H2>PROC16:</H2>
<P>
<H1><B>Promote Excellence in Vendor Performance</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>When the government makes a contract, it takes on a private-sector partner to accomplish a public purpose. The government must be assured that its partner is reliable by examining its past performance. Procurement actions should also encourage suppliers to value government business, provide high-quality supplies and services on time and at a reasonable price, and be compatible with public policy goals.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>Improvements in measuring and recognizing a contractor's performance as part of contract award, as well as improve-ments in the government's management of its contracts, will lead to greater value for the government and taxpayer.<BR>

<P>The most important means for improving vendor performance is for the government's evaluation process in source selection to seriously consider vendor past performance when making new contract awards. Evaluation of vendor past performance plays a crucial role in vendor selection in the private sector. Yet, one of the most unfortunate features of the current procurement system is that the evaluation process for making contract awards gives little or no weight to vendors' past perfor-mance on earlier contracts.<BR>

<P>Causes of <B>p</B>oor <B>q</B>uality.  The quality of performance the government gets from its vendors is likely to be significantly worse when:<BR>

<P>	*	a history of vendor performance is not maintained for use by the government in awarding future contracts, and<BR>
	*	the government fails to use a powerful incentive for better contractor performance by not using information on past performance as an important factor in making new contractor awards.<BR>
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires contracting officers to consider vendor performance. Nonetheless, most contracting officers have not used vendor performance data to maximum advantage. Vendors often have to provide some outside references in a negotiated procurement but may choose the references to submit. Many line managers believe references are often not candid for fear of possible legal liability, and the weight given to vendor references in the evaluation scoring system is extremely small. Even when limiting outside references, agencies deprive themselves of the other data most likely to be accurate and that, if used, exerts the most powerful incentive on vendor performance information about vendor performance within the agency itself.<BR>

<P>The federal government must also improve its contract management activities with regard to vendor performance. A Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) study on the quality of the contracting workforce finds that the distrust built into the present federal procurement system is not effective in reducing waste, fraud, or abuse, despite its high cost. In the MSPB study, a contractor states that &quot;increased oversight has become cumbersome, delayed the process, and has created an atmosphere of fear and distrust. This has greatly impacted the decision making process and has increased overall costs to both the government and the contractor.&quot;1 This one contractor's statement is representative of the way a majority of contractors view the federal procurement system.<BR>

<P>The <B>c</B>osts of <B>c</B>ompliance.  A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that contractor compliance with government controls costs three times what commercial companies spend on administrative costs.2 Burdens that the government imposes on its suppliers often are translated into higher prices charged to the government, and sometimes to commercial customers.<BR>

<P>In many respects, the success of any procurement action hinges on how well the contract is administered to ensure value to the government. In broad terms, contract administration responsibilities comprise fiscal and cost accounting methods, control of government property, quality control, production control, pricing and price re-determination where authorized, compliance with standard contract clauses, subcontract-ing consent, and in some cases, contract terminations.<BR>

<P>Each agency is organized differently to provide contract administration. Within the Department of Defense (DOD), there are two specialized organizations: the Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) with 19,000 people looking after $750 billion under 420,000 contracts for 25,000 contractors, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), with 6,000 people responsible for about $260 billion in contract audit work. Civilian agencies often rely on their contracting officer to perform administration and their Office of Inspector General (IG) to perform contract audits. However, most IGs use DCAA for some or all of their audits. The interagency OMB SWAT<I> </I>Team Report on Civilian Agency Contracting found certain weaknesses in the performance of contract audit and administration functions.3 An interagency group on Civilian Contract Administration Services (CIVICAS) was formed to assess alternative means for heads of agencies to efficiently meet their responsibilities to ensure performance under properly managed contracts.<BR>

<P>Current contract administration activities are not reviewed from a governmentwide perspective to measure output or value. Defense agencies are being downsized while civilian agencies are looking to improve their contract administration practices. There is no coordinating body to set performance goals or help determine the effectiveness of contract actions in meeting line manager needs through the contracting process. While the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) could establish standards in this area, true change will come about only with a team approach of both the government and its contractors seeking the best means to meet contract requirements.<BR>

<P>Examples of <B>s</B>uccess.  One example of the type of program that captures the tenets of a trust-centered team approach is the Process-Oriented Contract Administration Services (PROCAS) program developed by the Defense Logistics Agency. This program works with contractors to accredit internal control procedures to lessen government controls. Another example, in the audit area, is Motorola's experience with DCAA. In 1988, it took one year to get, review, report, and decide on overhead rates, mainly because the contractor did not always know what the government wanted. DCAA worked with internal company auditors in 1989 and cut the total process to five weeks, resulting in significant savings for all parties. Another cooperative approach to improve contract administration is the work of the Army's Corps of Engineers to avoid costly disputes and an adversarial environment in its construction contracts. Under a partnering concept, which sets out how the parties will work through any disagreements that arise under the contract, the Corps has not had a single case of litigation. This helps keeps both parties focused as a team on the contract goals.<BR>

<P>The federal procurement system must take into account vendor performance, both prior to contract award and during contract administration, to ensure that agency needs for continuous, reliable service are met and taxpayer dollars are well spent.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Establish an interagency Excellence in Vendor Performance Forum. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), should establish an interagency Excellence in Vendor Performance Forum to develop policies and techniques to measure contractor performance and use this information in source selection decisions. A change should be made in the procurement system throughout the government so that past performance becomes a genuine and serious part of the source selection process. The Director, OMB, should work with agencies to experiment with different methods for getting past performance to play a significant role in the procurement process and to publicize best practices throughout the government. Changes should include:<BR>

<P>	*	developing procedures for systematically gathering and using ongoing performance information on an agency's vendors, obtained from those interacting with vendors (users and contract administration personnel);<BR>
	*	giving past performance a weight in evaluation scoring systems significant enough to have a real impact on award decisions and to be noticed by the vendor community; <BR>
	*	making satisfaction of customers (users and contract administration personnel) with vendor performance one measure used to evaluate contracting officers involved in the contract award process;<BR>
	*	establishing a collaborative cost-effective governmentwide contract administration program emphasizing cross-servicing agreements among agencies to manage contracts to avoid unnecessary duplication;<BR>
	*	engaging government contractors in establishing partnering programs and measurable goals for reducing administrative burdens on both government and industry while ensuring contractor performance and value to the government; and<BR>
	*	obtaining contractor input in policy deliberations through surveys, town meetings, or other means to help develop effective and accountable contract management programs.<BR>
By April 1995, the Director, OMB, should issue a &quot;best practices&quot; manual that outlines the techniques to measure and use vendor information in source selection decisions.<BR>

<P><B>2. Establish an award for contractor and government acquisition excellence. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Director, OMB, and agencies should implement procedures for agencies to nominate contractors and government contracting staff for exceptional performance awards in various categories.<BR>

<P>
<H1><B>Authorize a Two-Phase Competitive Source Selection Process</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Federal law requires executive agencies to evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation. In the case of competitive proposals, the law requires that the government conduct, before award of the contract, written or oral discussions with all responsible sources submitting proposals within the competitive range, considering only price and other factors included in the solicitation.<BR>

<P>In certain negotiated procurements, the requirement to consider price in establishing the competitive range and include all proposals with a reasonable chance of being selected for award creates problems for both prospective offerors and the government. This is especially problematic for contracts that require an offeror to perform a substantial amount of design work in order to prepare its proposal. For example, in design-build construction procurement, it is very costly for prospective offerors to compete because they must do a considerable amount of the design work before they can price their proposal. Under a design-build construction contract, the contractor is responsible for designing and constructing the building or other public work. This differs from the traditional approach, where a contract is awarded to an architect-engineer firm that designs the project, and after the design is complete, separate bids for construction are solicited and a contract is awarded.<BR>

<P>When the government uses a design-build approach, contractors often complain of the high cost to compete for such projects and urge the government to use a two-phase process that would focus on qualifications and concepts in the first phase and limit competition in the second phase to a specified number of contractors. This would control a contractor's expenses in the first stage and assure those contractors that do incur the expense in the second phase that they have a realistic chance of being selected for the award.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>Executive agencies and departments involved in contracting for design-build construction projects, lease construction projects, prototype production, or other similarly complex projects where the cost of preparing and submitting a proposal is significant would benefit by using a two-phase process. It is similar to the commercial practice of &quot;shortlisting,&quot; where the best quality firms are chosen up-front, and only then asked to engage in a more detailed technical and price competition.<BR>

<P>The two-phase process would also permit more efficient use of government personnel by allowing them to focus on the detailed proposals of the most qualified offerors and expedite the selection, evaluation, and award process. Such limited competition should ensure reasonable prices while offering the government a range of designs or approaches to satisfying the government's requirement. This would benefit both prospective contractors and the government. This process would shorten the lead time for such procurements, reduce costs, and provide for more timely fulfillment of the customers' needs.<BR>

<P>The regulations and case law related to the establishment of the competitive range currently preclude the government from predetermining the number of offerors considered to be within the competitive range. The government is required to see what the market produces and then determine which offerors, when evaluated against the factors specified in the solicitation, have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. In a tight economic market with limited commercial activity, there can be intense competition for government contracts. For example, it is not uncommon for the government to receive more than 25 offers on major design-build construction projects. Often the offers are from well-qualified local firms and national real estate developers, and the final competitive range includes several offerors that have submitted outstanding proposals. Negotiating with all offerors in the competitive range requires a substantial amount of time, resources, and costs for the government and the offerors.<BR>

<P>If the government continues to use the current process, it will discourage some of the best offerors from competing because they are becoming more and more reluctant to expend the physical resources and costs when faced with unlimited competition for the award. If competition is limited in the second stage, the offerors would be more likely and willing to expend the resources because they would feel that they have a realistic chance of getting the award.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Action</B></H3>
<P><B>Authorize the use of a two-phase selection process for certain types of contracts. (3)</B><BR>
The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act and the Armed Services Act should be amended to authorize the use of a two-phase selection process for the evaluation and award of contracts when a substantial amount of project design work must be accomplished before offerors can develop a price proposal, or in other complex projects where the cost of preparing and submitting a proposal is significant.1 The process would provide for the submission of statements of qualifications, performance data, and limited technical proposals in the first phase. Based on evaluation of these submissions, the government would invite up to five offerors to submit detailed technical proposals and price proposals. No more than five offerors would be selected, based on an evaluation of the qualification statements and limited technical proposals against selection criteria/factors specified in the solicitation. In the second phase, the government would evaluate the detailed technical and price proposals and conduct discussions, as necessary, prior to the final selection of the offeror.<BR>

<P>
<H1><B>Authorize Multiyear Contracts</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Most federal agencies operate with annual appropriations. This limits their ability to contract for periods that extend beyond the end of the fiscal year. The lack of authority to cross fiscal years creates uncertainty as to whether a contractor and its services will be available to agencies after September 30, and imposes additional paperwork burdens on contracting personnel. There are circumstances where contracting for more than one year would reduce the overall cost of acquiring supplies and services. The use of multiyear contracts provides contractors with a guarantee of work over a period of years, lowers risk, and as a result produces lower contract prices. It would also provide agencies with a smaller number of contract actions and reduce the workload associated with exercising contract options. Special legislative authority to conduct multiyear procurement has been given to some agencies for selected programs. However, the authority is limited.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The General Accounting Office (GAO) has identified several benefits of multiyear contracting.1 Specifically, GAO indicated that:<BR>
	*	contract prices could be reduced for agency service and supply needs,<BR>
	*	administrative costs to federal agencies could be reduced,<BR>
	*	the quality of performance and service from contractors could increase,<BR>
	*	competition for government contracts could increase, and<BR>
	*	small business interests would be enhanced and be able to compete better in their market segment.<BR>
The Department of Defense (DOD) has multiyear contracting authority and multiyear funding authority for many of its weapons programs. The authority enables defense contractors to spread their costs over a larger production base, thus reducing the cost per item. While not in the same business, many civilian agencies buy supplies, equipment, systems, and services to support vital mission programs that go beyond the fiscal year appropriation.<BR>

<P>Another problem, which is tied to the limitation on contracting with annual funds for periods that extend beyond the end of the fiscal year, relates to severable services (e.g., services that are performed on a regular basis over a period of time like housekeeping, guard services, etc.). Currently, agencies are precluded from contracting for severable services for periods that extend beyond the fiscal year unless they have specific statutory authority to do so. While a few agencies (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services) have been authorized to contract for periods that cross fiscal years so long as the term does not exceed one year, most agencies do not have similar authority. As a result, agencies are placed in an impossible situation either award all severable service contracts so they expire September 30 or take the risk of being accused of technically violating the Antideficiency Act.2<BR>

<P>The inability to award multiyear contracts causes a major paperwork burden that increases federal administrative costs. At the end of each fiscal year, contracting officials must modify every federal contract funded with annual funds to add funding for the new contract period. This exercise is costly and unnecessary and is exacerbated when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal year. In such cases, a notice must be sent to every one of these contractors each time there is a continuing resolution, even if the resolution is only for a few days, as has often been the case.<BR>

<P>The ability to award multiyear contracts will allow federal agencies to reduce the administrative time and resources associated with recompeting contracts annually. It will also provide federal managers with continuity of service and avoid going through a learning process every year with a new contractor.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P><B>1. Authorize multiyear contracts. (3)</B><BR>
The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act should be amended to authorize agencies to contract for periods not in excess of 10 years when (a) appropriations are available and adequate for payment for the first fiscal year; (b) the agency determines that the government's need for the property or service being acquired is reasonably firm and continuing; and (c) such a contract would serve the best interests of the federal government by encouraging competition or promoting economies in administration, performance, and operation, and will not inhibit small business participation. Agencies should ensure that the multiyear contract would be either fully funded or funded for the first fiscal year plus any estimated cancellation costs. The availability of funds clause should be structured to provide that the contractor would be notified if funds are <I>not</I> appropriated by Congress and made available for payment under the contract. Internal agency procedures must also provide for program offices and/or budget offices to notify contracting offices as to the continued availability of funds. In the event funds are not made available for subsequent fiscal years, the contract would be cancelled and cancellation costs paid from funds originally obligated.<BR>

<P><B>2. Allow contracts for severable services to cross fiscal years. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act should be amended to authorize civilian agencies that use annual appropriations to enter into contracts for severable services with a period of performance that crosses fiscal years so long as the term does not exceed one year unless the contract is a multiyear contract specifically authorized by statute. This legislation would allow federal agencies to reduce their administrative costs by eliminating the need for &quot;availability of funds&quot; clauses.<BR>

<P>
<H1><B>Conform Certain Statutory Requirements for Civilian Agencies to Those of Defense Agencies</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Three statutory requirements formerly applied governmentwide have been repealed or amended only for defense-related agencies. They are:<BR>

<P>	*	The requirement to obtain commercial pricing certificates when other than full and open competition is used. The law requires that offerors certify that prices offered for parts or components are not more than their lowest commercial prices, or submit a written statement specifying the amount of the difference between their lowest commercial price for the parts of components and the prices offered.1<BR>
	*	The limitation on accepting an initial offer and awarding a contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest priced offer.2<BR>
	*	The requirement to obtain certified cost or pricing data before awarding a negotiated contract that exceeds $100,000.<BR>
In addition, DOD has been given authority to enter into cooperative agreements to conduct advanced research projects, primarily through the Advanced Research Projects Agency, but civilian agencies have not been given similar authority. Procurement contracts are often not well suited for research and development projects because they involve support, stimulation, and cooperation. Cooperative agreements provide the flexibility and innovation required. In research and development, government funding is often more like an investment.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>The DOD Inspector General found that the commercial pricing certificate was not cost-effective because the government was paying the lowest commercial price for items of supply procured even when the certificate was not obtained. Its continued use imposed a burden on the procurement process with-out a beneficial return. As a result, Congress repealed the requirement.3 This should be logically extended governmentwide.<BR>

<P>DOD may make contract awards to other than the lowest priced acceptable offeror based on an initial offer without discussions. When an offeror who is not the low offeror clearly provides the best technical proposal at a reasonable price, it may be in the government's best interest to award to that offeror without discussions. Award without discussions is appropriate in this circumstance when neither technical nor price improvements are expected to result from a round of discussions with offerors and when a superior proposal will not be significantly improved. This avoids unnecessary administrative costs for the offerors and the government.<BR>

<P>The threshold for obtaining cost and pricing data was increased to $500,000 for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, but kept at $100,000 for civilian agencies. The current statute provides that the $500,000 threshold will be reduced to $100,000 for contracts or subcontracts awarded, or modifications made, after December 31, 1995. In addition, defense agencies have statutory authority to levy penalties on contractors who knowingly submit defective pricing, whereas civilian agencies may not take such punitive action.4<BR>

<P>The $100,000 threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data, which was established in 1962, equates to $520,000 in 1992 dollars when adjusted for inflation. Raising the threshold for civilian agencies and maintaining the $500,000 for defense agencies will significantly reduce the paperwork burden on the government and contractors and will make the threshold consistent with the threshold for the Cost Accounting Standards, which was raised to $500,000 in 1988.<BR>

<P>The Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the United States Congress on Streamlining Defense Acquisition Law (Section 800 Panel) recommended that the $500,000 threshold be maintained for DOD. In making its recommendation, the panel stressed that the $500,000 threshold takes into account inflation, since the threshold was originally established in 1962.5<BR>

<P>Civilian agencies that conduct advanced research projects have a need for the same flexibility as DOD.6 The additional flexibility will provide for more supportive and innovative arrangements for research.<BR>

<P>In order to maintain a common governmentwide approach to the acquisition of property and services, statutory changes must be made to ensure consistency in the requirements for civilian and defense agencies. The current inconsistency in the statutory requirements causes inconsistent governmentwide application.7<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Repeal the requirement for commercial pricing certificates and authorize contract awards without discussions. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act should be amended to repeal the requirement for certificates of commercial pricing.8 The amendments should include a provision authorizing the award of a contract without discussions with offerors when the solicitation states that award may be made without discussions unless discussions are determined to be necessary. These changes will ensure a common approach throughout the entire federal government, which will accordingly benefit industry and government alike.<BR>

<P><B>2. Maintain the $500,000 threshold for cost and pricing data requirements for DOD. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Truth in Negotiations Act should be amended to maintain the dollar threshold for application of the statute at $500,000.9 All words in the statute that refer to the threshold reverting to $100,000 after December 31, 1995, should be eliminated, and section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act should be repealed.10 The amendment should also provide for periodic adjustment of the threshold to reflect inflation. The permanent increase in the threshold would allow DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard to maintain the administrative savings and lower contract costs that result from the higher threshold.<BR>

<P><B>3. Establish a $500,000 threshold for cost and pricing data requirements for civilian agencies. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act should be amended to make it conform to the Truth in Negotiations Act requirements to all federal agencies.11 The increase in the threshold, and periodic adjustment of the threshold to account for inflation, should increase the efficiency and effectiveness of civilian agency acquisitions and result in better service to the federal manager. Civilian agencies would be able to reduce procurement lead time by 45 to 60 days for procurements between $100,000 and $500,000. The paperwork and administrative burden placed on contractors when submitting offers to the civilian agencies for certain negotiated contracts between $100,000 and $500,000 should be reduced. The administrative cost of awarding negotiated contracts for civilian agencies would decrease as a result of the threshold increase.<BR>

<P><B>4. Authorize civilian agencies to use cooperative agreements for advanced research projects. (3)</B><BR>

<P>Civilian agencies should be provided with statutory authority to enter into cooperative agreements for advanced research projects comparable to that currently available to the Department of Defense.<BR>

<P>
<H1><B>Streamline Buying for the Environment</B></H1>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Background</B></H3>
<P>Buying for the environment means using the federal procurement process to support programs intended to preserve the world's natural resources for future generations of Americans. The procurement process is used to encourage the development of markets for products that are energy efficient, contain recovered materials, or are less harmful to the environment than competing products and to conserve the world's natural resources by promoting the use of new technologies.<BR>

<P>A number of laws (e.g., the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] and executive orders require the federal government to play a leadership role in developing and executing programs that provide for the protection of the environment. Many of these require the government to be an enlightened, environmentally conscious, and concerned consumer.<BR>

<P>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  RCRA requires federal agencies to maximize their purchases of products made with recovered materials.1 The Act requires: <BR>
	* 	the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue guidelines that designate items which are or can be produced from recovered materials; <BR>
	*	agencies, to the extent they purchase designated items, to purchase those with the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, unless the items are not available within a reasonable period of time, fail to meet performance standards, or are unreasonably priced; <BR>
	* 	agencies to eliminate from product specifications unnecessary requirements for virgin materials; and <BR>
	* 	the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), in cooperation with EPA, to implement these requirements and report to Congress every two years on agency progress in implementing RCRA.<BR>

<P>RCRA also requires agencies to develop affirmative procurement programs. The programs must contain four elements: (1) a preference program, (2) a promotion program, (3) procedures for obtaining and verifying estimates and certifications of the content of recovered materials, and (4) annual review and monitoring.<BR>

<P>From 1976, when RCRA was enacted, until the 1990's, implementation throughout the federal government was perfunctory at best. EPA issued only five guidelines, designating recycled paper products, cement and concrete containing fly-ash, retreaded tires, re-refined lubricating oil, and building insulation containing recovered materials. Agencies did not collect purchase information data, and there were no interagency efforts to promote the purchase of recycled products.<BR>

<P>The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires federal agencies to establish energy management programs to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2000 using 1985 consumption as the base.2 Agencies are also required to install all available energy and water conservation measures in federal facilities when the payback period is 10 years or less.<BR>

<P>The Energy Policy Act.  The Energy Policy Act imposes a number of require-ments for the procurement of supplies and services, including the requirements that:<BR>
	*	Agencies negotiate with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs and provide for the use of energy savings performance contracts. Demand management and conservation incentive programs are established by utilities because it is more cost-effective for them to invest their funds in conservation instead of constructing additional power plants in order to accommodate projected customer demands. The utilities are in effect buying conservation through rebate and other incentive programs that pay customers for installing energy-efficient equipment or changing their operations to save energy.<BR>
	*	Federal contractors, and their subcontractors, who manage and operate federally owned facilities, use energy conservation measures designed to reduce energy costs in government-owned and contractor-operated facilities, which are ultimately borne by the federal government.<BR>
	*	The Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency undertake a program to include energy-efficient products in carrying out their procurement and supply functions.<BR>
	*	GSA coordinate and hold regular biennial workshops in each of the 10 standard federal regions on energy management, conservation, efficiency, and planning strategy. The administrator is required to invite Department of Energy (DOE), state, local, tribal, and county public officials who have responsibilities for energy management or may have an interest in such matters. These workshops must address the procurement and use of energy-efficient products.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Need for Change</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Congress and the General Accounting Office (GAO) have criticized agency implementation of RCRA.3 EPA took more than six years to issue its first guideline, and has so far issued a total of five. For calendar years 1990 and 1991, the federal government estimates that for the five items covered by the guidelines, only 26 percent of all paper purchased had recovered content, less than 3 percent of tire purchases were for retreads, and less than 1 percent of re-refined oil was purchased.4<BR>

<P>Recent <B>p</B>rogress.  Over the last two years, agencies have placed greater emphasis on the procurement of recycled, environmentally preferable, and energy-efficient products and services. For example, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued a policy letter that emphasized the need to procure environmentally sound and energy-efficient products and services, as well as those made with recovered material. The Council on Federal Recycling and Procurement Policy was instrumental in assisting agencies to develop and implement their affirmative procurement programs, purchase recycled products, eliminate barriers to RCRA implementation, and develop FAR implementation language.5 And, a soon-to-be-signed Executive Order on Federal Acquisition, Recycling, and Waste Prevention will mandate increased procurement of recycled and environmentally preferable products.<BR>

<P>Few agencies have made substantial efforts to purchase products that are not covered by EPA guidelines or to purchase items containing more recovered material than the minimum content standard set by EPA. However, it is possible to do so. The new Executive Order will require EPA to streamline its guideline process so that more products can be designated faster and content standards can be updated more regularly. This should enable agencies to make greater strides in purchasing these products. GSA has contracted for more than 900 products (mostly paper products) containing recovered materials and an additional 1,200 products that have other environmentally beneficial features.6 As a central procurement agency for the federal government, GSA has marketed these products to other federal agencies.<BR>

<P>Barriers to <B>s</B>uccess.  One of the reasons RCRA is difficult to implement is that there are no common definitions for certain critical terms. EPA proposed consensus definitions for certain terms used by consumers and industry but included a disclaimer that the terms used in federal procurement may differ from the proposed consensus terms because of RCRA definitions.<BR>

<P>EPA deferred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to environmental marketing claims.<BR>

<P>Currently the law requires estimates, verification, and certification of a certain nature because it presumes agencies will select vendors based on highest recycled material content. Of all the acquisition strategies available, this is the least likely to be used since there is no way to accurately verify content estimates. The result is a paperwork burden on industry that is not linked to the acquisition strategy.<BR>

<P>Another problem is the requirement that purchase contracts stipulate the collection of information on the amount of recycled material contained in products. This imposes still more paperwork burdens on the government. The paperwork burden is particularly large for small transactions.<BR>

<P>Agencies are currently implementing the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Department of Energy is in the process of developing regulations covering certain aspects of the law, including those that deal with energy-savings performance contracts. GSA is responsible for taking action on those aspects of the Act dealing with intergovernmental energy management planning and coordination.<BR>

<P>Governmentwide implementation of the Act can be furthered by the establishment of indefinite delivery contracts for energy audits and retrofit projects. Such contracts should be made available to federal agencies for optional use. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command in San Diego established such contracts for small retrofit projects (e.g., replacement of small motors, lighting fixtures) that can serve as the model for establishing contracts for use by all government agencies.<BR>

<P>GSA and the Navy have been working with public utilities, such as San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, to take advantage of services that the government is entitled to under tariffs approved by the public service commission, such as energy audits, demand management, and conservation programs. In some cases, when public service commissions approve public utilities rates, they provide that a portion of the rate charged be used for programs to promote conservation. Until recently, federal agencies were not able to take advantage of such programs because of statutory limitations. However, the Energy Policy Act now authorizes agencies to accept financial incentives, goods, or services generally available to customers who participate in utility incentive programs. GSA is responsible for negotiating area-wide utility contracts for use by federal agencies in acquiring utility services.<BR>

<P>Many of the provisions of the Energy Policy Act require contracting personnel to develop new and innovative contracting methods in order to aid agencies in achieving the goals for saving energy by the year 2000. Contracts will be needed for new technology, and new financing sources (e.g., energy savings performance contracts) will be involved as well. An electronic commerce system is a means to both streamline procurement processes and reduce the use of paper.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Actions</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Amend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to clarify procurement issues that impede achievement of its procurement objectives. (3)</B><BR>

<P>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act should be amended to: <BR>
	*	Delete statutory definitions of recovered material and task EPA to establish mechanisms for the coordination of interagency and industry strategies for maximizing the use of products containing recovered materials. In addition, EPA should develop consensus objectives and terminology that will be more compatible with that used at the state and local government level and in private industry.<BR>
	*	Establish a threshold for application of affirmative procurement program requirements to individual contracts that is tied to the proposed $100,000 simplified acquisition threshold.<BR>
	*	Eliminate the statutory requirement for vendor certification and provision of estimates.<BR>
	*	Permit agencies other than DOD and GSA to retain and use funds generated from the sale of materials for recycling.7 <BR>

<P>Congress should permit EPA and other agencies to determine the best strategy for acquiring the product, as well as the best approach for ensuring compliance with contract requirements. Congress should also consider the necessity for EPA to issue guidelines. As an alternative to the guideline approach, Congress should consider giving agency heads the responsibility and accountability for procuring environmentally preferable products consistent with the demands for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.<BR>

<P><B>2. Develop &quot;best practice&quot; guides on buying for the environment. (2)</B><BR>

<P>By April 1995, the President should direct the development of one or more guides on contracting issues related to implementation of energy management programs and buying for the environment. These guides should be distributed to government procurement personnel and be used in conducting the conference workshops that are required under the Energy Policy Act.8 The guides should convey lessons learned and provide best practices information for contracting for energy and environmentally related supplies and services, including construction. The guides should address procurement issues that are being raised by operational procurement personnel, such as how to determine whether the project is a service contract or a construction contract; what can be ordered from area-wide utility contracts; how to place orders; what are the governmentt3s obligations in terms of awarding contracts under the Energy Policy Act to small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned business concerns; and what are procedures for establishing energy performance contracts.<BR>
3. Encourage multiple award schedule contractors to identify environmentally preferable products. (1)<BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), should develop and include a contract clause in multiple award schedule contracts to require contractors to identify in their brochures and on their schedule price lists products (including packaging) that are environmentally preferable. Contractors should only be permitted to identify products for which they have documentation to support the environmental market claims and that meet the Federal Trade Commissiont3s guides for making such claims.<BR>

<P><B>4. Provide energy efficiency information in GSA and DLA catalogs and automated </B><BR>
<B>systems. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By August 1994, the Administrator, GSA, and the Director, Defense Logistics Agency, should provide energy efficiency information in their supply catalogs and other publications in order to aid agencies in ordering from supply sources. Automated systems that provide information to ordering agencies and/or provide for electronic ordering should also be modified to provide the same type of information.<BR>

<P><B>5. Encourage multiple award schedule contractors to identify equipment that meets the EPA Energy Star requirements. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By January 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should develop and include a contract clause in multiple award schedule contracts for computer equipment to require contractors to identify equipment that meets &quot;EPA Energy Star&quot; requirements for energy efficiency in their brochures and on their schedule price lists.<BR>

<P><B>6. Encourage federal agency use of area-wide utility contracts for energy audits. (1)</B><BR>

<P>By August 1994, the Administrator, GSA, should encourage federal agency use of area-wide utility contracts for requesting energy audits when the utility companyt3s approved tariff requires the utility to provide such service to all customers. Utilities should be required to perform audits in compliance with federal procedures for life-cycle costing.

Executive Summary<BR>
*****************<BR>

<P>Congress established the War Department and the<BR>
Department of the Navy in 1789 to provide for the<BR>
common defense. In 1947, they were  combined to form<BR>
the Department of Defense (DOD).<BR>
 <BR>
 A cabinet agency, DOD is composed of three military<BR>
departments--Army, Navy, and Air Force--and 16<BR>
defense agencies. DOD is the nation's largest<BR>
employer: 1.9 million people serve on active duty in<BR>
the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The<BR>
Department employs 1 million civilians, and an<BR>
additional 1.8 million citizens participate in the<BR>
National Guard and Reserves.<BR>

<P>DOD's fiscal 1993 budget was $259.1 billion. That<BR>
amount was about 18 percent of the total 1993<BR>
federal budget, down from a Cold War high of 27<BR>
percent. By 1998, the Department will have 1.4<BR>
million people on active duty, and its budget will<BR>
have been cut by over 40 percent since 1985.<BR>

<P>The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Warsaw<BR>
Pact, the democratization of Eastern Europe, and the<BR>
demise of communist control in the former Soviet<BR>
Union have not changed the Department's basic<BR>
mission of protecting the United States. But these<BR>
dramatic changes do  provide our nation an<BR>
opportunity to reinvent the Department of Defense.<BR>
The Department's reinvention efforts will make DOD<BR>
more responsive to the new challenges to U.S.<BR>
national security interests.<BR>

<P>The global security environment is characterized by<BR>
four dangerous phenomena:<BR>

<P>~ nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass<BR>
  destruction;<BR>
        <BR>
~ regional dangers, including large-scale<BR>
  aggression, internal ethnic and religious<BR>
  conflicts, and state-sponsored terrorism;<BR>

<P>~ threats to democracy and reform, in the<BR>
  former Soviet empire and elsewhere; and<BR>
  <BR>
~ economic uncertainties that threaten the<BR>
  prosperity of Americans.<BR>
        <BR>
 The Department's reinvention efforts are based on<BR>
two premises concerning national security strategy.<BR>
The first premise is that the administration and the<BR>
nation as a whole will place top priority on<BR>
revitalizing the American economy. The second<BR>
premise is that the United States will pursue a<BR>
strategy marked by engagement, partnership, and<BR>
prevention to secure and advance U.S. interests in<BR>
the post-Cold War world.<BR>
 <BR>
 In its reinvention efforts, the department will<BR>
embrace the principles of the National Performance<BR>
Review to operate more effectively and at less cost,<BR>
and to be oriented toward results and performance.<BR>
Red tape will be slashed, market dynamics will<BR>
replace reliance on internal monopolies, and DOD's<BR>
practice of fostering a quality culture will be<BR>
re-energized by its senior leaders. The synergy<BR>
 of these efforts will enhance DOD's record of<BR>
innovation  and accomplishment despite the dramatic<BR>
downsizing now  taking place.<BR>
 <BR>
 DOD's first reinvention effort was the<BR>
restructuring of the Office of the Secretary of<BR>
Defense into five operational units to promote a<BR>
quality culture, streamline operations, build an<BR>
organization to pursue post-Cold War missions, and<BR>
undertake a new way of operating through teams. The<BR>
five operational units focus on the most important<BR>
building blocks: acquisition and technology;<BR>
personnel and readiness; comptroller/financial<BR>
management; command, control, communications and<BR>
intelligence; and policy.<BR>

<P>The department also undertook a &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot;<BR>
to reinvent itself in a creative and dynamic way in<BR>
response to the end of the Cold War. The review<BR>
encom-passed the formulation of strategy, force<BR>
structure, weapon system modernization, and the<BR>
reconfiguration of DOD's supporting infrastructure.<BR>
More infrastructure will be returned to productive,<BR>
private re-use, supported by President Clinton's<BR>
five-point revitalization plan, which includes:<BR>

<P>~ job-centered property disposal that puts <BR>
  local economic development first;<BR>
        <BR>
~ easy access to transition and redevelopment<BR>
  help for workers and communities;<BR>

<P>~ fast-track environmental cleanup;<BR>
  <BR>
~ larger economic development planning<BR>
  grants; and<BR>
  <BR>
~ transition coordinators at major bases<BR>
  slated for closure.<BR>
  <BR>
      <BR>
Real acquisition reform is another reinvention<BR>
keystone. Although DOD's acquisition system produces<BR>
the best weapons and support systems in the world,<BR>
this was achieved at great expense to the nation.<BR>
The current acquisition system was tailored to meet<BR>
Cold War dangers and for an industrial base that has<BR>
changed significantly since the system's inception.<BR>

<P>DOD also undertook its own Defense Performance<BR>
Review (DPR). The DPR built on recent successes and<BR>
the principles of quality leadership and culture.<BR>
Seven reinvention prototypes were developed by teams<BR>
drawn from every part of the Department.<BR>

<P>The first of the seven prototypes addresses the<BR>
steps needed to deploy a quality culture throughout<BR>
DOD. The second sets forth a process for reviewing<BR>
internal policy with a view toward eliminating<BR>
prescriptive process requirements and focusing on<BR>
performance metrics that will measure success. The<BR>
third and fourth prototypes focus on competitively<BR>
outsourcing non-core functions when doing so makes<BR>
operational and economic sense, and purchasing<BR>
best-value common services and supplies. The fifth<BR>
and sixth prototypes focus on defense bases as<BR>
installations of excellence, where commanders and<BR>
their people are empowered to manage and are held<BR>
accountable for results. The bases will demonstrate<BR>
national leadership in environmental cleanup,<BR>
conservation, compliance, and pollution prevention.<BR>

<P>A final prototype involves a three-pronged approach<BR>
to expanding the use of technology in the DOD<BR>
medical system in order to manage and deliver the<BR>
highest quality health care at the lowest possible<BR>
price. First, commercially available off-the-shelf<BR>
systems will be quickly deployed into one of the 12<BR>
DOD medical regions. Second, diagnostic coding,<BR>
patient-level cost accounting, and a paperless<BR>
 computerized medical record will be implemented for<BR>
use with the  increasing proportion of health care<BR>
delivered on an outpatient  orambulatory basis.<BR>
These practices could dramatically affect national<BR>
 health care reform in terms of cost management. The<BR>
third prong involves use of telecommunications to<BR>
reach patients and their families at home in order<BR>
to resolve and manage health care problems before<BR>
they travel to hospitals or clinics. Medical<BR>
education, health promotion, personal computer<BR>
teleconferencing and consultation, and remote<BR>
patient monitoring are major areas of exploration.<BR>

<P>The National Performance Review's DOD Agency Team<BR>
also offered the following initiatives: streamlining<BR>
the Army Corps of Engineers, creating incentives to<BR>
generate revenues, establishing a unified budget,<BR>
implementing a productivity-enhancing capital<BR>
investment fund, and reducing some National Guard<BR>
and Reserve costs.<BR>

<P>The budget submitted by President Clinton included<BR>
substantial reductions in defense spending compared<BR>
to the plans of the Bush administration. These<BR>
reductions were made possible by the end of the Cold<BR>
War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and<BR>
changes in security dangers and challenges facing<BR>
the United States in the latter half of the 1990s.<BR>
For fiscal years 1994-1997, the reductions in<BR>
discretionary budget authority for national defense<BR>
total $87 billion. This includes reductions in the<BR>
Department of Energy associated with nuclear weapons<BR>
programs and $79 billion of reductions in the<BR>
Department of Defense ($61 billion of programmatic<BR>
changes as well as an $18 billion pay adjustment).<BR>
The recently completed bottom-up review examines in<BR>
detail the force structure, modernization, and<BR>
infrastructure needs of the Department of Defense<BR>
through fiscal year 1999, along with new<BR>
requirements including those for defense<BR>
reinvestment. When the future year defense plan<BR>
(FYDP) of the previous administration has been<BR>
revised to reflect the results of the Bottom-Up<BR>
Review and has been extended through fiscal year<BR>
1999 as a new Clinton FYDP, the budgetary savings<BR>
estimate will be even greater.<BR>

<P>Department of Defense Reinvention Activities<BR>
********************************************<BR>

<P>In light of the post-Cold War environment and the<BR>
declining resources available for national defense,<BR>
the Department of Defense recognized the need for<BR>
reinvention and has already begun to incorporate the<BR>
principles of quality and excellence into its<BR>
operations.<BR>

<P>DOD created its own team--the Defense Performance<BR>
Review (DPR)--to identify and build on recent<BR>
successful innovations and to review primary<BR>
management functions. The DPR's objective has been<BR>
to devise innovative ways to encourage more<BR>
businesslike practices and market-driven<BR>
efficiencies throughout the department. In addition<BR>
to the DPR, DOD has already undertaken several<BR>
departmental initiatives, summarized in the<BR>
following chapters. These include the restructuring<BR>
of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the<BR>
Bottom-Up  Review of military requirements, and a<BR>
renewed approach to acquisition reform.<BR>
 <BR>
 The first initiative involves the complete<BR>
restructuring of the Office of the Secretary of<BR>
Defense. More than 20 divisions that formerly<BR>
operated autonomously were pared to five basic<BR>
parts. Under the new plan, four of the five Pentagon<BR>
divisions--Acquisition and Technology, Policy,<BR>
Comptroller, and Personnel and Readiness--will be<BR>
headed by under secretaries. The fifth will be<BR>
headed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for<BR>
Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence.<BR>

<P>The second reinvention effort, the Bottom-Up Review,<BR>
was a comprehensive assessment of all DOD programs.<BR>
It included a review of base force structure,<BR>
weapons systems, research and development programs,<BR>
and the support and infrastruc-ture in light of a<BR>
rapidly declining budget. The purpose of the review<BR>
was to ensure that each program is necessary and<BR>
consistent with the current national security<BR>
strategy.<BR>

<P>Through the acquisition reform program, the<BR>
Secretary of Defense has been identifying<BR>
improvements in DOD's acquisition practices. The DOD<BR>
Acquisition Law Advisory Panel's Section 800 Report,<BR>
submitted to the Senate and House Armed Services<BR>
Committees in January 1993, represents a first step<BR>
in defining a streamlined, sensible, and coherent<BR>
set of acquisition laws and regulations. The report<BR>
ensures necessary levels of congressional oversight<BR>
and control without significantly burdening the<BR>
process with unnecessary regulation. These actions,<BR>
if enacted, will have a major impact on DOD's<BR>
ability to follow smart businesslike practices and<BR>
outsource where it makes operational and economic<BR>
sense. DOD will also maximize the use of performance<BR>
specifications and commercial standards where<BR>
appropriate. This should lower the cost of products<BR>
and services and, in turn, make the marketplace more<BR>
competitive.<BR>

<P>The DPR Reinvention Team has taken account of these<BR>
programs and built on recent efforts in other areas<BR>
that are consistent with National Performance Review<BR>
(NPR) objectives. DOD established six task forces to<BR>
undertake a systematic and comprehensive look at<BR>
specific areas in which it could use the NPR<BR>
philosophy to implement change. Their efforts<BR>
resulted in the recommendations in this document.<BR>

<P>Restructuring the Office of the Secretary of Defense<BR>
****************************************************<BR>

<P>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has<BR>
been restructured in order to streamline the<BR>
opeations of OSD, to build a new OSD to pursue<BR>
post-Cold War missions, and to undertake a new way<BR>
of operating through a team approach.<BR>

<P>To streamline OSD, the number of units reporting<BR>
directly to the Secretary were reduced from about 20<BR>
offices to five primary operational units. The<BR>
five units are Acquisition and Technology; Personnel<BR>
and Readiness; the Comptroller; Command, Control,<BR>
Communications and Intelligence; and Policy (see<BR>
Table 1). In contrast to this streamlined OSD, the<BR>
organization of OSD under the Bush administration is<BR>
shown in Table 2. The Deputy Secretary will be<BR>
primarily responsible for the four resource-oriented<BR>
units, while the Secretary will be primarily<BR>
responsible and engaged in the policy unit, which<BR>
will drive the basic direction of DOD. This<BR>
streamlining has enabled the Secretary and upper DOD<BR>
management to concentrate more on effective policy<BR>
formulation rather than implementation.<BR>
 <BR>
 To operate DOD according to its new post-Cold War<BR>
mission, new offices have been created to address<BR>
the four dangers that threaten our national<BR>
interests, which are identified in the discussion of<BR>
the Bottom-Up Review. Other offices have been<BR>
created to address other mission areas, such as a<BR>
Deputy Under Secretary of Environmental Security and<BR>
a Deputy Under Secretary for Acquisition Reform.<BR>

<P>To implement the goal of bringing a team approach to<BR>
DOD management, the department has introduced<BR>
informal cross-cutting working groups, which<BR>
integrate policy across office and operational unit<BR>
lines and allow a larger segment of DOD to become<BR>
involved in the decisionmaking process. Each working<BR>
group is tailored to a particular task with<BR>
appropriate members drawn from OSD, the Joint Staff,<BR>
the Service staffs, the intelligence community, and<BR>
the commands in the field. These working groups<BR>
foster a team approach to management by encouraging<BR>
a high level of collaboration among its members.<BR>
They operate in a manner that values argument and<BR>
differences of opinion and encourages group members<BR>
to work together to accomplish specific tasks. A<BR>
prime example of this working group approach<BR>
 has been the many groups that prepared key elements<BR>
of the Bottom-Up Review. The Bottom-Up Review was<BR>
guided by the Under Secretary for Acquisition and<BR>
Technology and the Assistant Secretary for Strategy,<BR>
 Require-ments and Resources with the extensive<BR>
collaboration of members of the Joint Staff, the<BR>
service staffs, and OSD staff (see Table 3). Much of<BR>
the review's work was done in a series of working<BR>
groups that addressed key strategy, force structure,<BR>
modernization, and infrastructure issues.<BR>
 <BR>
 The restructuring of OSD is helping to create a<BR>
more mission-oriented, better managed, and<BR>
responsive DOD by creating better horizontal<BR>
integration of OSD depart- ments; encouraging upper<BR>
management to focus more effectively on developing<BR>
appropriate policies; delegating authority to lower<BR>
levels of the organization; and fostering overall<BR>
excellence in management.<BR>

Review<BR>

<P>
<P>Bottom-Up Review<BR>
****************<BR>

<P>The Bottom-Up Review was initiated shortly after<BR>
President Clinton took office. Its goal was to<BR>
recast the U.S. defense program in order to respond<BR>
in a creative and dynamic way to the end of the Cold<BR>
War. The review is a product of the collaborative<BR>
efforts of hundreds of individuals within the<BR>
Department of Defense and the intelligence<BR>
community. Its scope is unprecedented, encompassing<BR>
all major elements of U.S. defense planning: from<BR>
the formulation of strategy, to the construction of<BR>
force structure, to weapon system modernization, to<BR>
the reconfiguring of the DOD supporting<BR>
infrastructure.<BR>

<P>As Table 3 in the previous section shows, overall<BR>
oversight of the review was provided by a steering<BR>
group, chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for<BR>
Acquisition and Technology and including<BR>
representatives from offices within the Office of<BR>
the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the<BR>
Services. Task forces were established to examine<BR>
and report to the steering group on alternatives in<BR>
key program, policy, and infrastructure areas.<BR>
Membership was also drawn from experts within OSD,<BR>
the Joint Staff, and the Service staffs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Through the spring and early summer of 1993, these<BR>
task forces performed their analyses and reported<BR>
their preliminary findings to the steering group. In<BR>
June, the Secretary of Defense began meeting with<BR>
senior defense officials and the Joint Chiefs of<BR>
Staff to review the options in key program and<BR>
policy areas. Special task forces were deployed when<BR>
needed to gather additional data or examine new<BR>
options. In other cases, the Secretary began making<BR>
 preliminary decisions on the ideas submitted.<BR>
 <BR>
 By August 1993, the Bottom-Up Review was largely<BR>
completed and the Secretary of Defense and the<BR>
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed the<BR>
Principals Committee of the National Security<BR>
Council, the President, and the Vice President on<BR>
its results. The President then approved the<BR>
Secretary's recommendations and the results of the<BR>
Bottom-Up Review were publicly announced.<BR>

<P>Analytic Process. The analytic process used by the<BR>
Bottom-Up Review is set out in Table 4. It reviewed<BR>
the new dangers and opportunities that lie ahead in<BR>
the post-Cold War world; constructed military<BR>
strategies to address these dangers and<BR>
opportunities; and developed the means to carry<BR>
out these strategies, such as a structure for DOD to<BR>
deal with the new dangers, weapons modernization,<BR>
and key foundations of defense.<BR>

<P>
<P>Table 4<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>Post-Cold War World: Dangers and Opportunities (will<BR>
not format)<BR>

<P>Because so many basic elements of the security<BR>
landscape have changed over the past four years, it<BR>
is essential that plans for the future defense<BR>
program be built on a fundamental reassessment of<BR>
future security needs.<BR>

<P>The Bottom-Up Review identified dangers in the<BR>
global security environment that could affect U.S.<BR>
national security interests. The dangers can be<BR>
grouped into four broad categories:<BR>

<P>~ dangers posed by nuclear weapons and other weapons<BR>
  of mass destruction, including dangers associated<BR>
  with the proliferation of these weapons throughout<BR>
  the world as well as the threat posed by tens of<BR>
  thousands of weapons still residing in the former<BR>
  Soviet Union;<BR>

<P>~ regional dangers, including large-scale<BR>
  aggression, internal ethnic and religious<BR>
  conflicts, and state-sponsored<BR>
  terrorism;<BR>

<P>~ dangers to democracy and reform efforts in the<BR>
  former Soviet empire and elsewhere; and<BR>
 <BR>
~ economic dangers that threaten the prosperity of<BR>
  Americans.<BR>

<P>DOD's strategy will take account of opportunities to<BR>
advance U.S. objectives and, over time, to shape the<BR>
international environment in favorable ways. For<BR>
example, the collapse of the Soviet empire has<BR>
created opportunities to bring a number of nations<BR>
into the democratic fold of states with values and<BR>
objectives that are largely shared. There are<BR>
opportunities to nurture this trend of democratic<BR>
expansion, to stabilize those democracies that<BR>
threaten to back-slide, and to develop partnerships<BR>
among those democratic states dedicated to the<BR>
pursuit of our common objectives and values.<BR>
 <BR>
 Future Strategy. The Bottom-Up Review was based on<BR>
two basic premises concerning national security<BR>
strategy:<BR>

<P>~ first, that the administration and the nation as a<BR>
  whole will place top priority on revitalizing the<BR>
  American economy;<BR>

<P>~ second, that to secure and advance its interests<BR>
  in the post-Cold War world, the United States will<BR>
  pursue a strategy marked by engagement,<BR>
partnership, and<BR>
  prevention.<BR>

<P>Such a strategy is essential in an interdependent<BR>
world: no matter how powerful the United States is<BR>
as a nation, it is not possible to unilaterally<BR>
protect our people from the dangers outlined above.<BR>
Whether the danger is from nuclear proliferation,<BR>
regional instability, the reversal of reform in the<BR>
former Soviet empire, or unfair trade practices, the<BR>
dangers demand cooperative, multinational solutions.<BR>
Therefore, the only responsible U.S. strategy is one<BR>
that seeks to ensure U.S. influence over and<BR>
participation in the decisions of a wide and<BR>
growing range of other nations. The unparalleled<BR>
military capabilities of the United States and its<BR>
unique position as the preferred security<BR>
partner of important states in many regions will be<BR>
two key assets supporting this strategy.<BR>

<P>The assessment of future security needs will help to<BR>
create a new sense of purpose for DOD following the<BR>
demise of the Soviet Union. It reemphasizes that an<BR>
organization should be driven more by a sense of<BR>
mission and less by rules and regulations. This new<BR>
strategy is part of the effort of upper DOD<BR>
management to focus on developing the right<BR>
policy for the times. This approach will enable<BR>
upper management to focus on international<BR>
leadership and leave detailed implementation to<BR>
those in the field.<BR>

<P>The review examined several categories of activity<BR>
that will help support the new strategy. Among these<BR>
were force structure, modernization programs, new<BR>
initiatives, and defense foundations.<BR>

<P>Force Structure. Four major factors have driven DOD<BR>
planning for future force structure. These missions<BR>
are:<BR>

<P>~ the need to be prepared to defeat major<BR>
  regional aggression;<BR>
  <BR>
~ the need to station and deploy U.S. forces<BR>
  overseas in peacetime;<BR>
       <BR>
~ the need for capabilities to help enforce<BR>
  and keep the peace in situations of internal<BR>
  conflict or chaos; and<BR>
    <BR>
~ the continuing need to deter, and selectively<BR>
  defend against, attacks on U.S. territory with<BR>
  weapons of mass destruction.<BR>

<P>Defeating Regional Aggressors. The bulk of the<BR>
general purpose force structure is determined by the<BR>
need for the United States to field forces<BR>
sufficient to deter and, if necessary, to fight and<BR>
decisively defeat the forces of a regional power,<BR>
such as Iran, Iraq, or North Korea. The United<BR>
States will field forces that, in aggregate, can win<BR>
in two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts.<BR>

<P>This is prudent for two reasons. First, we need to<BR>
avoid a situation in which the United States, in<BR>
effect, makes an attack more likely by leaving<BR>
an opening for potential aggressors should our<BR>
engagement in a war in one region leave little or no<BR>
force available to respond in another. Second,<BR>
fielding forces sufficient to win two wars nearly<BR>
simultaneously provides a hedge against the<BR>
possibility that a future adversary--or coalition of<BR>
adversaries--might one day confront us with a<BR>
larger-than-expected threat.  In this dynamic and<BR>
unpredictable post-Cold War world, we must maintain<BR>
military capabilities that are flexible and<BR>
sufficient to cope with unforeseen threats.<BR>

<P>DOD analysis has helped determine what forces are<BR>
needed to fight and win future regional conflicts.<BR>
It has also shed light on questions of force<BR>
quality--readiness, force modernization, and support<BR>
enhancements needed to employ our forces most<BR>
effectively.<BR>

<P>Overseas Presence--U.S. Forces Abroad in Peacetime.<BR>
The second major driver of force planning is the<BR>
need to deploy American forces in peacetime in<BR>
regions important to our security. These force<BR>
deployments help to deter adventurism and coercion<BR>
by potentially hostile states as well as improve our<BR>
ability to respond effectively to crises or<BR>
aggression. Such deployments provide a rapid<BR>
response capability, by improving the ability of<BR>
U.S. and allied forces to operate effectively<BR>
together and by helping to ensure U.S. accessto the<BR>
 facilities and logistics assets we would need.<BR>
Force planning enables deployment for both<BR>
short-notice and day-to-day operations in support of<BR>
U.S. interests around the world, from evacuating<BR>
embassies and providing disaster relief to enforcing<BR>
United Nations resolutions and intercepting<BR>
narcotics traffic.<BR>

<P>Assuming that U.S. allies continue to carry a share<BR>
of the burden, forces can continue to be deployed in<BR>
Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East both because<BR>
the stability of these regions is of critical<BR>
importance to the United States and because our<BR>
military assets give us a stronger voice in the<BR>
affairs of these regions--not only military, but<BR>
political and economic as well. The demands of<BR>
overseas presence are also an important determinant<BR>
of our force structure, particularly with respect to<BR>
Navy and Marine forces.<BR>

<P>Peace Enforcement and Intervention. To maintain<BR>
regional stability, U.S. forces must be prepared to<BR>
intervene on short notice in defense of important<BR>
U.S. interests and to participate in multilateral<BR>
peace enforcement and peacekeeping operations. U.S.<BR>
forces might be required as an initial response to<BR>
establish order, while other units would follow to<BR>
enforce compliance and allow reconstitution of<BR>
authority. The U.S. will also continue to be called<BR>
upon to render humanitarian assistance and disaster<BR>
relief.<BR>

<P>The forces needed for these operations will, in<BR>
general, be drawn from general purpose units fielded<BR>
in preparation for winning two major regional<BR>
conflicts. Further, the U.S. possesses certain<BR>
specialized military assets that may be in great<BR>
demand during these missions. These include such<BR>
things as strategic lift, medical, psychological<BR>
operations, military police, civil affairs, and<BR>
other support units.<BR>

<P>Strategic Deterrence. The United States must<BR>
continue to ensure that no enemy would find<BR>
advantage in attacking our territory or people with<BR>
weapons of mass destruction. Until such time as<BR>
democratic institutions and liberal values are<BR>
firmly established in Russia, our strategic nuclear<BR>
forces will be sized and shaped primarily by the<BR>
nature of the Russian arsenal. DOD plans to posture<BR>
forces for the long term in accordance with the<BR>
provisions of the START II Treaty, while retaining<BR>
the capability to expand or adjust should<BR>
circumstances warrant. Our strategic bomber force<BR>
will likewise be brought into compliance with START<BR>
II, while being sized for a growing role in<BR>
conventional power projection.<BR>

<P>In the words of the President, our forces will<BR>
remain _the best equipped, best prepared in the<BR>
world._ To meet this standard, DOD will provide<BR>
sufficient resources to ensure that U.S. forces will<BR>
be ready to fight. Some of the key factors that will<BR>
ensure force readiness are outlined in Table 5. DOD<BR>
will also ensure that service in the U.S. armed<BR>
forces remains challenging, attractive, and<BR>
rewarding so that it can continue to attract and<BR>
retain high-quality people. Finally, DOD will<BR>
continue to fund research and development generously<BR>
and to focus investments on high-payoff technologies<BR>
to ensure that our forces retain the technological<BR>
edge that helped to bring victory in Operation<BR>
Desert Storm.<BR>

<P>The changes discussed above will ensure that budget<BR>
allocations will be linked to outcomes or products<BR>
rather than inputs. <BR>

<P>Table 5<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>Factors for Ensuring Force Readiness<BR>

<P>The first priority is to ensure that forces are<BR>
ready to fight.<BR>

<P>~ Ability to identify when readiness is decreasing<BR>
  and prevent problems from occurring<BR>
  <BR>
~ Existence of clear and agreed force performance<BR>
  standards<BR>
   <BR>
~ Existence of reliable measurements to assess<BR>
  whether standards are met<BR>
  <BR>
~ Ability to set policies and allocate resources to<BR>
  meet standards and correct problems<BR>
  <BR>
~ Commitment to maintain adequate Operations and<BR>
  Maintenance funding as budgets shrink<BR>
  <BR>
~ Establishment of a Task Force to provide an<BR>
  independent assessment of force readiness<BR>
        <BR>
~ Establishment of an internal DOD panel co-chaired<BR>
  by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice<BR>
  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to monitor<BR>
  readiness<BR>

<P>Linking future force structure planning to specific<BR>
missions also establishes a criterion by which to<BR>
measure the effectiveness of proposed force<BR>
structure options. By making the allocation of<BR>
resources to maintain superior training, equipment,<BR>
personnel, and technology a priority, DOD will also<BR>
ensure continued organizational excellence and that<BR>
U.S. forces will always be ready to fight.<BR>

<P>Modernization Programs. The Bottom-Up Review<BR>
examined force structure needs in tandem with major<BR>
force modernization programs. Table 6 outlines the<BR>
key considerations for modernization programs. Each<BR>
program in the Bottom-Up Review was evaluated in<BR>
terms of its potential contribution to the military<BR>
capabilities that would be most needed in the<BR>
future, its projected costs relative to alternative<BR>
means for achieving needed capabilities, and<BR>
long-term needs for maintaining the industrial base<BR>
associated with each capability. Using such criteria<BR>
will ensure that budget allocations for<BR>
moderni<BR>
inputs, which in turn will better serve DOD's<BR>
overall mission. This will also guarantee that U.S.<BR>
forces will have the highest quality equipment in<BR>
the future.<BR>

<P>New Initiatives. The new dangers and opportunities<BR>
of the post-Cold War world require the United States<BR>
to actively protect and enhance its national<BR>
security. DOD must not only prepare to deal with<BR>
threats to our security as they arise, but also to<BR>
prevent them from occurring. DOD must also seize<BR>
opportunities to shape the international environment<BR>
in ways favorable to U.S. interests. DOD's new<BR>
programs emphasize the funding of outcomes rather<BR>
than inputs by allocating resources on the basis of<BR>
how well they serve our national security interests<BR>
and overall departmental mission. These new policy<BR>
initiatives are:<BR>

<P>~ Cooperative Threat Reduction to consolidate<BR>
  safely, store, and dismantle the nuclear arsenal<BR>
  of the former Soviet Union.<BR>

<P>~ Counter-Proliferation Initiatives to further<BR>
  impede the spread of weapons of mass destruction<BR>
  and to improve our capabilities to prevent their<BR>
  effective use.<BR>

<P>~ Defense Partnership with the Former Soviet Union<BR>
  (FSU), both to reduce the likelihood that<BR>
  democratic political reform in the FSU might be<BR>
  reversed and to hedge against the consequences of<BR>
  such a reversal.<BR>

<P>~ Global Cooperative Initiatives to improve U.S.<BR>
  capabilities for peacekeeping, peace enforcement,<BR>
  and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, as<BR>
  well as initiatives to promote the spread of<BR>
  democracy, especially in the military<BR>
  establishments of emerging democracies.<BR>

<P>~ Defense Reinvestment and Economic Growth<BR>
  Initiatives to encourage the  freer flow of<BR>
  technologies between the defenseand civil sectors,<BR>
  and to  assist individuals and communities making <BR>
  the transition from  defense-related employment.<BR>
  This initiativewill also promote competition  and<BR>
  market solutions through its encouragement of<BR>
  dual-use technologies  and greater government<BR>
  interaction with the private sector. In<BR>
  addition, this initiative would offer incentives<BR>
  to individuals and communities to encourage them<BR>
  to make a more effective transition to civilian<BR>
  employment through job training, separation pay,<BR>
  and offering expertise to communities on defense<BR>
  conversion and economic revitalization.<BR>

<P>~ Environmental Security Initiatives to accelerate<BR>
  the cleanup of DOD properties and to better ensure<BR>
  that future defense activities are carried out in<BR>
  accordance with sound environmental practices.<BR>
  This will also promote the adoption of market<BR>
  solutions and experimentation by encouraging<BR>
  government to engage in technology partnerships to<BR>
  stimulate innovative technology development,<BR>
  promote dual-use technologies where appropriate,<BR>
  and improve technology transfer. Incentives would<BR>
  be offered to enable DOD to reduce its energy<BR>
  consumption while compliance programs would be<BR>
  improved to foster a more efficient and effective <BR>
  compliance system.<BR>

<P> While these initiatives will account for a<BR>
relatively modest share of the overall DOD budget,<BR>
they can yield long-term benefits far in excess of<BR>
their costs.<BR>

~ attack submarines<BR>

<P>        <BR>
 Defense Foundations and Infrastructure<BR>
Reform. Another major determinant of the defense<BR>
budget is infrastructure: the facilities,<BR>
maintenance activities, logistics support,<BR>
schooling, systems acquisition, environmental<BR>
protection and restoration, and medical capabilities<BR>
needed to support DOD's worldwide operations.<BR>
Spending on infrastructure today accounts for<BR>
approximately $160 billion per year, or almost 60<BR>
percent of DOD's budget. Table 7 outlines some of<BR>
the major considerations in evaluating DOD's<BR>
infrastructure. Clearly, if these expenditures are<BR>
not reduced substantially, it will be impossible to<BR>
field and equip the military forces DOD needs to <BR>
support the ambitious strategy it envisions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process<BR>
represents a major element in cutting defense<BR>
infrastructure, but it is only a part of the story.<BR>
The Bottom-Up Review has identified opportunities<BR>
for efficiencies in other areas as well, including<BR>
maintenance and supply depots, research<BR>
laboratories, central medical activities, training<BR>
facilities, and force management.<BR>

<P>Table 7<BR>
*******<BR>
 
<P>Issues Considered in Evaluating DOD's Infrastructure<BR>

<P>~ Infrastructure accounts for 60 percent of<BR>
  DOD's budget--the largest share is logistics.<BR>
~ Infrastructure cuts must occur to achieve<BR>
  savings, given declining budgets and emphasis on   <BR>
  readiness.<BR>
~ Some infrastructure cuts will be tied directly to<BR>
  drawdown in forces. Others will require changes in<BR>
  policy or law and be more difficult to implement.<BR>
~ Potential infrastructure savings of $20 billion to<BR>
  $25 billion over five years are associated with<BR>
  force structure changes, privatization,<BR>
  consolidation, and better businesslike practices.<BR>
~ Implementation of infrastructure changes and cuts<BR>
  will require continuing management attention.<BR>
        <BR>
        Bottom-Up Review as Implementation of the<BR>
National Performance Review. Where the<BR>
recommendations of the Bottom-Up Review are fully<BR>
implemented, DOD will have created a system that<BR>
reemphasizes that DOD serves the interests of its<BR>
customers, the American people, by focusing on<BR>
mission orientation rather than bureaucratic<BR>
processes. The review effort will empower all<BR>
echelons of DOD through collaborative<BR>
decisionmaking. Upper management will focus on<BR>
policy formulation rather than<BR>
implementation--steering more and rowing less. The<BR>
review will promote experimentation, create<BR>
incentives for positive behavior rather than<BR>
dictating behavior, and search for market rather<BR>
than administrative solutions. Finally, the<BR>
Bottom-Up review will foster excellence throughout<BR>
DOD by emphasizing that quality is the first<BR>
priority.<BR>

<P>Acquisition Reform<BR>
******************<BR>

<P>The new, post-Cold War era demands new thinking<BR>
about defense acquisition. The Clinton<BR>
administration believes the procurement system at<BR>
the Department of Defense must undergo fundamental<BR>
change to meet the security challenges of the 1990s.<BR>

<P>The Cold War is over, but the United States faces<BR>
new threats: regional conflicts; proliferation of<BR>
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass<BR>
destruction; risk to our economic well-being; and<BR>
the possible failure of democratic reform in the<BR>
former Soviet Bloc and elsewhere.  The President and<BR>
the Secretary of Defense are committed to<BR>
maintaining a lean, high-tech, ready-to-fight<BR>
military force in a time when the threats are<BR>
changing and difficult to predict, and when defense<BR>
spending is being sharply cut. The Department of<BR>
Defense budget will be reduced by more than 41<BR>
percent by 1997 from its peak in 1985.<BR>

<P>The Clinton administration is proposing the first<BR>
steps in a broad plan to remake the defense<BR>
acquisition system to meet these dangers. It will<BR>
allow DOD to run itself in a more businesslike<BR>
fashion. It will promote the merger of separate<BR>
production lines for defense and commercial<BR>
production, enabling companies to diversify while<BR>
maintaining their capability to meet the needs of<BR>
the Department of Defense. It will reduce paperwork<BR>
and promote off-the-shelf purchases.<BR>

<P>These critical steps must be taken to support our<BR>
fighting forces and preserve an integrated<BR>
commercial and military industrial base  that will<BR>
be competitive in the global marketplace. They will<BR>
enable  the Department of Defense to achieve<BR>
necessary savings,  retainhigh-quality weapons<BR>
systems, and preserve military readiness.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Clinton administration is committed to<BR>
maintaining the best equipped, best trained, most<BR>
effective fighting force in the world. We will not<BR>
be able to do it unless we change the way we do<BR>
business.<BR>

<P>The Problem. The DOD acquisition system is a web of<BR>
laws and regulations adopted for laudable reasons.<BR>
The aim of the laws and regulations is to ensure<BR>
that competition is fair and the taxpayer is<BR>
protected from waste, fraud, and abuse. But the<BR>
rules have led to an overloaded system that is often<BR>
paralyzed and ineffectual. Even at its best, it is<BR>
cumbersome and complex. Due largely to the ability<BR>
and dedication of the people in the system, the Cold<BR>
War was won -- but at a significant price.<BR>

<P>The existing DOD acquisition system is based on a<BR>
management system that creates a rule for every<BR>
contingency imaginable. It creates circumstances in<BR>
which no one person is accountable for an entire<BR>
process. Errors and delays dominate the system, and<BR>
the ability of any one person to improve the system<BR>
is small if not impossible.<BR>

<P>The combined effect of the thousands of pages of<BR>
acquisition law and regulation is a confusing and<BR>
often needlessly slow and expensive system that the<BR>
nation can no longer afford. It turns away<BR>
innovative companies and makes it nearly impossible<BR>
to save tax dollars because the Department cannot<BR>
easily buy off-the-shelf commercial products. It<BR>
denies or slows DOD's access to readily available<BR>
state-of-the-art technologies. It serves as a<BR>
barrier to integration of the defense and commercial<BR>
industrial bases.<BR>

<P>Neither DOD nor the nation can afford the luxury of<BR>
maintaining a unique defense industrial base. A 1991<BR>
report by the Center for Strategic and International<BR>
Studies said:<BR>

<P>[It] results in higher prices to DOD (even when<BR>
lower-cost commercial alternatives exist for the<BR>
same requirements), loss of a broad domestic<BR>
production base that could be available to defense<BR>
for peacetime and surge demands, and lack of access<BR>
to com-mercial state-of-the-art technologies.<BR>
Additionally, the wall between engineers and<BR>
scientists engaged in commercial and military work<BR>
impedes the kind of shoulder-to-shoulder contact<BR>
that is the essence of technology transfer and that<BR>
is basic to achieving greater job stability and<BR>
growth opportunities for the U.S. work force. <BR>

<P>DOD's acquisition process must become more flexible<BR>
and agile to respond to the rapidly changing<BR>
international climate of the 1990s. Because of its<BR>
complexity, a major overhaul of the acquisition<BR>
system cannot happen overnight. But it must begin.<BR>
It is not difficult to see why change is imperative.<BR>
During Operation Desert Storm, the U.S.-led<BR>
confrontation with Iraq, the Air Force found that it<BR>
needed to improve communication among its units. It<BR>
ordered 6,000 commercial radio receivers from<BR>
Motorola, whose products were uniquely suited to fit<BR>
its needs. Motorola, however, said it could not meet<BR>
the demands of the procurement rules. Specifically,<BR>
its commercial unit lacked the record-keeping<BR>
systems required to show the Pentagon that it was<BR>
getting the lowest available price. To circumvent<BR>
the problem, the Japanese bought the radios and<BR>
donated them to the Air Force.<BR>

<P>The Solution. The post-Cold War era and the defense<BR>
downsizing of the 1990s mean that the DOD<BR>
acquisition system must undergo a fundamental,<BR>
top-to-bottom transformation. It is not enough to<BR>
fine-tune the existing system. Instead, it must be<BR>
fundamentally redesigned to enable the Department of<BR>
Defense to respond to the diverse demands of the<BR>
decade. Such changes will take time and must be<BR>
based on a thorough review of existing practices. <BR>

<P>Our military contractors can compete successfully in<BR>
the global marketplace, but not if they must carry<BR>
the weight of all the special requirements placed on<BR>
them by the Department of Defense. Lifting this<BR>
burden will help companies remain viable as the<BR>
defense budget shrinks and will ensure the survival<BR>
of our domestic military industrial base. This will<BR>
help preserve high-paying jobs and encourage<BR>
innovative businesslike practices, and will make DOD<BR>
a better customer that companies will want to<BR>
supply.<BR>

<P>Simplifying the acquisition process is the single<BR>
most important step DOD, the Clinton administration,<BR>
and Congress can take to save money and help defense<BR>
contractors compete successfully in today's<BR>
marketplace. Revamping the procurement system will<BR>
offer the twin benefits of increasing the efficiency<BR>
of the defense acquisition system and helping<BR>
companies operate simultaneously in the defense and<BR>
commercial sectors. This can only help improve<BR>
America's industrial competiveness.<BR>

<P>DOD's new approach has three guiding principles:<BR>

<P>1) Reduce acquisition costs through adoption of<BR>
businesslike processes characteristic of world-class<BR>
customers, and enable its suppliers to do the same.<BR>

<P>2) Ensure that the United States maintains a strong,<BR>
globally competitive national industrial base that<BR>
can support DOD's needs.<BR>

<P>3) Take full advantage of rapid technological<BR>
advances by streamlining procedures so that DOD<BR>
easily can purchase state-of-the-art commercial<BR>
products and other technology.<BR>

<P>The Clinton administration is taking the first steps<BR>
toward acquisition reform by outlining a preliminary<BR>
set of proposals that will  begin to simplify and<BR>
streamline the process.<BR>
 <BR>
 Short-Term Plan of Action. The Department of<BR>
Defense has established a series of short-term<BR>
actions that take priority in its pursuit of<BR>
acquisition reform. The Department will set up<BR>
special Process Action Teams made up of federal<BR>
civilian employees and military personnel who<BR>
will evaluate problems and implement solutions.<BR>
 This effort to identify problems and find solutions<BR>
will evolve as DOD works with the Vice President's<BR>
National Performance Review, the National Economic<BR>
Council, the Defense Reinvestment Assistance Task<BR>
Force, and the Defense Science Board Task Force on<BR>
Acquisition Streamlining, among others. The Deputy<BR>
Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Reform<BR>
will consult regularly with the Senior DOD<BR>
Acquisition Reform Steering Group.<BR>

<P>Many of the DOD initiatives will require<BR>
coordination with and support from other agencies,<BR>
such as the Department of Labor and the Small<BR>
Business Administration. The Deputy Undersecretary<BR>
will work with the Office of Federal Procurement<BR>
Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, and<BR>
other federal agencies, including the National<BR>
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the General<BR>
Services Administration, and the Department of<BR>
Energy, among others.<BR>

<P>What follows is a synopsis of activities DOD is<BR>
pursuing along with proposed  solutions and<BR>
recommendations for implementation.<BR>

<P>1. Simplified Acquisition Thresholds<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. A solicitation<BR>
for commercial ant bait, using large purchase<BR>
procedures, was 29 pages. The estimated price of the<BR>
purchase was above the simplified purchase procedure<BR>
of $25,000. It took 227 days to make this buy. The<BR>
actual award price, however, was $16,500. If small<BR>
purchase procedures had been used, almost 200 days<BR>
would have been saved.<BR>

<P>A military hospital's supply officer requested a<BR>
re-supply of aspirin for his pharmacy. Several<BR>
offers were received. Supplier A's (a well-known<BR>
brand name producer) unit price was $3.98, the low<BR>
offer. DOD asked for the required small business<BR>
subcontracting plan. Supplier A refused to prepare<BR>
it even though it had many small business<BR>
subcontractors because it did not want to disturb<BR>
established long-term relation-ships with its many<BR>
suppliers and would never be asked for this in a<BR>
commercial transaction. Supplier A withdrew its<BR>
offer; the contract was awarded to the next low<BR>
offeror ($4.40 unit price), costing DOD<BR>
approximately 10.3 percent more--an additional<BR>
$107,000 over the life of the contract.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Promote a balance between an<BR>
efficient acquisition process and national social<BR>
policy by increasing the statutory threshold for<BR>
small purchases (Simplified Acquisition Threshold)<BR>
from $25,000 to $100,000. Remove the burden of most<BR>
government-unique clauses from purchases below the<BR>
threshold. Small businesses and small and<BR>
disadvantaged businesses will see increased<BR>
opportunities to do business with DOD because they<BR>
will be able to sell to the government under the<BR>
same rules they sell to their commercial customers,<BR>
and because purchases under $100,000 will be<BR>
reserved for small business. Electronic commerce<BR>
will ease access to the Defense market and at the<BR>
same time ensure enhanced notification of<BR>
procurement opportunities.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. Government agencies are<BR>
allowed to use simplified procedures if the contract<BR>
would amount to less than $25,000. Purchases under<BR>
the threshold are not subject to many of the laws<BR>
and regulations that apply to larger purchases.<BR>
These solicitations are far less complex--12 pages<BR>
on average. Large purchase solicitations, partly<BR>
because they must include a large number of required<BR>
clauses, are 29 pages on average.<BR>

<P>The laws that impose various socio-economic<BR>
requirements upon the acquisition process lack a<BR>
uniform threshold (some apply at $2,500, others<BR>
apply at $10,000), and have not been updated to<BR>
reflect inflation or other trends. Because<BR>
socio-economic laws are scattered throughout various<BR>
statutes, including authorization and appropriation<BR>
bills, many companies are afraid they are not aware<BR>
of all the requirements. This discourages them from<BR>
competing for DOD contracts and subcontracts. As the<BR>
DOD Acquisition Law Advisory Panel, commonly known<BR>
as the Section 800 Panel, reported:<BR>

<P>It seems unlikely that any company not already<BR>
engaged in the business of selling to the government<BR>
would actually be willing to spend the money<BR>
necessary to make the fundamental changes in the way<BR>
that it conducts its business in return for a sale<BR>
of $100,000 or less. This may be particularly true<BR>
of small businesses, which are the preferred<BR>
recipients of contracts of this size.<BR>

<P>From the government's standpoint, overwhelming<BR>
administrative efforts and an inordinate amount of<BR>
time are required to solicit, award, and administer<BR>
contracts between $25,000 and $100,000. For example,<BR>
if a contract will exceed $25,000, DOD generally<BR>
must publish in the Commerce Business Daily an<BR>
announcement of the intent to award a contract, wait<BR>
15 days before it can issue a solicitation, and then<BR>
wait 30 more days before making an award. As a<BR>
result, the average lead-time for awards below<BR>
$25,000 is 26 days. Above $25,000 the average lead<BR>
time is 90 days for simple sealed bids and 210 days<BR>

<P>for competitively negotiated contracts.<BR>

<P>The DOD budget requires a reassessment of the role<BR>
and ability of the acquisition workforce to monitor<BR>
compliance of a panoply of social policy intertwined<BR>
with DOD contract requirements. An exemption from<BR>
the socio-economic requirements for commercial items<BR>
and those within the simplified acquisition<BR>
threshold would use tax dollars more efficiently.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will propose Congress<BR>
enact a $100,000 Simplified Acquisition Threshold<BR>
under which purchases would be exempt from most<BR>
government-unique statutory requirements (e.g.,<BR>
those that specify the source of materials, specify<BR>
the means of transportation, require the submission<BR>
of reports by the contractor, or impose unique<BR>
socio-economic provisions on contractors, except<BR>
those noted below). <BR>

<P>Under the DOD proposal, procurements under the<BR>
$100,000 simplified acquisition threshold would be<BR>
reserved for small businesses, while allowing awards<BR>
to small and small disadvantaged businesses under<BR>
both the Small Business Administration's 8(a)<BR>
program and what is best known as DOD's Section 1207<BR>
program. These procurements would also be reported<BR>
under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act<BR>
for a period of five years if over $25,000 and<BR>
subject to new notice requirements depending on how<BR>
well DOD implements electronic means of providing<BR>
notice and opportunities to bid.<BR>

<P>DOD is moving aggressively to enhance the use of<BR>
electronic bulletin boards and electronic commerce<BR>
and electronic data interchange (EC/EDI), through a<BR>
quick-reaction Process Action Team. Existing pilot<BR>
electronic purchasing systems (e.g., GATEC at<BR>
Wright-Patterson Air Force base and EASE at NSC<BR>
Jacksonville) have demonstrated the potential to<BR>
reduce lead time from 29 to 11 days; achieve price<BR>
savings of approximately 12 percent on<BR>
price-volatile commodities such as food; increase<BR>
the number of bidders competing; and increase the<BR>
percentage of awards going to small businesses from<BR>
50 percent to 96 percent.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel Report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will  be transmitted to the<BR>
Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  as a<BR>
legislative proposal.   <BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. DOD believes that it could<BR>
realize significant savings by increasing the small<BR>
purchase threshold to a $100,000 simplified<BR>
acquisition threshold and by removing the<BR>
applicability of various impediments that are unique<BR>
to the government contracting process.<BR>

<P>A $100,000 threshold for DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ remove about 40,000 purchases (approximately 20<BR>
  percent of all purchases in excess of $25,000)<BR>
  with a value of about $2 billion from the burdens<BR>
  and cost of complex purchasing procedures while at<BR>
  the same time increasing participation and awards<BR>
  to small business;<BR>

<P>~ permit 99 percent of DOD's contract actions (12.1<BR>
  million in FY92, or one million actions per<BR>
  month--46,000 actions each working day) to be<BR>
  accomplished using simplified procurement<BR>
  procedures, including use of automated processes<BR>
  and credit cards, which would reduce the number of<BR>
  acquisition personnel required to perform these<BR>
  functions;<BR>

<P>~ reduce acquisition lead time; and<BR>

<P>~ provide contractors, particularly small<BR>
  businesses, enhanced incentives to do business<BR>
  with the Department by removing the burdens of<BR>
  unique laws associated only with contractors who<BR>
  sell to the federal government and their<BR>
  subcontractors.<BR>

<P>2. Commercial Items<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. A large<BR>
telecommunications company developed a narrow band<BR>
voice radio featuring full-function digital<BR>
technology, improved voice quality, and enhanced<BR>
encryption capabilities --features highly sought<BR>
after by DOD and law enforcement agencies. Although<BR>
it was designed for sale as a commercial product, it<BR>
had not yet been sold to anyone. Because of<BR>
complicated laws and regulations governing the<BR>
non-competitive acquisition of new commercial<BR>
products and technologies that haven't yet been sold<BR>
in substantial quantities to the public, federal<BR>
government buyers were reluctant to purchase the<BR>
product without requiring cost and pricing data. The<BR>
company would not sell the item to the government if<BR>
it had to generate and provide cost and pricing data<BR>
to support the price it was charging, which it did<BR>
not need to do to establish the commercial price.<BR>
Thus, the government continued to buy a less<BR>
advanced _old technology_ system, while commercial<BR>
customers bought _state-of-the-art._<BR>

<P>The Defense Personnel Support Center (DPSC) wanted<BR>
to contract with a large clothing manufacturer to<BR>
redesign military trousers so that the company could<BR>
produce both defense and commercial products on an<BR>
integrated line. Both the government and the company<BR>
would share in the resulting cost savings. DPSC also<BR>
wanted to learn from the company, an industry leader<BR>
in electronic quick response systems, how it could<BR>
take advantage of such a system to deliver trousers<BR>
to new recruits. Present law required DOD to obtain<BR>
and audit data from the company explaining how it<BR>
set its price. The company would not provide the<BR>
data and, as a result, DPSC's attempts to purchase<BR>
and learn from this experienced, successful company<BR>
were thwarted.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Maintain DOD's technological<BR>
superiority by ensuring it has access to<BR>
state-of-the-art commercial technology and integrate<BR>
the defense and commercial industrial base by<BR>
allowing DOD to acquire commercial products using<BR>
standard commercial practices. Large segments of the<BR>
U.S. industrial base will view DOD as a new market<BR>
never before open to them on normal business terms.<BR>
Many firms will see enhanced sales opportunities to<BR>
DOD.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. As a purchaser of military<BR>
hardware and weapons systems, products for which<BR>
there is no commercial counterpart, DOD always has<BR>
had unique contracting requirements. To ensure<BR>
accountability for taxpayer dollars, a complex<BR>
system of audit and oversight was considered<BR>
necessary. With soldiers' lives and military<BR>
security at stake, government inspectors were<BR>
installed in manufacturing plants to make sure<BR>
stringent quality requirements were met.<BR>

<P>In addition, as Congress passed laws to promote<BR>
various worthy social goals, government contracts<BR>
became more complex. Contract clauses required<BR>
contractors to set up drug-free workplace programs<BR>
and to purchase certain items only from U.S.<BR>
sources, among other things.<BR>

<P>The administrative cost to comply with these<BR>
requirements, the resulting reduction in profit, and<BR>
the sheer sense of regulatory gridlock have now<BR>
advanced to the point that some commercial firms<BR>
have simply decided the cost of doing business with<BR>
the government is too great. The potential loss to<BR>
DOD of critical commercial leading-edge<BR>
technologies, combined with reductions in defense<BR>
spending, could severely compromise our national<BR>
defense technology and industrial base. <BR>

<P>Many defense contractors who also sell to the<BR>
commercial market have set up separate divisions to<BR>
deal with these unique government requirements,<BR>
which they do not want to impose on their commercial<BR>
products. Firms have cited six primary areas in<BR>
which government procurement policies and<BR>
requirements impose significant burdens and require<BR>
them to fundamentally alter the way they do<BR>
business:<BR>

<P>~ government-unique cost principles and        <BR>
  accounting standards;<BR>
        <BR>
~ extensive audit and oversight requirements;<BR>
 <BR>
~ requirements to meet unnecessarily detailed<BR>
  specifications and standards with the resultant<BR>
  testing and inspection done to ensure conformance<BR>
  with those requirements;<BR>

<P>~ government technical data rights policies, which<BR>
  may require companies to give up rights to<BR>
  proprietary data that are closely guarded in the<BR>
  competitive marketplace;<BR>

<P>~ contract clauses intended to promote certain<BR>
  social goals (e.g., requirements to transport<BR>
  materials only in U.S.-flag vessels), that<BR>
  interfere with the contractor's normal business<BR>
  practices; and <BR>

<P>~ commercially unacceptable requirements levied on<BR>
  subcontractors.<BR>

<P>Unique oversight, auditing, and pricing requirements<BR>
do not need to be applied to commercial products<BR>
because the marketplace regulates the buyer/seller<BR>
relationship. Unique socio-economic laws applied<BR>
only to government contractors discourage commercial<BR>
companies  who could otherwise meet the government's<BR>
needs.<BR>
 <BR>
 D. Plan for the Future. DOD will propose a new<BR>
subchapter of Title 10, specifically tailored to<BR>
commercial item acquisitions, to create a new rule<BR>
structure and provide for exemptions from statutes<BR>
that create barriers to the use of commercial items.<BR>
Due to the general applicability of this proposed<BR>
inititiative, DOD recommends that this legislative<BR>
proposal be amended to apply governmentwide. This<BR>
new chapter will: <BR>

<P>~ Include stronger policy language in favor of the<BR>
  use of commercial and nondevelopmental items in 10<BR>
  U.S.C. Sec. 2301.<BR>

<P>~ Create a new definition of commercial items<BR>
  distinct from the definition of non-developmental<BR>
  items in 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2302.<BR>

<P>~ Exempt the acquisition of commercial items from<BR>
  the Truth in Negotiations Act, 10 U.S.C. Sec.<BR>
  2306a, by utilizing fair and reasonable pricing<BR>
  standards.<BR>

<P>~ Create new exemptions to technical data<BR>
  requirements for commercial items. <BR>

<P>~ Exempt commercial items from _Buy American_<BR>
  and domestic source restrictions and certain other<BR>
  socio-economic requirements.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will be transmitted to OMB<BR>
as a legislative proposal. A Process Action Team has<BR>
been formed to develop an implementation plan for<BR>
the move from government-unique product or process<BR>
specifications or standards to commercial<BR>
specifications or standards. DOD will determine the<BR>
most serious impediments to commercial item<BR>
acquisition that do not require statutory change and<BR>
will form a Process Action Team to develop<BR>
regulatory changes. Another Process Action Team will<BR>
be formed to evaluate actions necessary to ensure<BR>
full utilization of commercial buying practices<BR>
authorized under DFARS 211.<BR>

<P>F. Performance Metrics. As the administrative burden<BR>
on contractors is reduced, DOD expects a substantial<BR>
reduction in costs to the government. There also<BR>
will be a commensurate reduction in the number of<BR>
DOD personnel required to enforce lessened oversight<BR>
requirements for commercial item acquisition. This<BR>
will translate into significant savings as well. DOD<BR>
also expects increased access to the latest advanced<BR>
commercial technologies.<BR>

<P>3. Defense Acquisition Pilot Program<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. For years<BR>
Rockwell had been manufacturing and selling<BR>
semiconductor devices to both the defense and<BR>
commercial markets. To produce economies of scale<BR>
and take advantage of efficiencies available through<BR>
a combined operation, Rockwell moved its<BR>
military semiconductor operations into its<BR>
commercial facilities. Because only a very small<BR>
percentage (less than 5 percent) of the business was<BR>
defense, it was not cost-effective to redo the<BR>
accounting systems to comply with accounting,<BR>
purchasing, and other government procurement<BR>
regulations. Because it did not want to comply with<BR>
government cost accounting and other rules, Rockwell<BR>
was unable to sell semiconductors made on the<BR>
commercial line to its defense customers (even<BR>
though the economy of producing in high volume would<BR>
have been a cost advantage to the government).<BR>
Attempts to resolve this dilemma with government<BR>
representatives  were not successful. Rockwell<BR>
continued to support its existing defense  customers<BR>
by giving them the semiconductors free until<BR>
theycould obtain  alternate sources. Rockwell ended<BR>
up giving away about $1 million worth  of commercial<BR>
work over three to four years un  til the programs<BR>
were completed. Since then, that Rockwell division<BR>
has not sold to the government.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. The critical ingredient of<BR>
adaptation to commercial practice is conversion from<BR>
a regulation-based system to a market-based system.<BR>
The purpose of the pilot programs is to take early<BR>
advantage of conversion to a market-based system by<BR>
removing barriers to the use of commercial practices<BR>
and products. Successful pilot programs will enhance<BR>
use of commercial products and reliance on a<BR>
national industrial base. This will preserve the<BR>
U.S. industrial base and stabilize domestic<BR>
employment opportunities.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. Section 809 of the fiscal<BR>
year 1991 Defense Authorization Act created a<BR>
_Defense Acquisition Pilot Program_ to test whether<BR>
or not efficiencies could be achieved from using<BR>
standard, commercial industrial practices to procure<BR>
defense goods and services. Section 800 of the same<BR>
Act created the DOD Advisory Panel on streamlining<BR>
and codifying acquisition laws. Its final report is<BR>
now the baseline for the acquisition of commercial<BR>
items.<BR>

<P>In 1991, the Center for Strategic and International<BR>
Studies (CSIS) released a report titled _Integrating<BR>
Commercial and Military Technologies for National<BR>
Strength._ In that report, CSIS concluded that _many<BR>
companies have dual systems of administration,<BR>
management, research and development (R&amp;D), or<BR>
production in order to comply with the unique<BR>
requirements of federal contracting while also<BR>
pursuing their commercial goals._ The study further<BR>
found that _the burdens and risks of federal<BR>
contracting increase the cost of the goods and<BR>
services the government buys (without increasing the<BR>
value), unnecessarily limit competition to companies<BR>
that have instituted the appropriate compliance<BR>
systems, and restrict federal access to world-class<BR>
commercial production and management systems._<BR>

<P>Because the original report was based on case study<BR>
evidence, CSIS conducted a follow-on study,<BR>
surveying more than 200 firms. The principal<BR>
conclusion of the survey analysis, stated in the<BR>
CSIS report _Integrating Civilian and Military<BR>
Technologies: An Industry Survey,_ was that _most<BR>
companies that operate in both the commercial and<BR>
federal markets alter their business procedures in<BR>
order to  sell to the federal government and that<BR>
the cost premium to  the government can be<BR>
substantial._ <BR>
 <BR>
 DOD has identified seven candidate pilot programs<BR>
analogous to commercial item acquisitions to get a<BR>
head start on the efficiencies achieved through the<BR>
use of commercial practices, while awaiting<BR>
legislative action on the Section 800 Panel<BR>
recommendations. The seven pilot programs are Fire<BR>
Support Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (FSCATT);<BR>
Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM); Joint Primary<BR>
Aircraft Training System (JPATS); Commercial<BR>
Derivative Aircraft (CDA); Commercial Derivative<BR>
Engine (CDE); Global Grid; and certain medical,<BR>
subsistence, and clothing commodities of the Defense<BR>
Personnel Support Center (DPSC). <BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future.  DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Develop a package of statutory waivers that<BR>
  will be applied to the pilot programs.<BR>
        <BR>
~ Develop a package of regulatory waivers<BR>
  that will complement the statutory waivers. They<BR>
  will remove barriers to commercial practices and<BR>
  commercial item acquisition that are imposed by<BR>
  DOD.<BR>

<P>~ Develop an implementation strategy for each pilot<BR>
  program that will govern how that program will<BR>
  operate and be overseen in the streamlined<BR>
  commercial environment.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The pilot program candidates have<BR>
been approved by OMB and will be submitted to<BR>
Congress as a legislative proposal. Congress must<BR>
designate the programs as pilot programs and specify<BR>
the statutory waiver authority permitted the<BR>
Secretary of Defense  for pilot programs.<BR>
 <BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. The pilot programs will be<BR>
evaluated against baselines such as competition<BR>
(increases in both the number of firms competing and<BR>
the number of commercial firms that have not<BR>
previously competed for defense contracts), program<BR>
schedule and cost, and administrative support cost<BR>
and time.<BR>

<P>4. Military Specifications and Standards<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. The FAA certified<BR>
Allison 250-C30R Army helicopter engine (used in<BR>
lieu of a milspec engine) differs from the<BR>
commercial version in only one part. The engine was<BR>
procured as an off-the-shelf item, eliminating five<BR>
to eight years of DOD development time and cost.<BR>
Only the electronic fuel flow component, which<BR>
required approximately 30 months to develop and<BR>
certify, was developed specifically for DOD.<BR>
Compared to a military developed and qualified<BR>
engine, which the Army estimates would have cost<BR>
approximately $200 million, seven certified<BR>
off-the-shelf commercial engines were procured for<BR>
less than $2 million. Commercial warranties have<BR>
proven to be as good as--if not better--than<BR>
military equivalents. In addition, the Army has been<BR>
able to take advantage of several _commercial use_<BR>
changes that provided extended life in the desert<BR>
environment of the Gulf War.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Use of military-unique<BR>
specifications and standards must be prohibited<BR>
unless they are the only practical alternative to<BR>
ensure a product or service will meet the user's<BR>
needs. DOD must describe its needs in terms of<BR>
performance required and in a manner that permits<BR>
maximum reliance on existing commercial items,<BR>
practices, processes, and capabilities. Firms<BR>
currently unwilling or unable to change their<BR>
products to comply with military-unique<BR>
specifications and standards will see enhanced<BR>
business opportunities with DOD.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. The CSIS report _Road Map<BR>
for Milspec Reform: Integrating Commercial and<BR>
Military Manufacturing_ notes, _In the milspec area,<BR>
there is literally nothing new under the sun._ The<BR>
report goes on to say, _The problem is not defining<BR>
what needs to be done, but identifying the best way<BR>
to do it and then committing the resources and<BR>
staying the course in the face of bureaucratic or<BR>
political resistance._  Since 1986, there have been<BR>
at least seven major initiatives to decrease<BR>
reliance on military-unique specifications and<BR>
standards. These seven initiatives are:<BR>

<P>~ 400 Federal Supply Class Initiative, to restrict<BR>
  the revision or introduction of new military<BR>
  specifications and standards in those<BR>
  commercial-like product supply classes.<BR>

<P>~ Qualified Manufacturers List Initiative, to        <BR>
  qualify a manufacturer's process rather than       <BR>
  individual products.<BR>
        <BR>
~ Defense Management Review Working Group 9<BR>
  Initiative, to perform a zero-based review of<BR>
  military specifications and standards, canceling<BR>
  those documents that were no longer needed,<BR>
  replacing those documents that could be replaced<BR>
  with commercial specifications and standards, and<BR>
  retaining and updating documents for<BR>
  military-unique products and processes.<BR>

<P>~ Commercial Acquisition Demonstration Program <BR>
  Initiative, to define commercial item acquisition<BR>
  and identify impediments or restrictions.<BR>

<P>~ Simplified Non-government Standard Adoption<BR>
  Initiative, to significantly increase the number<BR>
  of adopted non-government standards.<BR>

<P>~ Commercial Military Document Tiger Team<BR>
  Initiative, to ensure that action was being taken<BR>
  to adopt commercial specifications or convert<BR>
  military specifications to commercial documents in<BR>
  a limited number of highly commercial federal<BR>
  supply classes.<BR>

<P>~ Special Non-government Standard Conversion<BR>
  Initiative, to convert military and federal<BR>
  specifications and standards in specific product<BR>
  areas to non-government standards by establishing<BR>
  or using existing private sector standards<BR>
  committees.<BR>

<P>Although progress toward decreasing reliance on<BR>
military specifications and standards has been made,<BR>
it is not moving quickly enough. DOD has increased<BR>
the number of adopted non-government standards from<BR>
3,279 to 5,617 (a 71 percent increase) and the<BR>
number of commercial item descriptions from 1,973 to<BR>
4,857 (a 146 percent increase) over the last seven<BR>
years.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Perform comprehensive market research to identify<BR>
  potential commercial alternatives, and conduct<BR>
  aggressive cost-performance trade-offs to ensure<BR>
  that system requirements do not preclude use of<BR>
  commercial products or processes.<BR>

<P>~ State requirements in terms of performance or<BR>
  form, fit, and function, and eliminate _how-to_<BR>
  requirements for management and manufacturing<BR>
  processes and permit _best commercial practices._<BR>

<P>~ Rapidly eliminate unnecessary and obsolete<BR>
  specifications and standards.<BR>
        <BR>
~ Use commercial-type specifications and standards<BR>
  and non-governmental standards to the greatest<BR>
  extent practicable. <BR>
        <BR>
 ~ Expedite conversion of military specifications<BR>
   and standards for commercial items to commercial<BR>
   item descriptions (CIDs) and non-governmental<BR>
   standards; work with non-governmental standards<BR>
   bodies to develop commercial equivalencies where<BR>
   suitable non-governmental standards do not exist<BR>
   today.<BR>

<P>~ Encourage industry, where military specifications<BR>
  and standards are used, to propose alternative<BR>
  solutions as substitutes for the referenced<BR>
  military specifications and standards to the<BR>
  maximum extent practicable.<BR>

<P>~ Ensure that military specifications and        <BR>
  standards documents are applied correctly on       <BR>
  contracts.<BR>
        <BR>
E. Action Plan. The Deputy Under Secretary<BR>
of Defense (Acquisition Reform) has directed that a<BR>
cross-functional Process Action Team be formed<BR>
including representatives from the Office of the<BR>
Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, and<BR>
the Defense Logistics Agency to: (1) develop a<BR>
specific and comprehensive strategy and plan of<BR>
action to ensure maximum progress within the<BR>
shortest period of time toward elimination of<BR>
unnecessary military product and process standards<BR>
and specifications; and (2) to ensure that DOD<BR>
describes its needs in ways that permit maximum<BR>
reliance on existing commercial items, practices,<BR>
processes, and capabilities. The team began work in<BR>
late August and will<BR>
have its draft plan for the future by the end of<BR>
November.<BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. The Defense Science Board<BR>
reports that savings of 15 percent are feasible if<BR>
only half of the major weapons systems were designed<BR>
without military specifications. The Process Action<BR>
Team will develop appropriate metrics, considering<BR>
such tools as the number of commercial item<BR>
descriptions and non-government standards applied on<BR>
contract.<BR>

<P>5. Contract Formation<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. Several contracts<BR>
were awarded for urgently needed supplies to support<BR>
military units in Europe. One week after the awards<BR>
were made, an unsuccessful offeror lodged a protest<BR>
with GAO. Under existing bid protest rules, DOD had<BR>
to suspend contract performance until the bid<BR>
protest was resolved. Generally this takes a minimum<BR>
of 45 days. After two informal discussions and one<BR>
formal debriefing explaining the bid selection to<BR>
the protestor, the company withdrew its protest. The<BR>
needed supplies finally were delivered to the<BR>
European theater.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Current procurement regulations<BR>
make it difficult if not impossible to do business<BR>
with private companies on terms that they<BR>
customarily use. The system needs to be streamlined,<BR>
mirroring commercial practices when appropriate, so<BR>
that companies are encouraged, not discouraged, from<BR>
doing business with DOD. For example, DOD is<BR>
considering experimenting with purchasing aircraft<BR>
that are derived from commercial aircraft such as<BR>
the 767 or MD-11. By reforming the acquisition<BR>
system, DOD will be able to tap innovative products<BR>
and services that otherwise would be unavailable,<BR>
and at the same time provide increased business<BR>
opportunities to many firms not now interested in<BR>
contracting with DOD.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. DOD has identified a<BR>
number of burdensome laws and regulations that<BR>
clearly inhibit the buyer-seller relationship and<BR>
DOD's ability to buy the products it needs. These<BR>
laws and regulations were passed to prevent waste,<BR>
fraud, and abuse and to promote competition. But<BR>
there have been many changes in technology. DOD<BR>
needs to rely more heavily on the commercial<BR>
marketplace. <BR>

<P>Mindful of this, the Section 800 Panel, which<BR>
reviewed 80 DOD contract<BR>
laws relating to the contract formation process,<BR>
recommended changing the laws to build more<BR>
flexibility and innovation into the acquisition<BR>
process. DOD contracting laws cover publicizing<BR>
requirements, competing or justifying the absence of<BR>
competition, soliciting offers, evaluating bids and<BR>
proposals, and pricing and awarding contracts. The<BR>
proposed changes would allow DOD to continue to<BR>
conduct its procurement process in an open, fair,<BR>
and ethical manner while still meeting mission<BR>
requirements more effectively.<BR>

<P>Examples of burdens on the contracting system: <BR>
**********************************************<BR>

<P>~ The Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) allows large<BR>
  contracts to be awarded without price competition<BR>
  only if the supplier can provide a detailed<BR>
  breakdown of how it arrived at its price. Because<BR>
  of the expense, and because commercial contractors<BR>
  do not price their products on the basis of the<BR>
  specific costs to build them, commercial<BR>
  contractors do not typically maintain cost<BR>
  accounting systems that can provide the type of <BR>
  detailed cost information required by the<BR>
  government. The Section 800 Panel concluded that<BR>
  the requirement to provide cost or pricing data<BR>
  should be stabilized at contracts worth $500,000,<BR>
  rather than having it revert back to $100,000, as<BR>
  present law provides. It also recommended that the<BR>
  exemptions to TINA be broadened to facilitate the<BR>
  acquisition of commercial products.<BR>

<P>~ Current law requires that executive agencies<BR>
  publish notice of their intent to contract 15 days<BR>
  before releasing their requests for bids and<BR>
  proposals, and that companies be given 30 days to<BR>
  respond before a contract is awarded. The law was<BR>
  established to promote competition and enhance<BR>
  opportunities for small businesses. However, the<BR>
  statutes do not recognize that many in the private<BR>
  sector now routinely find out about business<BR>
  opportunities through electronic bulletin boards,<BR>
  which convey information more quickly, and use<BR>
  total electronic data interchange (EDI) systems<BR>
  that enable them to provide quotes automatically.<BR>

<P>In 1986, Congress established a preference for<BR>
off-the-shelf technology available in the commercial<BR>
marketplace. DOD believes that this preference will<BR>
become more and more important as its budget is<BR>
reduced. When Congress established this preference,<BR>
it did not amend many basic competition statutes to<BR>
ease regulations governing these purchases. After a<BR>
review of these statutes, the Section 800 Panel<BR>
recommended that laws be amended to lift these<BR>
barriers to the competitive acquisition of<BR>
non-developmental items.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Champion the effort to maintain our technological<BR>
  superiority by fostering the integration of the<BR>
  defense and commercial industrial sectors into a<BR>
  national industrial and technology base (composed<BR>
  primarily of commercial companies that can meet<BR>
  the needs of DOD).<BR>
 <BR>
~ Propose Congress amend Title 10 U.S.C. to<BR>
  incorporate a broad defense procurement policy<BR>
  that integrates existing congressional policy and<BR>
  the 10 strategic DOD procurement objectives<BR>
  identified by the Section 800 Panel. Due to the<BR>
  general applicability of this proposed<BR>
  inititiative, DOD recommends that this legislative<BR>
  proposal be amended to apply governmentwide.<BR>

<P>~ Propose establishment of a uniform threshold of<BR>
  $500,000 for application of the Truth in <BR>
  Negotiation Act (TINA) and broaden the exemption<BR>
  to include commercial products and leading-edge<BR>
  commercial technology. Due to the general<BR>
  applicability of this proposed inititiative, DOD<BR>
  recommends that this legislative proposal be<BR>
  amended to apply governmentwide.<BR>

<P>~ Propose the establishment of a legislative policy<BR>
  requiring timely and meaningful debriefings to<BR>
  unsuccessful offerors and the establishment of a<BR>
  contract protest file that would be accessible to<BR>
  all offerors.<BR>

<P>~ Propose that Congress consider and study the<BR>
  creation of a single independent forum for<BR>
  resolving bid protests (to streamline the<BR>
  process).<BR>

<P>~ Propose that Congress amend the statute to delete<BR>
  the authority and rule structure for master<BR>
  agreements for advisory and assistance services<BR>
  and set forth a new more flexible authority for<BR>
  task order and other similar contracts. Due to the<BR>
  general  applicability of this proposed<BR>
  inititiative, DOD  recom-mends that this<BR>
  legislative proposal be amended to  apply<BR>
  governmentwide.<BR>
 <BR>
~ Propose to Congress a change to allow the head of<BR>
  an agency to waive the percentage limitations on<BR>
  obligations on undefinitized contract actions (in<BR>
  certain limited cases).<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel recommendations have<BR>
been finalized and will be transmitted to OMB as a<BR>
legislative proposal. DOD has already begun to<BR>
pursue the increased use of EC/EDI with the creation<BR>
of a Process Action Team (discussed earlier in the<BR>
section on Simplified Acquisition Thresholds).<BR>
Another Process Action Team has been established for<BR>
military specifications to assist DOD in<BR>
implementing a clear preference for commercial and<BR>
non-developmental items.<BR>

<P>F. Performance Metrics. The Department anticipates<BR>
that it can save money by redesigning its<BR>
acquisition processes. Significant savings will<BR>
occur in overhead for both DOD and the private<BR>
sector. DOD anticipates more favorable prices will<BR>
be offered as competition increases and contractor<BR>
overhead is reduced. The application of electronic<BR>
solutions will lead to increased efficiencies by<BR>
eliminating tasks currently performed by acquisition<BR>
personnel. Material managers both within DOD and<BR>
private industry should also be able to<BR>
significantly reduce their inventory holding costs<BR>
as DOD moves toward an acquisition system that<BR>
provides improved customer support. Improved<BR>
debriefings to unsuccessful offerors will also<BR>
result in DOD cost avoidance for protests not filed.<BR>

<P>6. Contract Administration<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. The executive had<BR>
been promoted from the commercial division of the<BR>
company and was looking forward to working in a<BR>
division whose major customer was the Department of<BR>
Defense. She was being briefed on all of the unique<BR>
rules that applied to DOD contracts--cost accounting<BR>
standards, audits, invoicing, vouchering, which<BR>
costs were allowable and which weren't, and so<BR>
on--and how all those affected her job. Much of what<BR>
she was hearing, particularly about some of the<BR>
costs not allowed under government contracts, she<BR>
thought made good sense for taxpayers. But she had<BR>
many questions. Too often the answer was, _I'm not<BR>
sure, I'll have to check with counsel or<BR>
accounting._ Finally, the new executive exclaimed,<BR>
_You may not mean to, but you're making it sound<BR>
like if anybody wants to work on government<BR>
contracts, they need to hire hundreds of attorneys<BR>
and CPAs!_<BR>

<P>_Well, actually,_ one of the managers admitted,<BR>
after some hesitation, _that is often the case._<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. The laws and regulations relating<BR>
to the contract administration process should be<BR>
clear, concise, easy to locate, and easy for<BR>
non-lawyers to understand. They should not prevent<BR>
companies from selling to the government. The<BR>
government's cost of administering a contract should<BR>
not be so high it does not justify the benefits<BR>
received.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. An April 1993 CSIS report,<BR>
_Integrating Civilian and Military Technologies: An<BR>
Industry Survey,_ said that in a survey of 206<BR>
companies, administrative costs of selling to the<BR>
government were from three to five times those of<BR>
selling commercially. A 1992 Defense Systems<BR>
Management College (DSMC) survey reported that costs<BR>
associated with government sales were roughly four<BR>
times those associated with those to commercial<BR>
customers.<BR>

<P>The DSMC data further showed that for every employee<BR>
in a comparable position in a commercial division of<BR>
the company, the government division employed eight<BR>
people in accounting, six in purchasing and<BR>
subcontracting, 12 in auditing, and two in the legal<BR>
department. In both reports, the government's unique<BR>
accounting requirements were identified as one of<BR>
the primary causes of those higher expenses. <BR>

<P>The government needs to streamline its accounting<BR>
requirements and acquisition laws--in effect, make<BR>
them more _commercial-like_ and easier to<BR>
understand. While DOD clearly recognizes that the<BR>
public must always remain fully protected against<BR>
possible abuses and waste, excessive administrative<BR>
costs harm companies_ competitiveness and<BR>
unnecessarily increase costs for DOD and the public.<BR>
 D. Plan for the Future. DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Propose a change to the Truth in Negotiations Act<BR>
  to exempt commercial items from Cost Accounting <BR>
  Standards (CAS) and propose to the CAS Board that<BR>
  it make its advance rule change a final rule. The<BR>
  imposition of CAS on commercial companies <BR>
  significantly increases their costs and forces<BR>
  most to set up separate production facilities for<BR>
  DOD and non-DOD customers, even though the <BR>
  product is largely, or even purely, commercial.<BR>
  Although the Cost  Accounting Standards Board<BR>
  recently issued an advance rule change that   <BR>
  increases the number of commercial item<BR>
  acquisitions that are exempt from CAS, many<BR>
  commercial item purchases will continue to be<BR>
  covered by CAS  unless Congress adopts DOD's<BR>
  proposed changes to the Truth in Negotiations Act<BR>
  (TINA). DOD believes that contractors should be<BR>
  completely free to fully integrate defense and<BR>
  commercial production whenever possible. <BR>

<P>~ Propose the consolidation of laws relating to<BR>
  advance, partial, and progress payments into one<BR>
  comprehensive statute. As the Section 800 Panel<BR>
  found, the many laws relating to payment are among<BR>
  the most duplicative, dispersed, and difficult to<BR>
  understand of any of the laws affecting contract<BR>
  administration. Due to the general applicability<BR>
  of this proposed inititiative, the DOD  recommends<BR>
  that this legislative proposal be amended to <BR>
  apply governmentwide.<BR>
 <BR>
~ Propose the amendment of useful and valuable laws<BR>
  and authorities originally passed for wartime or<BR>
  national emergency conditions so that they are<BR>
  applicable to normal, peacetime conditions as<BR>
  well. For example: Public Law 85-804,<BR>
  _Extraordinary Contractual Relief,_ has proved<BR>
  useful during peacetime, yet is available only<BR>
  during a national emergency declared by the<BR>
  Congress or the President and for six months<BR>
  thereafter. Similarly, 41 U.S.C.15, which limits<BR>
  assignments of payments under contracts except in<BR>
  time of war or national emergency, has proven<BR>
  useful particularly to small businesses in <BR>
  obtaining private financing.<BR>

<P>~ Propose the repeal of duplicative, superseded, or<BR>
  outdated laws. For example, the Vinson-Trammell<BR>
  Act, a limitation upon defense contractors_<BR>
  profits, has been ineffective for most of its life<BR>
  because Congress, starting in the 1940's, came to<BR>
  realize that its approach of limiting profits to<BR>
  specific percentages of contract prices actually<BR>
  curtails incentives to reduce costs, and so passed<BR>
  several successive statutes that restricted the<BR>
  application of the Act. <BR>

<P>~ Propose the repeal of laws that are not<BR>
  cost-effective. The Section 800 Panel found that<BR>
 <BR>
  some laws, such as 10 U.S.C. 2403, which requires<BR>
  contractor guarantees for major weapon systems,<BR>
  inadvertently cause DOD managers and contractors<BR>
  to take actions or make decisions that cost more<BR>
  than the benefits are worth. Even though such laws<BR>
  often contain provisions for exemptions where<BR>
  costs of compliance outweigh the benefits, the<BR>
  laws nonetheless establish such strong<BR>
  presumptions for a particular course of action<BR>
  that many managers are reluctant to challenge the<BR>
  laws_ presumptions.<BR>

<P>~ Establish a Process Action Team to develop<BR>
  recommendations for change to DOD's internal<BR>
  contract administration procedures. DOD already<BR>
  has several initiatives underway to streamline and<BR>
  simplify contract administration. Two very<BR>
  successful initiatives are the Defense Contract<BR>
  Management Command's Process-Oriented Contract<BR>
  Administration Services (PROCAS) and the<BR>
  Contractor Risk Assessment Guide (CRAG) program,<BR>
  administered by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.<BR>
  The success of these programs suggests DOD can go<BR>
  still further in relieving the burden of contract<BR>
  administration for both the government and<BR>
  contractors. The Process Action Team will look at<BR>
  all contract administration activities and develop<BR>
  a strategy and implementation plan for improving<BR>
  the efficiency of DOD contract administration<BR>
  procedures while still fully protecting the<BR>
  public's interests against abuse and waste. Some<BR>
  of the issues the team will examine are exempting<BR>
  mostly commercial producers from incurred cost<BR>
  audits and allowing contractors_ interest costs <BR>
  in lieu of government-provided financing.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. For those items requiring<BR>
congressional action, DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will be transmitted to OMB<BR>
as a legislative proposal. DOD will make a<BR>
recommendation to the Cost Accounting Standards<BR>
Board to make its recent advance rule changes in CAS<BR>
a final rule.<BR>

<P>F. Performance Metrics. With implementation of the<BR>
measures above, DOD expects that the administrative<BR>
costs companies incur in doing business with the<BR>
Department will decline substantially and come much<BR>
closer to those costs experienced in selling to the<BR>
commercial market.<BR>

<P>7. Major Systems and Testing Statutes<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. A government<BR>
procurement expert from academia testified before<BR>
the Senate that DOD program managers spend more time<BR>
answering questions from all the people around the<BR>
Department of Defense than they do running their<BR>
program. The program manager of an admittedly<BR>
troubled Air Force program estimated that 70 percent<BR>
of the program office's activity was consumed in<BR>
responding to external oversight demands rather than<BR>
managing the contract.<BR>

<P>One Army program executive officer indicated that<BR>
Army program managers spend between 300 and 600<BR>
man-hours of effort annually preparing just<BR>
the Selected Acquisition Report and the Unit Cost<BR>
Report.  <BR>
Some weapons systems undergoing testing to determine<BR>
whether they meet operational performance criteria<BR>
must comply with testing requirements in three<BR>
different statutes, and at least two different<BR>
reports must be submitted to Congress.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Weapons systems, which consume the<BR>
majority of the DOD acquisition budget, require<BR>
independent oversight and thorough testing. DOD<BR>
needs to retain the broad policy contained in the<BR>
current major systems and testing statutes. However,<BR>
these rules are excessively detailed, duplicative,<BR>
and inconsistent with the realities of a declining<BR>
defense budget. The Department needs to streamline<BR>
them, provide additional flexibility, and reduce<BR>
non-value-added oversight.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. The DOD Acquisition Law<BR>
Advisory Panel, commonly known as the Section 800<BR>
Panel, reviewed the major systems and testing<BR>
statutes and made the following recommendations:<BR>

<P>~ Remove the excessive detail from the Selected<BR>
  Acquisition Report (10 U.S.C. 2432), incorporate<BR>
  the Unit Cost Report requirement (10 U.S.C. 2433)<BR>
  into the Selected Acquisition Report statute, and<BR>
  eliminate the 25 percent unit cost certification<BR>
  requirements.<BR>

<P>~ Streamline the requirement for independent cost<BR>
  and manpower estimates (10 U.S.C. 2434) and for<BR>
  program baselines (10 U.S.C. 2435) by eliminating<BR>
  statutory detail but retaining existing policy.<BR>

<P>~ Repeal the Defense Enterprise Program (10 U.S.C.<BR>
  2436) and the Milestone Authorization Program (10<BR>
  U.S.C. 2437) because neither program has been<BR>
  successfully implemented by DOD or supported by<BR>
  Congress.<BR>

<P>~ Repeal the statutory requirements for competitive<BR>
  prototyping (10 U.S.C. 2438) and competitive<BR>
  alternative sources (10 U.S.C. 2439) because<BR>
  mandating such strategies is inappropriate in<BR>
  today's reduced budget environment and may be<BR>
  unaffordable.<BR>

<P>~ Consolidate the four current testing statutes (10<BR>
  U.S.C. 2362, 2366, 2399, and 2400), which contain<BR>
  different definitions and excessive reporting<BR>
  requirements, into one streamlined statute.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will: <BR>

<P>~ Propose legislation incorporating many of        <BR>
  the Section 800 recommendations.<BR>
        <BR>
~ Establish a Process Action Team to develop<BR>
  an implementation plan to better integrate the<BR>
  processes for resource allocation and requirements<BR>
  determination. This will ensure that the most<BR>
  effective, affordable, technically feasible and<BR>
  best value solution to a deficiency in current<BR>
  military capability or emerging need is developed<BR>
  after consideration of realistic cost, schedule, <BR>
  performance, and industrial base considerations. <BR>
 <BR>
~ Establish a Process Action Team to develop a plan<BR>
  for tailoring  acquisition strategies and policies<BR>
  to various typesof procurements  (e.g., commercial<BR>
  products, research and development, major systems <BR>
  acquisitions with little risk, major systems ac <BR>
  quisition with significant risk), considering such<BR>
  factors as the appropriate amount of oversight,<BR>
  among others.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will be transmitted to OMB<BR>
as a legislative proposal. Process Action Teams will<BR>
be established to recommend actions to better<BR>
integrate resource allocation, requirements<BR>
determination, and the acquisition system and to<BR>
tailor acquisition processes and regulations.<BR>

<P>F. Performance Metrics. The military departments<BR>
have estimated that reduction in oversight and<BR>
reporting requirements could reduce program office<BR>
workload and lead to program office staffing<BR>
reductions. Reduction of workload and any staff<BR>
reductions will be tracked.<BR>

<P>8. Defense Trade and Cooperation<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. Negotiations on<BR>
the U.S. Navy's AV-8B Harrier II Plus cooperative<BR>
radar integration program with Italy and Spain were<BR>
significantly disrupted by an unrelated U.S.-Spain<BR>
dispute over the statutory prohibition against<BR>
purchasing foreign anchor mooring chain. This<BR>
jeopardized the entire II Plus research and<BR>
development program. The $165 million Harrier II<BR>
Plus Program was equally shared by the three<BR>
countries and has resulted in additional follow-on<BR>
production and support of approximately $1 <BR>
billion--which translates into 25,000 U.S. jobs.<BR>
 <BR>
 The United States and its allies cannot continue to<BR>
proceed down parallel development and production<BR>
paths because of the staggering costs of developing<BR>
and fielding new systems. For example, it would have<BR>
been far less expensive for the nations that are<BR>
participating in the development of the European<BR>
Fighter Aircraft (EFA) to have bought an improved<BR>
F-16 Agile Falcon or F-18 Hornet. The comparable<BR>
costs are $20-30 million per copy for F-16/F-18<BR>
variant versus costs of approximately $40-60 million<BR>
for the EFA.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Promote the U.S. defense technology<BR>
and industrial base in times of declining defense<BR>
expenditures by exporting defense items to our<BR>
allies and broadening the pattern of international<BR>
armaments cooperation.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. The integration of<BR>
international and domestic economic security is<BR>
emerging as a key issue to be considered as the<BR>
United States restructures its defense<BR>
establishment. DOD needs to focus on the economic<BR>
aspects of American security, because defense<BR>
acquisi-tion faces the twin challenges of reducing<BR>
procurement expenditures while preserving a viable<BR>
industrial and technology base. A robust industrial<BR>
base is required to promote American technological<BR>
competitiveness and ensure needed domestic _surge_<BR>
capacity in a wide variety of crisis mobilization<BR>
scenarios--not unlike Operation Desert Shield.  DOD<BR>
needs to reassess its international agreements in<BR>
light of the new types of threats it faces. Just as<BR>
DOD found in Operation Desert Storm that its<BR>
inter-service agreements did not provide the needed<BR>
flexibility to accommodate all contingencies, the<BR>
same would hold true for its international<BR>
cross-servicing agreements.<BR>

<P>Items acquired by DOD must often be the same as--or<BR>
function with--articles acquired by our allies. DOD<BR>
should have additional statutory authority, for<BR>
example, to encourage the purchase of NATO-standard<BR>
items, which may or may not be available from U.S.<BR>
sources, as well as to encourage increased allied<BR>
burden-sharing. Likewise where NATO-standard items<BR>
are or could be available from U.S. sources, DOD<BR>
should encourage their export and thus enhance the<BR>
competitiveness of our national defense technology<BR>
and industrial base.<BR>

<P>As the domestic requirement for new weapons systems<BR>
decreases, there may be an increased opportunity to<BR>
participate in defense cooperation projects<BR>
and sell U.S. products and services abroad. Selling<BR>
U.S. defense products abroad not only permits the<BR>
economic production of such products, while lowering<BR>
the unit cost of items for U.S. forces, but will<BR>
also enhance the national defense technology and<BR>
industrial base. The United States can expect that<BR>
as our allies look to foreign exports to help their<BR>
own industrial base problems, defense companies<BR>
could use assistance in promoting their<BR>
exports--assistance that DOD is not in a position to<BR>
provide without  additional statutory authority. <BR>
 <BR>
 Further, the issue of domestic source restrictions,<BR>
such as the Buy American Act, is a contentious one.<BR>
To determine whether DOD may  or must limit<BR>
competition for an item to domestic sources  only, a<BR>
contracting officer must review the following <BR>
sources:<BR>

<P>~ the Trade Agreements Act, Title 19;         <BR>
~ the Buy American Act, Title 41;      <BR>
~ military assistance and foreign military        <BR>
  sales, Title 22;<BR>
~ various annual authorization and appropriations<BR>
  acts;<BR>
~ international treaties; and<BR>
~ memoranda of understanding and related        <BR>
  international agreements.<BR>
        <BR>
        Although there are certain technologies that<BR>
may be so essential to national security that such<BR>
products must be developed and acquired only from<BR>
U.S. sources, _Buy American_ statutes often are not<BR>
tied to a clear analysis that production of the<BR>
items in the United States is essential to national<BR>
security. Restricting acquisitions to U.S. sources<BR>
often causes a _tit-for-tat_ reaction from other<BR>
countries that precludes U.S. companies from<BR>
bidding. Protectionism has not proven effective in<BR>
maintaining the viability of U.S. industry absent<BR>
other factors.<BR>

<P>The Secretary of Defense is in the best position to<BR>
restrict acquisitions to U.S. sources and control<BR>
the foreign ownership of key defense industry<BR>
sectors to ensure this country's continuing military<BR>
strength. The Secretary is in the best position to<BR>
determine whether there is a level playing field in<BR>
defense trade with a particular country, and to<BR>
enter into defense acquisition partner-ships  to<BR>
share costs of research, development, and/or<BR>
production accordingly.  In analyzing the<BR>
legislative changes needed to help providethat level <BR>
playing field in defense trade and cooperation, the<BR>
Section 800  Acquisition Law Advisory Panel<BR>
concluded that: <BR>
 <BR>
~ Department of Defense international defense<BR>
  acquisition policies should be consistent, on a<BR>
  reciprocal basis, with the defense acquisition and<BR>
  trade policies of U.S. allies;<BR>

<P>~ Department of Defense international defense<BR>
  acquisition policies on international and<BR>
  cooperative agreements should be consistent with<BR>
  the maintenance of strong domestic technology,<BR>
  industrial, and mobilization bases;<BR>

<P>~ Department of Defense international defense<BR>
  acquisition policies  should be consistent with<BR>
  international operationalagreements, allied <BR>
  logistics support and standardization, and export<BR>
  sales of defense  items to foreign countries.<BR>
 <BR>
 In order to better take advantage of cooperative<BR>
program opportunities, the Secretary of Defense<BR>
should have the flexibility to adapt to the<BR>
acquisition practices, rules, and procedures for<BR>
international partnerships that treat our allies as<BR>
partners (contributing a significant portion of a<BR>
cooperative program costs while receiving a<BR>
commensurate share of the program work) as compared<BR>
to customers pursuant to the sales procedures and<BR>
rules of the Arms Export Control Act.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Seek to consolidate the statutory authorities<BR>
  concerning international cooperation, acquisition,<BR>
  cross-servicing, and standardization into a<BR>
  dedicated new chapter in Title 10, while<BR>
  recommending specific statutory revisions to<BR>
  cooperative project and international agreement<BR>
  authority.<BR>

<P>~ Propose to Congress an amendment to the Buy<BR>
  American Act to incorporate a substantial<BR>
  transformation rule-of-origin test, making it<BR>
  consistent with the Trade Agreements Act and other<BR>
  trade agreements, and seek to eliminate the DOD<BR>
  balance-of-payments evaluation differential.<BR>

<P>~ Seek to repeal or rescind all domestic source<BR>
  restrictions that are not enacted as part of a<BR>
  comprehensive restatement of law or established<BR>
  pursuant to the inherent statutory authority of<BR>
  the Secretary of Defense and based on industrial<BR>
  base considerations. <BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel recommendations have<BR>
been finalized and will be transmitted to OMB as a<BR>
legislative proposal. The _Plan for the Future_ in<BR>
section D above will be studied and addressed, with<BR>
appropriate legislative and regulatory<BR>
recommendations, through the formation of an<BR>
International Defense Acquisition Process Action<BR>
Team. The team will comprise experts and experienced<BR>
practitioners in the international defense<BR>
acquisition community and will be tasked to  devise<BR>
a strategy and implementation plan for achieving the <BR>
DOD vision.<BR>
 <BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. One military department<BR>
recently calculated that during the period<BR>
1987-1992, approximately  $555 million in savings<BR>
was realized from international cooperative research<BR>
and development programs. While these savings<BR>
demonstrate success in pursuit of _win-win_<BR>
international cooperative research and<BR>
developmentprograms, its success has largely been<BR>
accomplished in spite of--rather than because<BR>
of--the present legislative and regulatory system.<BR>
With implementation of a streamlined legislative and<BR>
regulatory framework to extend the cost sharing and<BR>
interoperability benefits of international<BR>
cooperative research and development programs<BR>
throughout DOD, savings of a similar or greater<BR>
magnitude are anticipated.<BR>

<P>9. Intellectual Property Rights<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. The company's<BR>
Vice President for Business Development was meeting<BR>
with his President. _This,_ the V.P. said, referring<BR>
to a DOD Request for Proposals, _we could do very<BR>
easily with an adaptation of the new traveling wave<BR>
technology we've just developed._<BR>

<P>&quot;So what's the problem?&quot; the president asked.<BR>

<P>&quot;Technical data rights.&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;That shouldn't be any problem,&quot; the president said.<BR>
&quot;That technology's ours. We developed it all by<BR>
ourselves.&quot; <BR>

<P>&quot;Under their contracts, DOD always get unlimited<BR>
rights in &quot;form, fit, and<BR>
function&quot; data. They also get unlimited rights to<BR>
any manuals or training materials. Now, throw in<BR>
that adaptation I was talking about earlier. If we<BR>
bill the costs of developing the adaptation to the<BR>
contract, DOD is probably going to insist we<BR>
negotiate with them over rights to that data--and<BR>
probably more data, as well.&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;What do they plan to do with the data?&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;Among other things, probably use it for competitive<BR>
spare parts buys.&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;Which means,&quot; the president filled in, &quot;some sharp<BR>
person just might get enough information to figure<BR>
out the basis for our technology, and all of a<BR>
sudden, it's in the open and we have nothing to show<BR>
for our investment!&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;Right.&quot;<BR>

<P>The president shook his head slowly.<BR>

<P>&quot;Our choices, as I see it,&quot; the V.P. said, &quot;are to<BR>
bid with the new technology and take our chances,<BR>
bid with the old &quot;standard&quot; technology, or not bid.<BR>
What do you want to do?&quot;<BR>

<P>&quot;I don't know.&quot;<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. On an increasingly lethal<BR>
battlefield, the nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen,<BR>
and Marines require the best technology available,<BR>
no matter what its source. In order to achieve this<BR>
goal, DOD should acquire rights in technical data<BR>
and computer software in a manner that maximizes the<BR>
flow of technology from the commercial sector to DOD<BR>
and from DOD to industry, but that also allows<BR>
companies (and individuals) to protect their<BR>
commercial interests in technology, products, or<BR>
processes they have developed.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. In 1983, the stories of<BR>
exorbitant spare parts prices ($600 toilet seat and<BR>
$400 claw hammer) outraged the  nation. Congress<BR>
reacted by encouraging DOD to acquire rights in <BR>
technical data, not only to ensure safe and<BR>
efficient operation ofthe  equipment it buys, but to<BR>
make _follow-on_ and spare parts purchases <BR>
competitively to ensure DOD would not become<BR>
_captive_ to   the original equipment manufacturer.<BR>

<P>Companies, on the other hand, are concerned about<BR>
protecting their<BR>
compe-titive position in an economic environment<BR>
where success increasingly depends on which company<BR>
is first in bringing new products or new technology<BR>
to a global marketplace. This makes companies,<BR>
particularly those with commercial products,<BR>
cautious of releasing data, and wary of DOD as a<BR>
customer.<BR>

<P>In the mid-1980s, it became apparent that the areas<BR>
of confluence between com-mercial and military<BR>
technologies were increasing. Indeed, in some areas<BR>
vital to the development of weapon systems,<BR>
commercial companies had outpaced DOD's efforts (for<BR>
instance, in microprocessor technology, where<BR>
defense technology lags behind the best commercial<BR>
technology by three to five years). However, as the<BR>
Packard Commission pointed out in 1986, DOD's policy<BR>
of acquiring intellectual property rights was<BR>
affecting the willingness of firms to bring their<BR>
best technologies to the defense marketplace.<BR>

<P>Congress, aware of industry's concerns, responded<BR>
with amendments to existing statutes to promote a<BR>
better balance between the government's needs for<BR>
technical data and contractors' needs for protection<BR>
of proprietary data. In September 1985, DOD<BR>
published proposed implementing regulations that<BR>
failed to satisfy commercial companies' needs. The<BR>
proposed regulations were withdrawn. Several revised<BR>
proposals have been published since, which have also<BR>
failed to satisfy industry's concerns. DOD's current<BR>
policy for acquisition  of technical data rights is<BR>
defined by an _interim rule_  that took effect in<BR>
1988.<BR>
 <BR>
 In 1991, Congress created the Government-Industry<BR>
Technical Data Committee to review the government's<BR>
technical data rights policies. The committee has<BR>
been performing an exhaustive review of the current<BR>
policies and procedures and has made encouraging<BR>
progress. It has determined that a balancing of<BR>
developers' and the government's interests in<BR>
technical data and software can be made without<BR>
statutory change. <BR>

<P>Finally, secrecy orders on patent applica-tions,<BR>
patent infringement by government contractors, and<BR>
copyright protection of software continue to present<BR>
a problem between DOD and its contractors.<BR>
Resolution of these problems, along with those noted<BR>
above, is necessary to improve the long-term<BR>
competitiveness of domestic firms.<BR>

<P>D. Plan for the Future. DOD will:<BR>

<P>~ Promote new policies for the acquisition of<BR>
  technical data and computer software that will<BR>
  strike a balance between technology developers'<BR>
  commercial interests and the government's needs. <BR>

<P>~ Establish a Patent and Trademark Advisory<BR>
  Committee, chaired by DOD, to shift responsibility<BR>
  from the Patent and Trademark Office to a body<BR>
  with expertise in both the control of technology<BR>
  and its development and the capability to assess<BR>
  whether publication would be detrimental to the<BR>
  national defense, to conduct reviews to determine<BR>
  if a secrecy order should apply to a patent<BR>
  application. <BR>

<P>~ Propose an amendment to allow federal agencies to<BR>
  copyright software that their employees have<BR>
  developed as part of the employees' official<BR>
  duties.<BR>
Allow federal agencies to license software to<BR>
commercial companies to assure them that whatever<BR>
develop-ments or improvements they make in the<BR>
software will be protected by law. <BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. When the Government-Industry<BR>
Technical Data Committee submits its final<BR>
recommendations to DOD, public comments will be<BR>
obtained and analyzed, and DOD will prepare<BR>
regulatory coverage within 120 days. As required by<BR>
Section 807 of the 1992/1993 National Defense<BR>
Authorization Act, the Secretary of Defense will<BR>
report the committee's recommendations to Congress<BR>
at least 30 days before issuing the final<BR>
regulations. DOD will have any required implementing<BR>
regulations in place six months after passage of the<BR>
authorizing legislation.<BR>

<P>F. Performance Metrics. With the implementation of<BR>
the measures described above, DOD will begin closing<BR>
the technology gap in those areas where commercial<BR>
technology leads. DOD anticipates that there will be<BR>
a significant increase in the number of federal<BR>
software  developments that are successfully<BR>
commercialized.<BR>
 <BR>
 10. Service-Specific Acquisition Laws<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. A 1926 statute,<BR>
specifying that invitations for bids for<BR>
experimental aviation design and procurement be<BR>
advertised in at least three leading aeronautical<BR>
journals for not less than 30 days, remains in<BR>
effect even though it has clearly been superseded by<BR>
more recent legislation and no longer is relevant to<BR>
modern aviation acquisition.<BR>

<P>The Navy International Program Office faced<BR>
significant delays in the transfer of three Knox<BR>
class frigates and an Adams class destroyer to<BR>
Greece in early 1992 because of a requirement to<BR>
notify the congressional defense committees of such<BR>
transfers and then await expiration of 30 days<BR>
continuous session. Such delays, particularly in<BR>
_hot-ship_ transfers where the foreign crew relieves<BR>
the U.S. watch simultaneously with decommissioning,<BR>
cost money and manpower.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Grants of authoritythat remain<BR>
useful should be retained, consolidated and, where<BR>
necessary, amended to modernize them. Authorities<BR>
that are no longer used or are otherwise obsolete<BR>
should be repealed. <BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. Service-specific<BR>
acquisition statutes include Army and Air Force<BR>
statutes that evolve historically from the same<BR>
source law, and Navy-unique  laws. The laws include<BR>
many authorities that are decades--or even <BR>
centuries--old, and that have become obsolete or<BR>
rendered uselessby  more recent legislation.<BR>
Authorities that remain useful are not  available to<BR>
all the Secretaries of the military departments<BR>
andthe  Secretary of Defense.<BR>
 <BR>
 Specific limitations, such as the 6 percent fee<BR>
limit on architect-engineering contracts, no longer<BR>
serve their original purpose and are significant<BR>
administrative burdens, particularly for modern,<BR>
technically complex projects. Certain historical<BR>
authorities, while remaining useful to the military<BR>
depart-ments, do not fully address modern<BR>
acquisition requirements.<BR>

<P>D. Plan For the Future. DOD will propose that<BR>
Congress amend the relevant legislation to:<BR>

<P>~ Retain useful authorities and amend them to vest<BR>
  such authorities, when appropriate, in the<BR>
  Secretary of Defense as well as the secretaries of<BR>
  the military departments.<BR>

<P>~ Repeal obsolete statutes, such as the 6 percent<BR>
  fee limit on architect-engineering services.<BR>
        <BR>
~ Modernize the authority to sell or loan, to allow<BR>
  DOD to give samples  of items that may promote<BR>
  independent researchand development and provide<BR>
  for the sale of services from government test<BR>
  facilities for use by private contractors. <BR>
 <BR>
~ Modernize the authorities provided the Civil<BR>
  Reserve Air Fleet, to  permit private contractors<BR>
  limited commercial useof military airfields.<BR>
 <BR>
 E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will  be transmitted to OMB<BR>
as a legislative proposal.<BR>
 <BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. Elimination of the obsolete<BR>
6 percent fee limit should result in higher quality,<BR>
more efficient architect-engineering services and<BR>
eliminate significant administrative burdens in<BR>
ascertaining which services are subject to fee limit<BR>
and which are not. Elimination of duplicative<BR>
congressional notice requirements for Navy ship<BR>
transfers will reduce administrative costs.<BR>
Enactment of modernized authority to sell, loan, or<BR>
rent will facilitate technology transfer between<BR>
government and private sector. Enhancement of Civil<BR>
Reserve Air Fleet authorities will increase use of<BR>
the commercial air fleet to meet military transport<BR>
needs, with savings from decreased demand on<BR>
military aircraft.<BR>

<P>11. Standards of Conduct<BR>

<P>A. Description of Current Program. A DOD official<BR>
violates ethics rules by accepting a DOD<BR>
contractor's offer to fly on the contractor's<BR>
aircraft to the plant for an official inspection<BR>
visit, even if the alternatives cost much more and<BR>
are very inconvenient.<BR>

<P>One defense-unique post-employment restriction<BR>
resulted in DOD issuing more than 4,300 legal<BR>
advisory (_safe harbor_) opinions in a 19-month<BR>
period; in only 4 percent of those opinions did the<BR>
DOD find that the law even potentially applied.<BR>

<P>B. A Better Way. Acquisition laws should promote<BR>
financial and ethical integrity in ways that are<BR>
simple, understandable, and not unduly burdensome<BR>
and that encourage sound and efficient procurement<BR>
practices.<BR>

<P>C. Background/Experience. There are more than 100<BR>
statutory sections setting forth the rules guiding<BR>
standards of conduct in defense procurement. These<BR>
include statutes covering post-employment<BR>
restrictions of government personnel, contractor<BR>
certifications, and<BR>
false claims.<BR>

<P>Criminal fraud statutes--within Title 18 of the U.S.<BR>
Code--apply to all federal sector procurement and<BR>
provide for criminal remedies on false claims,<BR>
conspiracy to commit false claims, conspiracy to<BR>
defraud the government, and false statements; they<BR>
generally require a finding of specific intent to<BR>
deceive.<BR>

<P>Civil fraud statutes--the False Claims Act--provide<BR>
remedies for knowingly presenting, or conspiring to<BR>
present, false or fraudulent claims to the United<BR>
States for payment; the action may be brought by the<BR>
government or a private person on behalf of the<BR>
government (so-called qui tam actions) and provide<BR>
treble damages, with a qui tam plaintiff entitled to<BR>
up to 30 percent of recovery. <BR>

<P>Piecemeal legislation sets forth a wide variety of<BR>
restrictions on post-government employment<BR>
(including opportunities and discussions), gifts and<BR>
gratuities, acts affecting personal financial<BR>
interests, disclosure of procurement-related<BR>
information, and certification and reporting<BR>
requirements related to these issues, as well as<BR>
administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for<BR>
violations. <BR>

<P>Nearly all ethics laws overlap. The propriety of a<BR>
given event is nearly impossible to measure when two<BR>
laws apply competing tests to the same situations.<BR>
This spectrum of laws is a significant impediment to<BR>
defense acquisition.<BR>

<P>The recent efforts to create a scandal-proof<BR>
government have gone so far that on balance, they do<BR>
more harm than good. Some of these ethics reforms,<BR>
especially recent attempts to purify the procurement<BR>
process by imposing broad restrictions on<BR>
post-government employment, afford little ethical<BR>
protection at very high cost--a bad bargain for the<BR>
government and a bad bargain for the public. <BR>

<P>D. Plan For the Future. DOD will propose that<BR>
Congress:<BR>

<P>~ Adopt legislation proposed by Office of Government<BR>
  Ethics (OGE) and the Office of Federal Procurement <BR>
  Policy (OFPP) in 1990 and 1991 that would revise<BR>
  procurement integrity laws to simplify ethics<BR>
  requirements and make them consistent across<BR>
  government, including deletion of current<BR>
  contractor certification requirements in favor of<BR>
  a prohibition on disclosure or receipt of certain<BR>
  sensitive source selection or proprietary<BR>
  information.<BR>

<P>~ Clarify and simplify _revolving door_ laws by<BR>
  establishing one law that would prohibit certain<BR>
  former procurement officials from representing,<BR>
  aiding, or advising any person concerning a<BR>
  procurement for one year after government service.<BR>

<P>E. Action Plan. The DOD comments and a position on<BR>
each of the Section 800 Panel report recommendations<BR>
have been finalized and will  be transmitted to OMB<BR>
as a legislative proposal.<BR>
 <BR>
 F. Performance Metrics. Greater clarity in<BR>
government ethics laws will ease the administrative<BR>
burden of unnecessary interpretative opinions.<BR>
Modification of _revolving door_ laws will remove<BR>
barriers to higher quality recruitment within the<BR>
federal sector.

<P>***************************************************<BR>
This accompanying report, prepared by the staff of<BR>
the National Performance Review (NPR), laid the<BR>
groundwork for the recommendations in the NPR report<BR>
_From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government<BR>
that Works Better and Costs Less,_ released on<BR>
September 7, 1993. This report is based on the best<BR>
information available at that time. The specific<BR>
recommendations within these reports have been and<BR>
will continue to be given priority as part of the<BR>
FY95 Budget, legislative proposals, or other<BR>
administration initiatives, as appropriate.<BR>

<P>DOD01: Rewrite Policy Directives to Include Better<BR>
Guidance and Fewer Procedures<BR>

<P>
<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>Committed people and sufficient resources within the<BR>
Department of Defense have helped make the United<BR>
States the sole remaining superpower. Times and<BR>
available resources, however, are changing. DOD is<BR>
downsizing and must operate with substantially fewer<BR>
people. One obstacle to success in this new<BR>
environment is the weight of more than 10,000<BR>
directives and 470,000 pages of intermingled policy <BR>
and highly detailed procedures that have stifled<BR>
innovation and  efficiency in the past. These<BR>
publications contain many unnecessaryor  needlessly<BR>
restrictive procedures that shackle workers<BR>
throughout DOD.<BR>
 <BR>
 Over time, DOD's policy guidance has grown because<BR>
its bureaucratic, over-centralized headquarters<BR>
tended to decide what was best for the field. Policy<BR>
makers tried to cover all possible situations, and<BR>
managers attempted to prevent error by adding new<BR>
procedures every time a mistake was made. DOD buried<BR>
policy in detailed procedures. This growth of<BR>
detailed procedures severely limits inventiveness<BR>
and creativity in finding the least costly and most<BR>
effective means to accomplish changing missions.<BR>
Accountability decreases as errors are blamed on<BR>
_procedures_ or time-consuming requests for<BR>
waivers. Most important, the blurring of policy has<BR>
caused a loss of focus on the end product or goal.<BR>

<P>As a result of the NPR process, DOD has the<BR>
opportunity to change its operating principles. The<BR>
notion of _steer more and row less_ requires<BR>
centralized policymaking and decentralized policy<BR>
execution. The Office of the Secretary of Defense<BR>
(OSD), military services, and defense agencies<BR>
should focus on providing policy guidance while<BR>
allowing their field organizations the latitude to<BR>
determine how to carry out that policy. To achieve a<BR>
renewed, empowered environment, DOD should limit<BR>
directives to clearly stating desired results. DOD<BR>
must purge these directives of unnecessary,<BR>
encumbering, and restrictive procedures that stifle<BR>
innovation and efficiency.<BR>

<P>Two anecdotes--one from the Air Force and one from<BR>
the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)--demonstrate<BR>
success in clarifying policy and procedures. The Air<BR>
Force recognized that the key to success was to<BR>
empower people to be creative, accept<BR>
responsibility, and use their initiative to seek out<BR>
new, more efficient methods. It also recognized that<BR>
creative efforts must focus on doing the right<BR>
things. Policy became one of the Air Force's most<BR>
effective tools. It provided the focus on the _right<BR>
things_ and served as a guide. The Air Force's<BR>
Policy Review Initiative served to identify and<BR>
clarify the Air Force's most important tasks. It set<BR>
clear, concise policy; fixed accountability and<BR>
responsibility; and measured the accomplishment of<BR>
policy objectives.<BR>

<P>The Air Force has identified its most important,<BR>
_overarching_ policies in Air Force Policy<BR>
Directives (AFPDs). Written by Air Force<BR>
Headquarters (HQ USAF), these directives clearly and<BR>
concisely state policies, outline responsibilities<BR>
and authorities, and provide _CEO-level_ metrics to<BR>
measure performance. Senior leaders use management<BR>
information based on these metrics to make<BR>
_fact-based_ decisions. Policy directives are no<BR>
more than three to five pages long.<BR>

<P>The Air Force is rescinding all existing regulations<BR>
and retaining only those procedures required to<BR>
comply with law, address health and safety issues,<BR>
or standardize Air Force systems. Field operating<BR>
agencies or designated major commands are writing<BR>
these procedures, and HQ USAF is issuing them as Air<BR>
Force Instructions.<BR>

<P>The Air Force is replacing 1,510 regulations with<BR>
165 policy directives and 750 instructions<BR>
containing essential procedural guidance. Some<BR>
55,000 pages of intermingled policy and procedures<BR>
will become approximately 18,000 pages that clearly<BR>
separate policy from procedures. And, by mid-1994,<BR>
CD-ROM disks will replace printed documents.<BR>

<P>Commanders of the Air Force's major commands have<BR>
strongly approved of the increased latitude this<BR>
initiative provides and are quickly employing the<BR>
concept within their commands. In short, they also<BR>
are confining their headquarters instructions to<BR>
policy and leaving the _rowing_ for local<BR>
commanders.<BR>

<P>Similarly, the DLA's Defense Contract Management<BR>
Command (DCMC) replaced 16 manuals with the DCMC<BR>
Manual. Known as the _One Book,_ it is a single<BR>
document organized around DCMC services. The One<BR>
Book eliminates restrictive procedures because it<BR>
focuses only on headquarters policy and leaves<BR>
procedures to field activities. It has fundamentally<BR>
changed the way DCMC operates. The One Book has<BR>
empowered the field commanders to best apply<BR>
resources to achieve mission success.<BR>

<P>As a related initiative, DLA now uses CD-ROM<BR>
technology for many large logistical and policy<BR>
databases. The DLA Publishing System (DLAPS)<BR>
produces and distributes all policy, procedures, and<BR>
administrative-support documents on CD-ROM. DLA has<BR>
converted more than 800 DLA regulations, manuals,<BR>
and handbooks, containing 140,000 text and image<BR>
pages, to CD-ROM. For a one-time capital investment<BR>
of $900,000, DLA identified an annual cost savings<BR>
of $600,000 by eliminating conventional printing of<BR>
publications and reducing distribution and storage<BR>
costs. Additionally, DLA avoided $1,370,000 in<BR>
annual costs by no longer having to insert changed<BR>
pages in DLA publications. Users receive the most<BR>
complete, up-to-date inventory of publications every<BR>
three months on the DLAPS CD-ROM. The success of<BR>
this DLA initiative clearly demonstrates the<BR>
feasibility (and desirability) of using electronic<BR>
media to distribute the revised policies and<BR>
procedures advocated here.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should clarify policy and decentralize<BR>
procedures to empower people to do their jobs<BR>
better.<BR>

<P>The goal of the initiative is to provide clear,<BR>
concise statements of policy, define desired<BR>
results, and set performance measures. Further, DOD<BR>
should delegate responsibility and authority for<BR>
detailing procedures to the lowest possible level so<BR>
the field organizations can work within local<BR>
constraints. In pursuit of this goal, DOD should<BR>
establish procedures to ensure that existing policy<BR>
guidelines are reviewed and revised, future<BR>
guidelines meet specific criteria, performance of<BR>
the new guidelines is tracked, and all guidelines<BR>
_steer more and row less._<BR>

<P>2. Components (OSD, military services, and defense<BR>
agencies) must streamline their procedural guidance.<BR>

<P>Components should write directives that include only<BR>
essential procedures, e.g., required by law, safety,<BR>
health, or standardization. Writers should link<BR>
procedural publications to the overarching policy<BR>
directive that requires the essential guidance.<BR>
Components should group families of related<BR>
procedural documents into single publications.<BR>
Detailed procedures should be left to field<BR>
organizations.<BR>

<P>3. Components should institutionalize, in writing,<BR>
the process to revise policy and procedural<BR>
documents.<BR>

<P>They should annually certify that directive<BR>
publications are current and applicable and monitor<BR>
policy directive metrics to verify that policy<BR>
objectives are met. By evaluating progress and<BR>
benefits, components can continuously improve the<BR>
process.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should follow the DLA model and make policy<BR>
directives available on CD-ROM.<BR>

<P>DOD should encourage internal and external suppliers<BR>
to satisfy customer requirements at the least total<BR>
cost to the taxpayer. Suppliers will price goods<BR>
based on the level of required support, match price<BR>
with commercial vendors, tailor on-site logistics<BR>
support, and deliver common supplies directly to<BR>
customers' desks. DOD should empower commanders (and<BR>
individual military personnel) to obtain essential<BR>
support services from their best value source. <BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Regulatory or legislative changes are not needed to<BR>
carry out this initiative, but as each component<BR>
works through this process it will identify barriers<BR>
to efficient operations. Each component will address<BR>
regulatory and legislative changes at that time. <BR>

<P>A fundamental change in mindset is needed, however.<BR>
A move is needed from the old paradigm of a rigid<BR>
bureaucracy, resistant to change, to a new paradigm<BR>
of flexibility and adaptability where personnel are<BR>
empowered. Headquarters personnel must make policy<BR>
(or steer). They must not mix in the daily<BR>
operational issues of the field units who are<BR>
rowing.<BR>

<P>Clarifying policy directives and limiting procedures<BR>
to those that are absolutely necessary empowers<BR>
people, reduces regulatory burdens, and frees people<BR>
to use their creative energy and talents to improve<BR>
performance and increase output. Institutionalizing<BR>
the process--separating policy and directing only<BR>
the essential procedures--will enable DOD to further<BR>
incorporate quality principles into  its core<BR>
processes and improve continuously.<BR>
 <BR>

savings to DOD. These savings cannot be accurately<BR>
estimated.<BR>

<P>DOD02: Establish a Unified Budget for the Department<BR>
of Defense<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>Congress provides funds to the Department of Defense<BR>
(DOD) through a series of appropriations covering<BR>
specific aspects of defense operations. Congress<BR>
allows DOD to obligate these funds over one to five<BR>
fiscal years depending on the type of funds.<BR>
Congress also allows cumulative transfers of about<BR>
$4 billion among appropriations. However, DOD does<BR>
not give similar flexibility to its headquarters and<BR>
field commanders. Rather, it requires them to manage<BR>
their varied and complex installations under<BR>
inflexible budgetary controls.<BR>

<P>When commanders request approval to shift funds,<BR>
portions of those funds often are taken for higher<BR>
priority contingencies. As a result, some former and<BR>
current commanders stated that they were hesitant to<BR>
seek approval to shift funds. Furthermore,<BR>
commanders do not have incentives to hold funds in<BR>
reserve to ensure that the highest priority needs<BR>
are met. To avoid losing the use of the funds, <BR>
commanders may use the funds for lower priority<BR>
needs.<BR>
 <BR>
 In recognition of this problem, DOD initiated a<BR>
three-year unified budget test beginning in fiscal<BR>
year 1987. Several installation commanders were<BR>
given flexibility to transfer funds among<BR>
appropriations and cost categories. The test showed<BR>
that more needs were met and funds were used more<BR>
efficiently and effectively.1<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should seek legislative authority to revise<BR>
its budget process to fund major unbudgeted<BR>
emergencies by a process of assessing  each<BR>
organization an appropriate share of the shortfall. <BR>
 <BR>
 To the extent possible and appropriate, commanders<BR>
should have flexibility to determine which budget<BR>
accounts under their control will be used to fund<BR>
the assessment. This could be implemented in fiscal<BR>
year 1995.<BR>

<P>2. DOD should seek congressional approval to combine<BR>
Operations and Maintenance, non-weapons systems<BR>
(non-centrally managed), Other Procurement, Family<BR>
Housing Operations and Maintenance, and Minor<BR>
Construction into a single appropriation, available<BR>
for obligation  for three years, for each Service<BR>
and DOD agency. <BR>
 <BR>
 If approved by Congress, this would further enhance<BR>
the unified budget concept. Three years of funding<BR>
availability is necessary for cost-effective<BR>
procurement and is consistent with the current<BR>
availability of Other Procurement funds. This should<BR>
be proposed for the fiscal year 1996 budget. If<BR>
Congress does not approve this action, actions 3 and<BR>
4 below are alternatives that DOD could implement<BR>
unilaterally.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should allow field commanders flexibility to<BR>
transfer funds among appropriations and cost<BR>
categories, as needed, to improve mission<BR>
capability, cope with unforeseen contingencies, and<BR>
take advantage of opportunities that only<BR>
flexibility permits. <BR>

<P>This could be implemented immediately. Notification<BR>
to central budget offices of transfers of funds may<BR>
be desirable to assure compliance with reprogramming<BR>
thresholds and legislated authority until such time<BR>
as<BR>
action 2 is implemented. However, evidence from the<BR>
unified budget test indicates that a very low<BR>
probability of noncompliance exists even if<BR>
notification is not required. If noncompliance<BR>
levels are approached, the central budget offices<BR>
should notify the field organizations to stop<BR>
further transfers.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should allow flexibility to transfer<BR>
headquarters' administrative and housekeeping funds<BR>
among appropriations and categories.<BR>

<P>
<P>This could be implemented immediately. This will<BR>
permit more appropriate allocation among items such<BR>
as travel, equipment, contractors, and civilian<BR>
personnel. Notification to the central budget<BR>
offices of transfers of funds may be desirable to<BR>
ensure compliance with reprogramming thresholds and<BR>
legislated authority until such time as action 2 is<BR>
implemented. However, evidence from the unified<BR>
budget test indicates that a very low probability of<BR>
noncompliance exists even without notification. If<BR>
noncompliance levels are approached, the central<BR>
budget offices should notify the headquarters<BR>
organizations to stop further transfers.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Based on the results of the unified budget test,<BR>
these recommendations will enhance mission readiness<BR>
by giving commanders greater flexibility to set<BR>
priorities, to solve funding problems sooner, to<BR>
resolve unplanned and unprogrammed require-ments,<BR>
and to facilitate solutions without higher<BR>
headquarters assistance. In addition, DOD will have<BR>
a more orderly process for funding major unbudgeted<BR>
activities.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>

are implemented there will be some savings to DOD.<BR>

Programs and Installation Assistance, Office of the<BR>

<P>DOD03: Purchase Best Value Common Supplies and<BR>
Services<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>DOD acquires common supplies and services under<BR>
guidance provided by the Federal Acquisition<BR>
Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition<BR>
Regulation Supplement (DFARS). FAR and DFARS<BR>
incorporate laws aimed at more than just acquiring<BR>
supplies and services. Socioeconomic goals,<BR>
protection of American markets, and tailored<BR>
economic legislation are often included.<BR>
Additionally, each Service applies unique<BR>
acquisition and supply regulations to FAR and DFARS<BR>
guidance. The Service regulations provide policy and<BR>
guidance to ensure proper expenditure of public<BR>
funds and require adequate records for review and<BR>
audit. As problems have arisen, Services have<BR>
revised their regulations to prevent recurrence. As<BR>
a result, Service regulations are lengthy to prevent<BR>
mistakes. The resulting regulatory environment often<BR>
confuses and frustrates customer, supplier, and<BR>
procurement personnel alike. Furthermore, the<BR>
complexity of  excessive regulation adds to the cost<BR>
of doing business.<BR>
 <BR>
 For example, at an East Coast installation an<BR>
average 10 percent of vehicles are out of service at<BR>
any given time, awaiting parts from the DOD supply<BR>
system. Many of these parts are locally available,<BR>
often for less than $100. If downtime could be<BR>
reduced to 5 percent through local purchase of<BR>
repair parts, the requirement for 30 vehicles, worth<BR>
over $250,000, could be eliminated. Buyers did not<BR>
know that local purchase was authorized for such<BR>
requirements. This demonstrates how best intentions<BR>
run awry in this complex environment.<BR>

<P>As a result of the National Performance Review, the<BR>
Service Headquarters has reissued guidance, provided<BR>
training, and followed up to ensure vehicle parts<BR>
are obtained in a timely manner. One specific<BR>
problem has been resolved, but there is little doubt<BR>
that the supply system's very complexity leads to<BR>
many similar inefficiencies.<BR>

<P>In order to provide best value common supplies and<BR>
services, DOD must continue to streamline existing<BR>
acquisition guidelines and wholeheartedly adopt<BR>
commercial business practices like credit cards,<BR>
electronic commerce, competition, and electronic<BR>
data interchange. Ultimately, employees must be<BR>
empowered to procure everything in the most<BR>
efficient<BR>
manner. DOD has initiated many efforts in the past<BR>
aimed at procurement reform and streamlining<BR>
acquisition practices, but caution and fear of<BR>
failure have impeded rapid expansion of these<BR>
practices.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should test enabling actions that allow<BR>
commanders and managers access to all sources of<BR>
common supplies and services in order to obtain best<BR>
value products.<BR>

<P>The goal of each prototype is to create a<BR>
competitive environment in which commanders and<BR>
managers can select private, public, or nonprofit<BR>
sources for best value common supplies and services,<BR>
and suppliers focus on meeting customer needs.<BR>
Enabling actions should be adopted DOD-wide if<BR>
proved successful in a pilot test. DOD will test<BR>
these actions at specific reinvention labs for 15<BR>
months. The tests should commence no later than four<BR>
months after approval by the Defense Performance<BR>
Review. As the reinvention labs verify the<BR>
effectiveness of specific actions, the Defense<BR>
Performance Review staff will coordinate exportation<BR>
and institutionalization of the action.<BR>

<P>2. DOD personnel should use best value sources of<BR>
supply, as determined by the local commander or<BR>
manager.<BR>

<P>This will not eliminate the requirement to use<BR>
specified items where technical guidance exists. DOD<BR>
should empower local commanders and managers to buy<BR>
supplies --including personal computers, small<BR>
amounts of hazardous material, commercial<BR>
off-the-shelf items, and consumable weapon system<BR>
items--from any authorized source of supply.<BR>
Commanders may purchase items locally when using the<BR>
normal supply system is undesirable due to<BR>
availability, cost, or quality.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should empower any properly delegated<BR>
individual to buy common supplies and<BR>
non-professional services.<BR>

<P>DOD should not limit authorization to make small<BR>
purchases to only procurement personnel. Proper<BR>
delegation will include sufficient training to make<BR>
buyers aware of legal and ethical restrictions<BR>
pertinent to their level of buying authority. DOD<BR>
should expand the use of credit cards,<BR>
establish higher procurement thresholds, publish a<BR>
Customer's Bill of<BR>
Purchase Rights, and eliminate Service restrictions<BR>
beyond basic FAR/DFARS small purchase guidance.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should empower internal and external<BR>
suppliers to focus on meeting customer needs.<BR>

<P>DOD should encourage internal and external suppliers<BR>
to satisfy customer requirements at the least total<BR>
cost to the taxpayer. Suppliers will price goods<BR>
based on the level of required support, match price<BR>
with commercial vendors, tailor on-site logistics<BR>
support,<BR>
and deliver common supplies directly to customers'<BR>
desks. DOD should empower commanders (and individual<BR>
military personnel) to obtain essential support<BR>
services from their best value source.<BR>
 <BR>
Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>These recommendations will create a competitive<BR>
environment in which commanders and managers can<BR>
select private, public, or nonprofit sources for<BR>
best value common supplies and services, and<BR>
suppliers can focus on customer needs. As in the<BR>
private sector, market dynamics, rather than<BR>
excessive regulatory direction or socioeconomic<BR>
goals, will determine the choice of supplier. These<BR>
recommendations will empower employees, foster<BR>
excellence, and inject an entrepreneurial approach<BR>
into obtaining supplies and services.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Adoption of these actions is expected to lead to<BR>
more effective use of DOD resources.<BR>

<P>DOD04: Outsource Non-Core Department of Defense<BR>
Functions<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>The Department of Defense (DOD) budget is falling so<BR>
rapidly (24 percent real decline since 1990) that<BR>
DOD can no longer afford to do business as usual. It<BR>
cannot devote significant resources to performing<BR>
non-core functions when non-DOD providers are<BR>
available to  do them better, cheaper, and faster.<BR>
 <BR>
 Competition, which includes outsourcing, is<BR>
increasingly important. Outsourcing in DOD means the<BR>
possible transfer of organizational functions, in<BR>
whole or in part, to non-DOD providers. Key to<BR>
deciding whether to outsource functions is how to<BR>
provide the best balance of cost and operational<BR>
risk.<BR>

<P>DOD core functions are those functions or<BR>
competencies intimately related to the<BR>
organization's basic mission and crucial to its<BR>
long-term success.1 In general, core functions in<BR>
DOD include combat force, command of combat forces,<BR>
deployable combat or combat service support, and<BR>
provision of the rotational base for these<BR>
functions. The distinction between core and non-core<BR>
is used only to remove from consideration certain<BR>
functions that clearly are not viable outsource<BR>
candidates. Non-core does not equal non-critical.<BR>

<P>Outsourcing of non-core functions has been proven in<BR>
both the private and public sectors to be a sound<BR>
business tool. In fact, the trend nationwide is<BR>
toward more outsourcing. In the private sector, the<BR>
motivation to outsource is reduced costs and<BR>
increased profit. In the public sector, the<BR>
principal motivation to outsource is the need to<BR>
provide essential services at the least cost because<BR>
of  declining budgets. Simply put, it is purely a<BR>
business  decision.<BR>
 <BR>
 The critical consideration for outsourcing is<BR>
defining the core business and, thus, core functions<BR>
of the company. For example, administrative<BR>
functions such as data processing, billing, and<BR>
payroll, while important and necessary, are not core<BR>
tasks. Outsourcing these functions to specialized<BR>
vendors allows management to concentrate on the<BR>
company's core functions. Four examples of<BR>
successful outsourcing in the private sector are:<BR>

<P>~ General Dynamics awarded a$3 billion, 10-year<BR>
  contract to Computer Services Corporation to<BR>
  provide all information technology functions,<BR>
  including applications development and<BR>
  maintenance, data center operations, and<BR>
  networking.<BR>

<P>~ United Technologies awarded a$100 million, 10-year<BR>
  contract to Integrated Systems Solutions<BR>
  Corporation (ISSC) for operation of the United<BR>
  Technologies data center in Newington,<BR>
  Connecticut, providing data processing services<BR>
  and managing all existing hardware leases and<BR>
  system software.<BR>

<P>~ Continental Bank awarded a $700 million, 10-year<BR>
  contract to ISSC for data center and network<BR>
  management and operations, assuming all leases on<BR>
  currently installed hardware and system software.2<BR>

<P>~ Cummins Diesel outsourced piston design and<BR>
  manufacturing, concentrating instead on building<BR>
  leadership in electronics, ceramics, and<BR>
  alternative fuels.3<BR>

<P>The public sector also offers many examples of<BR>
successful outsourcing. Across the country,<BR>
outsourcing of public services has experienced<BR>
significant growth in recent years. In the last 10<BR>
years, outsourcing for refuse collection has grown<BR>
43 percent, data processing 3,664 percent, and<BR>
landfill operations 129 percent. Local governments<BR>
routinely outsource vehicle towing, legal services,<BR>
street  light operation, solid waste disposal, and<BR>
street <BR>
 <BR>
 Cultural, administrative, legislative, and<BR>
regulatory roadblocks are preventing DOD from taking<BR>
advantage of the opportunity to outsource various<BR>
non-core functions, even though it makes operational<BR>
and economic sense.<BR>

<P>Cultural roadblocks. Well-entrenched communities<BR>
within DOD strongly object to letting go of non-core<BR>
competencies. A rigorous review may show DOD does<BR>
not need to perform them in-house. Achieving this<BR>
needed cultural change will take an institutional<BR>
commitment to begin outsourcing.<BR>

<P>Administrative roadblocks. Commanders and managers<BR>
do not have sufficient latitude to design the mix of<BR>
resources needed to accomplish their mission, nor is<BR>
there a simple approach to defining non-core<BR>
functions and when to outsource them.<BR>

<P>Legislative roadblocks. Section 312 of the fiscal<BR>
year 1993 DOD Authorization Act is an excellent<BR>
example of a roadblock to the outsourcing process.<BR>
It constrains DOD's outsourcing ability. <BR>

<P>The Acquisition Law Advisory Panel was directed by<BR>
Congress in the fiscal year 1992 DOD Authorization<BR>
Act to review all laws affecting procurement<BR>
actions. During its review, the panel found that the<BR>
statutory provisions in Chapter 146 of Title 10<BR>
_present a confusing and contradictory set of rules<BR>
regarding the DOD's contracting out process._ The<BR>
panel proposed to consolidate and streamline the<BR>
existing rules into two sections that provide DOD<BR>
managerial flexibility while at the same time<BR>
preserving meaningful congressional oversight and<BR>
effective community input. For example, the panel<BR>
identified the following sections for amendment or<BR>
repeal:<BR>

<P>~Section 2462, which requires procurement of<BR>
 supplies necessary for DOD functions from a private<BR>
 sector source if such a source can provide the<BR>
 supply or service at a real cost lower than the<BR>
 comparable, in-house cost. The panel recommended an<BR>
 amendment to include a new requirement that the<BR>
 private sector source must be able to provide the<BR>
 supply or service _adequate to meet defined<BR>
 performance standards._<BR>

<P>~ Section 2465 prohibits contracting of fire<BR>
  fighting and security guard functions. The panel<BR>
  recommended repeal of this statute in its<BR>
  entirety. It noted numerous examples where this<BR>
  had impeded management flexibility, increased<BR>
  costs, and in some cases hampered meeting mission<BR>
  requirements.<BR>

<P>~ Section 2466 prohibits DOD from contracting<BR>
  out more than 40 percent of its depot-level<BR>
  maintenance. The 60 percent in-house requirement<BR>
  was found to be somewhat arbitrary. The panel<BR>
  believed DOD should have the flexibility to<BR>
  determine core depot-level requirements.<BR>

<P>Agencies are also required by 10 U.S.C. 2851 to<BR>
obtain construction and design services from the<BR>
Army Corps of Engineers or the Naval Facilities<BR>
Engineering Command. This limits the commander's<BR>
ability to outsource construction and design<BR>
services. <BR>

<P>Additionally, interviews with commanders/ managers<BR>
disclosed that enabling legislation is needed to<BR>
allow installation commanders and municipalities to<BR>
achieve cost savings by negotiating agreements to<BR>
permit exchange or purchase of services. For<BR>
example, municipalities could provide trash removal<BR>
services if the installation provided snow removal<BR>
and grass cutting services on public roads adjoining<BR>
the installation.<BR>

<P>Regulatory roadblocks. The study goals and budget<BR>
reductions contained in Executive Order 12615<BR>
(Performance of Commercial Activities) have served<BR>
as disincentives rather than incentives to<BR>
outsourcing. The process contained in OMB Circular<BR>
A-76 is complex and inflexible.<BR>

<P>However, the fundamental policy outlined in the<BR>
circular--that government should rely on the private<BR>
sector for services when analysis determines it is<BR>
more economical--is sound business. Added<BR>
flexibility in making this economic comparison would<BR>
enhance the government's<BR>
ability to meet this policy goal.<BR>

<P>While current federal, DOD, militaryservice, and DOD<BR>
agency regulations may have served a useful purpose,<BR>
many restrictions placed on commanders or managers<BR>
at all levels are not warranted. For example, DOD<BR>
4100.33 and OMB Circular A-76 require local<BR>
authorities to get Assistant Secretary-level waivers<BR>
for deviations in severance pay and contract<BR>
administration factors. This requirement can add<BR>
substantially to the time it takes  to complete a<BR>
cost comparison, one of the major complaints  about<BR>
the process.<BR>
 <BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>
<P>1. DOD should implement a comprehensive program for<BR>
outsourcing non-core functions when it makes<BR>
economic and operational sense.<BR>

<P>Before the program can be implemented, senior<BR>
leadership must overcome roadblocks to outsourcing,<BR>
give commanders and managers incentives to outsource<BR>
when appropriate, and test the viability of<BR>
outsourcing. DOD must emphasize the need for a<BR>
cultural change within the department regarding<BR>
outsourcing and give commanders or managers the<BR>
latitude to design the mix of resources needed to<BR>
accomplish their mission.<BR>

<P>Six steps should be used to decide when outsourcing<BR>
makes economic and operational sense:<BR>

<P>~ clearly describe the function in objective<BR>
  terms of what gets done and how it gets done, but<BR>
  not who does it;<BR>

<P>~ categorize the function as either core or<BR>
  non-core;<BR>

<P>~ establish detailed, specific performance  <BR>
  requirements for each function based on the<BR>
  commander/manager's mission and customer<BR>
  requirements;<BR>

<P>~ analyze legal, supplier, and performance<BR>
  requirements for each function to determine the<BR>
  source that best balances economic benefits with<BR>
  operational risk;<BR>

<P>~ produce a detailed performance agreement and<BR>
  associated documents for function (e.g.,<BR>
  performance work statement and request  for<BR>
  proposal if function is to be outsourced); and<BR>
 <BR>
~ introduce cost competition.<BR>

<P>Each performance agreement is a contract between the<BR>
customer and the supplier, whether that source is an<BR>
in-house workforce supervised by a subordinate<BR>
commander/manager, some other DOD or government<BR>
source, or a commercial source. Each includes the<BR>
identification of required performance levels in<BR>
terms of relevant performance metrics.<BR>

<P>After the process has been defined, it must be<BR>
managed. Metrics should be used to monitor the state<BR>
of the process and providecommanders/managers with<BR>
appropriate information and accountability to enable<BR>
them to reduce costs while providing objective<BR>
measures of levels of performance. As a basic<BR>
approach, efficiency and effectiveness<BR>
characteristics should be used to establish a plan,<BR>
assess performance, and determine rewards. <BR>

<P>Section 312 of the fiscal 1993 DOD Authorization Act<BR>
is the greatest roadblock to overcome. By<BR>
prohibiting the funding of contracts in fiscal 1993<BR>
as a result of OMB Circular A-76 reviews. Congress<BR>
has prevented DOD from conducting business in the<BR>
most effective and efficient manner. This provision<BR>
should not be extended or codified as a permanent<BR>
restriction.<BR>

<P>2. Implement the recommendations made by the<BR>
Acquisition Law Advisory Panel's Section 800 Report. <BR>

<P>The panel proposed to consolidate and streamline the<BR>
existing rules of Chapter 146, Title 10, into two<BR>
sections that provide DOD managerial flexibility<BR>
while at the same time preserving meaningful<BR>
congressional oversight and effective community<BR>
input. Sections 2462, 2465, and 2466 were identified<BR>
for amendment or repeal. The legislative requirement<BR>
to obtain construction and design services<BR>
exclusively from the Corps of Engineers or the Naval<BR>
Facilities Engineering Command should be eliminated.<BR>
And legislation should be enacted to permit<BR>
installation commanders to negotiate agreements with<BR>
municipalities for the exchange or purchase of<BR>
services.<BR>

<P>3. Executive Order 12615 (Performance of Commercial<BR>
Activities) should be rescinded and a new Executive<BR>
Order issued.<BR>

<P>The new order should highlight the government's<BR>
policy of acquiring goods and services in the most<BR>
economical and efficient manner without directing<BR>
study goals or identifying projected savings. The<BR>
study goals and budget reductions have served as<BR>
disincentives rather than incentives to outsourcing.<BR>

<P>In the very near term, OMB Circular A-76 should be<BR>
reviewed for potential change to simplify the<BR>
process and increase its flexibility by allowing<BR>
varying levels of detail based on the size and scope<BR>
of the study. Added flexibility in how economic<BR>
comparisons are made will enhance the government's<BR>
ability to meet this policy goal. For the long term,<BR>
the federal government needs to evolve beyond the<BR>
limited scope of OMB Circular A-76 to ensure that<BR>
sourcing decisions for all government functions are<BR>
based on a logical, systematic, and accepted<BR>
process.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should provide tangible incentives for<BR>
commanders/managers to seek new and better ways of<BR>
doing business.<BR>

<P>DOD's incentive clearly comes from reducing overhead<BR>
and the ability and flexibility to shift its limited<BR>
and ever-decreasing resources from non-core to core<BR>
functions. Additionally, commanders and/or managers<BR>
who initiate outsourcing must be permitted to retain<BR>
a  portion of the resulting savings. This is the<BR>
only way to  provide a positive, real incentive to<BR>
outsource.<BR>
 <BR>
 Further, DOD must move more toward the practice of<BR>
specifying from contractors _what is wanted, rather<BR>
than how it is to be done._ DOD should give<BR>
contractors flexibility to use standard commercial<BR>
business practices and material specifications,<BR>
rather than demanding more costly and often<BR>
unnecessary military/government specifications.<BR>

<P>5. DOD should test outsourcing non-core functions.<BR>

<P>DOD has identified 50 broad areacandidates for<BR>
outsourcing, such as base operations support,<BR>
housing, health services, maintenance and repair,<BR>
training, labs, security, and transportation.<BR>
Further, the military services and DOD agencies have<BR>
identified nine specific functions for immediate<BR>
outsourcing consideration. The functions are<BR>
Navy-Defense Printing Service, formally Navy<BR>
Publishing and Printing Service; Defense Nuclear<BR>
Agency (Technical Library Division); Air Force (304<BR>
conference<BR>
Switch and Associated Command Display System<BR>
consoles and maintenance); Defense Finance and<BR>
Accounting System (DOD travel reimbursement);<BR>
Defense Logistics Agency (Defense Reutilization and<BR>
Marketing Service); Defense Mapping Agency (security<BR>
guard functions); AETC Training Base (base operating<BR>
support functions); Defense Information System<BR>
Network (switched services); and Army (morale,<BR>
welfare, recreation business programs).<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>

<P>By outsourcing non-core functions when it makes<BR>
economic and operational sense, DOD will be better<BR>
able to focus on its core functions and to absorb<BR>
current and future budget cuts. Many roadblocks both<BR>
inside and outside DOD must be overcome before DOD<BR>
commanders/managers are routinely allowed to make<BR>
sound business decisions on whether to outsource<BR>
non-core functions or continue to perform them with<BR>
federal employees.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Outsourcing can produce significant savings for DOD.<BR>
After selected tests, DOD will be able to estimate<BR>
future savings.<BR>

<P>DOD05: Create Incentives for the Department of<BR>
Defense to Generate Revenues<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>By giving commanders/managers incentives to generate<BR>
revenue, the Department of Defense (DOD) can<BR>
increase funds available for mission-related<BR>
activities, improve the environment, and enhance<BR>
customer service.<BR>

<P>Appropriate incentives would include allowing DOD to<BR>
retain all or a portion of the new revenue for<BR>
mission-related use. DOD has opportunities to<BR>
generate new revenues by such changes as eliminating<BR>
or reducing subsidies and increasing sales of<BR>
recyclable materials.<BR>

<P>Eliminating or reducing subsidies can generate a<BR>
significant amount of revenue. DOD does not<BR>
consistently charge customers either the incremental<BR>
or full costs of services. In effect, DOD is<BR>
providing a subsidy to some customers. When<BR>
subsidies are included, neither the provider nor the<BR>
recipient of services has an incentive to seek the<BR>
most cost-effective way of doing business.<BR>

<P>Fees are about $12 million short of costs incurred<BR>
by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for<BR>
processing applications for discharges of dredged or<BR>
fill materials into the waters of the United States.<BR>
In 1993, the taxpayers funded permitting activities<BR>
at$86 million to evaluate about 15,000 individual<BR>
applications, 20,000 activities under the Corps'<BR>
regional permit program, and over 60,000 activities<BR>
through the Corps_ nationwide permit program.1 For<BR>
many years, the Corps of Engineers has been charging<BR>
token permit fees of $10 for noncommercial projects<BR>
and $100 for commercial projects, which resulted in<BR>
revenues of less than $400,000 per year.2 Funds<BR>
received for permits historically have been conveyed<BR>
to the U.S. Treasury rather than used to offset<BR>
costs.<BR>

<P>Following a study and recommendation from the DOD<BR>
Inspector General, a Corps Task Force developed a<BR>
more realistic fee schedule based on the costs to<BR>
the government for work done in the regulatory<BR>
program. In October 1990, the Corps formally<BR>
proposed significantly higher permit fees designed<BR>
to recover about $17 million annually.3 The proposal<BR>
would have increased application fees to $2,000 for<BR>
commercial projects and to $500 for noncommercial<BR>
projects. The proposed increase in fees was very<BR>
controversial, and in the 1992 and 1993 Energy and<BR>
Water Development Appropriations Acts, Congress<BR>
expressly prohibited the Corps from expending any<BR>
funds to finalize its proposed fee regulations. As a<BR>
result, no action has been taken on the proposed fee<BR>
increases.<BR>

<P>Revenue can also be generated by increasing sales of<BR>
recyclable materials. Proceeds from sales of<BR>
recyclables grossed $37 million in fiscal year 1992.<BR>
Although income from the sale of recyclables is<BR>
increasingly important, Public Law 97-214 restricts<BR>
the use of revenue from sales of recyclable<BR>
materials as follows: Funds shall cover the costs of<BR>
operations, maintenance, and overhead for processing<BR>
recyclable materials at the installation (including<BR>
the cost of any equipment purchased for recycling<BR>
purposes). Up to 50 percent of the remaining funds<BR>
can be used for pollution abatement, energy<BR>
conservation, and occupational safety and health<BR>
activities. All remaining funds may be used for<BR>
morale and welfare activities. However, at the end<BR>
of each fiscal year, unobligated funds in excess of<BR>
$2 million must be conveyed to the U.S. Treasury.<BR>

<P>In fiscal year 1992, DOD's proceeds from sales of<BR>
recyclable materials grossed $37 million, down from<BR>
a high of $50 million in a previous year.4 Proceeds<BR>
from sales of recyclables are declining even though<BR>
the quantity of materials is increasing. This is due<BR>
in part to declining markets for recyclables. More<BR>
materials are being recycled and demand for products<BR>
containing these materials has not kept pace.<BR>
Additional money can be saved by increasing efforts<BR>
to purchase products containing recycled materials<BR>
and by developing _closed-loop_ recycling ventures<BR>
in which DOD-provided recycled materials are<BR>
manufactured into products needed by DOD.<BR>

<P>More and more communities are prohibiting the<BR>
disposal of certain materials (such as yard waste,<BR>
newspapers, mattresses, and tires) in their<BR>
landfills, which forces DOD to look to recycling or<BR>
alternate uses of these materials. These could<BR>
increase disposal costs if they are not effectively<BR>
addressed.<BR>

<P>DOD is now determining the total costs of its solid<BR>
waste disposal. The disposal costs may be as much as<BR>
$500 million a year.5 By establishing aggressive<BR>
goals, these costs can be reduced, thus saving<BR>
operation and maintenance account funds for mission<BR>
support. Therefore, in some cases, it may be<BR>
advantageous for DOD to pay for the recycling of<BR>
materials. Since disposal costs can be as high as<BR>
$200 a ton, paying companies to take the recyclable<BR>
material will still save DOD funds if the payments<BR>
are less than its normal disposal costs.6<BR>

<P>DOD estimates that solid waste reduction goals of 50<BR>
percent are achievable over the next five years.7<BR>
This can equate to significant reductions in solid<BR>
waste disposal costs, even if DOD must pay companies<BR>
to take the recyclables.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. The Corps of Engineers should be permitted to<BR>
establish commercial regulatory fees to more closely<BR>
approximate the costs of evaluating applications and<BR>
should be allowed to retain, in a special regulatory<BR>
account, all revenues generated through the<BR>
collection of fees. <BR>

<P>These funds would then be used by Corps districts<BR>
solely to increase the efficiency of the regulatory<BR>
program by reducing delays associated with permit<BR>
evaluations and wetlands delineations. This fund<BR>
would be independent from the Corps' normal<BR>
regulatory operating budget and should be available<BR>
without appropriation. DOD must provide<BR>
accountability over the use of the new revenue.<BR>

<P>2. Congress should amend PL 97-214 to allow<BR>
managers/commanders mission- related use of all net<BR>
revenue from sales of recyclable materials.<BR>

<P>DOD should continue the same level of funding<BR>
available in fiscal year 1992 from sales of<BR>
recyclables for pollution abatement, energy<BR>
conservation, occupational safety and health<BR>
activities, and morale and welfare activities.<BR>
However, commanders/ managers should be allowed<BR>
unrestricted use of all revenue in excess of fiscal<BR>
year 1992 revenue ($37 million) from sales of<BR>
recyclables. In addition, commanders/ managers<BR>
should be allowed unrestricted mission-related use<BR>
of savings from reducing waste disposal costs. <BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Permit fees would be increased for certain projects<BR>
that require extensive, detailed review. In<BR>
addition, fees could be charged for jurisdiction<BR>
determinations, public hearings, and environmental<BR>
impact studies. The costs of evaluating applications<BR>
would be defrayed partially by the fees. Since only<BR>
a small portion of the taxpayers benefit directly<BR>
from permits, it should be more equitable for the<BR>
direct users to bear the costs of the permits.<BR>
However, it is recognized that many users would be<BR>
against the increased fees because they own the land<BR>
and all taxpayers benefit from the protection of the<BR>
environment through the regulatory process. Most<BR>
objections would probably diminish if the increased<BR>
fees were for large projects only and if the fees<BR>
were used to further reduce regulatory delays, which<BR>
would improve customer service.<BR>

<P>If commanders/managers had more funding flexibility,<BR>
they would have more incentive to expand their<BR>
recycling programs as revenue-producing activities<BR>
and reduce their disposal costs. By establishing<BR>
aggressive goals, commanders/managers can reduce<BR>
disposal costs, thus saving operation and<BR>
maintenance account funds for mission support.<BR>
Important, but lower priority, mission-related<BR>
activities would be funded. The most significant<BR>
outcomes from increased recycling are that it will<BR>
reduce pollution, conserve limited disposal  space,<BR>
and conserve natural resources by using recycled <BR>
materials in the manufacture of products.<BR>
 <BR>
Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Increasing commercial regulatory fees could produce<BR>
revenues of about $12 million annually upon<BR>
congressional approval. Estimated annual costs of<BR>
implementing the recommendation would be minimal.8<BR>

<P>DOD estimates that solid waste reduction goals of 50<BR>
percent are achievable over the next five years.<BR>
This can equate to significant reductions in solid<BR>
waste disposal costs, even if DOD must pay companies<BR>
to take the recyclables. Preferably, DOD will be<BR>
able to sell recyclable waste materials for a<BR>
profit. If DOD reduced its average disposal cost to<BR>
$100 a ton for one-half of its solid waste, DOD<BR>
would annually save about $125 million after the<BR>
startup period. However, if DOD did not have to pay<BR>
companies to take the recyclable materials, the<BR>
annual savings would increase to about $250 million.<BR>

<P>DOD06: Establish and Promote a Productivity-<BR>
       Enhancing Capital Investment Fund<BR>

<P>Background<BR>

<P>Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations include<BR>
approximately $12 million annually for capital<BR>
investments that will, over a period of increased<BR>
productivity, result in savings greater than the<BR>
initial investment. The money available, however,<BR>
has not been sufficient to fund all the potentially<BR>
worthy projects. In order to increase long-term<BR>
savings, more of these investments should be made.<BR>

<P>Each military department has a central organization<BR>
that controls the allocation of funds for investing<BR>
in equipment that will increase productivity.<BR>
Applicants for these funds are required to submit<BR>
proposals demonstrating that enhanced productivity<BR>
would result in recovery of the cost in three years.<BR>
While they directly benefit from the capital<BR>
investments, they are not required to track or<BR>
report on the savings that result.<BR>

<P>As the DOD budget has declined, the funds available<BR>
for such investments have been cut by approximately<BR>
70 percent, a cut that was disproportionate to the<BR>
total defense budget reduction.1 Market mechanisms<BR>
could be used to increase the available resources<BR>
for productivity-enhancing equipment as well as to<BR>
regulate the allocation of the scarce investment<BR>
funds. From the perspective of the operating<BR>
organization, funding the purchase of<BR>
productivity-enhancing equipment could be similar to<BR>
a business decision to borrow funds from a bank and<BR>
repay the loan with the resulting savings.<BR>

<P>Action<BR>
******<BR>

<P>To increase the resources available for<BR>
productivity-enhancing capital investments, DOD<BR>
should seek congressional approval to establish a<BR>
new fund that would lend money to DOD organizations<BR>
specifically for such purposes.<BR>

<P>The organizations would be required to repay the<BR>
loan in equal installments over three years, pay an<BR>
annual fee to cover administrative costs, and pay a<BR>
fee of 25 percent of the estimated annual savings<BR>
during the first three years. If more loans are<BR>
requested than can be funded, a biddingsystem should<BR>
be established by the Department to provide a<BR>
self-regulating method of ensuring that only the<BR>
most worthy proposals are funded. The organization<BR>
controlling the investment funds will evaluate<BR>
project proposals and ensure that loans are repaid<BR>
and fees are paid.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Although congressional approval is required, this<BR>
fund can be established under the current revolving<BR>
fund authorization. The pay-back provision would<BR>
make DOD more businesslike and discourage or prevent<BR>
requests for loans for investments that are not<BR>
likely to generate savings. A borrower would be able<BR>
to avoid repayment of the loan only if the Office of<BR>
Management and Budget grants a waiver. After several<BR>
years, the fund should grow to the point of being<BR>
self-sustaining and able to return a profit to the<BR>
Treasury. This fund could also enable the Department<BR>
of Defense and the military departments to purchase<BR>
productivity-enhancing equipment that might  not<BR>
otherwise be affordable.<BR>
 <BR>
Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>An annual congressional appropriation for the fund<BR>
will be necessary only for the first four years. The<BR>
fiscal year 1994-1997 appropriations would be used<BR>
to provide initial capital for the fund, with<BR>
administrative costs covered by a separate fee<BR>
charged to the borrowers. Initial borrowers should<BR>
begin repaying loans in 1995. After fiscal year<BR>
1997, the $12 million annual appropriation should be<BR>
discontinued. The savings computation is based on<BR>
the assumption that funds will be loaned only for<BR>
projects that guarantee a 2-for-1 return on<BR>
investment, i.e., that will return the $1 invested<BR>
and an additional $1 in savings. Total savings<BR>
through 1999 are estimated at approximately $110<BR>
million.<BR>

<P>1. Interview with Ronald A. Davidson, Assistant<BR>
Deputy Comptroller (Program/Budget), Office of the<BR>
Secretary of Defense, June 8, 1993.<BR>

<P>
<P>DOD07: Create a Healthy and Safe Environment For<BR>
Department of Defense Activities <BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>The Department of Defense (DOD) must take steps to<BR>
improve its environmental stewardship. DOD has a<BR>
clear responsibility to clean up its current<BR>
facilities as well as former defense sites. It must<BR>
also comply with existing environmental regulations,<BR>
conserve natural resources, and prevent pollution.<BR>
Senior DOD leadership has already made a strong<BR>
commitment to fulfilling its responsibility by<BR>
redirecting both budget and personnel resources, but<BR>
additional steps should be taken. The DOD<BR>
environmental program covers over 5,500 properties<BR>
containing approximately 27 million acres and more<BR>
than 400,000 buildings. In fiscal year 1992, the<BR>
program cost the American taxpayer $4.4 billion in<BR>
budget authority. Progress has been made in<BR>
clean-up, compliance, conservation, and pollution<BR>
prevention. DOD must now speed up the process,<BR>
demonstrate significant progress, and lay the<BR>
foundation for long-term improvements.<BR>

<P>The challenges inherent in the clean-up of DOD<BR>
facilities and former facilities often result in<BR>
adversarial relationships among stakeholders (i.e.,<BR>
groups with an interest in the project such as<BR>
installation commanders, government regulators, the<BR>
surrounding community, contractors, and public<BR>
interest groups). For example, state and federal<BR>
officials have been in litigation since 1988 to<BR>
determine who will be in charge of clean-up at Rocky<BR>
Mountain Arsenal. This lengthy battle has led to<BR>
mistrust, increased clean-up expenses, and<BR>
unnecessary delay. When stakeholders have worked<BR>
together to solve their problems, the results have<BR>
been quite different. The Air Force has developed a<BR>
highly successful program at McClellan Air Force<BR>
Base where, through innovative management,<BR>
education, communication, and partnering with the<BR>
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State<BR>
of California, it was able to obtain consensus on<BR>
clean-up strategy.<BR>

<P>DOD's environmental vision is to create a responsive<BR>
program that balances the needs of the individual<BR>
military departments, is fully integrated into all<BR>
DOD businesslike processes, and provides the tools<BR>
and authority to installation commanders so that<BR>
they can create a healthy and safe environment for<BR>
DOD activities. <BR>

<P>To achieve this goal, five issues are recommended<BR>
for action: partnering, clean-up, environmental<BR>
technology, pollution prevention, and environmental<BR>
regional offices. These five areas offer the<BR>
opportunity to significantly improve the DOD<BR>
environmental program.<BR>

<P>Partnering, the first issue, involves commitment<BR>
between stakeholders to work together to achieve<BR>
mutual objectives by maximizing each participant's<BR>
resources. Where employed, it has significantly<BR>
reduced project time, cost, and litigation. Although<BR>
the value of partnering is appreciated in some DOD<BR>
locations, it is not widely practiced throughout<BR>
DOD, nor is it universally understood and accepted<BR>
as a business practice. This can be improved by<BR>
educating and training managers in how to commit to<BR>
and maintain partnering relationships and by<BR>
adapting partnering concepts more closely to DOD<BR>
core processes. This practice of partnering should<BR>
be expanded throughout DOD to foster cooperative<BR>
relationships with stakeholders.<BR>

<P>The adversarial nature of relationships between many<BR>
personnel at DOD facilities and their regulators<BR>
seriously impedes successful compliance and clean-up<BR>
programs. Partnering replaces adversarial<BR>
relationships with teamwork. Of the approximately<BR>
150 Army Corps of Engineers construction projects<BR>
that use partnering, none have resulted in<BR>
litigation. Clearly, cooperation through partnering<BR>
yields many positive results.<BR>

<P>The second targeted area, clean-up, has much room<BR>
for improvement. In many cases, the excessively<BR>
lengthy and costly study process causes _paralysis<BR>
by analysis._ With experience, many of DOD's<BR>
clean-up activities are becoming almost routine.<BR>
Clean-up can be expedited by using successful<BR>
remedies developed elsewhere. However, the field<BR>
does not often have sufficient access to information<BR>
about  clean-up technologies and their successful<BR>
application.<BR>
 <BR>
 Project officers need better data on which to base<BR>
decisions regarding the use of competing<BR>
technologies. For example, on a project concerning<BR>
clean-up of old maintenance sites with traces of<BR>
tri-chlor-ethylene in the surrounding ground water,<BR>
an officer may need sound information to determine<BR>
which clean-up method would most efficiently<BR>
minimize environmental harm. This could be solved by<BR>
maintaining cost and performance data on various<BR>
clean-up methods and technologies and making the<BR>
data widely available.<BR>

<P>A disproportionate amount of money allocated for<BR>
clean-up is expended for analysis rather than for<BR>
the clean-up itself. Presumptive solutions, based on<BR>
experience, will help. Regulators often require<BR>
unrealistic future land use projections to determine<BR>
health risk  and clean-up levels, which increases<BR>
restoration costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 DOD must better involve the community in clean-up<BR>
initiatives. Even though the community is a<BR>
significant stakeholder in clean-up programs, DOD<BR>
frequently excludes community representa-tives from<BR>
clean-up planning or activities.<BR>

<P>Environmental technology, the third issue, can<BR>
assist in both clean-up of existing contaminated<BR>
sites and prevention of pollution during future<BR>
defense operations. A DOD environmental technology<BR>
program is needed to solve the most pressing<BR>
environmental problems as rapidly as possible at<BR>
minimum cost. This can be achieved through<BR>
cooperative actions in program planning, budgeting,<BR>
and execution and by leveraging each Service's<BR>
funding, expertise, and facilities. <BR>

<P> Currently, no systematic method exists by which<BR>
user (i.e., the installation commanders') needs are<BR>
identified, quantified, validated, prioritized, and<BR>
integrated. Also, the time from the identification<BR>
of an environmental problem to the fielding of a<BR>
solution (an average of six to seven years) is too<BR>
long. This delay increases costs for environmental<BR>
compliance. Additionally, no process integrates all<BR>
DOD environmental technology demonstration programs,<BR>
nor is there an effective method to prioritize<BR>
technology based on a potential return on<BR>
investment.<BR>

<P>Pollution prevention, the fourth area, can also be<BR>
improved. While DOD strives to meet certain<BR>
environmental requirements that mandate phasing out<BR>
ozone-depleting chemicals, few resources are left to<BR>
meet other needs. Another hindrance is that<BR>
commanders lack the budgetary resources to make the<BR>
business decisions necessary for successful,<BR>
cost-effective pollution prevention. Federal and DOD<BR>
procurement policies also impede cost-effective<BR>
pollution prevention by limiting flexibility and<BR>
inhibiting decisionmaking ability. For example,<BR>
current procurement regulations require the<BR>
assignment of short shelf-lives on many products for<BR>
which the actual life is much longer. Environmental<BR>
regulations often require this material to be<BR>
classified as hazardous waste once the shelf-life<BR>
has expired, which greatly increases disposal costs.<BR>
In short, current DOD investment strategies do not<BR>
encourage pollution prevention.<BR>

<P>The final issue, environmental regional offices,<BR>
involves the development of a unified program for<BR>
dealing with the regulatory community. Currently<BR>
each installation, including local reserve<BR>
components, deals directly with the various<BR>
regulatory agencies. Commanders need support from<BR>
DOD for their interests with state and local<BR>
regulators, particularly during the rulemaking<BR>
process. Installations and reserve centers need<BR>
regional offices to help them interpret and<BR>
understand the large number of local environmental<BR>
laws and regulations; to provide early notice of<BR>
emerging legislation; and to assist in environmental<BR>
compliance and clean-up. DOD and Service staffs can<BR>
accomplish this function at a national level,<BR>
working primarily with EPA, but the corresponding<BR>
function with the states needs to be improved.<BR>

<P>The DOD environmental program is in its infancy.<BR>
Though some progress has been made to date, the<BR>
Department must expand and accelerate its efforts.<BR>
The following five recommendations are designed to<BR>
substantially improve DOD's execution of its<BR>
environmental mission.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should develop _partnering_ relationships<BR>
with key environmental stakeholders.<BR>

<P>Several steps must be taken to implement this<BR>
recommendation. First, DOD should develop a<BR>
partnering training program that includes all<BR>
stakeholders. As it executes its environmental<BR>
mission, it should seek to obtain the consensus of<BR>
stakeholders in the technical direction, magnitude,<BR>
and process of clean-up projects from _cradle to<BR>
grave._ The Department must also seek to create<BR>
formal partnerships between the customers and<BR>
technology developers, thereby ensuring that the<BR>
processes for developing, producing, and ultimately<BR>
transferring it to the customer are designed to<BR>
address DOD's most pressing environmental problems<BR>
in the most timely, cost-effective manner.<BR>
Furthermore, DOD should work with EPA and state<BR>
governments to partner oversight.<BR>

<P>2. DOD should streamline the clean-up process so<BR>
that sites may be remediated quickly without<BR>
prolonged periods of study.<BR>

<P>This involves partnering with regulators,<BR>
encouragement of generic clean-up approaches, and<BR>
provisions that grant installation commanders<BR>
authority to contract for clean-up of contaminated<BR>
sites. A _risk management_ approach--which requires<BR>
the categorization of sites, puts highest priority<BR>
on risk to human health and the environment,<BR>
mandates funding allocation based upon these<BR>
priorities, and monitors progress in reducing<BR>
overall risk--must be developed.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should develop an environmental technology<BR>
policy that is based on service users' environmental<BR>
requirements and embodies the  DOD environmental<BR>
strategy.<BR>
 <BR>
 To do this, it is necessary to ensure active<BR>
participation by users in the technology development<BR>
process as well as adequate funding. Moreover, DOD<BR>
should identify those areas where a joint<BR>
development approach is most desirable and encourage<BR>
early identification of relevant technologies in<BR>
other federal agencies and the private sector. DOD's<BR>
goal should be to field new technology that meets<BR>
the users' needs in a timely manner.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should develop a more effective pollution<BR>
prevention program.<BR>

<P>This can be accomplished with the creation of<BR>
incentives to use pollution prevention as a primary<BR>
means to achieve environmental compliance; a review<BR>
of military specifications to eliminate the use of<BR>
hazardous materials; adequate funding of the<BR>
services' pollution prevention program; and<BR>
development of a model pollution prevention program<BR>
to serve as a prototype.<BR>

<P>5. DOD should work with EPA regional offices and<BR>
state and local environmental organizations to<BR>
develop joint implementation approaches. <BR>

<P>These efforts can assist installations and reserve<BR>
centers in environmental compliance and clean-up,<BR>
and support commanders' interests with state and<BR>
local regulators.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>The American public has shown great interest in<BR>
DOD's management of environmental security issues.<BR>
Adequate funding must be appropriated for training,<BR>
clean-up of existing sites, and pollution prevention<BR>
on DOD property. Coordination with EPA environmental<BR>
regional offices should be expedited. This will<BR>
significantly help installation commanders in<BR>
fulfilling their environmental security mission and<BR>
facilitate improved relations with government<BR>
regulators. Many of the initiatives are long-range<BR>
in nature and will require changes in regulations<BR>
and policies. <BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Once these initiatives are implemented, there may be<BR>
cost savings to the<BR>
department. Because the amounts saved will vary from<BR>
installation to installation, they cannot be<BR>
estimated at this time.<BR>

<P>DOD08: Establish a Defense Quality Workplace<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>Substantial budget reductions in the post-Cold War<BR>
era compel the Department of Defense (DOD) to change<BR>
the way it does business. The Services and several<BR>
DOD agencies have already implemented total quality<BR>
management (TQM) principles as a means to accomplish<BR>
their missions in a constrained fiscal environment.<BR>
Many have achieved significant successes, and<BR>
several DOD activities have even become nationally<BR>
recognized quality award winners. The key factor<BR>
underpinning each success is top leadership<BR>
commitment and strategicmanagement of the quality<BR>
improvement effort. The commitment of the<BR>
Department's most senior leadership to establishing<BR>
a defense quality workplace is required now if DOD<BR>
is to continue to provide and maintain an effective<BR>
national defense.<BR>

<P>Many corporations that recognized that their<BR>
survival was at stake adopted TQM as their framework<BR>
for improvement. Likewise, many units and entire DOD<BR>
components have injected the principles of TQM into<BR>
their daily operations. They have achieved many<BR>
breakthroughs, saved millions of dollars, and<BR>
prevented potentially life-threatening situations.<BR>
Unfortunately, these efforts have not been<BR>
institutionalized across the entire Department of<BR>
Defense.<BR>

<P>The quality revolution that has profoundly changed<BR>
management practice rests on an industrial<BR>
engineering foundation, but its leverage comes from<BR>
the leadership principles of Dr. W. Edwards Deming.<BR>
When the United States was experiencing a severe<BR>
recession, a 1980 NBC-TV White Paper titled _If<BR>
Japan Can, Why Can't We?_ awakened American industry<BR>
to the power of Deming's principles. Individual<BR>
industrial and<BR>
government leaders reexamined their management<BR>
practices and concluded that these practices, not<BR>
their employees, were the problem. A managerial<BR>
breakthrough was required to reverse the country's<BR>
economic fortunes. Those who saw the possibilities<BR>
of  a total quality approach to management initiated<BR>
the  changes and ultimately created world-class<BR>
companies.<BR>
 <BR>
 The business environment of American industry<BR>
dramatically changed in the 1970s, as has the<BR>
current operating environment of the Department. The<BR>
status quo is no longer tenable and strategic<BR>
changes demand an organizational transformation in<BR>
DOD.<BR>

<P> The most important characteristic of a total<BR>
quality organization is committed leadership. Its<BR>
central task is to create an environment in which<BR>
the knowledge and expertise of every person can be<BR>
expressed and is welcomed. A shared vision based on<BR>
core principles must be employed so that all members<BR>
will have a compass for their direction. Employees<BR>
must be empowered to _surface_ problems and fix<BR>
those for which they have the resources.<BR>

<P>Responsible initiative is required throughout DOD,<BR>
where resources are limited, because success in the<BR>
nation's defense is not negotiable. Any impediment<BR>
that inhibits the Department's components from<BR>
solving problems they confront must be eliminated.<BR>
Mutual trust between the organization's leadership<BR>
and its employees must be fostered so that everyone<BR>
is committed to the organization's mission.<BR>

<P>The hierarchical structure of the DOD organization<BR>
might be satisfactory when resources are plentiful,<BR>
but industry has proven that this type of<BR>
architecture and narrow span of control becomes a<BR>
millstone when budgets shrink and market demand<BR>
changes dramatically. Hierarchical structures foster<BR>
centralized decisionmaking, powerful staffs who<BR>
tamper, turf battles, and avoidance of risk. These<BR>
behaviors prevent any long-term organizational<BR>
efficiencies and constrain the ability to alter<BR>
direction when required.<BR>

<P>The best of U.S. commercial industry has eliminated<BR>
many layers of management and flattened its<BR>
organizations in order to be competitive and agile.<BR>
It is not uncommon for 20 to 50 employees to report<BR>
to one person. This structure demands that everyone<BR>
contribute and add value to the process. The<BR>
supervisor becomes a coach, a mentor, and is not<BR>
expected to know instantly every detail in the<BR>
organization. The employee is accountable for<BR>
specific assignments and responsible for his or her<BR>
own contribution to the team. To be successful, this<BR>
type of organization demands mutual trust.<BR>

<P>The ultimate goal is that TQM will cease to have its<BR>
own identity as continuous improvement principles<BR>
and practices become the normal way DOD accomplishes<BR>
its mission. To achieve this goal, everyone in the<BR>
Department must understand and employ TQM<BR>
principles.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should establish a top leadership and<BR>
management structure that furthers TQM principles.<BR>

<P>This structure would provide DOD with a senior-level<BR>
corporate forum to define the future direction of<BR>
the Department. The Secretary of Defense should<BR>
charter a DOD Executive Steering Board (ESB),<BR>
composed of the Department's senior leaders, to<BR>
guide implementation of TQM within DOD. A DOD<BR>
Quality Advisor should be designated to provide an<BR>
independent source of advice to the Secretary and<BR>
the ESB on matters of quality management.<BR>

<P>2. DOD should implement a strategic planning process<BR>
that encompasses TQM principles and establishes<BR>
direction.<BR>

<P>A strategic planning process and implementation plan<BR>
are necessary to communicate direction and guide<BR>
work efforts across DOD. The plan would provide a<BR>
vehicle for alignment and integration of actions,<BR>
programs, and process improvement endeavors across<BR>
all DOD organizational components. At the outset,<BR>
the Department should determine customer needs and<BR>
assess the external and internal environment to<BR>
identify the critical issues upon which to base the<BR>
strategic plan.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should ensure that employees throughout the<BR>
Department have a comprehensive knowledge of TQM<BR>
principles and practices to bring about and sustain<BR>
the TQM transformation.<BR>

<P>Whereas significant actions are already underway in<BR>
the Services, the Secretary of Defense should<BR>
establish a TQM education and training plan for<BR>
personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.<BR>
In addition, the Department should issue policy that<BR>
requires incorporation of TQM<BR>
principles in the curricula of all DOD professional<BR>
and service schools, and establish measures to<BR>
determine the impact of TQM education and<BR>
training on mission outcomes departmentwide.<BR>

<P>4. DOD should create an environment that promotes<BR>
TQM principles and practices to foster continuous<BR>
process improvement, encourage creativity and<BR>
innovation, and nurture the professional and<BR>
personal growth of all employees.<BR>

<P>The Department's most crucial resource is its<BR>
people. Specifically, leadership should set the tone<BR>
and create such an environment through the following<BR>
actions:<BR>

<P>~ create career-enhancing incentives for DOD<BR>
  executives and managers to employ TQM principles<BR>
  and methods;<BR>

<P>~ redesign DOD's reward and recognition programs and<BR>
  performance appraisal systems so that they are<BR>
  consistent with TQM principles and value total<BR>
  quality practitioners;<BR>

<P>~ design and implement an unencumbered, responsive<BR>
  employee suggestion program that encourages people<BR>
  to volunteer their improvement ideas;<BR>
 <BR>
~ reinvent the DOD Office of Inspector General and<BR>
  minimize its statutory control role so that its<BR>
  main purpose is to assist DOD components in<BR>
  achieving their mission rather than controlling<BR>
  their actions; and<BR>

<P>~ enact a DOD policy that accentuates the<BR>
  involvement of elected union representatives as<BR>
  active participants and partners in the TQM<BR>
  process.<BR>

<P>5. DOD should rewrite directives, instructions, and<BR>
policies to support TQM principles and<BR>
methodologies.<BR>

<P>In particular, the Department should provide<BR>
guidance for the implementation of the Government<BR>
Performance and Results Act of 1993, which is<BR>
consistent with TQM principles. Furthermore, the<BR>
Department should ensure that recommendations<BR>
resulting from ongoing reviews of personnel and<BR>
acquisition regulations are consistent with TQM<BR>
principles.<BR>

<P>6. DOD should use performance metrics to assess<BR>
progress<BR>
toward attaining its vision. <BR>

<P>A measurement system would ensure that leadership<BR>
decisions are based on objective information from<BR>
outcomes. A performance measurement capability would<BR>
also provide a means of assessing progress toward<BR>
the DOD vision.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>TQM principles have brought measurable success to<BR>
numerous public and private organizations. The<BR>
further introduction and institutionalization of TQM<BR>
concepts into DOD greatly enhances the ability of<BR>
each Service, component, command, and individual to<BR>
accomplish its specific mission. For this to happen,<BR>
DOD's cultural environment must change so that a<BR>
comprehensive knowledge of TQM principles and<BR>
practices becomes part of the Department's daily<BR>
operations at all levels, in headquarters and in the<BR>
field. Many of the initiatives are long-range in<BR>
nature and require changes in regulations and<BR>
policies. The end result will be a true quality<BR>
defense establishment.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>If past successes are a reliable indicator, it is<BR>
anticipated that once these initiatives are<BR>
implemented, there will be sizable cost savings<BR>
within DOD. These will result from streamlined<BR>
management and core processes, enhanced<BR>
productivity, the reduction of errors, and the<BR>
elimination of bad management practices. The<BR>
specifics, however, cannot be estimated at this<BR>
time.<BR>

<P>DOD09: Maximize the Efficiency of DOD's Health Care<BR>
Operations <BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>The Department of Defense (DOD) has an extensive and<BR>
complex medical system serving more than 8 million<BR>
eligible people. Despite its  size and complexity,<BR>
the DOD health care system does not use current <BR>
technology to the fullest extent possible to<BR>
maintain  records,communicate throughout the system,<BR>
and carry out other  essential functions. The<BR>
Department has already begun to integrate  technolog <BR>
y to improve service delivery while simultaneously<BR>
reducing costs, and opportunities exist to speed up<BR>
these efforts.<BR>

<P>Specifically, commercially available systems can<BR>
effect immediate improvements in service. Through<BR>
innovative uses of technology, the Department could<BR>
improve the proportion of health care delivered on<BR>
an outpatient or ambulatory basis. Although an<BR>
ever-increasing proportion of health care is<BR>
delivered in the outpatient or ambulatory setting,<BR>
there is no present mechanism available to capture<BR>
systematically ambulatory diagnostic coding<BR>
information and the associated costs. A prototype<BR>
that incorporates these functions has been developed<BR>
and will be tested in the medical center at<BR>
Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Within a short<BR>
time this system could be operationally deployed<BR>
into one of DOD's health care regions.<BR>

<P>Incorporating technology into DOD's health care<BR>
operations alone will not be sufficient as a<BR>
strategy to make the best use of DOD's resources.<BR>
DOD must also determine whether all of its<BR>
operations are still essential and whether the<BR>
private sector can provide certain DOD services.<BR>

<P>For example, in order to foster a program to train<BR>
physicians committed to a long-term military career,<BR>
DOD created a medical school called the Uniformed<BR>
Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS)<BR>
in 1972. The USUHS provides a full medical education<BR>
to individuals in return for seven years of active<BR>
military service. The cost of this program is $90<BR>
million a year.1<BR>

<P>Based on figures from 1991, it costs the USUHS<BR>
approximately $562,000 to train each physician in<BR>
its program. This program has only met a small<BR>
fraction of DOD's need for new physicians and<BR>
accounts for less than 9 percent of the total number<BR>
of physicians entering military service. Based on<BR>
USUHS's share of physicians provided, closing the<BR>
USUHS would reduce the supply of DOD physicians by<BR>
less than 10 percent. Currently, the remaining 90<BR>
percent of DOD physicians are derived from other<BR>
sources, including volunteers.2 Due to anticipated<BR>
drawdown of military forces, the loss of USUHS<BR>
physicians would be consistent with the requirements<BR>
of a smaller military force.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should accelerate the deployment of currently<BR>
available commercial technology into one of its 12<BR>
health care regions, with the eventual goal of<BR>
deploying it throughout the system.<BR>

<P>Among potential candidates are the Medical<BR>
Diagnostic Imaging System (MDIS), Kurzweil<BR>
Artificial Intelligence VoiceRAD and Kurzweil Voice<BR>
Emergency Room, Apple Newton technology (PROMED),<BR>
and Third Party Collection Program systems.<BR>

<P>DOD should also investigate the possible use of<BR>
televideoconferencing to reach patients and their<BR>
families at home to prevent unnecessary trips to<BR>
hospitals or clinics. Medical education, health<BR>
promotion, and remote patient monitoring are major<BR>
areas in which such technology could be applied.<BR>

<P>2. DOD should seek to use technology to improve the<BR>
increasing proportion of health care delivered on an<BR>
outpatient or ambulatory basis.<BR>

<P>None of the currently available systems capture<BR>
outpatient diagnostic information and the associated<BR>
costs. A prototype system that addresses these needs<BR>
has been developed for testing at Elmendorf Air<BR>
Force Base. Once testing is complete, DOD should<BR>
aggressively deploy the system elsewhere.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should seek legislative authority to<BR>
terminate the Uniformed Services University of the<BR>
Health Sciences medical school program.<BR>

<P>Reducing the number of physicians by the loss of<BR>
USUHS could be offset by an expansion of other<BR>
existing programs that are less costly, such as the<BR>
Health Professionals Scholarship Program, which<BR>
costs annually $111,000 per person.3 Physicians<BR>
currently enrolled in the USUHS program should be<BR>
allowed to complete their education.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Immediate improvements in DOD's health care delivery<BR>
can be realized with the deployment of commercially<BR>
available systems. Expanding the use of technology<BR>
could eventually result in ambulatory diagnostic<BR>
coding, patient level cost accounting, and a<BR>
paperless computerized medical record.<BR>

<P>Historically, DOD recruited physicians for long-term<BR>
military service through the USUHS program. However,<BR>
due to the cutbacks in force structure and the<BR>
change in military missions for DOD, less costly<BR>
medical training programs should replace the USUHS.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Through the continued and expanded use of current<BR>
technology, and the development and testing of new<BR>
prototypes, DOD anticipates sizable future savings<BR>
and cost avoidance. Up-front investments may be<BR>
required to accelerate the deployment of relevant<BR>
technologies into DOD's health care system. The<BR>
specifics, however, cannot be estimated at this<BR>
time. By eliminating the USUHS medical school<BR>
program, the Department of Defense could save<BR>
approximately $350 million over a 5-year period.<BR>

<P>DOD10: Give Department of Defense Installation<BR>
Commanders More Authority and Responsibility over<BR>
Installation Management<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>The Department of Defense's (DOD's) installations<BR>
constitute more than<BR>
5,500 properties containing approximately 27 million<BR>
acres and over 400,000 buildings. The current<BR>
replacement value of these properties is more than<BR>
$566 billion. Facilities and services are provided<BR>
for approximately 1.9 million military personnel,<BR>
almost one million civilian employees, 2.5 million<BR>
dependents, and 1.7 million military retirees. The<BR>
annual funding support provided to military<BR>
installations averaged over $16 billion per year<BR>
during the early 1990s.<BR>

<P>All installations share a common mission to provide<BR>
quality facilities and services to tenant<BR>
organizations, activities, and individuals.<BR>
Installations provide housing, food services,<BR>
utilities, waste disposal, health and child care,<BR>
schools, hospitals, recreation, facilities repair,<BR>
grounds and building maintenance, vehicle<BR>
maintenance, and administrative and technical<BR>
support. Managing a defense installation is<BR>
comparable to managing a city of equal size. And,<BR>
like cities, each installation is unique.<BR>

<P>Installation commanders often are hampered by an<BR>
abundance of rules and regulations. And many<BR>
decisions that affect installations are made by<BR>
people who do not have detailed knowledge of a<BR>
situation nor any responsibility for the<BR>
consequences of their actions.<BR>

<P>For example, authority to repair leaking roofs in<BR>
Albuquerque, New Mexico, could only be given by the<BR>
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, even<BR>
though he was 2,500 miles away and did not know<BR>
whether the roofs leaked. The installation engineer,<BR>
who could see that the roofs leaked, could only<BR>
write a report to Washington, D.C., seeking<BR>
permission to fix them, rather than take the<BR>
initiative to fix them on his own.<BR>

<P>DOD wants to empower installation commanders with<BR>
the responsibility, authority, and flexibility to<BR>
make such decisions by the year 2000. This chapter<BR>
identifies the legislative, regulatory, and policy<BR>
barriers to this vision.<BR>

<P>Four general functional areas with significant<BR>
barriers have been identified: financial management<BR>
and funding flexibility, installation engineering<BR>
support, installation contracting, and supply and<BR>
service support. These represent areas in which<BR>
installation commanders are restricted in their<BR>
authority to manage in a more businesslike manner.<BR>

<P>First, the finance and accounting systems that<BR>
support installations are generally designed to<BR>
control and track appropriation obligations.<BR>
Currently, these systems fail to provide adequate<BR>
cost accounting information to the installation<BR>
commander and severely limit the capability of<BR>
commanders to make cost-based, best value decisions.<BR>

<P>Financial management constraints include the<BR>
appropriation structure, restrictive fiscal<BR>
policies, inflexible program levels, fiscal year<BR>
boundaries, and obligation limits. Though some would<BR>
argue that these constraints are necessary to<BR>
control and monitor spending, unreasonable<BR>
restrictions often overwhelm the proactive<BR>
installation commander who is attempting to apply<BR>
limited resources to an  unending list of<BR>
operational, support, and quality of life <BR>
requirements.<BR>
 <BR>
 To improve financial management and funding<BR>
flexibility, the installation commander must be<BR>
empowered to manage his or her installation. The<BR>
commander must have the authority, ability, and<BR>
responsibility to develop a comprehensive management<BR>
plan that addresses all of the installation's tasks<BR>
and functions. This plan must establish the overall<BR>
priorities, distribute the full set of resources,<BR>
and balance requirements with available resources.<BR>
And the installation commander must be held<BR>
accountable for his or her decisions. The proposed<BR>
actions would enable installation commanders to<BR>
tailor their resources to the unique requirements of<BR>
their installation, flexibly respond to changing<BR>
circumstances, encourage and reward good management<BR>
by subordinates, and subsequently improve the<BR>
overall value and effectiveness of DOD intallations. <BR>

<P>Second, mission effectiveness and productivity are<BR>
significantly affected by the quality of<BR>
installation engineering services. Engineering<BR>
services include the maintenance and disposal of<BR>
real property, facilities and physical plant<BR>
systems, and the procurement of  services, supplies,<BR>
and equipment in support of these  systems.<BR>
 <BR>
 Engineering support requirements from higher<BR>
headquarters often direct exactly how commanders are<BR>
to meet these requirements. Engineering projects<BR>
frequently require line-item reviews and approval by<BR>
higher authority. These restrictions unnecessarily<BR>
delay completion. Inflexible workforce authorization<BR>
and personnel hiring and discharge procedures impede<BR>
the commander's ability to adequately staff a<BR>
particular project as workloads and resources<BR>
change. Limitations on specific budget accounts may<BR>
prevent commanders from funding pressing engineering<BR>
requirements.<BR>

<P>DOD is currently in the process of reducing its<BR>
inventory of properties and is retaining only those<BR>
installations that are necessary to adequately<BR>
support the current or planned missions and<BR>
activities of the Department. Where possible, DOD<BR>
has relied on the private sector and other public<BR>
sector agencies to provide real property and<BR>
installation support (e.g., use of local fire<BR>
departments). However, coordination between private<BR>
and public sectors has not been fully explored. And<BR>
the use of private sector financing has not always<BR>
been considered as an option. Installation<BR>
commanders are also hampered by inflexible<BR>
requirements that prevent them from acquiring a<BR>
provider who can give the best value for services,<BR>
supplies, or equipment.<BR>

<P>In the area of inventory management, decisions on<BR>
the cost of installation facilities and engineering<BR>
services are often based on annual obligations<BR>
rather than on total life-cycle costs. Also, DOD<BR>
lacks a comprehensive, long-range management program<BR>
to manage its capital assets. This has led to DOD's<BR>
inability to properly maintain and dispose of real<BR>
property facilities and systems.<BR>

<P>The ever-increasing number of environmental, safety,<BR>
and occupational health laws and regulations imposed<BR>
by both state and federal authorities is also of<BR>
concern. Installation commanders sometimes do not<BR>
have adequate facilities and engineering services to<BR>
ensure  compliance.<BR>
 <BR>
 The third area of concern is contracting support.<BR>
Contracting support at the installation level is<BR>
hampered by excessive controls imposed on<BR>
contracting activities. For example, smaller<BR>
contracts ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 cannot be<BR>
processed in an expeditious manner due to complex<BR>
and restrictive acquisition procedures. Current<BR>
procurement rules require extensive documentation<BR>
and lead time to advertise and prepare bids on<BR>
relatively small value contracts. Unnecessary inter-<BR>
and intra-agency reviews also impede the efficient<BR>
and effective processing of contracts.<BR>

<P>Resolution of disputes between contractors and the<BR>
installation are also a matter of concern.<BR>
Procurement disputes between service providers and<BR>
service users delay the prompt delivery of goods and<BR>
services, create a confrontational atmosphere, and<BR>
raise the costs  to both the provider and the<BR>
government. Partnering agreements between  suppliers<BR>
and customers could prevent misunderstandings,<BR>
butare rarely  used.<BR>
 <BR>
 Supplies and services support is the last area of<BR>
concern. Installation managers lack flexibility to<BR>
purchase, procure, obligate, negotiate, source, or<BR>
price for best value supplies and services directly<BR>
from a provider. Restrictive regulations and<BR>
directives drive up costs by inhibiting the<BR>
commander from _shopping smart._<BR>

<P>For example, to purchase a commercial motor vehicle<BR>
or to lease space, the commander must provide an<BR>
extensive analysis to the DOD Comptroller and the<BR>
General Services Administration. The preparation of<BR>
the analysis and the subsequent review and approval<BR>
process cause unnecessary delay and expense. It<BR>
would be faster and more economical to permit<BR>
installations to purchase the vehicle directly from<BR>
a private commercial dealer. Commanders should be<BR>
permitted to make such purchases, and also be given<BR>
authority to buy high-demand items _in bulk_ to<BR>
minimize costs.<BR>

<P>Current procurement practices create unusable excess<BR>
as well as pose significant disposal problems for<BR>
hazardous waste at installation sites. For example,<BR>
if a project only requires one gallon of paint, a<BR>
commander may be forced to purchase a 55-gallon<BR>
container because this is the minimum amount that<BR>
can be obtained. Obviously, procuring, storing, and<BR>
ultimately disposing of the excess paint is an<BR>
expense that should be avoided.<BR>

<P>Currently, the costs of procuring, warehousing,<BR>
packing, crating, and handling are not permitted to<BR>
be included as customers' surcharges. These<BR>
additional costs should not be absorbed by the<BR>
government. <BR>

<P>Finally, because DOD instructions concerning<BR>
interservice support agreements (ISAs) are<BR>
inadequate, the responsibilities and functions of<BR>
users and suppliers are often not clearly defined.<BR>
Ambiguous and incomplete provisions in an ISA<BR>
ultimately lead to confusion and costly delays. <BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>A. Financial Management and Funding Flexibility<BR>

<P>1. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service should<BR>
develop and institute a Defense-wide cost accounting<BR>
system for installation management.<BR>

<P>Systems should be developed that provide timely and<BR>
accurate status reports to installation commanders.<BR>
Budget function and appropriations data must not<BR>
take precedence over basic financial decision-making<BR>
information.<BR>

<P>2. DOD should review all financial constraints and<BR>
limitations imposed on installations.<BR>

<P>All limitations should be challenged and removed<BR>
wherever possible. For example, the Defense<BR>
Comptroller should seek legislative authority to<BR>
allow, on a limited basis, Operations and<BR>
Maintenance appropriations beyond the traditional<BR>
single fiscal year. For those limitations required<BR>
by law or good business practice, the dollar amounts<BR>
should be raised to the maximum achievable levels.<BR>

<P>3. DOD should develop and institute procedures that<BR>
allow installation commanders to retain a designated<BR>
portion of savings generated by specified<BR>
cost-saving measures, such as energy conservation.<BR>

<P>This would encourage installation commanders to<BR>
manage their programs as efficiently and<BR>
economically as possible.<BR>
 <BR>
4. DOD should institute procedures that require a<BR>
financial impact assessment of major policy<BR>
decisions.<BR>

<P>The assessments would be factored into resource<BR>
initiatives before these policies reach the<BR>
installation. Installation commanders would be<BR>
assured that the financial impact has been<BR>
considered.<BR>

<P>5. DOD should limit non-specific, broad-based cuts<BR>
of installation resources.<BR>

<P>Reductions should be tied to a specific deletion of<BR>
functions or reduction of a required level of<BR>
service. By limiting the imposition of<BR>
non-programmatic reductions of resources,<BR>
installations would not face maintaining unnecessary<BR>
functions or undesired levels of  service in the<BR>
face of decreasing funding levels.<BR>
 <BR>
B. Installation and Engineering Support<BR>

<P>6. DOD should review existing installation<BR>
engineering policies, procedures, and other<BR>
regulatory requirements.<BR>

<P>The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense<BR>
for Environmental Security, in conjunction with the<BR>
Services, should ensure that clear, measurable,<BR>
realistic, and attainable goals and standards have<BR>
been established for each primary process and<BR>
activity. It should eliminate all unnecessary<BR>
prescriptive direction on how the goal or standard<BR>
is to be achieved.<BR>

<P>7. DOD should develop a comprehensive, long-range<BR>
approach to managing DOD capital assets, similar to<BR>
capital asset management systems common in the<BR>
private sector.<BR>

<P>OSD, the Comptroller, and the Office of the Deputy<BR>
Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental<BR>
Security, in conjunction with the Services and other<BR>
DOD agencies, the Office of Management and Budget<BR>
(OMB), and Congress, should develop an approach that<BR>
requires tracking total life-cycle costs for<BR>
acquiring, operating, maintaining, and disposing of<BR>
real property facilities and systems. DOD, with the<BR>
assistance of OMB, would also annually program and<BR>
budget the capital and operating expenses necessary<BR>
to minimize total life-cycle costs.<BR>

<P>8. DOD should enhance the installation commander's<BR>
ability to obtain engineering support services.<BR>

<P>The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense<BR>
for Environmental Security, in conjunction with the<BR>
OSD Comptroller, the Services, other DOD agencies,<BR>
OMB, and Congress, should implement policies and<BR>
practices that empower the installation commanders<BR>
to obtain engineering support in a timely and<BR>
efficient manner. The number and types of projects<BR>
requiring line-item review and approval by<BR>
authorities above the installation level should be<BR>
greatly reduced. Work classification policies and<BR>
guidance should be simplified. Commanders should be<BR>
allowed to adopt a _unified budget_ with a single<BR>
account for all installation engineering<BR>
requirements.<BR>

<P>9. DOD should empower installation commanders to<BR>
make best value purchases.<BR>

<P>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for<BR>
Acquisition and Technology, in conjunction with the<BR>
Services, DOD agencies, and<BR>
Congress, should identify and modify those statutes,<BR>
policies, and procedures that preclude or otherwise<BR>
limit the installation commander from acquiring the<BR>
best value for services, supplies, equipment, and<BR>
other resources.<BR>

<P>10. DOD should act to minimize lifecycle costs.<BR>
 The OSD Comptroller and the Office of the Deputy<BR>
Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental<BR>
Security, in conjunction with the Services, DOD<BR>
agencies, OMB, and Congress, should encourage<BR>
private-sector-financed alternatives to the Military<BR>
Construction appropriation for acquiring, operating,<BR>
and maintaining required facilities at the lowest<BR>
total life-cycle cost.<BR>

<P>11. DOD should provide savings incentives to<BR>
installation commanders.<BR>

<P>The OSD Comptroller and the Office of the Deputy<BR>
Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental<BR>
Security, in conjunction with the Services, DOD<BR>
agencies, OMB, and Congress, should implement cost<BR>
savings incentives that would authorize installation<BR>
commanders to retain savings (or cost avoidance)<BR>
that result from process improvements and<BR>
productivity enhancements. Commanders should be<BR>
allowed to apply these savings toward discretionary<BR>
spending and/or other installation engineering<BR>
requirements.<BR>

<P>12. DOD, in conjunction with the Office of Personnel<BR>
Management, unions, and Congress, should modify<BR>
staffing authorization and personnel hiring and<BR>
discharge procedures to permit installation<BR>
commanders the flexibility they need to efficiently<BR>
adjust their staffs  to changing workloads and<BR>
resources and to retain the most  qualified and<BR>
productive personnel.<BR>
 <BR>
C. Contracting Support<BR>

<P>13. Legislation should be enacted to permit DOD to<BR>
use simplified acquisition procedures for contracts<BR>
between $25,000 and $100,000.<BR>

<P>
<P>DOD should also reduce the solicitation lead time<BR>
for contracts between $25,000 and $100,000 and seek<BR>
legislative authority to increase the threshold<BR>
established by the Service Contract Act and the<BR>
Davis-Bacon Act.<BR>

<P>14. DOD should encourage the use of _partnering_<BR>
agreements between suppliers and customers.<BR>

<P>Widespread application should be encouraged wherever<BR>
possible and appropriate, in contracts as well as in<BR>
agreements between government organizations.<BR>
Successful partnering can be enhanced by formally<BR>
stating values and goals in solicitations, ensuring<BR>
top-level commitment to the process, sponsoring<BR>
joint team building workshops, reaching consensus on<BR>
operating principles, and establishing conflict<BR>
management procedures such as the Alternate Disputes<BR>
Process. Follow-up meetings and/or workshops will<BR>
also maintain open communications and encourage<BR>
continued cooperation after the contract is under<BR>
way.<BR>

<P>15. DOD should increase the use of _best value_<BR>
contracts where applicable and encourage<BR>
installation commanders to take prudent risks in<BR>
procurement activities.<BR>

<P>Current requirements do not encourage the use of<BR>
best value contracts. This contributes to longer<BR>
lead times, customer dissatisfaction, and less than<BR>
full value for government expenditures. All<BR>
personnel involved in the contracting process should<BR>
be better trained  in the _best value_ philosophy.<BR>
The training should emphasize the  benefits of using<BR>
best value contracting approaches. DOD needs <BR>
toencourage installation commanders to take prudent<BR>
risks, and DOD must  accept their occasional<BR>
failures. Approval of Value Engineeri  ng proposals<BR>
should be authorized at the installation.<BR>

<P>16. DOD should reform contract protest procedures.<BR>

<P>The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for<BR>
Acquisition Reform should revise the protest process<BR>
to include limiting the time in which a protest is<BR>
considered. The rejection of unreasonable protests<BR>
submitted by contractors whose primary intent<BR>
appears to be to delay the contract awards should be<BR>
facilitated.<BR>

<P>D. Supply and Service Support<BR>

<P>17. DOD should identify impediments to a _shop<BR>
smart_ capability.<BR>

<P>DOD should revise and/or eliminate restrictive<BR>
regulations that prevent installation contracting<BR>
officers from buying in the most cost-effective<BR>
manner. DOD should also provide information to<BR>
installation commanders<BR>
comparing commercial options to available federal<BR>
sources. DOD also should develop a standard<BR>
interservice support agreements (ISAs) accounting<BR>
system to facilitate reimbursement.<BR>

<P>18. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should<BR>
be amended to permit purchasing from large<BR>
businesses based on cost and quality of items<BR>
required.<BR>

<P>Amending FAR would, in many cases, save the costs<BR>
associated with the small business intermediary.<BR>

<P>19. DOD should delete or revise those statutory and<BR>
regulatory requirements that unreasonably impede an<BR>
installation commander's ability to contract for<BR>
supplies and services.<BR>

<P>In the area of real estate leasing and purchasing,<BR>
Section 2682 of Title 10, U.S.C., should be amended<BR>
to eliminate some fixed lease costs and overhead<BR>
expenses. Similarly, DOD should be allowed to delete<BR>
the requirement to submit Analysis of Requirements<BR>
for Commercial Vehicles and other similar<BR>
requirements where the procedures are unnecessary,<BR>
cumbersome, or difficult to understand. The Joint<BR>
Travel Regulations should also be reviewed and<BR>
amended. The restriction on use of foreign flag<BR>
carriers (Fly American Act) should be eliminated.<BR>
This act prohibits the use of several U.S. carriers<BR>
(e.g. USAir, Continental) because of their alignment<BR>
with non-U.S. carriers, even though they often can<BR>
provide the least costly means of transportation.<BR>

<P>20. DOD should issue unit cost guidance.<BR>

<P>It is critical that the DOD Comptroller establish a<BR>
standard financial accounting system and uniform<BR>
guidance for computing unit costs. This will promote<BR>
uniformity and assist installation commanders in<BR>
assessing their procurement programs in a more<BR>
efficient and effective manner.<BR>

<P>21. DOD should change applicable DOD regulations to<BR>
allow stock fund managers to include in their<BR>
customers' surcharges the costs for procuring,<BR>
warehousing, packing, crating, and handling. <BR>

<P>These are allowable costs that should be recovered.<BR>

<P>22. DOD should provide guidance on inter-service<BR>
support agreements (ISAs).<BR>

<P>DOD should revise its guidance to include DOD<BR>
interservice support policy; organization,<BR>
functions, and specific responsibilities of<BR>
suppliers and receivers in the ISA process;<BR>
procedures for negotiation and preparation of ISAs;<BR>
and categories of support that spell out in detail<BR>
the types of support required.<BR>

<P>23. OMB and DOD should implement full funding<BR>
reimbursement on an accelerated schedule.<BR>

<P>In this area, DOD should add improved automated<BR>
support and provide more definitive<BR>
policy/procedural guidance. This should include<BR>
flexible pricing, process/function costs, and total<BR>
asset visibility.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Many of these initiatives are long-range in nature<BR>
and will require changes in legislation as well as<BR>
in DOD internal regulations and policies.<BR>
Coordination with the Services will be required.<BR>
Reforming engineering support functions will require<BR>
assistance from outside resources such as state and<BR>
local communities and other federal agencies. Modern<BR>
management tools and innovative technological <BR>
applications in the areas of energy use, automated<BR>
data processing, and  the environment will have to<BR>
be provided in order to assistthe  installation<BR>
commander in moving toward entrepreneurial<BR>
management.  There will be some upfront<BR>
administrative costs to develop   the various fiscal<BR>
management systems.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>Once these initiatives are implemented, cost savings<BR>
will be realized. The amounts saved will vary from<BR>
installation to installation  and cannot be<BR>
estimated.<BR>
 <BR>
 DOD11: Reduce National Guard and Reserve Costs<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>In 1993, the U.S. military reserves exceeded 1.1<BR>
million personnel, compared with approximately 1.8<BR>
million on active duty.1 There are seven reserve<BR>
components, comprising Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine<BR>
Corps, and Coast Guard personnel, along with the<BR>
Army and Air National Guards. Two-thirds of the<BR>
reserve force are in the Army Reserve and Army and<BR>
Air<BR>
National Guards.<BR>

<P>The post-Cold War drawdown of active and reserve<BR>
military forces has, in some cases, created a<BR>
surplus of individuals seeking to join or stay in<BR>
the reserve program. In a given calendar year, a<BR>
_selected reservist_ generally performs duty one<BR>
weekend a month plus serves on active duty for a<BR>
period of time, usually 12 to 14 days. During the<BR>
monthly drill period, the selected reservist trains<BR>
in  his or her military occupational specialty for a<BR>
wartime  mission.<BR>
 <BR>
 The cost of the Guard and Reserve personnel program<BR>
amounts to more than $9 billion annually.2 The<BR>
National Performance Review has identified two<BR>
specific areas where substantial cost savings in the<BR>
program can be achieved.<BR>

<P>The first of these areas deals with payments to<BR>
reservists who are also full-time federal civilian<BR>
employees. In fiscal year 1992 alone, there were<BR>
136,700 reservists who fell into that category.3<BR>
Although the Dual Compensation Act generally<BR>
prohibits a federal employee from drawing two<BR>
salaries from the federal government for the same<BR>
period of time, these selected reservists received<BR>
both their full civilian pay and full reserve pay<BR>
during their two weeks of annual military training.<BR>

<P>The fact that these selected reservists are<BR>
authorized by federal statute to receive military<BR>
leave for training without loss of pay or annual<BR>
leave is an inequity in the system. In contrast, a<BR>
1986 Hay-Huggins Benefits Survey of Clients showed<BR>
that such dual compensation is not standard in the<BR>
private sector.4 In fact, the study found that 81<BR>
percent of reservists employed by private employers<BR>
with over 500 employees received either the<BR>
difference between their civilian and reserve pay,<BR>
were allowed to take vacation, or received no<BR>
additional pay at all for their two weeks of<BR>
military training.5 A similar 1989 study showed that<BR>
66 percent of medium-sized private companies and 51<BR>
percent of large private companies only paid the<BR>
difference in reserve and civilian salary, paid no<BR>
salary at all, or required the reservist to take<BR>
annual or sick leave.6<BR>

<P>Both a 1978 Reserve Compensation System Study (RCSS)<BR>
and a 1990 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report<BR>
proposed eliminating this dual compen-sation.7 The<BR>
RCSS was not, however, released as an approved study<BR>
outside the Department of Defense. The RCSS found<BR>
that over half of the reservists who were federal<BR>
employees were civilian technicians (i.e., full-time<BR>
federal employees of Guard and Reserve units) whose<BR>
civilian employment was contingent upon reserve<BR>
membership in the unit.8 In fiscal 1992, out of<BR>
101,000 selected reservists employed as civilians by<BR>
DOD, 58,000 were military technicians.9<BR>

<P>The second area where cost savings can be achieved<BR>
involves housing benefit payments to reservists with<BR>
dependents. Historically, military personnel have<BR>
been furnished living quarters or a cash substitute<BR>
while serving on active duty. This cash substitute<BR>
is known as a basic allowance for quarters (BAQ).<BR>
The current BAQ authority, however, creates a<BR>
disparity in entitlements for members in essentially<BR>
identical situations. Reservists with and without<BR>
dependents are treated differently with respect to<BR>
BAQ when on short tours of active duty. In effect,<BR>
some reservists who are placed on active duty for<BR>
short training periods receive housing allowances,<BR>
while others do not.<BR>

<P>While reservists generally serve two weeks of active<BR>
duty each year for annual training, they also may<BR>
serve for short periods of additional active duty<BR>
for schooling or special training. During these<BR>
limited periods of training, living quarters are<BR>
provided at government expense to the reservist.<BR>
Whereas reservists without dependents do not receive<BR>
BAQ, a reservist with dependents receives BAQ, even<BR>
though dependents do not usually accompany a<BR>
reservist.<BR>

<P>Generally, because of mission requirements,<BR>
dependents are not authorized to travel with the<BR>
reservist and are not provided quarters during these<BR>
short periods of active duty. For example,<BR>
reservists assigned to ships or stationed in the<BR>
field cannot bring their dependents. For these<BR>
reasons, and because of the out-of-pocket costs<BR>
involved, fewer than 5 percent of reservists<BR>
actually bring their dependents with them on such<BR>
short tours.10<BR>

<P>This issue of equity was addressed in a 1986 Reserve<BR>
Component Survey when service members complained<BR>
that reservists without dependents did not receive<BR>
BAQ during short tours of active duty while members<BR>
with dependents did.11 As a result of their<BR>
concerns, the Sixth Quadrennial Review of Military<BR>
Compensation recommended that BAQ be extended to all<BR>
reservists on active duty with the exception of<BR>
members without dependents who are performing<BR>
initial active duty for training.12<BR>

<P>The disparity in treatment with respect to<BR>
compensation emanates from Section 401(d) of<BR>
Executive Order No. 11157, _Regulations Relating to<BR>
Incentive Pay, Special Pay and Allowances._ This<BR>
section defines the permanent duty station of<BR>
members of reserve components on active duty for<BR>
training as the place where the training is being<BR>
performed.13 Thus, a reservist on temporary active<BR>
duty is deemed to be at his or her _permanent duty<BR>
station._<BR>

<P>Since BAQ for personnel without dependents serving<BR>
at their permanent duty station and occupying<BR>
government quarters is not authorized, reservists<BR>
without dependents on active duty are not entitled<BR>
to BAQ. On the other hand, reservists with<BR>
dependents receive BAQ even though their dependents<BR>
do not accompany the reservist. This inequity is<BR>
apparent in both the reserve officer and enlisted<BR>
corps.<BR>

<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. DOD should seek an amendment to Section 6323 of<BR>
Title 5, U.S.C., to authorize a reservist on annual<BR>
military training leave who is a federal employee to<BR>
be paid only the greater of civilian or reserve<BR>
compensation or to allow the reservist to take<BR>
annual leave.<BR>

<P>
<P>Corresponding changes to DOD and Office of Personnel<BR>
Management regulations and policies would also have<BR>
to be made to implement this statutory amendment.2.<BR>
DOD should seek an amendment to Section 403 of Title<BR>
37, U.S.C., to eliminate BAQ for all selected<BR>
reserve personnel occupying government quarters<BR>
during short periods of active duty (15 days or<BR>
less) who are not accompanied by their dependents.<BR>

<P>To implement this statutory change, relevant<BR>
Executive Orders, regulations, and policies would<BR>
also have to be amended.<BR>

<P>Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>These two issues have been raised in the past by<BR>
both the CBO and the OMB. Though many have argued<BR>
that this change in policy would have a negative<BR>
impact on the recruitment and retention of qualified<BR>
individuals in the reserves, this review indicates<BR>
that such changes would only minimally affect<BR>
overall reserve compensation. It is estimated that<BR>
the reduction in annual income of reservists with<BR>
dependents would be only about 5 percent.<BR>
Implementation of these recommendations, however,<BR>
would put an end to perceived inequities in the<BR>
system and generate significant cost savings for the<BR>
government.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>
<P>By eliminating dual compensation for reservists who<BR>
are civilian federal employees, the Department of<BR>
Defense would save approximately $80 million a year.<BR>
Ending BAQ for reservists with dependents who do not<BR>
accompany the reservist to the active duty location<BR>
during short periods of active duty could save as<BR>
much as $100 million per year.<BR>

of Engineers<BR>

<P>Background<BR>
**********<BR>

<P>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has both a military<BR>
and a civil works mission. Its military mission<BR>
includes all military construction for the Army and<BR>
most construction for the Air Force. The civil works<BR>
mission is wide-ranging and includes such functions<BR>
as flood control on major U.S. inland waterways. The<BR>
1993 fiscal year program of $10.6 billion included<BR>
$5.5 billion for military construction and $5.1<BR>
billion for civil works.1 The Corps also performs<BR>
reimbursable work for other DOD organizations and<BR>
other federal agencies. The Corps has provided<BR>
project planning, cost estimating, design, and<BR>
contract management services to the Environmental<BR>
Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the<BR>
Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the<BR>
Department of State, to name a few.2<BR>

<P>Approximately 20,000 of the Corps' 41,000 civilian<BR>
and military employees work in assigned geographic<BR>
areas within the continental United States.3 This<BR>
paper addresses that portion of the Corps<BR>
organization. It excludes the Corps Research and<BR>
Development<BR>
Laboratories and two specialized division offices. <BR>
The Corps has not undergone a major reorganization<BR>
since 1942, although its traditional engineering and<BR>
construction activities are changing. It appears<BR>
there will be fewer large civil works projects<BR>
approved by Congress, and traditional military<BR>
construction is expected to decline.<BR>

<P>Although the Corps' workload and workforce are<BR>
generally balanced nationwide, some districts have<BR>
workloads that vary as much as 50 percent from year<BR>
to year.4 These offices are difficult to staff<BR>
efficiently. And the Corps' technical capabilities<BR>
are limited by a lack of personnel in specialized<BR>
fields at some smaller offices. High overhead costs<BR>
are also a problem. Corps-wide overhead and<BR>
management costs are about 25 percent; however,<BR>
small district offices may have much higher overhead<BR>
rates.5<BR>

<P>The Corps' organizational structure is a matter of<BR>
congressional concern. Committee reports<BR>
accompanying the Energy and Water Development<BR>
Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 1990 and 1991<BR>
directed the Corps to prepare conceptual<BR>
alternatives and criteria for reorganization. As a<BR>
result, the Corps furnished its _Bayley_ Phase I<BR>
Report to Congress on January 4, 1991. It also<BR>
should be noted that the Corps is not part of the<BR>
Base Realignment and Closure process.<BR>

<P>In early 1992, the Corps renewed its restructuring<BR>
effort by focusing on its roles, missions, workload,<BR>
workforce, funding, and cost-effectiveness. This<BR>
review confirmed the Corps' need to reorganize. The<BR>
Corps coordinated its reorganization plans with<BR>
Congress. It also testified before both the House<BR>
and Senate authorization and appropriation<BR>
committees on the need for a comprehensive<BR>
reorganization. In November 1992, the Corps<BR>
submitted a reorganization plan to Congress. The<BR>
fiscal year 1993 appropriations bill included $5<BR>
million and transfer authority for another $7<BR>
million to reorganize the Corps' divisions and<BR>
headquarters. However, the fiscal year 1993 Energy<BR>
and Water Development Appropriations Act prohibited<BR>
closing any district office or changing any district<BR>
function.6<BR>

<P>In addition to changing its organizational<BR>
structure, the Corps' reorganization plan proposes<BR>
consolidation of some functions, elimination of<BR>
several reviews, and other process streamlining to<BR>
achieve management efficiencies and substantial<BR>
savings. Moreover, more  than 37 actions were<BR>
identified to remove redundancy, improve <BR>
efficiency, and reduce headquarters costs. Some of<BR>
these  headquartersactions can be implemented<BR>
independent of the Corps-wide  reorganization plan.<BR>
 <BR>
 The current reorganization plan recommended by the<BR>
Corps would:<BR>

<P>~ reduce the number of division offices from<BR>
  11 to six;<BR>

<P>~ retain all district offices;<BR>

<P>~ enhance the Corps' competency and cost-effectiveness by<BR>
  consolidating technical and support functions;<BR>

<P>~ create 15 civil works technical centers within<BR>
  existing districts to consolidate some technical<BR>
  functions and provide planning, design, real estate,<BR>
  and review expertise;<BR>

<P>~ create five administrative centers to<BR>
  consolidate administration;<BR>

<P>~ create a national financial and accounting<BR>
  center to consolidate financial and accounting<BR>
  functions; and <BR>

<P>~ collocate military project construction<BR>
  management and design with 10 of the 15 civil works<BR>
  technical centers.<BR>

<P>Recently, the Corps has prepared two reorganization<BR>
plans. The first plan was rejected by Congress in<BR>
1991, and the second plan is pending review by the<BR>
new administration. Congress is clearly opposed to<BR>
changes in district structure, as evidenced by the<BR>
House version of the fiscal year1994 Energy and<BR>
Water Development Appropriations Act. Continued<BR>
uncertainty regarding reorganization is<BR>
understandably having an adverse impact on Corps'<BR>
employees. As a result, the Corps is losing valuable<BR>
employees, and the reorganization question needs to<BR>
be answered quickly.7<BR>

<P>
<P>Actions<BR>
*******<BR>

<P>1. The administration and the Corps should develop<BR>
and implement a reorganization to accomplish<BR>
appropriate streamlining and right-sizing.<BR>

<P>The administration, Congress, and the Corps should<BR>
work cooperatively to ensure the timely approval of<BR>
an agreed-uponreorganization plan. The Corps, using<BR>
previously appropriated funds for reorganization,<BR>
should proceed immediately to implement the<BR>
division-level portions of the plan. This includes<BR>
establishment of a central review center to<BR>
consolidate the headquarters and division policy<BR>
review and transfer of technical review functions<BR>
from divisions to districts. <BR>

<P>2. The Corps should seek authority to close or<BR>
relocate district or division offices based on<BR>
mission, programs, workload, and resource needs.<BR>

<P>The Corps should recommend a plan for its<BR>
district-level and division-level structures that<BR>
includes public and congressional input on the<BR>
Corps' mission, programs, workload, resource needs,<BR>
and other planning criteria.3. Maximize the use of<BR>
Corps' planning, engineering, and contract<BR>
management capabilities in support of other federal<BR>
agency programs.<BR>

<P>
<P> The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works)<BR>
and the Chief of  Engineers should work with other<BR>
federal agencies and theOffice of  Management and<BR>
Budget (OMB) to increase the use of Corps resources, <BR>
particularly in construction design and management.<BR>
 <BR>
Implications<BR>
************<BR>

<P>Congressional concerns limit the Corps' ability to<BR>
close or relocate district offices. However, the<BR>
reorganization plan will not only save money but<BR>
also improve customer service. The plan would allow<BR>
the Corps to apply a managed approach to achieving<BR>
necessary reductions.<BR>

<P>Fiscal Impact<BR>
*************<BR>

<P>The cost to implement all of the changes contained<BR>
in the Corps' reorganization plan is estimated at<BR>
$215 million. After full implementation, annual<BR>
savings are estimated to be $92 million from reduced<BR>
staffing.8 The savings stated in the November 1992<BR>
plan were adjusted to reflect current Corps staffing<BR>
and the President's initiatives to reduce the<BR>
government workforce and administrative reductions.<BR>
Implementation of only selected portions of the plan<BR>
could be accomplished at lower cost, but this would<BR>
be accompanied by reduced savings.<BR>

<P>8. This follows the same cost and FTE estimating<BR>
procedures as used in the Corps' November 1992<BR>
Reorganization Plan. Dollar entries are incremental,<BR>
not cumulative. The civil works FTE base has been<BR>
adjusted downward by 500 FTE since the end of fiscal<BR>
year 1991 and an additional adjustment downward by<BR>
1,100 FTE to reflect the President's initiatives to<BR>
reduce the government workforce. Thus, net<BR>
reductions would equal 1,000 FTEs versus 2,600 FTEs,<BR>
and annual dollar savings $47 million per year<BR>
versus $115 million per year. Implementation costs<BR>
of $108 million are assumed unchanged. This also<BR>
assumes that the reorganization plan will, at a<BR>
minimum, achieve the savings contained in the Corps'<BR>
Reorganization Plan of November 1992 as adjusted.<BR>

 *****************<BR>
 Executive Summary<BR>
 *****************<BR>
 <BR>
 The Commerce Department celebrates its 80th birthday as a cabinet-<BR>
 level department in 1993. During its 80-year history, the department <BR>
 has grown to employ more than 36,000 people in 13 major operating <BR>
 units with a fiscal year 1993 budget of approximately $3 billion. <BR>
 Despite this growth, the Commerce Department still remains the <BR>
 smallest cabinet-level department in terms of budget.<BR>
 <BR>
 The department is, in some respects, a holding company composed of <BR>
 vastly different agencies, each pursuing disparate missions. The <BR>
 department's 13 operating units have five primary missions: <BR>
 increasing business and trade promotion; improving the nation's <BR>
 technological competitiveness; fostering environmental stewardship; <BR>
 improving economic development; and compiling, analyzing and <BR>
 disseminating vital national statistical information. <BR>
 <BR>
 The National Performance Review (NPR) analysis of the Department of <BR>
 Commerce's Economic Development Administration and other economic <BR>
 development programs from other agencies revealed that community and <BR>
 regional development efforts are characterized by fragmentation, poor <BR>
 quality, and bureaucratization. <BR>
 <BR>
 To overcome these shortcomings, NPR recommends that the President <BR>
 create a Federal Coordinating Council for Economic Development <BR>
 (FCCED). FCCED would consist of the affected cabinet officers and <BR>
 would be responsible for developing a government-wide strategic plan <BR>
 and unified budget for carrying out federal economic and regional <BR>
 development programs.<BR>
 <BR>
 The export of U.S. goods and services overseas helps to create jobs <BR>
 at home and ensures that American businesses remain competitive in <BR>
 the global marketplace. <BR>
 <BR>
 The NPR recommends that the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee be <BR>
 given broader authority to create performance measures for use in <BR>
 evaluating and funding the approximately 150 federal export promotion <BR>
 programs, and begin a pilot program to integrate the domestic field <BR>
 offices of federal agencies that provide export counseling and <BR>
 finance services. Also, the NPR recommends that the Foreign Service <BR>
 Officers Corps be leveraged to increase the Foreign Commercial <BR>
 Service, making it more competitive with the commercial services of <BR>
 other industrialized nations.<BR>
 <BR>
 U.S. businesses continue to lose potential export opportunities due <BR>
 to a cumbersome and outdated export licensing policy. The NPR <BR>
 recommends that the review, decision and dispute resolution system <BR>
 for export licensing be reformed to decrease jurisdic-tional disputes <BR>
 between the agencies involved in this policy area. If implemented, <BR>
 this change could help generate billions in new exports, create <BR>
 thousands of new jobs annually and help ensure U.S. competitiveness.<BR>
 <BR>
 Commerce must break the decade-long deadlock on the role and <BR>
 responsibility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric <BR>
 Administration's (NOAA) fleet. The NPR recommends an experiment with <BR>
 a program of public/private sector competition.The NPR also <BR>
 recommends that the department work with Congress and the fishing <BR>
 industry to rebuild marine fisheries and improve economic health of <BR>
 the nation's publicly owned and privately used continental shelf <BR>
 fishery resources.<BR>
 <BR>
 Timely and effective dissemination of critical trade, economic, and <BR>
 statistical information to other government agencies and the private <BR>
 sector is another area in which Commerce must take a government-wide <BR>
 lead. The NPR recommends that the Secretary support the expansion of <BR>
 the contents of the National Trade Data Bank and develop an active <BR>
 marketing campaign to explain its value to American exporters. Com-<BR>
 merce should also establish a Manufacturing Technology Data Bank to <BR>
 disseminate critical, precompetitive, government-funded technology <BR>
 data to U.S. businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Opportunities exist to dramatically reduce the reporting burden <BR>
 placed on American businesses by federal statistical agencies. <BR>
 Commerce, in consultation with these other federal agencies, should <BR>
 institute widespread electronic data gathering from U.S. businesses, <BR>
 eliminate duplicative requests, and begin shifting reporting <BR>
 schedules to be more in line with common business practices. <BR>
 Implementing these recommendations can save business owners tens of <BR>
 millions of dollars.<BR>
 <BR>
 The NPR recommends that NOAA, the National Aeronautics and Space <BR>
 Administration, and the Department of Defense establish a single, <BR>
 coordinated polar satellite program, as opposed to the current plan <BR>
 for three systems. <BR>
 <BR>
 The NPR recognizes that access to credit for minority businesses is a <BR>
 persistent national problem and recommends that the Department of <BR>
 Commerce, in cooperation with the Small Business Administration, <BR>
 increase its efforts to expand credit access for minority small <BR>
 business.<BR>
 <BR>
 The NPR also recommends that Commerce work with the Office of <BR>
 Management and Budget and the Justice Department to remove the <BR>
 current prohibition on the use of sampling in decennial censuses to <BR>
 determine the apportionment of Congress. Significant savings will be <BR>
 achieved in the 2000 decennial if this restriction is removed.<BR>
 <BR>
 Commerce has begun an internal reinvention program. This effort is <BR>
 strongly supported by Secretary Brown. The internal Commerce effort <BR>
 consists of four main phases. First is the idea-generation process. <BR>
 So far, nearly 8,000 reinvention ideas have been received from <BR>
 Commerce employees.<BR>
 <BR>
 Shortly after the idea-generation process, five cross-cutting <BR>
 programmatic teams were formed to develop recommendations in trade, <BR>
 economic stimulus, environmental services and research, information, <BR>
 and technology. The third source of new ideas is a series of focus <BR>
 group meetings in which nearly 300 managers and employees have <BR>
 participated. Commerce's fourth reinvention phase is the <BR>
 establishment of five reinvention laboratories. Many additional <BR>
 recommendations are being evaluated by Commerce's internal review.<BR>
 <BR>
 The overall savings and revenues from these recommendations are <BR>
 estimated at $675 million over the five-year period fiscal year 1995 <BR>
 through 1999.<BR>

         Regional Development Efforts<BR>

 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 At least seven federal programs assist states and localities with <BR>
 economic and regional development.(1) The major programs are the <BR>
 Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration, the <BR>
 Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Administration and <BR>
 Rural Electrification Administration and the Department of Housing <BR>
 and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant Program. <BR>
 Smaller development programs are operated by the Department of <BR>
 Defense, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Appalachian Regional <BR>
 Commission.<BR>
 <BR>
 These economic and regional development efforts are characterized by <BR>
 fragmentation, poor quality, and excessive bureaucracy. In the <BR>
 absence of a coordinated system that integrates assistance, states <BR>
 and communities must turn to an assortment of different agencies and <BR>
 programs. This dispersion of effort makes it difficult for <BR>
 communities to obtain assistance, limits the development of critical <BR>
 knowledge, hinders organization, and limits funding for national <BR>
 efforts. Moreover, many federal programs are poorly run, with <BR>
 communities facing significant delays in receiving assistance. <BR>
 Finally, there is no coherent federal policy concerning regional <BR>
 development and community dislocation. Piecemeal, after-the-fact <BR>
 responses are the norm.<BR>

 <BR>
 The Economic Development Agency (EDA) was established in 1965 to aid <BR>
 economically distressed regions; it soon became the &quot;flagship&quot; <BR>
 federal agency for regional economic development. EDA principally <BR>
 funds local public works projects (such as industrial parks, access <BR>
 roads, and sewer lines), to enable communities to attract industry <BR>
 from other areas. The agency also provides grants to communities <BR>
 facing sudden economic distress and funds technical assistance and <BR>
 economic research. Funding rose until the early 1980s, when the <BR>
 Reagan and Bush administrations tried to eliminate the program. The <BR>
 program's current budget is $254 million for fiscal 1994, down from <BR>
 $830 million in 1980 (in 1992 dollars).<BR>
 <BR>
 Significant changes in the economic development environment during <BR>
 the 1980s suggest that EDA's economic development role (as well as <BR>
 that of other federal programs) needs to be fundamentally rethought.<BR>
 <BR>
 First, states and localities now have significantly greater economic <BR>
 development capabilities than they did when EDA was established . As <BR>
 a result, EDA's &quot;retail&quot; approach to economic development, with its <BR>
 49 field offices, six regional offices, and 150-person national <BR>
 office, now duplicates many state and local efforts. Moreover, the <BR>
 creation or expansion of state and other federal programs means that <BR>
 EDA is no longer the flagship agency for regional economic <BR>
 development in the U.S.<BR>
 <BR>
 Second, EDA's traditional approach to economic development (which <BR>
 focuses on public works and other infrastructure development) has not <BR>
 shifted sufficiently to focus on newer efforts such as technology <BR>
 centers, entrepreneurial development, and manufacturing <BR>
 modernization.(2) This is in part because EDA funds are divided into <BR>
 several titles, the largest being Title 1 for public works and <BR>
 infrastructure.<BR>
 <BR>
 Finally, EDA's uncertain political support has contributed to a <BR>
 variety of problems, including reduced morale, lower staff quality, <BR>
 poor operation and administration of programs, lengthy and <BR>
 complicated grant approval procedures, and the pursuit of low-risk <BR>
 policies. Grant applications must go through four levels of review: <BR>
 an informal review at the Economic Development Representative field <BR>
 level, a formal review at the regional level, and two final reviews <BR>
 at the national office.(3) As a result, the EDA approval process is <BR>
 slower than it should be.<BR>

 Department of Agriculture <BR>
 *************************<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Rural Development Agency <BR>
 (RDA), a recently reconfigured agency formed by the consolidation of <BR>
 several existing USDA programs, was created to aid in the development <BR>
 of rural communities. RDA's programs can be divided into three <BR>
 categories: Water and Waste Disposal, Business and Industry, and <BR>
 Community Facilities. RDA provides technical assistance and funding <BR>
 through grants and loans. Water and Waste Disposal funds are <BR>
 available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, <BR>
 special purpose districts, Indian tribes, and non-profit <BR>
 corporations.<BR>
 <BR>
 Funding includes support for technical assistance and training <BR>
 grants. RDA provides business and industry assistance through loan <BR>
 guarantees and loans distributed through intermediaries, such as <BR>
 state and local government and nonprofit organizations. Loan <BR>
 guarantees are designed to bolster the local private credit market. <BR>
 Indirect RDA loans are supposed to go to business facilities and <BR>
 community development. Community Facilities funds are for the purpose <BR>
 of improving essential services in rural areas. Eligibility is the <BR>
 same as for Waste Disposal.<BR>
 <BR>
 As stated, RDA makes grants, direct loans, indirect loans (through <BR>
 cities, states, and nonprofits), and also guarantees loans. In fiscal <BR>
 year 1994, out of a total budget appropriation of $913 million, RDA <BR>
 received budget authority of $264 million for loan levels of $1.85 <BR>
 billion. The money for direct loans, usually 30-year, long-term <BR>
 loans, is borrowed from the Treasury Department. Indirect loans, <BR>
 provided through state and local government, are paid back to RDA by <BR>
 the state and local governments themselves. Guarantees are also <BR>
 provided to commercial banks and work similarly to guaranteed student <BR>
 loans.<BR>
 <BR>
 Many of RDA's programs provide emergency assistance for events such <BR>
 as tropical storms, earthquakes, or flooding. The Federal Emergency <BR>
 Management Agency is best equipped to handle these functions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was created under the <BR>
 New Deal as part of a general program of unemployment relief, with <BR>
 the goal of providing electricity service to the countryside. REA has <BR>
 continued to provide financing for the provision of electric service; <BR>
 in 1950, it began to provide financing for telephone service as well. <BR>
 In addition, in 1989 REA initiated the Rural Economic Development <BR>
 Program, which provides loans for job creation in rural areas.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Clinton administration has already proposed virtually eliminating <BR>
 REA's low-interest loan program for electric cooperatives and <BR>
 telephone companies, which would save an estimated $374 million over <BR>
 four years.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Department of Housing and Urban Development<BR>
 *******************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers the <BR>
 Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). CDBG is broken up <BR>
 into entitlement and non-entitlement sections. Both programs have the <BR>
 primary objective of developing viable communities by providing <BR>
 decent housing and expanding economic opportunities, principally for <BR>
 low- and moderate-income persons. Seventy percent of CDBG <BR>
 appropriations are direct entitlements to large metropolitan cities <BR>
 and urban counties. Non-entitlement spending, otherwise known as the <BR>
 Small Cities Program, is slightly less than 30 percent of CDBG <BR>
 appropriations and is appropriated to states who then make grants to <BR>
 small local governments to carry out development activities.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Other Federal Programs<BR>
 **********************<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) <BR>
 assists communities in planning for defense conversion. However, <BR>
 because federal support for the implementation of these plans comes <BR>
 from different agencies, particularly EDA, it is difficult to develop <BR>
 coordinated defense conversion strategies.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is responsible for the <BR>
 maintenance and management of a broad array of public lands, physical <BR>
 facilities and natural resources. In addition, it directly supports <BR>
 economic development through business assistance, economic planning, <BR>
 education, environmental planning, agriculture assistance, tourism <BR>
 promotion, and minority business development.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a federal-state <BR>
 government agency concerned with the economic, physical, and social <BR>
 development of the 13-state Appalachian region. ARC's comprehensive <BR>
 goals are to improve the health and job skills of the people of <BR>
 Appalachia. ARC concentrates on community and industrial development <BR>
 as well as housing, education, health, and tourism.<BR>
 <BR>
 Both TVA and ARC were created at a time when state capacities were <BR>
 limited. However, state capacities are much greater now. The nation <BR>
 no longer needs area-specific development commissions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The federal government no longer effectively guides and supports <BR>
 regional development. For example, the proliferation of federal <BR>
 programs supporting economic development makes it difficult for <BR>
 states and localities to obtain assistance easily. Knowing where to <BR>
 look and how to apply can be challenging for the most knowledgeable <BR>
 state or local government official. When governments need assistance <BR>
 in more than one area (e.g., defense conversion, rural development, <BR>
 or business assistance), the maze becomes even more complex. Federal <BR>
 economic and regional development programs do not operate as one-stop <BR>
 shops. This makes it difficult for the federal government to focus <BR>
 its resources on pressing problems such as defense conversion, for <BR>
 which a number of agencies provide help.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition, the lack of innovation and consistency in federal policy <BR>
 has contributed to the ineffectiveness of many state and local <BR>
 economic development programs. For example, much of the money states <BR>
 now spend on economic and regional development is for &quot;zero-sum&quot; <BR>
 industrial recruitment activities. Individual states may benefit from <BR>
 industrial recruitment activities, but when one state wins another <BR>
 loses. No net benefit accrues to the nation as a whole because <BR>
 business investment is not increasing; it is simply being shifted <BR>
 among regions.<BR>
 <BR>
 Moreover, much of this money subsidizes foreign firms that have <BR>
 already decided to locate branch plants in the United States. For <BR>
 example, states and cities gave more than $1 billion to foreign <BR>
 automobile firms between 1978 and 1992.(4) <BR>
 <BR>
 Federal policy has not changed to meet modern economic realities; <BR>
 instead it has persisted in a fragmented, programmatic approach to <BR>
 development. These actions have hindered, rather than fostered, a <BR>
 consistent and integrated federal, state, and local effort toward <BR>
 regional development.<BR>
 <BR>
 Regional economic distress must be a federal priority if the nation <BR>
 is to manage economic structural change effectively. At least two <BR>
 reasons underlie this need. First, an uneven national pattern of <BR>
 regional growth and decline is inefficient and costly. In some <BR>
 places, resources sit idle and under-used, while others suffer from <BR>
 the negative effects of growth, such as congestion and high costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 This less-than-optimal use of public and private resources reduces <BR>
 the efficiency not only of declining communities, but of the U.S . <BR>
 economy as a whole.<BR>
 <BR>
 Second, community economic decline imposes social, psychological, and <BR>
 physical distress on area residents. Caught in a downward spiral, <BR>
 communities may find it impossible to regain former levels of <BR>
 prosperity unless they receive economic assistance. Federal support <BR>
 can help these communities and regions stem further decline and build <BR>
 a solid base for recovery.<BR>
 <BR>
 Although state and local government efforts have made significant <BR>
 strides in addressing local economic concerns, they are not an <BR>
 adequate replacement for a strong federal presence, particularly <BR>
 given today's economic realities of increased international <BR>
 competition and rapid changes in technology. The U.S. government <BR>
 should revitalize its commitment to regional economic development in <BR>
 a manner that guides and supports state and local efforts to achieve <BR>
 the best possible practices and results.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 The President should create a Federal Coordinating Council for <BR>
 Economic Development (FCCED).<BR>
 <BR>
 The FCCED would consist of the cabinet officers or directors of the <BR>
 affected agencies (i.e., Department of Commerce, Department of <BR>
 Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Appalachian <BR>
 Regional Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority) or their <BR>
 representatives.<BR>
 <BR>
 The FCCED would provide a unifying framework to coordinate the <BR>
 economic and regional development activities of the U.S. government, <BR>
 and to develop a governmentwide strategic plan and unified budget for <BR>
 carrying out federal economic and regional development programs. The <BR>
 FCCED would:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Coordinate federal economic development policies and programs;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Provide a central source of information for states and localities <BR>
 on federal economic development programs;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Coordinate official economic development efforts to ensure better <BR>
 delivery of these services to the public;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Prevent unnecessary duplication in federal economic and regional <BR>
 development activities;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Assess the appropriate levels and allocation of resources among <BR>
 agencies in support of economic and regional development and provide <BR>
 recommendations to the President based on its assessment; and<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Carry out such other duties as are deemed to be consistent with <BR>
 the purposes of the FCCED.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The federal government currently possesses a broad menu of economic <BR>
 and regional development programs but is not adequately organized or <BR>
 coordinated to meet the needs of the states and local communities. <BR>
 This recommendation would help ensure that the needs of states and <BR>
 local communities would be better met and that, ultimately, more jobs <BR>
 would be created. Further, a stronger and more effective federal-<BR>
 state relationship on economic development issues would be <BR>
 established.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 This recommendation is budget neutral; however, the coordination of <BR>
 the delivery of economic and regional development services and a <BR>
 clearer delineation of agency roles should produce savings.<BR>

 DOC02:  Provide Better Coordination to Refocus<BR>
         and Leverage Federal Export Promotion<BR>
 **********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 Unlike most of our economic competitors, the United States does not <BR>
 possess an export strategy or an export infrastructure capable of <BR>
 assisting U.S. businesses interested in pursuing global <BR>
 opportunities.(1) Export programs are fragmented among 19 federal <BR>
 agencies, 10 of which possess substantial export promotion budgets. <BR>
 The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, State, Energy, and <BR>
 Interior; the Agency for International Development; the Export-Import <BR>
 Bank; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Overseas <BR>
 Private Investment Corporation; the Small Business Administration; <BR>
 and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency all play major roles. <BR>
 Partially as a result of this fragmentation, the U.S. continues to <BR>
 lag far behind other industrialized nations in exports as a percent <BR>
 of Gross Domestic Product.(2)<BR>
 <BR>
 The export of U.S. manufactured goods helps U.S. industries remain <BR>
 competitive in the global marketplace and create jobs at home. The <BR>
 Department of Commerce estimates that every additional billion <BR>
 dollars of U.S. exports creates 20,000 new jobs. In fact, most of the <BR>
 growth of the U.S. economy over the past few years is directly <BR>
 attributable to exports, as is almost all growth in America's high-<BR>
 wage manufacturing sectors.(3)<BR>
 <BR>
 Today, 14 million U.S. jobs are supported through exports.(4) <BR>
 Unfortunately, despite the vast number of manufacturing companies <BR>
 that could compete in the global marketplace, only 2 percent of U.S. <BR>
 businesses account for 85 percent of U.S. exports.(5) These companies <BR>
 are primarily large U.S. multinational corporations that have the <BR>
 resources to compete internationally. Census Bureau figures show that <BR>
 the top 10,000 exporters are responsible for 96 percent of U.S. <BR>
 exports, while the other 94,000 corporations account for the rest <BR>
 .(6) Even among the top exporters, only 5,000 U.S. companies have <BR>
 annual export sales of more than $5 million.(7) Most shipments, 72 <BR>
 per- cent, are worth less than $20,000.(8)<BR>
 <BR>
 Thousands of small and medium-sized manufacturing firms recognize <BR>
 that their products are internationally competitive, but due to high <BR>
 transaction costs and sometimes a lack of information, they are <BR>
 unable to tap into new markets. In this context the United States has <BR>
 been referred to as the &quot;world's biggest export underachiever.&quot; (9) <BR>
 In an effort to rectify this problem, the government operates more <BR>
 than 150 programs designed to assist American businesses sell their <BR>
 manufactured goods overseas. So far, this effort has not been <BR>
 successful for a number of reasons.<BR>
 <BR>
 Historically, the United States has focused federal export program <BR>
 dollars on the promotion of agricultural products. In 1982, the U.S. <BR>
 exported more than $36 billion worth of agricultural goods, which <BR>
 represented 17 percent of all U.S. exports.(10) By 1992, after <BR>
 another decade in which the federal government poured billions more <BR>
 into agricultural export programs, U.S. agricultural exports had <BR>
 actually decreased to 10 percent of total U.S. exports, while the <BR>
 share of machinery and other manufactured goods exported showed a <BR>
 steady increase.(11) Commerce Department figures indicate that of the <BR>
 7.2 million jobs supported by exports in 1990, 46 percent were in the <BR>
 manufacturing sector, while 8 percent were in the agricultural <BR>
 sector.(12) Yet in 1991, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported <BR>
 that, although agricultural products accounted for only a small <BR>
 percentage of overall U.S. exports, the Department of Agriculture <BR>
 continued to receive approximately 70 percent of the $2.7 billion <BR>
 federal export promotion budget.(13)<BR>
 <BR>
 This disparity has had a detrimental effect on other federal export <BR>
 promotion programs. Compared to the Japanese and most of our major <BR>
 European trading partners, the U.S. spends the least on helping its <BR>
 businesses compete internationally. For every billion dollars of <BR>
 manufactured goods exported overseas, the U.S. spent 59 cents, while <BR>
 France spent $1.99 and Italy spent $1.71 per billion.(14) In terms of <BR>
 human resources devoted to assisting U.S. business with trade lead <BR>
 information, advocacy, and other assistance overseas, the U.S. record <BR>
 is also poor.<BR>
 <BR>
 The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&amp;FCS), part of the <BR>
 Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA), is <BR>
 the leading government agency devoted to helping U.S. businesses <BR>
 promote themselves internationally. Despite presences in 70 nations <BR>
 and 47 district offices in the United States, the US&amp;FCS has been <BR>
 continually criticized for not doing enough to promote U.S. business <BR>
 interests. Critics of the US&amp;FCS argue that it should be abolished <BR>
 because federal employees do not adequately understand the needs of <BR>
 business people. Others maintain that, with only 200 US&amp;FCS officers <BR>
 spread throughout the world--an average of less than two people per <BR>
 post--the US&amp;FCS has never had a chance to be effective. In <BR>
 comparison, the Japanese, through the Japan Export Trading <BR>
 Organization (JETRO), field more than 150 trade experts in the United <BR>
 States. The U.S. currently has 15 US&amp;FCS officers and 44 Foreign <BR>
 Service Nationals stationed in Japan.(15)<BR>
 <BR>
 The federal government's inability to provide for a stronger overseas <BR>
 presence has created a leadership vacuum that state governments are <BR>
 attempting to fill. State trade offices overseas have proliferated. <BR>
 The National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA) <BR>
 reports that in 1990, state governments spent more than $90 million <BR>
 annually on international economic activities, more than four times <BR>
 what they had spent in 1984.(16) About one-third of these funds, $33 <BR>
 million, was spent to support 163 state-run foreign office <BR>
 locations.(17) Even more disconcerting than the total number is the <BR>
 fact that only nine of these state offices were located in cities <BR>
 without a US&amp;FCS office, and that at least seven offices were <BR>
 partially funded by private donations.(18)<BR>
 <BR>
 Although these state offices were initially created to attract <BR>
 foreign investment, today they devote an average of only 30 percent <BR>
 of their time to that task. In an attempt to fill the void created by <BR>
 inadequate federal support and leadership, the states have continued <BR>
 to attempt to bolster their domestic industries by creating programs <BR>
 to duplicate what the US&amp;FCS was mandated to do.<BR>
 <BR>
 Duplication of effort is endemic, not only in the relationship <BR>
 between the states and the US&amp;FCS, but also among other domestic <BR>
 federal export promotion programs. Currently, three agencies share <BR>
 primary responsibility for delivering export counseling and finance <BR>
 services. The Export-Import Bank is responsible for helping <BR>
 businesses finance their exports; the Small Business Administration <BR>
 (SBA) helps small businesses assess their exporting capabilities and <BR>
 provides financing assistance; and the Department of Commerce, <BR>
 through the domestic offices of the US&amp;FCS, provides small and <BR>
 medium-sized U.S. businesses with counseling, trade mission, and <BR>
 trade lead information.<BR>
 <BR>
 According to critics, trade finance services, especially financial <BR>
 advice and information, are not disseminated efficiently because the <BR>
 Export-Import Bank has a small staff and is not able to market its <BR>
 services. At the same time, the SBA, with its huge domestic network <BR>
 of field offices, has not made the Export Revolving Line of Credit a <BR>
 priority.(19) Export counseling, primarily the responsibility of the <BR>
 regional and district offices of the US&amp;FCS, is in some cases <BR>
 duplicated by SBA's field structure and local state economic <BR>
 development agencies.(20) Essentially, each of these agencies <BR>
 attempts to service overlapping segments of the same group of <BR>
 customers instead of presenting a coordinated effort.<BR>
 <BR>
 The duplication and fragmentation found within the entire federal <BR>
 export bureaucracy is mirrored within the Commerce Department itself. <BR>
 Commerce should strive to ensure that its own ITA does as much as <BR>
 possible to promote the sale of manufactured goods.<BR>
 <BR>
 A business that contacts the Department of Commerce directly may <BR>
 become lost within the maze of ITA subdivisions. Composed of the <BR>
 US&amp;FCS, International Economic Policy (IEP), Trade Development (TD), <BR>
 and Import Administration bureaus, ITA's mission is to promote U.S. <BR>
 industrial exports. According to a recent Commerce Department <BR>
 Inspector General's report, ITA's organizational structure encourages <BR>
 overlap.(21) It allows each division to help promote exports, <BR>
 diffusing responsibility for this task and leading to mission <BR>
 confusion among ITA employees, &quot;turf&quot; battles between divisions, and <BR>
 confusion among customers. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the <BR>
 country desk officers and analysts within IEP who focus on specific <BR>
 countries, are out of necessity also becoming industry experts--the <BR>
 role of TD analysts--because of the lack of communication among the <BR>
 divisions.<BR>
 <BR>
 In an attempt to solve the problems of federal export promotion <BR>
 program duplication and resource allocation, the Trade Promotion <BR>
 Coordinating Committee (TPCC) was created by executive order in 1990. <BR>
 Its mandate was to define areas of overlap and streamline federal <BR>
 export promotion activities. The Bush Administration did very little <BR>
 with the TPCC. By 1992, it became clear that the TPCC needed more <BR>
 power to fulfill its mandate, and the committee received additional <BR>
 statutory authority under the Export Enhancement Act of 1992 .<BR>
 <BR>
 The TPCC will present a report to Congress on September 30, 1993, <BR>
 outlining a national strategy for export promotion, proposing ideas <BR>
 for eliminating program duplication, and developing a unified budget <BR>
 for export promotion activities. Proponents of the TPCC believe that <BR>
 it will become an effective vehicle to enhance and coordinate the <BR>
 fragmented federal export promotion effort.<BR>
 <BR>
 In sum, the federal government is not using its resources in an <BR>
 efficient manner to meet the needs of small and medium-sized <BR>
 businesses interested in exporting their products overseas. The lack <BR>
 of federal coordination and leadership has led to duplicated efforts <BR>
 between federal agencies and state governments and has caused <BR>
 confusion among customers. Although export promotion programs cannot <BR>
 by themselves alter the U.S. trade imbalance, which is influenced by <BR>
 macroeconomic and financial policies, the federal government can <BR>
 provide businesses with technical and representational assistance as <BR>
 well as export financing. If small and medium-sized U.S. businesses <BR>
 are to compete in the global marketplace, the federal government must <BR>
 begin to reallocate its resources to sectors that have clearly shown <BR>
 growth potential while it works to make its services more accessible <BR>
 to its clients.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The President should issue an Executive Order to grant the TPCC <BR>
 broader authority to control federal export promotion efforts.<BR>
 <BR>
 The TPCC should be given additional authority to create performance <BR>
 measurements and goals and to use them for program evaluation across <BR>
 all federal export promotion programs. This structure would give the <BR>
 TPCC the power to move beyond its current role of coordinator and <BR>
 become a stronger mechanism for the Department of Commerce to <BR>
 facilitate interagency communication and cooperation. The TPCC should <BR>
 work closely with the National Economic Council (NEC), which would <BR>
 oversee the resource reallocation process for federal export <BR>
 promotion resources to be incorporated into the Office of Management <BR>
 and Budget's (OMB) annual budget process. The NEC would use TPCC's <BR>
 program evaluation results to oversee the creation and implementation <BR>
 of unified export promotion budget.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The TPCC should establish a pilot program to physically integrate <BR>
 the domestic field offices of federal agencies that provide export <BR>
 counseling and finance services.<BR>
 <BR>
 In 12 U.S. cities, Department of Commerce US&amp;FCS district officials <BR>
 are located in the same building with Small Business Administration <BR>
 loan officers. Integrating these international trade counselors with <BR>
 financial experts will eliminate the need for prospective U .S. <BR>
 exporters to visit multiple government offices to get the information <BR>
 they need. This pilot program should last for at least one year, <BR>
 after which time a report should be prepared for the Secretary of <BR>
 Commerce (as chair of the TPCC) outlining the program's <BR>
 effectiveness.<BR>
 <BR>
 This proposal to create &quot;one-stop shops&quot; is consistent with the <BR>
 strategic vision currently being developed by the TPCC. That vision <BR>
 provides for a new, more focused domestic Commerce Department program <BR>
 as part of a consistent national approach in which, over time, the <BR>
 federal government will shift from providing export services directly <BR>
 to the client to providing the means and support to state and local <BR>
 governments, as well as the private sector, to do the same. This will <BR>
 help to facilitate a better public-private partnership.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. A Recruiting Program should be established through the TPCC to <BR>
 increase the Foreign Commercial Service Officer Corps.<BR>
 <BR>
 Compared to our major trading partners, the United States spends less <BR>
 and does less to assist new or potential exporters. To rectify this <BR>
 problem, Foreign Service officers from federal agencies whose <BR>
 missions have changed due to the end of the Cold War should be <BR>
 transferred or placed on long-term rotation to the overseas field <BR>
 posts of the US&amp;FCS. This would not increase government costs. A <BR>
 recruiting program should be created to transfer or rotate competent <BR>
 Foreign Service officers who are interested in business promotion <BR>
 from the Agency for International Development, the U.S. Information <BR>
 Agency, and potentially the State Department.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Department of Commerce should create regional and industry <BR>
 specific task forces within its ITA.<BR>
 <BR>
 ITA, currently composed of the US&amp;FCS, International Economic Policy <BR>
 (IEP) and Trade Development (TD) divisions, operates under a matrix <BR>
 structure that attempts to leverage country, industry, and export <BR>
 promotion expertise. Trade Development focuses on industry analysis; <BR>
 International Economic Policy provides country-specific information <BR>
 to businesses; and US&amp;FCS's mission is to lead the promotion of U.S. <BR>
 industry overseas. However, each division plays a part in ITA's <BR>
 overall trade promotion strategy.<BR>
 <BR>
 This kind of programmatic overlap has caused mission confusion within <BR>
 ITA. According to a recent Inspector General report and interviews <BR>
 conducted by the National Performance Review, the divisions are not <BR>
 working well together, and International Economic Policy country desk <BR>
 officers are becoming industry experts because of a lack of <BR>
 coordination between IEP and TD. ITA should create regionally or <BR>
 industry focused task forces that would bring country and industry <BR>
 analysts together to create a more synergistic and team-oriented <BR>
 environment within ITA.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The federal government currently possesses a broad menu of export <BR>
 promotion and financing programs but is not organized or coordinated <BR>
 to meet the needs of U.S. businesses. These recommendations will help <BR>
 ensure that those needs are met, potentially increasing both the <BR>
 volume of U.S. exports and the number of U.S. exporters. This in turn <BR>
 will help create new jobs in the United States and, by changing the <BR>
 way the government delivers these services to the private sector, a <BR>
 more effective public-private partnership.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations are budget- neutral, but the creation of &quot;one-<BR>
 stop shops,&quot; the coordination of export promotion service delivery, <BR>
 and the delineation of agency roles, should produce significant <BR>
 savings in terms of spending and personnel. According to a recent <BR>
 return-on-investment analysis study, which indicated that a US&amp;FCS <BR>
 dollar spent on export promotion returns $2.88 to the Treasury in <BR>
 additional personal and corporate income tax revenues, the expected <BR>
 annual return would be $29 million.(22) Furthermore, enhanced U.S. <BR>
 exports resulting from these actions will have a positive effect on <BR>
 U.S. trade balances.<BR>

 DOC03:  Reform the Federal Export Control<BR>
         System for Commercial Goods<BR>
 *****************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The current dual-use export control system used by the United States <BR>
 was created to protect national security by preventing <BR>
 technologically sensitive commercial goods from being used for <BR>
 military purposes by potential Soviet-bloc adversaries. In this <BR>
 regard, it is a relic of the Cold War and should be changed to <BR>
 reflect today's nonproliferation security challenges and to recognize <BR>
 the realities of competing in the global marketplace. Once an <BR>
 effective tool, the current system now hampers U.S. economic <BR>
 competitiveness and lacks the focus needed to ensure effective <BR>
 opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.<BR>
 <BR>
 Established in 1949 at the Cold War's beginning, the Export Control <BR>
 Act sought to maintain the technological superiority of the United <BR>
 States and NATO allies over the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc by <BR>
 denying them access to sophisticated commercial goods whose value-<BR>
 added technology could be used for military purposes.(1) To ensure <BR>
 that this strategy would be successful in stopping the flow of dual-<BR>
 use goods to Communist nations, the U.S. and NATO allies formed a <BR>
 multilateral control regime called COCOM (Coordinating Committee on <BR>
 Multilateral Export Controls) that sought to harmonize the <BR>
 international procedures and standards by which commercial and <BR>
 military items would be restricted.<BR>
 <BR>
 The late 1960s and 1970s saw a dramatic rise in the use of export <BR>
 controls to oppose human rights violations and terrorism and to help <BR>
 counter proliferation. By 1969, it had also become apparent that U.S. <BR>
 commercial competitiveness was being hampered by the export control <BR>
 process. The act was revised to decontrol commercial items readily <BR>
 available on the world market. This revision marked the first time <BR>
 the U.S. government officially recognized the necessity of balancing <BR>
 commercial and national security interests.(2) In response to the <BR>
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1979 revision of the act <BR>
 reflected increased East-West tensions and sought to strengthen <BR>
 controls on the export of commercial goods and technologies in order <BR>
 to maintain strategic and economic advantages.(3)<BR>
 <BR>
 The early part of the 1980s saw little change in the international <BR>
 political system, and thus little change in U.S. export control <BR>
 policies. However, by the mid-1980s, more multilateral agreements <BR>
 were created to control the proliferation of chemical, biological, <BR>
 and nuclear weapons, as well as missile technology. The creation of <BR>
 these agreements kept military concerns at the forefront of the U.S. <BR>
 export control policy and helped to institutionalize jurisdictional <BR>
 conflicts between the State Department, responsible under the Arms <BR>
 Export Control Act for restricting the flow of munitions abroad, and <BR>
 the Commerce Department, responsible under the Export Administration <BR>
 Act for restricting dual-use commercial goods. The State Department, <BR>
 through the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which <BR>
 fall under the Arms Export Control Act, also regulates about $6 <BR>
 billion in commercial arms sales annually. <BR>
 <BR>
 Industry sources recently complained to the State Department that, <BR>
 because it has not revised the ITAR since 1985, too many commercial <BR>
 items are controlled by the Munitions List, which specifies items <BR>
 that are primarily military in nature.(4) In fact, anecdotal evidence <BR>
 indicates that, in some instances, an exporter has received an export <BR>
 license from the Commerce Department only to learn at the border that <BR>
 the product also falls under the jurisdiction of the Munitions List <BR>
 and requires a State Department license. Currently, no formal system <BR>
 exists to resolve these jurisdictional disputes.<BR>
 <BR>
 The changing international situation has not yet prompted the <BR>
 government to create a revised set of export control policies that <BR>
 accurately reflect current international political and economic <BR>
 realities, including the fact that our security interests are <BR>
 increasingly dependent on global economic competitiveness.(5) Experts <BR>
 in both the private and public sectors agree that the current system <BR>
 is still based on high-volume, Cold War-era export controls. <BR>
 Previously, less than 20 percent of all applications were referred to <BR>
 other agencies for review. Such referrals were due primarily to <BR>
 concerns that these dual-use goods might be diverted to the Soviet <BR>
 Union for military purposes.<BR>
 <BR>
 Today, with the break-up of the Soviet Union, concerns about the <BR>
 worldwide proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have <BR>
 increased. More than 50 percent of all commercial applications <BR>
 currently received by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export <BR>
 Administration (BXA) are referred to other agencies due to end-user <BR>
 concerns and potential applicability to the construction of nuclear, <BR>
 chemical, and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.(6) As a <BR>
 result, export licensing processing times have doubled in the past <BR>
 two years. On average, referred cases require six times longer to <BR>
 process.(7) Such licenses are routinely delayed for three months and <BR>
 longer.<BR>
 <BR>
 One reason for these delays may be attributed to BXA's current <BR>
 organization and staffing patterns. BXA is equipped to meet Cold War-<BR>
 era needs and lacks certain technical skills and expertise that could <BR>
 help ensure speedy and accurate licensing decisions in the current <BR>
 exporting environment. At any rate, such delays can hurt companies' <BR>
 marketing strategies and create the impression that U.S. firms are <BR>
 unreliable suppliers. The current decentralized system, with its <BR>
 multiple licensing groups and unclear lines of authority, is baffling <BR>
 to many exporters. Industry sources have complained that export <BR>
 control regulations are confusing and that their responsibilities <BR>
 under new nonproliferation regulations require clarification.<BR>
 <BR>
 According to some estimates, up to 40 percent of all goods <BR>
 manufactured in the U.S. require a license before they can be <BR>
 exported.(8) The computer industry reports that 70 percent of all <BR>
 export licenses are for computer-related products.(9) Today, although <BR>
 millions of Americans owe their jobs to exports, the export control <BR>
 system has not been able to keep pace, causing the nation to lose <BR>
 sales, jobs, and tax revenue.(10)<BR>
 <BR>
 However, calculating the economic impact of such controls is <BR>
 difficult. Most studies do not include potential savings in defense <BR>
 spending due to continued U.S. technological advantages, or the costs <BR>
 of maintaining the present export control bureaucracy. Some industry <BR>
 groups believe that the U.S. loses up to $20 billion in sales <BR>
 annually because of these controls. According to industry estimates, <BR>
 this figure translates into as many as 400,000 potential U.S. <BR>
 jobs.(11)<BR>
 <BR>
 The current process has been described as &quot;a maze.&quot; When a company <BR>
 applies for a commercial export license, the interagency decision-<BR>
 making and referral process can allow the license to languish. At <BR>
 least five cabinet departments, five interagency working groups, the <BR>
 intelligence community, a number of interagency escalation groups, <BR>
 the National Security and National Economic Councils, and ultimately <BR>
 even the President may take part in the process.<BR>
 <BR>
 While the current system provides a time limit for agency review (as <BR>
 outlined in National Security Directive 53) that generally has worked <BR>
 efficiently, delays still occur, especially in the cases of <BR>
 precedent-setting license applications or jurisdictional conflicts <BR>
 between the Commerce Department's dual-use Control List and the State <BR>
 Department's Munitions List. Anecdotal evidence indicates that delays <BR>
 for some industries have become so acute that a number of U.S. <BR>
 multinational corporations have lawfully circumvented U.S. controls <BR>
 by shipping products through other COCOM countries such as Canada, <BR>
 saving two to three months in shipping time.<BR>
 <BR>
 Another problem for business has been that of timely control-list <BR>
 review. The Commerce Department's control list is reviewed every <BR>
 year, which may not be fast enough for the computer industry's short <BR>
 product life-cycles. Although it is regarded as an exceptional case, <BR>
 the current definition of &quot;super-computer&quot; restricts U.S. sales of <BR>
 widely used and available work-station computers. Restricting sales <BR>
 of these computers by U.S. firms, in a $10 billion industry expected <BR>
 to double in volume by 1997, only harms the nation's industrial <BR>
 competitiveness and economic security.(12)<BR>
 <BR>
 Although the U.S. coordinates most controls with its allies within <BR>
 existing multilateral agreements, it sometimes imposes unilateral <BR>
 controls either for national security or foreign policy reasons. <BR>
 While unilateral policies and controls sometimes are appropriate, <BR>
 long-term unilateral controls place U.S. firms at a significant <BR>
 disadvantage if they are not adopted multilaterally.(13) At present, <BR>
 the government does not perform any type of cost-benefit analysis to <BR>
 determine the effect of unilateral controls on the domestic economy <BR>
 in general or on specific industries.<BR>
 <BR>
 While export controls are still an essential element of U.S. national <BR>
 security policy, today's licensing process for commercial goods is <BR>
 widely criticized as cumbersome, bureaucratic, and confusing. Citing <BR>
 such concerns, 28 members of Congress recently sent President Clinton <BR>
 a letter urging the administration to change the current export <BR>
 control process. Although progress has been made, a 1991 National <BR>
 Academy of Sciences study also stated that the U.S. has &quot;. . . <BR>
 continued to drive the vehicle of export control policy while looking <BR>
 in the rearview mirror . . .&quot; and is basing its policy on &quot;. . . a <BR>
 set of assumptions about American economic, technical, and political <BR>
 influence that, while certainly true for the first two decades or so <BR>
 following the Second World War . . . simply no longer reflects <BR>
 prevailing global circumstances.&quot; (14)<BR>
 <BR>
 Clearly, the export control system must change to reflect current <BR>
 security priorities. Specifically, it should focus on non-<BR>
 proliferation concerns and balance this interest with U.S. economic <BR>
 priorities, by placing a high priority on the competitiveness of <BR>
 industries that contribute to U.S. national security. A new export <BR>
 control system should establish clear lines of accountability to <BR>
 resolve interagency disputes in a timely and effective manner. It <BR>
 also should clearly define agency roles and jurisdictions concerning <BR>
 control lists, and incorporate timely reviews of control lists. <BR>
 Lastly, while unilateral controls will always remain a valid foreign <BR>
 policy option, they should be imposed only under narrowly defined <BR>
 conditions.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The President should direct that the decision and dispute <BR>
 resolution system for export licensing applications be overhauled.<BR>
 <BR>
 This revision should provide clear accountability for the efficient <BR>
 functioning and management of the export licensing system. The <BR>
 Commerce and State Departments should work to streamline their <BR>
 internal licensing procedures and maintain responsibility for <BR>
 chairing the licensing committees and dispute resolution mechanisms <BR>
 under their purview. Processing times for dual-use licenses that have <BR>
 not been referred to other agencies should be completed within nine <BR>
 days. Processing times for more complicated applications requiring <BR>
 referrals should be reduced at least 25 percent, from 120 days to 90 <BR>
 days. Other agencies involved in the referral process (e.g. the <BR>
 Departments of State, Defense, and Energy) should be allowed no more <BR>
 than 20 days to review any pending license before being required to <BR>
 transfer the license to an interagency dispute resolution group for a <BR>
 decision.(15) Moreover, to help forge a better public-private <BR>
 partnership, each agency should designate a senior official as the <BR>
 principal contact person for exporters or other interested parties <BR>
 who wish to raise concerns about export control issues.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The President should direct the Secretaries of Commerce and State <BR>
 and the Assistants to the President for National Security Affairs and <BR>
 Economic Policy to create an effective jurisdictional dispute <BR>
 resolution process to reduce confusion caused by the overlap between <BR>
 the State Department's Munitions List and the Commerce Department's <BR>
 Control List.<BR>
 <BR>
 As illustrated above, the licensing jurisdictions of the Departments <BR>
 of State and Commerce overlap in a number of areas. While progress <BR>
 has been made toward limiting these areas of overlap, licensing <BR>
 jurisdictional questions still cause considerable confusion for <BR>
 exporters. Shipments occasionally are halted by the U.S. Customs <BR>
 Service due to uncertainties concerning the correct agency licensing <BR>
 requirements.<BR>
 <BR>
 A timely and effective dispute resolution process should be created <BR>
 through the NEC/NSC that would help to rationalize the two systems. <BR>
 This process also should include a study of the feasibility of &quot;one-<BR>
 stop shopping&quot; for export licensing, designation of one agency as the <BR>
 entry-point for all license applications, consolidation of <BR>
 administrative functions, and creation of a uniform application form. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. The President should direct that the control lists be examined to <BR>
 ensure that only the most sensitive items remain restricted. Further, <BR>
 controls should be implemented multilaterally whenever possible, and <BR>
 the NEC should conduct an assessment on unilateral controls.<BR>
 <BR>
 With the end of the Cold War, the existing export control list should <BR>
 be examined carefully to ensure that it reflects current security <BR>
 concerns. Controls on widely available goods such as work-station <BR>
 computers should be reviewed to ensure that continued controls serve <BR>
 modern security concerns.<BR>
 <BR>
 Because export controls can be effective only when they are imposed <BR>
 multilaterally by all supplier nations, unilateral controls should be <BR>
 avoided in all but the most pressing circumstances. Whenever <BR>
 unilateral controls are imposed, the NEC should be directed to <BR>
 conduct an economic assessment of their consequences to U.S. <BR>
 industries so that their full costs can be properly weighed.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The President should direct the appropriate Cabinet Secretaries to <BR>
 create an integrated database for dual-use and munitions export <BR>
 licenses.<BR>
 <BR>
 To improve interagency review and communications and the overall <BR>
 licensing process, agencies involved in export control should begin <BR>
 to upgrade and integrate their data systems.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 5. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) <BR>
 should adapt its operations to the changing nature of export <BR>
 controls.<BR>
 <BR>
 BXA should realign its programs to improve its credibility with <BR>
 customers by providing clear and concise regulations and timely <BR>
 export control information. BXA should also consolidate and increase <BR>
 its technical resources to ensure that all available expertise is <BR>
 brought to bear on critical nonproliferation export control issues. <BR>
 BXA should use its resources to train other nations, especially the <BR>
 newly independent states produced by the breakup of the U.S.S.R., in <BR>
 the complexities of dual-use export controls. Better use of resources <BR>
 in this area will help to preclude the proliferation of weapons of <BR>
 mass destruction through the supply of sensitive items from the <BR>
 former Soviet Union.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Implementation of these recommendations would help to balance <BR>
 competing economic and military considerations and create clearer <BR>
 lines of responsibility and authority by decreasing jurisdictional <BR>
 disputes between agencies. In the long term, these changes also would <BR>
 help to foster a better partnership between government and industry <BR>
 and ensure that U.S. industries remain competitive in the global <BR>
 marketplace.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 The full fiscal impact of these recommendations is difficult to <BR>
 estimate. The purpose of these improvements is to lessen <BR>
 inefficiencies within the federal export control system by <BR>
 rationalizing and streamlining the process and bringing disparate <BR>
 computer systems together. These changes should help U.S. companies <BR>
 become more competitive so that they can create new jobs at home.<BR>

 DOC04:  Strengthen the Tourism Policy Council<BR>
 *********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The impact of tourism on the U.S. economy should not be <BR>
 underestimated. Tourism ranks as the first, second, or third largest <BR>
 employer in 37 states; it is the largest employer in 13 states. In <BR>
 1992, tourism was the second-largest employer in the U.S. as a whole. <BR>
 In the past decade, the travel industry created jobs at twice the <BR>
 average rate of all U.S. industries. The industry leads the nation in <BR>
 its employment of women and minorities.<BR>
 <BR>
 In 1992, domestic and international travelers spent $361 billion in <BR>
 the U.S. on air, bus, taxi, ship, and rail travel; hotel and motel <BR>
 accommodations; camping; food and drink; retail purchases; and <BR>
 amusement and recreation services. This amounted to an estimated 6 <BR>
 percent of the Gross National Product. In the same year, domestic and <BR>
 international travelers paid nearly $51 billion in U.S. taxes, <BR>
 compared to $32 billion in 1986. International tourism is <BR>
 particularly important to the U.S. balance of payments, resulting in <BR>
 a surplus of more than $20 billion in 1992 and supporting 5.9 million <BR>
 U.S. jobs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Prior to the 1960s, the government was largely uninvolved in the <BR>
 promotion of tourism to the United States. By the late 1960s, <BR>
 however, the impact of tourism on the balance of payments and its <BR>
 important contribution to economic development had become evident.<BR>
 <BR>
 Between 1949 to 1960, the U.S. travel deficit--the difference between <BR>
 the nation's payments on travel abroad and U.S. receipts from <BR>
 international visitors--nearly tripled, from $360 million to $1.2 <BR>
 billion. In 1961, the U.S. Travel Service, predecessor to today's <BR>
 U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA), was created in <BR>
 response to the growing travel deficit. Today, this situation has <BR>
 reversed, and USTTA has become an aggressive promoter of U.S. tourism <BR>
 interests.<BR>
 <BR>
 However, the federal tourism promotion effort is fragmented. At <BR>
 present, more than 20 federal agencies possess tourism programs in <BR>
 addition to USTTA. Of these, 10 have significant responsibilities.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Agriculture Extension Service provides communities with <BR>
 information on tourism development opportunities, and is pilot-<BR>
 testing &quot;Our Town,&quot; a computerized bulletin board of rural travel <BR>
 opportunities. The service also has a pilot project to increase <BR>
 tourism through training, capacity building, and implementation of a <BR>
 comprehensive tourism marketing plan to be developed by the New <BR>
 Mexico Cooperative Extension Service. The service recently developed <BR>
 instructional materials in the Polish language for use in Poland. It <BR>
 has also formed an ad hoc tourism committee.<BR>
 <BR>
 The U.S. Forest Service works with local, state, and regional tourism <BR>
 organizations to create jobs in national forests, working mostly <BR>
 through rural economic development efforts. A variety of other agency <BR>
 activities promote tourism directly. For example, the service <BR>
 recently dedicated $50,000 to support the Allegheny National Forest's <BR>
 membership in the Pennsylvania-Rhode Island Regional Market <BR>
 Development Program in Germany. Similar ventures are under way in <BR>
 Idaho and New Mexico.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Education's College Work Study program provides a <BR>
 Port Receptionist Program that offers language assistance to <BR>
 international visitors at airport inspection areas.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is involved with multi-cultural and <BR>
 rural tourism and is also an ex officio member of the Rural Tourism <BR>
 Development Foundation Board of Directors.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages nearly one-eighth of U.S. <BR>
 lands and also is host to 2 million visitors annually. BLM <BR>
 administers &quot;Recreation 200,&quot; a recreation growth and development <BR>
 plan that includes Back Country Byways, Adventures in the Past and <BR>
 Watchable Wildlife. Primarily involving rural communities, BLM's <BR>
 tourism policy promotes relationships with local, state, national, <BR>
 and international tourism entities.<BR>
 <BR>
 The National Park Service operates a tourism program to offer <BR>
 technical assistance for the development of new tourism <BR>
 infrastructure and marketing planning. Service public relations <BR>
 efforts attempt to change park visitation patterns and holds tourism <BR>
 training conferences concerning public use of national parks. It also <BR>
 acts as a point of contact for public-private tourism organizations.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Federal Highway Administration (FHA) administers the interim <BR>
 National Scenic Byways Program, which seeks to increase tourism while <BR>
 preserving the natural environment. FHA also recognizes scenic <BR>
 qualities surrounding various highways, provides grants to states for <BR>
 project activities along existing state-designated scenic byways, and <BR>
 provides grants for other tourism-related activities. The agency has <BR>
 spent about $80 million over six years for Scenic Byways Program <BR>
 activities, including development of visitor centers and promotion.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Appalachian Regional Commission works to promote travel and <BR>
 tourism to the Appalachian area through promotional activities aimed <BR>
 at foreign and domestic travel professionals. The commission also <BR>
 provides grants for revolving loan funds as well as small grants for <BR>
 educational workshops, and produces various brochures.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Tennessee Valley Authority delivers technical assistance in the <BR>
 Tennessee Valley, and cooperates with other agencies in developing <BR>
 the Tennessee River for maximum economic development through tourism. <BR>
 It has also been a leader in rural tourism development.<BR>
 <BR>
 The proliferation of federal agencies involved in tourism development <BR>
 has caused great concern among state and local tourism officials. <BR>
 Problems cited include confusion regarding what agency to approach <BR>
 for which type of support, and duplicated, uncoordinated efforts at <BR>
 the state, local, and federal levels.<BR>
 <BR>
 The severe demands of the federal budget make it imperative that the <BR>
 U.S. maximize the impact of every dollar. Coordination of the <BR>
 fragmented federal approach to tourism development makes sense both <BR>
 in terms of maximizing the impact of federal spending and in avoiding <BR>
 duplication of products and services.<BR>
 <BR>
 In an effort to coordinate federal tourism efforts, the Tourism <BR>
 Policy Council (TPC) was created by statute in 1981 to coordinate <BR>
 federal policies, programs, and issues that relate to tourism, <BR>
 recreation, and the national heritage. The council also is <BR>
 responsible for developing areas of cooperative program activity, <BR>
 assisting in the resolution of interagency program and policy <BR>
 conflicts, and addressing the policy concerns of state and local <BR>
 governments and the private sector.<BR>
 <BR>
 The TPC, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, includes the following <BR>
 members: the Under Secretary for Travel and Tourism; the Director of <BR>
 the Office of Management and Budget; a representative of the <BR>
 International Trade Administration, designated by the Secretary of <BR>
 Commerce; the Secretaries of Energy, State, Interior, Labor, <BR>
 Transportation, and Agriculture; the Chair of the Tennessee Valley <BR>
 Authority; the Chief, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the Administrator <BR>
 of the Small Business Administration; the Commissioner of the <BR>
 Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Chief Executive Officer <BR>
 of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak); and the <BR>
 Commissioner of Customs. <BR>
 <BR>
 The role of TPC in tourism policy coordination has steadily eroded <BR>
 over the years; at present, meetings generally are attended only by <BR>
 staff-level persons with little or no authority to speak for their <BR>
 agencies. This decline in TPC's effectiveness has occurred as <BR>
 independent activity by agencies has increased, and the future of <BR>
 tourism trade development becomes more and more significant to the <BR>
 nation's economic health.<BR>
 <BR>
 The council should be revitalized in a manner that allows for <BR>
 effective cooperation and integration of federal efforts in tourism <BR>
 development. This reinvention will allow the agency to achieve its <BR>
 potential and fulfill the vision set out for it in the 1981 statute <BR>
 and reconfirmed and expanded in the Tourism Policy and Export <BR>
 Promotion Act of 1992.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 The President should broaden TPC's authority to coordinate federal <BR>
 tourism promotion efforts.<BR>
 <BR>
 TPC's expanded authority would empower the council to govern tourism <BR>
 development initiatives across federal departments. The Secretary of <BR>
 Commerce, as chair, should be empowered to conduct cross-cutting <BR>
 tourism program and budget reviews to facilitate integrated planning <BR>
 and implementation, and to propose means for improving such efforts <BR>
 through resource adjustments, integrated planning, a unified budget, <BR>
 or such other techniques as may be required. The council should <BR>
 develop a strategy maximizing government's impact on tourism exports.<BR>
 <BR>
 These new authorities would reverse the decline in TPC's role and <BR>
 would make it an effective mechanism to facilitate interagency <BR>
 communication and cooperation. TPC's efforts would be integrated with <BR>
 those of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee. TPC would work <BR>
 closely with the National Economic Council and with the Office of <BR>
 Management and Budget, particularly in relationship to development of <BR>
 a unified budget. TPC would prepare an annual report to the President <BR>
 with recommendations on coordinating programs and allocating <BR>
 resources.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The fragmented federal approach to assist the development of the U.S. <BR>
 tourism industry has created duplication and overlap. These <BR>
 recommendations would help to ensure that government spending is <BR>
 being directed within a strategic framework resulting in a decrease <BR>
 in duplication, better federal communication and coordination, and a <BR>
 more rational expenditure of scarce federal resources.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations are budget-neutral, but their impact should <BR>
 result both in increased tourism &quot;export&quot; earnings and increased <BR>
 tourism in areas that are currently unpopular and in greater need of <BR>
 economic development. Improved coordination and integrated planning <BR>
 should result in a net increase in federal funds directed to tourism <BR>
 promotion and, more importantly, more effective expenditure of funds.<BR>

 DOC05:  Create Public-Private Competition for the NOAA Fleet<BR>
 ************************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains <BR>
 a fleet of ships to support its mission of oceanographic and <BR>
 atmospheric research, assessment of living marine resources, and <BR>
 nautical charting and mapping. With an average age of about 28 years, <BR>
 the fleet is reaching the end of its projected life expectancy. The <BR>
 life expectancy of a vessel that has received a major midlife <BR>
 rehabilitation is 30 years. However, only six of 20 NOAA vessels have <BR>
 had even partial midlife rehabilitation. NOAA's ability to accomplish <BR>
 its responsibilities is in jeopardy unless immediate action is taken.<BR>
 <BR>
 A recent internal NOAA study proposes that a minimum of 5,000 days-<BR>
 at-sea (DAS) per year are required to accomplish its mission.(1) The <BR>
 current NOAA fleet provides less than 3,600 DAS per year. This is <BR>
 only 84 percent of the average annual number of DAS provided over the <BR>
 past 15 years. The study also proposes a fleet replacement and <BR>
 modernization plan that would cost in excess of $1.6 billion over the <BR>
 next 15 years, in addition to its current funding level.<BR>
 <BR>
 Many evaluations of NOAA's fleet requirements have been conducted <BR>
 since 1986, including reports by the General Accounting Office (GAO), <BR>
 the Department of Commerce Inspector General (IG), and the Oceanic <BR>
 and Atmospheric Management Advisory Committee (OAMAC).(2) The OAMAC <BR>
 evaluation seriously questioned NOAA's proposed ship-type <BR>
 requirements, fleet size and mix of government-owned/operated, <BR>
 contractor-owned/government-operated, and contractor-owned/operated <BR>
 vessels. The evaluation also suggested that an independent review <BR>
 would be useful in determining ship requirements and that NOAA's <BR>
 proposed contracting effort be increased to a minimum of one year. <BR>
 This would be necessary to generate significant private interest. <BR>
 Currently, contractors provide a very small amount of NOAA's charting <BR>
 and research functions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Corps of Engineers contracts 30 to 40 percent of its charting, <BR>
 which suggests that the private sector has the ability and interest <BR>
 to do this kind of work. Historically, substantial savings result <BR>
 when competition is introduced into an acquisition process.<BR>
 <BR>
 To address these issues, NOAA recently prepared a model to perform an <BR>
 economic analysis of public versus private acquisition and operation <BR>
 for each of its proposed acquisitions. An experiment with public-<BR>
 private competition in conjunction with this new model could help <BR>
 determine the appropriate size and mix of the fleet and maximize <BR>
 potential savings.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. NOAA should experiment with a program of public-private <BR>
 competition to help fulfill NOAA's minimum number of days-at-sea <BR>
 (DAS).<BR>
 <BR>
 The program should be conducted for a minimum of one year in each of <BR>
 the three areas of mission responsibility. This experiment should be <BR>
 conducted in parallel with fleet replacement and modernization and <BR>
 should not delay the basic program. The results of this competition, <BR>
 in conjunction with the new economic model analysis, would provide <BR>
 additional support for future modernization decisions. The Request <BR>
 for Proposal (RFP) would be based on desired end products rather than <BR>
 on the type of equipment to be used. The RFP would also specify data <BR>
 kind, quantity and quality to ensure international quality standards. <BR>
 This would allow NOAA to determine areas in which private industry <BR>
 has the capability and interest to provide services.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. NOAA should bid against private contractors in areas in which the <BR>
 agency can be competitive.<BR>
 <BR>
 However, NOAA's capacity to bid will be limited in the near term, <BR>
 because of the age and condition of much of its existing fleet. <BR>
 Competition would give NOAA an incentive to perform its mission by <BR>
 the most cost-effective methods, either in-house or by contract. <BR>
 Since NOAA would be both buyer and seller, the procurement process <BR>
 must be designed to prevent any conflict of interest or appearance <BR>
 thereof. The process should include an impartial or independent <BR>
 review to ensure that government costs and projected results are <BR>
 properly prepared and all bids properly evaluated.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. NOAA should obtain an independent review of NOAA's modernization <BR>
 program.<BR>
 <BR>
 NOAA should implement the OAMAC suggestion for an independent review <BR>
 to consider specific topics relating to modernization, including the <BR>
 use of generic hulls and appropriate ship staffing for NOAA's <BR>
 missions. The results of this review should be factored into the <BR>
 modeling process. By combining the modeling results, the competition, <BR>
 and the independent review with NOAA's own internal studies, a more <BR>
 informed decision can be made and justified concerning long-range <BR>
 plans.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 A core fleet of NOAA-owned ships will remain desirable. However, the <BR>
 size and composition of this fleet ideally and ultimately should be <BR>
 determined by the results of competition, economic modeling, and <BR>
 internal analysis. Because of the poor condition of the fleet and the <BR>
 long lead time needed to acquire or repair ships, however, NOAA may <BR>
 need to reevaluate its plans for ship repair and replacement, to <BR>
 ensure that an appropriate core capability is established as the <BR>
 modernization plan progresses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Public-private competition, in conjunction with economic analysis, <BR>
 should allow the agency to make valid decisions about the size and <BR>
 mix of its fleet without endangering its mission.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 No change in budget authority will be required to implement these <BR>
 recommenda-tions. <BR>

 DOC06:  Improve Marine Fisheries Management<BR>
 *******************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The marine fishery resources of the United States' 200-mile Exclusive <BR>
 Economic Zone (EEZ) are publicly owned and privately used. The U.S. <BR>
 has exclusive fishery management authority over all fish and fishery <BR>
 resources within the EEZ.<BR>
 <BR>
 The economics of traditional open-access fisheries lead to increased <BR>
 competition and overcapitalization, which, in turn, lead to <BR>
 accelerated depletion of fish. Harvesters in developing fisheries <BR>
 initially enjoy substantial returns. As initial benefits attract more <BR>
 participants and total harvests reach sustainable biological limits, <BR>
 combined harvesting efforts tend to increase to prevent declines in <BR>
 individual shares. To maximize net income in the face of rising costs <BR>
 and reduced catches, fishermen often invest in more efficient <BR>
 technology, including larger, more powerful vessels. The resulting <BR>
 competition leads to increased demands at a time when available <BR>
 stocks are static or declining.<BR>
 <BR>
 Fishery managers respond to such situations by setting quotas, <BR>
 regulating gear, limiting fish size, and closing areas or seasons. <BR>
 However, these practices often result in even more overfishing, <BR>
 harvesting inefficiency, and waste, and spur increased investment in <BR>
 vessels and technology, resulting in fleet overcapitalization.(1)<BR>
 <BR>
 Proper management techniques should produce a sustained yield of the <BR>
 fishery resources over time. A 1991 National Marine Fisheries <BR>
 Service's (NMFS) report indicated that of 153 edible species or <BR>
 species groups, 65 (42 percent) are overused (in other words, more <BR>
 resources than necessary are used to obtain the most desirable <BR>
 production), 57 (37 percent) are fully used (an appropriate number of <BR>
 resources result in desirable production), and 31 (21 percent) are <BR>
 underused (more resources are necessary to obtain desirable <BR>
 production).(2)<BR>
 <BR>
 The Magnuson Fishery and Conservation Management Act established a <BR>
 management process for the conservation and management of marine <BR>
 fisheries.(3) Regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) have <BR>
 developed 33 management plans that have been implemented by the <BR>
 Secretary of Commerce. Under the act, a fishery management program <BR>
 may require a permit to be obtained and fees paid for an individual, <BR>
 fishing vessel, or fish processor to operate. However, the act limits <BR>
 permit fees to the administrative costs of issuing the permits. <BR>
 Furthermore, fees collected from permits are deposited into the <BR>
 Treasury's General Fund and are not available either to reimburse the <BR>
 department for its costs of issuing the permits or to fund fishery <BR>
 management programs and activities. In 1990, a section was added to <BR>
 provide for the establishment of a trust fund and fee assessment in <BR>
 support of fishery management programs in the North Pacific.(4) This <BR>
 amendment had the general support of the area's fishing industry when <BR>
 it was considered by Congress.<BR>
 <BR>
 New Zealand has implemented a management system which allocates fish <BR>
 among competing users.(5) Five U.S. fisheries use a system of <BR>
 individual transferable quotas (ITQs) similar to the New Zealand <BR>
 plan, which combines traditional conservation regulations with free-<BR>
 market methods of allocation among competing users. This method <BR>
 assigns negotiable shares of the total allowable catch to <BR>
 individuals, which then are transferable in free and competitive <BR>
 markets. After the initial distribution of ITQs, market forces <BR>
 determine individual shares of the total harvest quota.<BR>
 <BR>
 The importance of fishery resource management cannot be <BR>
 overemphasized, since jobs depend on it. Improved management and <BR>
 allocation systems would help to rebuild U.S. fisheries but would <BR>
 require additional resources. For example, the cost to implement a <BR>
 new individual fishing quota system (a version of the ITQ) for the <BR>
 North Pacific sablefish and halibut fisheries alone is estimated at <BR>
 $3.1 million per year.<BR>
 <BR>
 In light of continuing budget limitations, one option would be to <BR>
 underwrite critical management, information collection, and <BR>
 enforcement costs by lifting present restrictions on fees. Ideally, <BR>
 users of public resources should pay the cost of managing them for <BR>
 the public good. User fees are an accepted practice for recovering <BR>
 management costs for land-based resources such as timber and grazing <BR>
 lands.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) should <BR>
 continue collaborating with FMCs and commercial and recreational <BR>
 fishing interests to develop and implement controlled-access plans <BR>
 that include individual harvesting rights, such as ITQs, in <BR>
 accordance with provisions of the Magnuson Act.<BR>
 <BR>
 This is necessary to promote the recovery of depleted fisheries and <BR>
 the industry's economic health.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. NOAA should work with Congress, FMCs, and commercial and <BR>
 recreational fishing interests to evaluate options for user fees to <BR>
 help offset the cost of implementation of FMPs.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. Depending on the outcome of these recommendations, NOAA should <BR>
 prepare, in collaboration with Congress, appropriate amendments to <BR>
 the Magnuson Act.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The need for innovative assessment and management programs and the <BR>
 funds to support those programs is widely accepted. Support has been <BR>
 voiced by the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, FMC <BR>
 representatives, and members of the fishing industry. A key condition <BR>
 of their acceptance is that the funds derived from the fees be used <BR>
 in the fisheries from which they are collected.<BR>
 <BR>
 Some industry members object both to limited-access programs and to <BR>
 fees. In the past, this issue has prompted a wide range of protests <BR>
 from the fishing industry. However, resource depletion and <BR>
 overcapitalization are realities of the present management system. <BR>
 Industry is beginning to understand and accept the need for a basic <BR>
 restructuring of management techniques. Further discussions with <BR>
 Congress, FMCs, and the fishing industry may accelerate industry <BR>
 acceptance.<BR>
 <BR>
 Programs such as ITQs would address overcapitalization by allowing <BR>
 participants to match the level of capital investment with the level <BR>
 of shares. As ITQs are transferred, more harvesters could move to <BR>
 areas that are underused. In addition, smaller, more manageable <BR>
 fleets would allow fishery managers to better control harvests and <BR>
 rebuild depleted stocks. Harvesters would have greater incentives to <BR>
 conserve resources and encourage others to comply with management <BR>
 programs, knowing that their percentage share would result in greater <BR>
 harvests as fisheries are rebuilt.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 If fully implemented, controlled-access management programs would <BR>
 bring economic growth and stability to the fishing industry. NOAA <BR>
 estimates the potential net value derived from adjustments in fleet <BR>
 size and the recovery of over-fished stocks to be $2.9 billion (a <BR>
 $1.8 billion potential increase in gross harvesting revenues from all <BR>
 fishery units, and a $1.1 billion reduction in harvesting costs from <BR>
 increases in efficiency)--a substantial contribution to the <BR>
 economy.(6)<BR>
 <BR>
 Through the use of a combination of licenses, permits, and landing <BR>
 fees, estimated revenue could exceed $100 million annually. This <BR>
 number is a preliminary estimate.<BR>

 DOC07:  Provide EDA Public Works Loan Guarantees <BR>
         for Infrastructure Assistance<BR>
 ************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 Since 1965, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the <BR>
 Department of Commerce has assisted local communities in developing <BR>
 infrastructure to create and retain private-sector jobs. While <BR>
 appropriations and staffing levels have dropped, EDA's main business <BR>
 has remained the same. EDA's largest program in dollar terms is its <BR>
 public works categorical grant program. The agency funds about 200 <BR>
 projects each year, such as industrial park improvements and the <BR>
 construction of incubator buildings, mostly for local government <BR>
 grantees, at an average of roughly $800,000 in grant funds per <BR>
 project.<BR>
 <BR>
 Depending on the level of distress in the community (measured by <BR>
 factors such as low incomes and persistent unemployment), EDA pays up <BR>
 to 80 percent of project costs (up to 100 percent for Indian tribes). <BR>
 Yet the poorest communities often cannot finance even their 20-<BR>
 percent local share. EDA's field staff reports that the usual sources <BR>
 of local matching funds for essential development facilities of long-<BR>
 term benefit are not available to very poor communities. Such <BR>
 governments have exhausted their taxing authority and have little or <BR>
 no general bonding authority, and their discretionary resources, such <BR>
 as Community Development Block Grant (CBDG) funds, are committed to <BR>
 other pressing needs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Even so, more eligible projects exist than EDA can support. As a <BR>
 practical matter, EDA often delays funding, either in the course of <BR>
 processing or by postponing invitations for applications. <BR>
 Occasionally, EDA will fund a smaller percentage of the project costs <BR>
 than the percentage for which an applicant is eligible, or define <BR>
 only a portion of a desired project as EDA-funded, due to its funding <BR>
 limitations.<BR>
 <BR>
 Communities and projects that do not need grant assistance could <BR>
 still benefit from some lower level of financial support, <BR>
 particularly for innovative projects. At a minimal cost to the <BR>
 federal government, a loan guarantee program could serve as catalyst <BR>
 in promoting creative and innovative projects, including the <BR>
 commercialization of new technologies.<BR>
 <BR>
 EDA's current legislation authorize public-works loans and loan <BR>
 guarantees to private borrowers but does not permit loan guarantees <BR>
 for public borrowers. EDA's economic revolving fund was formed to <BR>
 support its loan and loan guarantee activity; it currently has a <BR>
 balance of about $135 million. Repayment of old public-works loans <BR>
 adds approximately $10 million per year to the fund.<BR>
 <BR>
 EDA has not received appropriations for public-works loans since <BR>
 1978. Between 1966 and 1978, EDA's Public Works Direct Loan Program <BR>
 approved 421 loans for $154 million, with a more than 95-percent <BR>
 repayment rate. The program was discontinued by EDA because of a <BR>
 determination that sufficient funding was available through private <BR>
 capital markets.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 Legislation should be enacted to establish a reserve fund for EDA <BR>
 loan guarantees. <BR>
 <BR>
 Congress should provide EDA with the authority to use a portion (20 <BR>
 percent) of its economic development revolving fund for loan <BR>
 guarantees to financial institutions that make loans to public <BR>
 entities. The guaranteed loans will be secured by general obligation <BR>
 or revenue bonds (not tax-exempt) and/or the property acquired or <BR>
 improved with the assistance.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 This recommendation would improve customer service by providing EDA <BR>
 with the flexibility to provide greater assistance to economically <BR>
 distressed communities. Assuming a 20-percent subsidy rate, this <BR>
 recommendation should enable EDA to double the amount of public works <BR>
 projects it supports.<BR>
 <BR>
 Based on the current level of funds in the revolving fund account, <BR>
 about $27 million (20 percent of $135 million) would be available to <BR>
 support loan guarantees of approximately $148 million, compared to <BR>
 its fiscal 1993 public works program appropriation of $147 million <BR>
 and its proposed 1994 appropriation of $135 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 The cost of implementing this program is well within EDA's current <BR>
 budget authority, assuming EDA reallocates its funds or requests that <BR>
 funds be reprogrammed as necessary to support the contingent <BR>
 liability created as a result of the loan guarantees. <BR>

 DOC08:  Establish a Manufacturing Technology Data Bank<BR>
 ******************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce and other federal agencies produce an <BR>
 enormous amount of scientific and technical information that is <BR>
 directly applicable to manufacturing. As with many federal programs, <BR>
 manufacturing technology research is conducted by a wide and often <BR>
 confusing array of government organizations. The National Institute <BR>
 of Standards and Technology, the Department of Defense, federal <BR>
 research labs, government-funded university scientists, and many <BR>
 other organizations conduct basic research with a combined research <BR>
 and development budget of more than $65 billion a year.<BR>
 <BR>
 Thousands of published and unpublished documents and data files are <BR>
 produced by this combined research effort. Many of these items have <BR>
 direct applicability to businesses. In fact, the ability of U.S. <BR>
 businesses to effectively compete in world markets or create new, <BR>
 high-paying jobs is directly related to how effectively new <BR>
 technologies are identified and converted to or embodied in useful <BR>
 products and services.<BR>
 <BR>
 Technological information moves freely within the research community, <BR>
 but many businesses have a difficult time learning what information <BR>
 is available, how it can be applied to their line of business, and <BR>
 how to obtain it. This is particularly true of small businesses in <BR>
 which research resources are limited. Yet maintaining a competitive <BR>
 edge is vital to the long-term success of small businesses. Many <BR>
 scientific and technical agencies have developed stand-alone services <BR>
 to deliver information to their constituents. However, the federal <BR>
 government has no ongoing and comprehensive cross-agency program to <BR>
 deliver technological information to manufacturers on a continuing <BR>
 basis.<BR>
 <BR>
 The American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 went a long way <BR>
 toward centralizing the government's collection of scientific and <BR>
 technical information (STI), by requiring each executive-branch <BR>
 agency to transfer to the National Technical Information Service <BR>
 (NTIS ) one copy of the results of all federally funded research and <BR>
 development. However, no good mechanism exists to help businesses <BR>
 sift through this mountain of data to locate information relevant to <BR>
 their needs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Improving manufacturers' ability to identify and obtain relevant <BR>
 technical information can enable them to compete more effectively in <BR>
 their current markets and to enter new markets. The success of these <BR>
 efforts will enhance opportunities for U.S. workers. Well established <BR>
 models can be used as blueprints for the development of a <BR>
 manufacturing technology data bank (MTDB). The Commerce Department's <BR>
 successful National Trade Data Bank (NTDB) has changed the way in <BR>
 which the federal government delivers export promotion and <BR>
 international trade information to the public and its own offices. <BR>
 Moreover, an information delivery system is already well established <BR>
 for these services. A MTDB based on the NTDB model could take <BR>
 advantage of existing software, processing facilities, and <BR>
 distribution systems. Finally, the NTDB experience shows that the <BR>
 quality of reporting improves dramatically when rapid dissemination <BR>
 and feedback become institutionalized.<BR>
 <BR>
 A MTDB containing a core set of data highlighting new production <BR>
 techniques, examples of best business practices, quality assurance <BR>
 and management information, and contacts for additional technical <BR>
 information, also could be used as a teaching tool for engineers, <BR>
 business leaders, managers, product development specialists, basic <BR>
 researchers, and production line workers. The NTDB again serves as a <BR>
 useful model; it is used daily as a teaching tool for students in <BR>
 international business and marketing courses. Exposing students to <BR>
 tools used by businesses while attending colleges and universities <BR>
 gives them skills that can be put to immediate use upon their entry <BR>
 into the work force. Moreover, students often bring these tools to <BR>
 organizations that have not yet taken advantage of these information <BR>
 products.<BR>
 <BR>
 The MTDB can be designed to compile, organize, and disseminate <BR>
 information from a wide range of agencies on an equally wide range of <BR>
 topics or technologies. This stands in marked contrast to existing <BR>
 services that organize information along agency or topic lines <BR>
 requiring extensive, often confusing, searches to research a topic or <BR>
 process. <BR>
 <BR>
 A properly prepared data bank will not be a substitute for existing <BR>
 dissemination services operated by government technical agencies . <BR>
 Rather, it will serve as a complementary service that exposes <BR>
 individuals to basic technical concepts. When a technical area is <BR>
 identified as promising, more extensive research will usually be <BR>
 required to access detailed and narrowly defined databases and <BR>
 services. A technology data bank will introduce a wide variety of <BR>
 technology concepts to manufacturers and can serve as an &quot;idea <BR>
 generator&quot; allowing technical issues to be examined quickly for <BR>
 applicability to a business.<BR>
 <BR>
 No one agency can accomplish this task without cooperation and <BR>
 guidance from other scientific and technical agencies. One reason for <BR>
 the success of the NTDB is the existence of the Interagency Trade <BR>
 Data Advisory Committee (ITDAC), which is charged with advising the <BR>
 Secretary of Commerce on the NTDB's content and operations. A similar <BR>
 organization that focuses on STI can be established to provide <BR>
 effective guidance on items to be included in the data bank, <BR>
 procedures for organizing and searching for information, and <BR>
 distribution channels.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Department of Commerce should establish a manufacturing <BR>
 technology data bank. <BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce should establish a MTDB using the <BR>
 department's NTDB as an operating model. The data bank should feature <BR>
 highlights of new research applicable to U.S. manufacturers, <BR>
 abstracts of additional technical information available from the <BR>
 federal government and the names of federal contacts in technical <BR>
 areas that assist in implementing these technologies. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Department of Commerce should incorporate input from an <BR>
 interagency coordinating group in the data bank's development.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Secretary of Commerce (or his designee) should chair an <BR>
 interagency coordinating group to establish the content, organization <BR>
 and operation of the data bank. This committee may be an extension of <BR>
 an existing technical coordinating committee, such as the interagency <BR>
 group comprised of the Department of Commerce, the Department of <BR>
 Energy, the National Library of Medicine, the National Aeronautics <BR>
 and Space Administration, and Defense Technical Information Center <BR>
 (CENDI); the Federal Coordinating Committee on Science, Engineering, <BR>
 and Technology (FCCSET); or a new body whose specific duty focuses on <BR>
 the MTDB<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. The Department of Commerce should foster extensive use of the <BR>
 manufacturing technology data bank.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce should ensure that the MTDB becomes a <BR>
 fundamental tool, understood by all federal agencies with programs <BR>
 that assist manufacturers with new technology. The data bank should <BR>
 be used by federal agencies, state and local governments, and <BR>
 university and industry-based programs designed to advise firms on <BR>
 how to incorporate new technology into their business.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Department of Commerce should develop a comprehensive <BR>
 technology dissemination program.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce should administer the development of a <BR>
 comprehensive technology dissemination program that employs multiple <BR>
 types of electronic information media, such as CD-ROM, on-line <BR>
 access, and networked distribution. The program should take advantage <BR>
 of existing information networks and federal depository libraries and <BR>
 offer the data bank for sale on a wholesale and retail basis. <BR>
 Reasonable fees should be charged for these products.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 5. The Department of Commerce should develop data bank applications <BR>
 for educational use.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce should encourage development of <BR>
 partnership relationships with educators to ensure that technology <BR>
 applications for the MTDB are developed for use in elementary and <BR>
 secondary schools, colleges, universities, and trade schools; and in <BR>
 adult continuing and remedial education programs. Courses, textbooks, <BR>
 and multi-media applications can be developed to meet defined <BR>
 teaching requirements.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Improved access to federal government STI will provide U.S. <BR>
 businesses with enhanced opportunities to bring these technologies to <BR>
 the marketplace. <BR>
 <BR>
 Coordinated delivery of STI by federal agencies will ensure increased <BR>
 use of the information by the U.S. public. Moreover, a coordinated <BR>
 process for disseminating information and receiving feedback should <BR>
 fuel the creation of more accurate, higher quality information in the <BR>
 future.<BR>
 <BR>
 Delivery of STI will be viewed positively by private sector <BR>
 interests. All segments of the economy stand to benefit--<BR>
 manufacturers, through direct application of new technology; <BR>
 information service providers, through an enhanced ability to obtain <BR>
 and repackage government information; and individuals, through <BR>
 improved work opportunities and the creation of new jobs.<BR>

 DOC09:  Expand Electronic Availability of Census Data<BR>
 *****************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce collects, processes, <BR>
 analyzes, and distributes valuable current and historical information <BR>
 on every aspect of our economy and society. Users include educators <BR>
 and students; entrepreneurs; urban planners; and local, state and <BR>
 federal agencies. All of these depend on the bureau to deliver <BR>
 timely, accurate and low cost information relevant to their needs. <BR>
 Most of these needs are met through the hard-copy publication of <BR>
 2,000 to 4,000 releases and reports each year.<BR>
 <BR>
 The bureau pioneered the dissemination of data in computer-accessible <BR>
 form following the 1970 Census of Population and Housing, and was the <BR>
 first federal agency to distribute statistical information on compact <BR>
 disc. Expanding from a base of 10,000 computer-tape customers in <BR>
 1973, the Census Bureau served 380,000 electronic-media customers in <BR>
 1992; an additional 1.1 million obtained electronic census <BR>
 information from subsidiary distribution partners, mostly state data <BR>
 centers. Products and services now offered include diskettes, <BR>
 computer tapes, CD-ROMs, a fax system, an electronic bulletin board, <BR>
 automated Census Bureau exhibits at conferences of public and private <BR>
 organizations, and two modest prototypes of on-line direct data <BR>
 acquisition systems.<BR>
 <BR>
 However, despite its pioneering efforts, the bureau has fallen behind <BR>
 emerging information distribution standards. Faster ways to deliver <BR>
 large quantities of census information to more users are needed. For <BR>
 example, to order a product such as a compact disc, users either must <BR>
 submit a paper order form or place the order via the bureau's <BR>
 customer-service phone lines, which are only open nine hours a day, <BR>
 five days a week.<BR>
 <BR>
 Ideally, public and private data users should be able to locate and <BR>
 order (or directly obtain) census information through the medium of <BR>
 their choice at minimum cost, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. <BR>
 On-line Census Bureau databases would allow the immediate use of data <BR>
 to support ongoing research and analysis of the economy, both within <BR>
 and without the federal establishment. While current data from other <BR>
 agencies that measure the economy will not be affected, Census Bureau <BR>
 data could assist in understanding the overall context of these <BR>
 indicators.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Census Bureau should establish a computerized census <BR>
 information access service.<BR>
 <BR>
 Using existing technology, the Census Bureau should establish a new <BR>
 24-hour computerized census information access service, and be <BR>
 authorized to charge a fee to recover the costs of the service. Users <BR>
 would dial a toll-free number from a touch-tone phone to access a <BR>
 &quot;free&quot; key-word information guide to available products. Easy menu <BR>
 options (much like a bank transaction system) would guide the caller <BR>
 to an appropriate subsystem listing available information and order <BR>
 options for particular products or services. All products and <BR>
 services will involve user fees, which should continue to be based on <BR>
 reproduction costs and should be automatically billable to a credit <BR>
 card or to a pre-credited account for frequent users. Dispatch of <BR>
 products or downloaded data sets should be fully automated.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Census Bureau should publish reports electronically on the <BR>
 Internet.<BR>
 <BR>
 When hard-copy reports are printed and released to the public, they <BR>
 should be simultaneously published electronically on the Internet, a <BR>
 worldwide &quot;network of computer networks&quot; linking organizations in <BR>
 North and South America, Europe, and the Pacific Basin. Internet <BR>
 provides world-wide connectivity to a vast variety of federal, <BR>
 military, educational, research laboratories, contractors and other <BR>
 private sector organizations, researchers and practitioners.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. The Census Bureau should publish frequently used statistics on the <BR>
 Internet.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau should develop and publish on the Internet large <BR>
 databases of frequently used statistics from censuses, surveys, <BR>
 estimates, programs and international data sources. For example, the <BR>
 bureau is preparing an easy to use, 6,000 variable database for every <BR>
 community, county, metropolitan area, and state in the nation based <BR>
 on the results of the 1990 census (DAPS90). It should be made <BR>
 available on Internet. In time, geographically-correlated, <BR>
 disclosure-protected summary data from the Economic, Agricultural, <BR>
 and Government Censuses should be included in this file.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Census Bureau should provide data from micro-records through a <BR>
 dial-up system.<BR>
 <BR>
 For sophisticated users, the Census Bureau should establish a dial-up <BR>
 system containing a &quot;disclosure-free&quot; sample of micro-records from <BR>
 frequently used censuses or surveys. Via a user-friendly software <BR>
 system, the caller could &quot;program&quot; a desired table and download the <BR>
 customized statistics to his or her desktop computer. The Bureau's <BR>
 working SIPP-ON-CALL system demonstrates their ability to design, <BR>
 mount, and operate such systems.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 5. The Census Bureau should link these systems (particularly Internet <BR>
 databases) to each of the Census Bureau's 12 regional offices. This <BR>
 will provide for access by &quot;walk-in&quot; patrons and regional federal <BR>
 personnel.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 6. The Census Bureau should license these systems to state data <BR>
 centers and affiliates.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau should license each of the 54 state data centers to <BR>
 share these systems and &quot;cascade&quot; access to the 1,700 local data <BR>
 center affiliates, including university and public libraries, <BR>
 economic development departments, and councils of governments.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations would significantly increase access to and use <BR>
 of census data, and speed up its distribution. Printed reports, which <BR>
 are costly, cumbersome, and time consuming to publish and distribute, <BR>
 would become less common if they were also available electronically, <BR>
 thereby reducing both user and producer costs. Moreover, data that <BR>
 are too extensive and expensive to tabulate and publish could be made <BR>
 available electronically at lower cost. Increased access, a variety <BR>
 of delivery choices, and 365-day, around-the- clock service make this <BR>
 a &quot;user-friendly&quot; way to disseminate public information.<BR>
 <BR>
 At the same time, these initiatives would provide a foundation for <BR>
 eventual conversion to the digital transmission of data via optical <BR>
 fiber, as this technology becomes more widely established. The <BR>
 ultimate goal is to make it easy to obtain relevant information from <BR>
 five or six reports without having to identify the reports, order <BR>
 them, and wait several weeks to extract needed information.<BR>

 DOC10:  Amend the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness<BR>
         Act to Increase the Data Quality of the <BR>
         National Trade Data Bank<BR>
 ***************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires the <BR>
 Secretary of Commerce to operate a National Trade Data Bank (NTDB) as <BR>
 a central repository of data compiled or obtained by the federal <BR>
 government relating to trade and international economics. The <BR>
 Secretary delegated responsibility for developing and operating the <BR>
 data bank to the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA). ESA' <BR>
 s Office of Business Analysis (OBA) has operated the service since <BR>
 its inception.<BR>
 <BR>
 The legislation requires the department to manage the data bank using <BR>
 the most appropriate technology to monitor, organize, analyze, and <BR>
 disseminate the data. The Act requires that &quot;access, including <BR>
 electronic access, is to be provided to virtually every citizen, <BR>
 business, educational, or governmental unit in the United States.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 The data bank has been successful since it began operating on August <BR>
 23, 1990. It was implemented on time and under budget. The content <BR>
 and quality of the NTDB has grown continuously. At its inception, the <BR>
 data bank was comprised of 43 information programs contributed by 15 <BR>
 federal agencies. It required one compact disc (CD-ROM) per issue. <BR>
 Today, the data bank is twice its original size, requiring two CD-ROM <BR>
 discs per issue, and containing 100 information programs. This <BR>
 includes information on import and export statistics, foreign country <BR>
 market reports, how-to-export information, and foreign business <BR>
 contacts. <BR>
 <BR>
 Easy to use software allows U.S. businesses and other users to <BR>
 navigate through 130,000-plus documents in the data bank to find <BR>
 information they need. The data bank has revolutionized the method <BR>
 used by the department's U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service to <BR>
 deliver export promotion information to its U.S. field offices and <BR>
 foreign-based sites.<BR>
 <BR>
 The NTDB is in daily use in more than 800 depository libraries <BR>
 located throughout the United States. More than 1,400 discs are sold <BR>
 each month either through single-month sales or annual subscriptions <BR>
 of 12 monthly discs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Despite its success, though, several deficiencies limit the <BR>
 effectiveness of the NTDB. Appropriations have been relatively <BR>
 constant during the life of the project and are not projected to <BR>
 increase. Section 5412 of the Act allows the department to recover <BR>
 &quot;reasonable fees consistent with section 552 of Title 5, United <BR>
 States Code,&quot; which is part of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<BR>
 <BR>
 Consistent with these pricing guidelines, each issue is priced at $35 <BR>
 and annual subscriptions at $360. Cost increases have been paid <BR>
 through greatly improved staff productivity. For example, the cost of <BR>
 the NTDB has held constant even though it now requires two CD-ROM <BR>
 discs per issue rather than one. Further innovations or improvements <BR>
 can only be made as funds are found. <BR>
 <BR>
 Experience during 32 months of continuous operation has shown that <BR>
 the FOIA pricing rules, which were designed for relatively simple <BR>
 search and duplication of paper files, do not fit an electronic <BR>
 dissemination system involving electronic data collection, processing <BR>
 and duplication. This is particularly true when the costs of <BR>
 manufacturing and distributing several thousand CD-ROM discs each <BR>
 month, as well as staff resources, training, and other customer-<BR>
 support efforts are included. <BR>
 <BR>
 Despite its large content, significant amounts of information remain <BR>
 outside the data bank. Specifically, Department of Commerce's export <BR>
 regulations represent a large omission, even though significant <BR>
 efforts have been made to include these data in the NTDB. A more <BR>
 comprehensive and usable system to determine a product's trade <BR>
 classification (its Schedule B harmonized code) is also needed to <BR>
 assist users in locating information and preparing export declaration <BR>
 documents.<BR>
 <BR>
 The NTDB, moreover, lacks sufficient data to determine true world <BR>
 markets for U.S. exporters. Export and import statistics report only <BR>
 bilateral trade between the U.S. and its partners. Multilateral or <BR>
 world trade patterns may be determined only through use of data <BR>
 compiled by international organizations such as the United Nations. <BR>
 Unfortunately, most of this information is copyrighted. Dissemination <BR>
 through the NTDB would require licensing fees, which cannot be <BR>
 recovered due to FOIA pricing guidelines. Funding is not available to <BR>
 cover these costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 The NTDB meets the intent of Congress by bringing together important <BR>
 export promotion information that can be of value to thousands of <BR>
 existing and potential new exporters. Even so, it represents an <BR>
 underused and little-known resource among U.S. exporters.<BR>
 <BR>
 One reason for this is that the NTDB is poorly advertised. Experts <BR>
 believe thousands of businesses and individuals would find the NTDB <BR>
 useful if they knew of it. A properly funded marketing campaign <BR>
 oriented to business would require additional funding, but should <BR>
 yield significantly more NTDB customers. Moreover, the relatively <BR>
 small investment would be well worth it if increased use of the NTDB <BR>
 resulted in increased U.S. exports. At present, however, &quot;marketing&quot; <BR>
 of the NTDB generally is conducted by word of mouth or in frequent <BR>
 contacts with new exporters. Budget limitations rule out major, <BR>
 comprehensive campaigns to publicize this service.<BR>
 <BR>
 Rapidly falling technology prices and the increasing use of networked <BR>
 computers present new distribution opportunities that should be used <BR>
 to broaden access to the NTDB. CD-ROM distribution is still limited <BR>
 to the relatively small number of computers presently equipped with <BR>
 this technology. Alternative delivery techniques, such as dial-up or <BR>
 network-based access, could deliver this information to much larger <BR>
 numbers of customers.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. Section 5412 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 <BR>
 (P.L. No. 100-09418, 15 U.S.C. sec. 4912) should be amended by <BR>
 removing reference to &quot;fees consistent with&quot; the Freedom of <BR>
 Information Act.<BR>
 <BR>
 This change would allow the department to establish a fee schedule <BR>
 that would permit them to purchase additional data. Additional <BR>
 information supported by the fee increase would greatly enhance the <BR>
 data bank's usefulness for U.S. exporters and international trade <BR>
 policy analysts.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Department of Commerce should place the NTBD on a firm <BR>
 financial foundation to ensure its continued viability. <BR>
 <BR>
 This may be accomplished through two actions. A portion of the <BR>
 revenues generated by the NTDB and related OBA electronic information <BR>
 services should be earmarked for reinvestment into improvements in <BR>
 the content or delivery of electronic information services or direct <BR>
 customer support of these services.<BR>
 <BR>
 Appropriations should continue or increase as necessary to maintain <BR>
 adequate staff and provide the necessary infrastructure to support <BR>
 these services.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. ESA should contact international organizations (the United <BR>
 Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, <BR>
 World Bank, and International Monetary Fund) and develop an action <BR>
 plan for including their data in the NTDB.<BR>
 <BR>
 The plan should include a determination of the funds necessary to <BR>
 include this information in the NTDB and the consequent impact on <BR>
 user fees.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Secretary of Commerce should direct all Commerce agencies to <BR>
 comply with requests from ESA for data.<BR>
 <BR>
 Missing federal information should be included in the NTDB without <BR>
 delay. Additional data, where necessary, should be tabulated, <BR>
 formatted, or otherwise prepared for inclusion in the data bank.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 5. ESA, with the authority of the Secretary and the assistance of the <BR>
 department's Office of Public Affairs and the International Trade <BR>
 Administration, should take appropriate steps to develop an effective <BR>
 marketing plan that publicizes the NTDB as an exporter's resource <BR>
 tool to a large number of potential customers.<BR>
 <BR>
 Strategies should include announcements by high government officials, <BR>
 including the Secretary, and mass marketing via various media <BR>
 strategies.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 6. ESA should deliver the content of the NTDB using a full range of <BR>
 up-to-date computer techniques.<BR>
 <BR>
 Specifically, access to the NTDB via the Internet/National <BR>
 Information Infrastructure should become available as soon as <BR>
 possible, with dial-up service to follow.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Eliminating fee restrictions and increasing fees would greatly <BR>
 increase the content and quality of the data bank without the need <BR>
 for additional funds. New international data would literally &quot;open <BR>
 the world&quot; to NTDB customers (mostly U.S. businesses).<BR>
 <BR>
 U.S. businesses will be able to better research foreign markets to <BR>
 determine if they want to enter or expand operations in these <BR>
 markets. Improved access to world trade statistics will also improve <BR>
 the analysis of trade issues by policymakers and analysts. The cost <BR>
 of obtaining and disseminating this information to the public would <BR>
 be largely offset by customer charges.<BR>
 <BR>
 Adding export regulations and other trade information would improve <BR>
 the content and present a more complete set of information necessary <BR>
 for a business to engage in foreign trade. These data may be <BR>
 accommodated in the present NTDB environment without major fiscal <BR>
 impact, assuming it is provided in proper electronic format.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Internet/National Information Infrastructure provides an <BR>
 opportunity to immediately disseminate export promotion information <BR>
 to a largely untapped audience--schools and universities. <BR>
 Incorporation of the NTDB in programs to train students in <BR>
 international marketing, business, and economics would provide <BR>
 businesses with a ready supply of capable workers skilled in using <BR>
 tools of international trade.<BR>
 <BR>
 Although lifting the fee restriction would provide funds necessary to <BR>
 purchase additional information, the department must be prepared for <BR>
 some users declining to continue their subscriptions.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 ESA should attempt to recover the additional costs needed to <BR>
 implement these recommendations through increased user fees. The <BR>
 department should develop a fee schedule that would permit them to <BR>
 achieve the above recommendations. The department should establish a <BR>
 revised fee schedule for the NTDB. The actual impact of the fee <BR>
 increase cannot be estimated. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and <BR>
 the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collect many of the nation's <BR>
 most essential economic statistics. Much public sector economic <BR>
 analysis and private sector business planning depends on these <BR>
 statistics, which are collected through a wide variety of monthly, <BR>
 quarterly, and annual surveys and quinquennial economic censuses. <BR>
 Some of these surveys are mandatory; that is, response is mandated <BR>
 under law. Others are voluntary. Companies of all sizes, <BR>
 partnerships, and proprietorships are asked to respond. Some surveys <BR>
 are sent to only a few firms; others are sent to thousands.<BR>
 <BR>
 Inevitably, the collection of economic data by federal statistical <BR>
 agencies imposes a cost on the private sector. In collaboration with <BR>
 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), these agencies attempt to <BR>
 minimize this burden by simplifying surveys; eliminating outdated <BR>
 surveys; avoiding duplication among surveys; using alternative <BR>
 administrative records, such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <BR>
 records; and increasing use of electronic reporting techniques. Some <BR>
 costs cannot be avoided because the statistical agencies take <BR>
 elaborate precautions to assure the confidentiality of data supplied <BR>
 by respondents.<BR>
 <BR>
 &quot;Burden hours&quot; is the measurement used to measure the private sector <BR>
 costs necessary to comply with federal data collection activities. <BR>
 Each hour of an employee's time to fill out a survey questionnaire <BR>
 counts as one burden hour. Over fiscal years 1994-98, the business <BR>
 statistics collection programs of the three federal statistical <BR>
 agencies will incur about 29 million burden hours on U.S. businesses, <BR>
 at an estimated total cost of $870 million. Another way to illustrate <BR>
 the effort involved in collecting, tabulating, and publishing federal <BR>
 business statistics is to note the costs of the federal programs. In <BR>
 fiscal year 1994, the budgets for these business statistics programs, <BR>
 for the three agencies combined, will total almost $266 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 Simplifying data collection from the nation's businesses, linking <BR>
 their statistical reporting schedules to their internal data-<BR>
 generation schedules, instituting rolling reporting schedules to <BR>
 replace &quot;one-shot&quot; reports such as end-of-year reports, and putting <BR>
 all reporting on an electronic data interchange basis would save time <BR>
 and expense for businesses and the federal statistical system alike.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 Legislative barriers to the exchange of business data among federal <BR>
 statistical agencies should be eliminated.<BR>
 <BR>
 This would enable the federal government to significantly reduce the <BR>
 statistical reporting burden on American businesses. Since June 1993, <BR>
 a Statistics 2000 task force, composed of representatives from the <BR>
 three federal statistical agencies, has been working to develop <BR>
 strategies necessary to accomplish this goal. Implementation of the <BR>
 detailed proposals prepared by the task force will call for <BR>
 collaboration with the IRS, including amendment of certain provisions <BR>
 of law regarding the sharing of IRS data.<BR>
 <BR>
 The program should be developed in consultation with a group selected <BR>
 to represent the interests of American businesses. The end result <BR>
 will be a totally new statistical reporting system for most American <BR>
 companies. The program should concentrate on four immediate tasks:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Elimination of duplicated data requests from the three federal <BR>
 statistical agencies;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Development of common reporting formats and simplified data <BR>
 requests;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Development of rolling reporting schedules, timed as best as <BR>
 possible to conform to businesses' internal reporting routines and to <BR>
 avoid the bunching-up of data requests; and<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Adoption of electronic data interchange standards and procedures <BR>
 leading to a paperless reporting system.<BR>
 <BR>
 Progress in these four task areas would permit exploration of a fifth <BR>
 recommendation:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The restructuring of data collection activities to match company <BR>
 record keeping practices with agency data requests; for example, <BR>
 collecting selected data items for the 1997 Economic Census from <BR>
 companies' division or group levels rather than from individual <BR>
 operating units, and reengineering surveys so that annual surveys do <BR>
 not duplicate data collected during economic census years.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Implementation of this program could produce several benefits. First, <BR>
 it would reduce the burden hours placed on private-sector reporters. <BR>
 Burden hours cost companies an estimated $30 per hour. Preliminary <BR>
 analysis suggests that this program, once fully implemented, would <BR>
 cut business reporting costs by around $10 million in most years and <BR>
 by as much as $40 million in years when Economic Censuses occur.<BR>
 <BR>
 More timely and accurate reporting of data from the nation's largest <BR>
 companies could also be expected. An up-to-date &quot;moving picture&quot; of <BR>
 the business performance of the nation's largest companies would be <BR>
 an invaluable tool in assessing the economy's performance.<BR>
 <BR>
 Finally, an intensified collaboration among the three federal <BR>
 statistical agencies would lead to reductions in the costs of <BR>
 collecting, processing, and disseminating data, better data analyses, <BR>
 and improved understanding of the factors that drive performance <BR>
 among the biggest firms in the U.S. economy.<BR>
 <BR>
 Convincing industry that it would truly benefit from participating in <BR>
 the system will be a challenge, but adapting federal needs to <BR>
 companies' internal data procedures should encourage a favorable <BR>
 response to this proposal. In the near future, the automation of <BR>
 corporate data systems should reach the point at which compliance <BR>
 with federal statistical reporting requirements will be viewed as <BR>
 nothing more than a by-product of meeting corporations' own control <BR>
 needs.<BR>

 DOC12:  Establish a Single Civilian Operational<BR>
         Environmental Polar Satellite Program<BR>
 ***********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The United States is committed to an operational environmental polar <BR>
 satellite program because of the critical value of the data the <BR>
 satellites collect.(1) Polar satellites collect temperature and <BR>
 moisture measurements (key inputs to computer weather prediction <BR>
 models generating all national three- to five-day weather forecasts); <BR>
 measurements of the Antarctic ozone levels; long-term environmental <BR>
 measurements used to support global climate change studies; sea <BR>
 surface temperature measurements; and global cloud-cover images. <BR>
 Polar satellites also provide other valuable support missions, such <BR>
 as monitoring emergency distress beacons to aid search and rescue <BR>
 missions and worldwide data collection to support a variety of <BR>
 activities, such as endangered species monitoring.<BR>
 <BR>
 However, at present, the nation maintains two polar-orbiting <BR>
 meteorological satellite systems: (l) the National Oceanic and <BR>
 Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar-orbiting Operational <BR>
 Environmental Satellite (POES), for civil forecasting and research <BR>
 purposes; and (2) the Department of Defense (DOD) Defense <BR>
 Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) for national security <BR>
 purposes.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to these programs, the National Aeronautic and Space <BR>
 Administration (NASA) has initiated a climate research program called <BR>
 Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE). A key portion of this effort is the <BR>
 Earth Observing System (EOS), a series of six different satellites <BR>
 measuring various parameters critical to understanding global climate <BR>
 change. One of these satellites is called the EOS-PM (PM indicating <BR>
 that the satellite passes over the equator in the afternoon). The <BR>
 climate monitoring instruments on EOS-PM are basically more modern <BR>
 versions of the meteorological instruments currently flying on the <BR>
 NOAA weather satellites. In essence, the nation will have three <BR>
 different satellite systems with very similar capabilities.<BR>
 <BR>
 Over the past 20 years, the POES and DMSP programs have made numerous <BR>
 attempts to converge to the greatest extent possible.(2) The programs <BR>
 have similar spacecraft, use a common launch vehicle, share products <BR>
 derived from the data, provide complementary environmental data to <BR>
 the nation, and work closely together on research and development <BR>
 efforts. In all, the programs achieved substantial commonality, but <BR>
 national security concerns have precluded full convergence.(3)<BR>
 <BR>
 DOD has stated it would manage a converged system, but a single <BR>
 program run by DOD was and still is unacceptable given international <BR>
 concern over the militarization of space.(4) Today, however, with the <BR>
 end of the Cold War, the issues which have precluded complete <BR>
 convergence seem to have diminished in importance.(5) With both <BR>
 programs planning a new satellite design, the time is appropriate to <BR>
 consolidate their efforts. <BR>
 <BR>
 The EOS-PM climate research satellite is being designed with the idea <BR>
 that many of the instruments can be used by NOAA within the POES <BR>
 program. This continues a historical NOAA-NASA relationship wherein <BR>
 NASA develops new technology and demonstrates prototype hardware, and <BR>
 NOAA buys identical units for continued operational support.(6) <BR>
 However, current plans involve flying EOS-PM for 15 years, during <BR>
 which time POES also will have operational satellites.(7) Over most <BR>
 of this period, both programs would be flying duplicate instruments. <BR>
 The nation would be more efficiently served if NASA would develop and <BR>
 fly the prototypes once and then transfer the systems to NOAA's <BR>
 operational program for future flights.<BR>
 <BR>
 Convergence studies began in 1972 and have continued ever since.(8) <BR>
 NOAA recently performed an internal study of the opportunities <BR>
 available through convergence of the programs.(9) Recently, initial <BR>
 talks have begun among the three agencies with the goal of performing <BR>
 another study of convergence opportunities among the three <BR>
 programs.(10) What is needed, however, is a clear decision to create <BR>
 a single, civilian polar satellite program.<BR>
 <BR>
 Currently, the NOAA POES program, the DOD DMSP program, and the NASA <BR>
 EOS-PM program all are in various stages of developing new spacecraft <BR>
 and instruments. In the next 10 years, the estimated total cost for <BR>
 these three efforts exceeds $6 billion in development, production, <BR>
 and operations costs. However, many policy makers feel that the <BR>
 nation cannot afford to develop three separate satellite systems with <BR>
 such similar missions.<BR>
 <BR>
 For example, Congressman George Brown of California has stated that a <BR>
 converged system seems more achievable than in the past. He therefore <BR>
 has directed NOAA to work with DOD and NASA to &quot;jointly study and <BR>
 assess the possible benefits and mechanisms for merging all or parts <BR>
 of the three programs.&quot; (11) Senator James Exon of Nebraska was more <BR>
 direct in his letters to DOD and Commerce: &quot;The nation cannot afford <BR>
 to maintain and modernize two satellite weather constellations.&quot; (12) <BR>
 Recently, at the National Space Outlook Conference, Air Force General <BR>
 Charles Horner, Commander United States Space Command, stated: &quot;How <BR>
 you do convergence is really the question, not if you do <BR>
 convergence.&quot; (13)<BR>
 <BR>
 A single operational polar satellite program could meet the needs of <BR>
 all users by incorporating key DOD requirements into the NOAA POES <BR>
 program. Furthermore, the synergy achieved through DOD and NOAA <BR>
 cooperation could allow both agencies to meet critical operational <BR>
 requirements (such as collecting oceanographic and global <BR>
 tropospheric wind data) which neither agency has been able to afford <BR>
 alone. The converged operational program could save additional costs <BR>
 by using the NASA EOS program's state-of-the-art spacecraft and <BR>
 instruments instead of forcing NOAA to design and build its own. The <BR>
 result would be a single development program (compared to the three <BR>
 planned today) and minimal overlap between NASA's climate research <BR>
 and the NOAA-DOD converged operational meteorological missions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The difficulty will be to successfully incorporate DOD requirements <BR>
 into the program. Based upon historical studies, key areas requiring <BR>
 consideration are data deniability, orbit selection, international <BR>
 cooperation, and adequate oversight to ensure DOD concerns are <BR>
 adequately met.(14) The following summarizes how each of these can be <BR>
 addressed:<BR>
 <BR>
 Data deniability. The satellite must broadcast data free to everyone <BR>
 but also have the capability to deny data to specific adversaries. <BR>
 New technology, such as that used to deny cable-TV pay channels to <BR>
 non-subscribers, makes this task easier.<BR>
 <BR>
 Orbit selection. Currently, the DOD desires the capability to change <BR>
 its satellite orbits depending on mission requirements. Past studies <BR>
 have identified a three-satellite constellation as sufficient for <BR>
 meeting all orbit needs.(15) Allowing DOD to influence orbits <BR>
 selection should alleviate their concerns.<BR>
 <BR>
 International cooperation. A NOAA-led system could easily maintain <BR>
 and even improve international cooperation in environmental data <BR>
 exchange. However, since NOAA plans to use foreign satellites as part <BR>
 of the converged program, DOD may be reluctant to rely upon foreign <BR>
 satellites for important data. This concern could be alleviated by <BR>
 maintaining one or more ground spare U.S. satellites at all times <BR>
 that could be launched if a foreign-controlled satellite ever became <BR>
 unreliable.<BR>
 <BR>
 Oversight. DOD will require some mechanisms to ensure their <BR>
 requirements continue to be met. Possible implementation details <BR>
 could involve including DOD user and acquisition experts in the NOAA <BR>
 program offices and operations facilities, allowing DOD to fund and <BR>
 manage DOD-unique parts of the program, and establishing an <BR>
 interagency oversight group to which the program would have to report <BR>
 periodically to ensure that all agency requirements were adequately <BR>
 met. Such oversight mechanisms should not be difficult to achieve. <BR>
 The driving force behind this effort is clearly the desire to reduce <BR>
 costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Further cost reduction could be achieved through greater <BR>
 international participation. According to Dr. Ray A. Williamson of <BR>
 the Office of Technology Assessment: &quot;Greater international <BR>
 coordination and collaboration on sensors and systems . . . will <BR>
 eventually be needed in order to reap the greatest benefit from the <BR>
 world-wide investment in remote sensing.&quot; (16)<BR>
 <BR>
 NOAA is already working on such arrangements in its POES program by <BR>
 asking the Europeans to assume a greater role. An agreement in <BR>
 principle has been reached between NOAA and the European Organization <BR>
 for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) whereby <BR>
 EUMETSAT will purchase, launch, and operate one of the two current <BR>
 POES missions beginning in the year 2000. This will save the U.S. <BR>
 more than $100 million for each launch of one of these satellites. <BR>
 Such cooperation with the Europeans is an important component of <BR>
 cost-efficient operations and is the first step to a truly <BR>
 international environmental satellite observing system.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 Legislation should be enacted to establish a single environmental <BR>
 polar satellite program under the direction of NOAA.<BR>
 <BR>
 Congress should enact legislation to establish a single environmental <BR>
 polar satellite under the direction of NOAA. The legislation should <BR>
 direct NOAA, NASA, and DOD to undertake activities to establish this <BR>
 effort within their existing programs.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The proposed changes would allow for a more efficient, less-costly <BR>
 global satellite observation program. A strong, efficient U.S. polar <BR>
 environmental monitoring program would be the foundation for a <BR>
 cooperative international system. The Europeans already plan to <BR>
 increase funding for an element of this system. With a solid, unified <BR>
 U.S. national program in place, other countries may align their <BR>
 programs to complement the basic system. The result will be <BR>
 additional environmental data collected at minimal cost to the <BR>
 nation. The convergence concept provides a feasible and cost-<BR>
 effective opportunity to accurately monitor and predict the impact of <BR>
 the environment on the world's societies.<BR>
 <BR>
 The greatest difficulty in the proposal will be to ensure that a <BR>
 single, national program under civilian leadership will be responsive <BR>
 to national security needs. However, these concerns can be met much <BR>
 more easily now than they could have in the past. <BR>

 DOC13:  Use Sampling to Minimize the Cost <BR>
         of the Decennial Census<BR>
 *****************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The decennial census of population and housing is one of the federal <BR>
 government's largest and most expensive statistical programs. The <BR>
 full cycle cost of the 1990 census program (fiscal year 1984 through <BR>
 fiscal year 1993) will total nearly $2.6 billion.<BR>
 <BR>
 The results of the 1990 decennial census indicate that the current <BR>
 approach appears to have exhausted its potential for accurately <BR>
 counting the population at a reasonable cost. The Census Bureau's <BR>
 Year 2000 research and development staff has estimated that, if the <BR>
 current approach to the census is retained in the year 2000, the <BR>
 costs could rise to about $4.8 billion in current dollars. Moreover, <BR>
 the average cost per household (measured in 1980 dollars) has <BR>
 steadily increased, from $5.04 in 1950 to $12.10 in 1980 to $17.00 in <BR>
 1990. <BR>
 <BR>
 In 1990, accuracy fell below that of the 1980 census, while census <BR>
 costs escalated significantly. Between 1940 and 1980, the broad <BR>
 overall measure of census accuracy--the net undercount (the <BR>
 percentage of the population not counted) declined each census. <BR>
 However, the official estimate of the net undercount rose to 1.8 <BR>
 percent (4.7 million persons) in 1990, from 1.2 percent in 1980.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau's longstanding policy of attempting to gather data <BR>
 on each nonresponding household (more than 34 million in 1990) has <BR>
 resulted in a reliance on labor-intensive and time-consuming field <BR>
 operations (such as door-to-door canvassing). Such efforts are <BR>
 costly, both in terms of the $1.3 billion spent for census data <BR>
 collection and in the quality of the data collected. The costs of <BR>
 these efforts continue to rise in direct relationship to the <BR>
 declining response rate to census mail questionnaires, which fell by <BR>
 10 percentage points in 1990 to 65 percent. In addition, it is <BR>
 estimated that the error rate increases significantly for follow-up <BR>
 efforts on nonresponding households, as compared to persons counted <BR>
 primarily by mail return of questionnaires. The Census Bureau <BR>
 estimates that it could have saved $450 million if it had sampled 25 <BR>
 percent of the nonresponding households in 1990 rather than <BR>
 attempting to collect data on all of them.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau, however, is unable to use sampling to supplement <BR>
 its current enumeration-based method, due to the current statutory <BR>
 prohibition on the use of sampling in determining the census for the <BR>
 apportionment of Congress.<BR>
 <BR>
 Research by Census Bureau staff suggests that a number of factors, <BR>
 such as illiteracy, rising numbers of non-English speaking immigrants <BR>
 and concerns about privacy, may make the environment for census-<BR>
 taking even worse over the next decade. It is generally agreed that <BR>
 the current census methodology does not and cannot count the entire <BR>
 population, and that the challenges will continue to mount. As a <BR>
 result, the census undercount is likely to increase; costs will rise <BR>
 and the accuracy of the census will decrease.<BR>
 <BR>
 Sampling nonrespondents to support the enumeration-based method <BR>
 offers the opportunity to improve accuracy, reduce the undercount, <BR>
 and lower the cost of the census.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. Title 13, Section 195, of the U.S. Code should be amended to <BR>
 remove the current prohibition on the use of sampling in the census <BR>
 to determine the apportionment of Congress.<BR>
 <BR>
 Title 13, Section 195, of the U.S. Code should be amended to remove <BR>
 the current prohibition on the use of sampling in the census to <BR>
 determine the apportionment of Congress and authorize the Director of <BR>
 the Census Bureau to use sampling of nonrespondents to supplement the <BR>
 current enumeration-based method. While questions have been raised <BR>
 about the legality of sampling for the census count, according to <BR>
 Census Bureau officials, available legal opinions and case law do not <BR>
 appear to prevent the use of sample-based methods to supplement <BR>
 enumeration-based methods. However, congressional action must take <BR>
 place before the end of 1995 to allow the Census Bureau to make final <BR>
 design recommendations.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Census Bureau should begin planning for statistical sampling <BR>
 of nonrespondent households.<BR>
 <BR>
 The bureau should begin planning and developing a methodology to use <BR>
 statistical sampling of households that fail to respond to the mail-<BR>
 out census form for the 2000 census, rather than attempting to locate <BR>
 and count every individual.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Sampling nonrespondents would add sampling error to the census <BR>
 results. The key technical question is whether non-sampling errors <BR>
 can be reduced enough to offset the sampling error. For example, if <BR>
 the reduced workload resulting from sampling would lead to fewer <BR>
 errors, the total accuracy of the result may be better. The key <BR>
 policy issue to be addressed is whether various stakeholders--<BR>
 Congress, the states, localities, and businesses--are willing to <BR>
 accept census counts that are based in part on a sample.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 The potential savings from the use of sampling can be approximated <BR>
 through the use of the Bureau of Census' cost model. For example, in <BR>
 1992 dollars, it is estimated that approximately $300 million would <BR>
 have been saved with a 50-percent sample of the nonresponse follow-up <BR>
 workload in 1990. With a 25-percent sample, approximately $450 <BR>
 million could have been saved while maintaining the full complement <BR>
 of district offices; $650 million would have been saved with a <BR>
 reduced number of district offices.<BR>

 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce is an acknowledged leader in the <BR>
 dissemination of business and economic information through computer <BR>
 and telecommunication technology. The Economics and Statistics <BR>
 Administration (ESA) has been an outstanding innovator in the field. <BR>
 The Census Bureau began distributing its data on computer tape in the <BR>
 1960 Census and moved to CD-ROMs for the 1990 Census. The Bureau of <BR>
 Economic Analysis distributed its national economic account data on <BR>
 diskette in the early days of micro-computers. The Office of Business <BR>
 Analysis pioneered on-line dissemination of economic data with the <BR>
 Economic Bulletin Board, (EBB) and has greatly facilitated the <BR>
 department's export promotion function with the National Trade Data <BR>
 Bank on CD-ROM.<BR>
 <BR>
 ESA electronic dissemination products now go directly to almost <BR>
 400,000 individuals and organizations; through &quot;multipliers&quot; <BR>
 (information vendors, state and local government agencies, and <BR>
 educational institutions), ESA data reach as many as one million <BR>
 individuals and businesses in the U.S. Even so, many millions of <BR>
 individuals, businesses, and other organizations do not have access <BR>
 to basic information that would help them in their daily affairs and <BR>
 which would increase their understanding of choices open to them.<BR>
 <BR>
 New developments in computer technology and emerging <BR>
 telecommunications technologies present the department with a <BR>
 significant opportunity to expand the availability of its data <BR>
 services to businesses and individuals at limited costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Department of Commerce should build a business and economic <BR>
 information node for the information superhighway.<BR>
 <BR>
 ESA has already established an Internet (a global network of more <BR>
 than a million computers, spanning seven continents, with up to 20 <BR>
 million users) node for the EBB and is now proceeding to test that <BR>
 system with the Federal Depository Library system. The EBB should be <BR>
 extended to a full-scale economic and business information source.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. Commerce should establish common formats and protocols for data <BR>
 transfer and standards for data description for use within the <BR>
 department and for extension to the entire federal government <BR>
 information community.<BR>
 <BR>
 Precedent for this exists in the standards established for the EBB; <BR>
 the National Trade Data Bank, and the National Economic, Social, and <BR>
 Environmental Data Bank. Forty-one federal agencies already <BR>
 contribute to these products and use these standards. It is essential <BR>
 that business and economic information from the entire federal <BR>
 government be accessible in a unified way.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. Commerce should establish a prototype &quot;on-line&quot; business and <BR>
 economic information system in the White House (National Economic <BR>
 Council) to develop the concept, refine its data and communications <BR>
 standards, and create a state-of-the-art search and retrieval and <BR>
 analytical system.<BR>
 <BR>
 Later, dissemination techniques developed in the Internet test system <BR>
 can be combined with the most useful techniques of the White House <BR>
 system to create a first-rate business and economic information <BR>
 system for the National Information Infrastructure.<BR>

 <BR>
 These recommendations could bring the federal government <BR>
 significantly closer to connecting every citizen and U.S. business to <BR>
 the government through easy, low cost, direct access to information. <BR>
 At the end of these projects, government business and economics <BR>
 information would be directly available to 10 to 20 million citizens <BR>
 through Internet alone, and to millions more through secondary <BR>
 sources.<BR>
 <BR>
 On the negative side is the clear challenge these moves would present <BR>
 to the private information industry. In the past, these firms have <BR>
 vigorously protested any move by the government to make information <BR>
 directly available to the public and have adamantly protested &quot;value-<BR>
 added&quot; information products.<BR>

 DOC15:  Increase Access to Capital for Minority Businesses <BR>
 ***********************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 While the efforts of the federal government and Congress have helped <BR>
 to mitigate the effects of the historic exclusion of minority <BR>
 businesses from the competitive marketplace, minorities continue to <BR>
 experience obstacles to full participation in the free-enterprise <BR>
 system. The most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau <BR>
 indicate that while minorities comprise 19.7 percent of the <BR>
 population, they own 8.9 percent of American businesses. These <BR>
 businesses account for only 3.9 percent of the nation's gross <BR>
 business receipts and generate less than 3 percent of the employment <BR>
 produced annually--figures that have changed very little over the <BR>
 past 20 years .<BR>
 <BR>
 A recent report of the U.S. Commission on Minority Business <BR>
 Development determined that a lack of access to capital was one of <BR>
 the most formidable stumbling blocks to the formation and development <BR>
 of minority businesses. There is a long history of minority <BR>
 businesses' inability to gain access to capital and credit that, in <BR>
 part, accounts for the low entry rate of minorities into business and <BR>
 that has a direct impact on unemployment rates and other social <BR>
 problems. In addition, many minority businesses which start out under <BR>
 capitalized find it almost impossible to obtain capital or credit to <BR>
 expand their operations.<BR>
 <BR>
 Many believe that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), enacted more <BR>
 than 15 years ago to overcome barriers to credit and capital in <BR>
 economically disadvantaged communities, has failed. The CRA's impact <BR>
 has been limited due to an overemphasis on process, documentation, <BR>
 and good intentions rather than actual lending to or investments in <BR>
 low- and moderate- income neighborhoods and distressed rural <BR>
 communities.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to intrinsic barriers to obtaining capital and credit, <BR>
 minorities are also adversely impacted by the overall decline in <BR>
 lending to all small businesses because of economic conditions, bank <BR>
 regulatory requirements and tighter credit standards by lending <BR>
 institutions.<BR>
 <BR>
 The President has made it a major priority of his administration to <BR>
 address the problem of lack of access to credit for small- and <BR>
 medium-sized businesses and improve the effectiveness of the CRA. To <BR>
 support the President's efforts and to address the specific concerns <BR>
 of minority small businesses, the Secretary of Commerce and the <BR>
 Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) have <BR>
 established a working group to develop recommendations for improving <BR>
 federal assistance to minority businesses, with particular emphasis <BR>
 on access to capital and credit.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of SBA, upon <BR>
 completing their review of the various federal minority business <BR>
 assistance programs (with particular attention on the SBA section <BR>
 8(a) program and the programs of the Minority Business Development <BR>
 Agency) should make recommendations to the President for improving <BR>
 federal assistance to minority-owned small businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations should be made within 90 days of completing <BR>
 their report.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Secretary of Commerce should determine the feasibility of <BR>
 allocating a portion of Commerce's budget to provide assistance to <BR>
 state and non-profit organizations that provide innovative and <BR>
 alternative sources of credit and capital to minority-owned <BR>
 businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. The Secretary of Commerce should expand the capacity of the <BR>
 Minority Business Development Agency to identify and develop private <BR>
 and public sources of capital for minority small businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Secretary of Commerce should provide the President with <BR>
 recommendations to improve and strengthen the Community Reinvestment <BR>
 Act by November 1, 1994.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Improving federal assistance to minority businesses will contribute <BR>
 to the growth of the economy. Establishment of effective programs to <BR>
 promote the ability of minority business enterprises to participate <BR>
 in the competitive market is an important element in the planning and <BR>
 implementation of strategies to reduce unemployment and other <BR>
 economic and social problems in minority communities.<BR>
 <BR>
 Coordination of the two major federal minority assistance programs <BR>
 will more effectively address the practical problems that hinder the <BR>
 development of minority businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Development of a national strategy to provide capital and credit to <BR>
 minority businesses will improve the rate of entry of minorities into <BR>
 business and increase the chances for success for minority businesses <BR>
 in general.<BR>

 Summary<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 Fhe Department of Commerce has been in partnership with U.S. business <BR>
 for 80 years, seeking to maintain a prosperous, productive America. <BR>
 Over the past decade or so, however, the department slid from being <BR>
 an advocate of economic prosperity to a bystander. As the national <BR>
 and world economies changed, the department too often continued to <BR>
 rely on its traditional ways of doing business.<BR>
 <BR>
 The President and Secretary Brown believe the time has come for <BR>
 change. The fiercely competitive world economy, environmental threats <BR>
 and headlong technological change demand that the department re-<BR>
 examine its basic policies, programs, and operations.<BR>
 <BR>
 Under the Secretary's leadership, Commerce has begun that process to <BR>
 redefine the role it plays in the country's economic and <BR>
 environmental future; to realize the Secretary's determination to <BR>
 make Commerce a government leader; and to spread through the ranks of <BR>
 Commerce employees an optimism about the impact the agency can have <BR>
 and a commitment to a pragmatic, bottom-line approach. The Commerce <BR>
 Performance Review (CPR) has been the vehicle to launch the <BR>
 department in that direction.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Commerce approach is somewhat different from that of other <BR>
 agencies because of Secretary Brown's profound conviction that <BR>
 tapping the knowledge of employees will yield an abundance of <BR>
 improvement ideas. Events have borne him out. Nearly 8,000 ideas have <BR>
 flooded in from employees across the country and around the world.<BR>
 <BR>
 Change is the goal and this outpouring of help set the stage for <BR>
 change at every level. Few areas of the department will remain <BR>
 untouched as it proceeds to implement these ideas. They range from <BR>
 proposals to redirect legislation, to improvements in financial <BR>
 management, to methods of streamlining correspondence processing. <BR>
 Commerce will pursue every idea, regardless of whether it will save <BR>
 millions or merely make one person's job more satisfying.<BR>
 <BR>
 The department's review structure is designed to reflect both the <BR>
 department's central policy themes and its diverse program <BR>
 priorities. Its key elements are summarized below.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- An Executive Committee, consisting of the Secretary and his top <BR>
 staff, which is responsible for final review and approval of all <BR>
 ideas and for systematic review of implementation efforts;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- A Steering Committee (Assistant Deputy Secretary; Acting Chief <BR>
 Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration; <BR>
 Director for Budget, Planning, and Organization; Director for Human <BR>
 Resources Management; and Confidential Assistant to the Deputy <BR>
 Assistant Secretary which is responsible for day-to-day coordination <BR>
 of the idea-generation effort, oversight and assistance to working <BR>
 teams and cross-cutting teams, compilation of idea books for the <BR>
 Executive Committee, and design of the implementation effort.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- A bureau leader who is responsible for the success of this <BR>
 project within his or her bureau, including the introduction of the <BR>
 idea generation process to employees, process monitoring and <BR>
 evaluation and ranking of ideas.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Specific Reinvention Projects<BR>
 *****************************<BR>
 <BR>
 This report summarizes the results of the massive idea-generation <BR>
 process, but also describes a variety of other approaches pursued in <BR>
 parallel. The department painstakingly re-examined its mission and <BR>
 program priorities. Commerce launched a major customer outreach <BR>
 initiative, convened hundreds of managers into focus groups to share <BR>
 their expertise on a range of more than 20 topic areas, examined the <BR>
 needs and opinions of its customers, and carried out five major <BR>
 cross-cutting studies led by members of the Secretary's top staff.<BR>
 <BR>
 The department expects that it will save significant amounts of money <BR>
 through this process, and is convinced that it will do a better job <BR>
 of delivering products and services to its customers. Ultimately, <BR>
 there can be no more important goal than excellence, and the <BR>
 department plans to achieve that goal, based on the expectations of <BR>
 its customers and clients.<BR>
 <BR>
 The CPR initiative consists of four main components--idea generation, <BR>
 cross-cutting teams, focus groups, and reinvention labs.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 The Idea Generation Process<BR>
 ***************************<BR>
 <BR>
 Secretary Brown wanted to be sure every employee had opportunities to <BR>
 submit ideas. He launched this initiative with a May 19 letter to all <BR>
 employees asking for their support and ideas. After that, a variety <BR>
 of means were used to get the word out and seek ideas: a special <BR>
 electronic mail box for employees, a memo to all field employees from <BR>
 the directors of the Kansas City and Boulder Administrative Support <BR>
 Centers, a special departmental kick-off meeting in the auditorium, <BR>
 and a series of bureau-sponsored kick-offs.<BR>
 <BR>
 The response was encouraging; nearly 8,000 employee ideas arrived <BR>
 from throughout the country and around the world. The ideas were <BR>
 predominantly &quot;high-payoff&quot; ones.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Secretary's belief in the expertise and innovative spirit of <BR>
 employees is well-founded. The number of ideas received, their <BR>
 quality and creativity, and the obvious effort that went into them <BR>
 are ample evidence of the commitment of the Commerce work force to <BR>
 making the department a better and more effective place to work.<BR>
 <BR>
 The review process was intensive. Every idea was reviewed and <BR>
 evaluated by a bureau head, who was usually assisted by a team of <BR>
 employees, and then submitted for departmental review, first by the <BR>
 CPR Steering Committee and then by the CPR Executive Committee, which <BR>
 includes the Secretary. The Steering Committee then met with each <BR>
 bureau head and agreed upon follow-up implementation.<BR>
 <BR>
 In the meantime, Secretary Brown directed that implementation begin <BR>
 immediately. A number of important steps already have been taken . <BR>
 For example, the following internal procedures have been streamlined <BR>
 or eliminated:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The requirement for approval of travel by multiple persons to the <BR>
 same destination has been delegated to bureau heads.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The &quot;counterpart clearance&quot; process for personnel clearance has <BR>
 been eliminated.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The threshold for grants clearance has been raised to $100,000.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The threshold for clearance of advisory and assistance services <BR>
 contracts has been raised to $100,000.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The threshold for BankCard purchases has been raised.<BR>
 <BR>
 The department also selected priority ideas that will be fully <BR>
 researched and prepared as action documents. While some ultimately <BR>
 may not be implemented because of cost or other factors, all offer <BR>
 considerable potential for improving service delivery. Examples of <BR>
 topics being pursued include:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- expanding the availability and improving the quality of economic <BR>
 data on the newly independent states of the former U.S.S.R. and <BR>
 Eastern Europe;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- developing options for an annual forum on governmentwide <BR>
 technology transfer as a means of enhancing commercialization by the <BR>
 private sector;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- automating standard governmentwide and Commerce forms to reduce <BR>
 printing and labor costs;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- exploring methods to improve the department's effectiveness in <BR>
 handling fisheries collection cases in state and federal courts;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- proposing the establishment of a threshold of public burden hours <BR>
 for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s approval of public <BR>
 information collections; and<BR>
 <BR>
 --- examining the costs and benefits of automated fee collection for <BR>
 the public use of patent and trademark search systems.<BR>
 <BR>
 To supplement the internal idea generation process, the department <BR>
 will also seek the input of its customers. A preliminary customer <BR>
 survey (approved on an expedited basis by OMB) was used by five <BR>
 bureaus to provide information to support management improvements. <BR>
 The department is now working with the Bureau of the Census to <BR>
 develop a comprehensive customer survey methodology that will <BR>
 incorporate a combination of written surveys and interviews. This <BR>
 initiative will be part of the continuing effort to reinvent <BR>
 Commerce.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Cross-Cutting Teams<BR>
 *******************<BR>
 <BR>
 Shortly after the idea generation effort began, six cross-cutting <BR>
 programmatic teams were formed. Each was led by a bureau head and <BR>
 included members from throughout the department. They were selected <BR>
 because of their reputation for achievement and innovation. The teams <BR>
 examined broad functional areas, deliberately not confining <BR>
 themselves to traditional organizational boundaries, and developed a <BR>
 wide range of recommendations for the Secretary's approval. Their <BR>
 reports, just completed as this summary was prepared, include 35 <BR>
 proposals for action, including:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Establishing a one-stop source for computer access to government <BR>
 data on business, economics, international trade, and demographics;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Developing a coordinated intra-departmental program to inform <BR>
 industry of the need for ISO 9000 quality system standards <BR>
 registration and to educate them on its importance for global <BR>
 competitiveness;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Launching an initiative to have the department serve as focal <BR>
 point for U.S. firms to promote trade in oil and hazardous chemical <BR>
 spill response products, building on the department's own experience <BR>
 in this area;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Designing and implementing a prototype technology data bank, <BR>
 using CD-ROM technology, to offer U.S. manufacturers research <BR>
 reports, abstracts, and other data on new technology; and<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Establishing sustainable development as a unifying policy for <BR>
 Commerce programs, reflecting the administration's rejection of the <BR>
 false choice of economic development or environmental protection.<BR>
 <BR>
 These few examples serve to illustrate the breadth of ideas that have <BR>
 been advanced under this initiative. Commerce expects significant <BR>
 benefits to the public from better service delivery to result.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Focus Group Sessions<BR>
 ********************<BR>
 <BR>
 A source of getting new ideas is through a series of focus group <BR>
 sessions which brought together managers from different parts of the <BR>
 department in small, facilitated groups to generate and discuss ideas <BR>
 for improvement. The meetings were organized around specific themes, <BR>
 including five programmatic and seven administrative management <BR>
 topics.<BR>
 <BR>
 More than 400 employees, located both in Washington, D.C. and in the <BR>
 field, were asked to participate. Thirty focus group meetings were <BR>
 held, including 21 in the Washington, D.C. area and nine in five <BR>
 different field locations. The field sessions were held in Boulder <BR>
 and Denver, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; and <BR>
 Seattle, Washington.<BR>
 <BR>
 In general, headquarters participants tended to be concerned with the <BR>
 policy directions the department will take and how &quot;reinventing&quot; <BR>
 concepts will be used to facilitate change. Field managers, in <BR>
 contrast, tended to be more interested in administrative and <BR>
 management themes and, particularly, in increasing their authority <BR>
 through greater delegation. Specific proposals include the following <BR>
 examples:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Improving government's ability to work productively with U.S. <BR>
 standards-setting bodies to represent U.S. interests in the <BR>
 international arena;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Bringing together community-based field offices to work <BR>
 cooperatively on assistance programs;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Requiring value-added and cost-benefit analyses of all new or <BR>
 revised administrative processes, procedures, and rules;<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Simplifying security classification procedures by removing excess <BR>
 layers of clearance and relaxing the &quot;aggregate classification&quot; rule; <BR>
 and<BR>
 <BR>
 --- Analyzing the extent to which new technologies are moving <BR>
 overseas and why.<BR>
 <BR>
 These five ideas illustrate the range of nearly 100 specific <BR>
 proposals that emerged from the focus-group sessions, all of which <BR>
 are now under review for implementation.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Reinvention Laboratories<BR>
 ************************<BR>
 <BR>
 The fourth avenue for &quot;reinventing&quot; the department is the reinvention <BR>
 laboratory. This technique will enable Commerce to experiment with a <BR>
 variety of approaches to improving program performance. Five <BR>
 reinvention laboratories have been approved to date:<BR>
 <BR>
 The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) will experiment <BR>
 with means to provide one-stop, electronic service for business. Key <BR>
 components will be &quot;FedWorld,&quot; a pilot gateway to federal agency <BR>
 electronic bulletin boards, the comprehensive existing NTIS document <BR>
 collection, and electronic on-line dissemination techniques.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Bureau of the Census intends to reengineer the full census <BR>
 process using computer-assisted technologies. This approach reflects <BR>
 the move from traditional paper and pencil data collection to fully <BR>
 automated approaches.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) plans to experiment with a plan <BR>
 to allow employees to &quot;telecommute&quot; by performing a substantial <BR>
 portion of their duties at another work site, typically their homes. <BR>
 The experiment will build upon recent PTO advances in automated <BR>
 technology.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Bureau of Export Administration plans to deal creatively with its <BR>
 budget-driven downsizing by creating a more flexible, performance-<BR>
 driven organization, reducing costs without recourse to reductions in <BR>
 force.<BR>
 <BR>
 The department's Boulder, Colorado facility houses scientific <BR>
 laboratories from three bureaus. The reinvention laboratory there <BR>
 will experiment with ways to achieve more efficient operations by <BR>
 examining delegation of authority, service responsiveness, and other <BR>
 support-service mechanisms.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Lessons Learned<BR>
 ***************<BR>
 <BR>
 One of the most important lessons learned was that an effort to get <BR>
 ideas for improvement must have the clear support of top management <BR>
 to assure employees of the sincerity of the effort. Secretary Brown's <BR>
 commitment to this process was evident to all, from top program <BR>
 managers to part-time summer clerks. Connected to that principle is <BR>
 the necessity to provide adequate resources to manage the initiative <BR>
 and seek ideas through multiple channels.<BR>
 <BR>
 A second lesson is the necessity for an intensive follow-up. Commerce <BR>
 recognized that gathering and evaluating ideas was merely the <BR>
 beginning of the reinvention effort; ensuring that ideas are acted <BR>
 upon and employees and clients are informed of the results is the <BR>
 real challenge. Commerce will retain its present project structure <BR>
 throughout implementation, with supplemental staff to conduct careful <BR>
 monitoring.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition, Commerce believes that the involvement of field-office <BR>
 management and employees is critical to achieving the department's <BR>
 reinvention goals. In Commerce's case, nearly half of its staff is <BR>
 located outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and their <BR>
 perspective provided an invaluable means of reexamining our <BR>
 operations. As was confirmed by the focus group sessions and the <BR>
 ideas provided by employees, field staff tend to have a different <BR>
 slant on priorities and problems and are more concerned with <BR>
 operational issues.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Conclusion<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Department of Commerce has taken an ambitious approach to its <BR>
 reinvention effort. Its Commerce Performance Review has tapped the <BR>
 ideas of managers, employees, and customers. The full impact of the <BR>
 effort is not likely to be known for some time, as changes are <BR>
 implemented and benefits verified. But Commerce is working with a <BR>
 vast array of ammunition--nearly 8,000 ideas from employees, 100 <BR>
 recommendations from focus groups, and 30 detailed proposals from <BR>
 cross-cutting teams. Potential savings are significant, but these <BR>
 must be carefully researched. Credibility is critical to the <BR>
 continued success of this initiative, and the department must be sure <BR>
 that the results it expects will in fact occur.<BR>
 <BR>
 That principle applies to the less tangible, but equally important, <BR>
 improvements expected in customer service and product quality. That <BR>
 is the ultimate test of this effort and Secretary Brown is determined <BR>
 that the Department of Commerce not just meet but exceed expectations <BR>
 in this area. <BR>

 Executive Summary<BR>
 *****************<BR>
 <BR>
 The Small Business Administration (SBA) was established as an <BR>
 independent federal agency in 1953 to provide financial, management, <BR>
 technical, procurement, and related assistance to the nation's small <BR>
 businesses, giving particular attention to small minority-owned <BR>
 businesses. The agency employs about 4,000 people (excluding <BR>
 temporary disaster assistance personnel) with a fiscal year 1993 <BR>
 budget of $927.6 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 Almost 95 percent of all business credit extended through the SBA is <BR>
 provided in the form of loan guarantees. In 1992, nearly $6.4 billion <BR>
 in SBA-backed, generally long-term credit was provided to small <BR>
 businesses through banks, non-bank lenders, state and local <BR>
 development companies, and SBA-licensed investment companies.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA also administers a number of small direct loan programs, with <BR>
 1992 approvals totaling less than $100 million. These programs are <BR>
 designed to assist businesses owned by handicapped persons, veterans, <BR>
 minorities, and other disadvantaged individuals. A new &quot;microloan <BR>
 program&quot; provides small loans of up to $25,000 (averaging <BR>
 $9,700) to individuals attempting to start or expand businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA's disaster loan program provides direct loans to homeowners, <BR>
 renters, and businesses to repair damages or replace destroyed <BR>
 facilities in the wake of physical disasters. This program, along <BR>
 with the Individual and Family Grant program at the Federal Emergency <BR>
 Management Agency (FEMA), provide the primary sources of federal <BR>
 disaster relief to individuals.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to physical disaster loans, a generally small number of <BR>
 economic injury loans provide working capital to small businesses to <BR>
 assist them through the recovery period.<BR>
 <BR>
 Business development programs at SBA provide a combination of <BR>
 managerial and technical assistance to present and prospective <BR>
 business owners. Direct counseling, training, and business <BR>
 information are available at any of SBA's nearly 100 field offices, <BR>
 and approximately 57 Small Business Development Centers and 946 <BR>
 subcenters throughout the country. <BR>
 <BR>
 The National Performance Review (NPR) recommends that the application <BR>
 process for SBA's minority assistance program be streamlined to <BR>
 reduce the regulatory burden on applicants, program participants, and <BR>
 federal procuring agencies. To increase the amount of federal <BR>
 procurement opportunities available to minority small businesses, NPR <BR>
 recommends the establishment of a small disadvantaged set-aside <BR>
 program. <BR>
 <BR>
 NPR also recommends that federal procuring agencies use their <BR>
 existing authority to provide advance payments to participants in <BR>
 SBA's minority assistance program. NPR also recommends that the SBA <BR>
 Administrator provide the President with specific recommendations and <BR>
 legislative changes required to expand and lower the costs of SBA's <BR>
 credit programs. These changes would place greater emphasis on using <BR>
 both public and private resources to provide credit to small <BR>
 businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 The lack of access to credit for qualified small businesses has broad <BR>
 implications for the U.S. economy. To improve credit prospects for <BR>
 small businesses, NPR recommends a review of the bank examination <BR>
 guidelines to determine whether all small business loans made by <BR>
 well-capitalized institutions should be examined solely on <BR>
 performance. The NPR recommendation to establish user fees for the <BR>
 management and technical assistance provided by the Small Business <BR>
 Development Centers will encourage accountability to customers and <BR>
 ensure that the beneficiaries of this assistance pay a share of the <BR>
 program costs.<BR>
 <BR>
 The SBA microloan program provides critically needed small loans to <BR>
 start up businesses. NPR recommends that this program be changed from <BR>
 a direct loan program to a guaranty program that would enable SBA to <BR>
 assist many more small enterprises without increasing federal funding <BR>
 for the program.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Empowering Employees To Get Results<BR>
 ***********************************<BR>
 <BR>
 To improve service delivery to the small business community, SBA <BR>
 should establish a basic principle of staff distribution based on <BR>
 administrative efficiency and program workload. The recommendations <BR>
 to support this initiative include realignment of functions, <BR>
 increased use of automation in loan processing and loan servicing <BR>
 operations, improvement of data collection and automation efforts, <BR>
 and development of objective program performance measures.<BR>
 <BR>
 To improve the quality of data available on small business, NPR <BR>
 recommends that federal surveys that collect data on the economic <BR>
 activities of businesses be required to include a question on <BR>
 business size. The availability of these data would have major <BR>
 implications for environmental initiatives, tax-law changes, <BR>
 workplace requirements, export promotion, and energy policies.<BR>
 <BR>
 The overall savings from these recommendations is estimated at $17 <BR>
 million annually, not including $169 million in annual savings from <BR>
 changes in the general business-loan guaranty subsidy rates in the <BR>
 President's 1994 budget.<BR>

 SBA01: Allow Judicial Review of the Regulatory<BR>
        Flexibility Act<BR>
 **********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 Small businesses often feel overwhelmed by well-intentioned <BR>
 regulations that burden them with needless costs. Congress and the <BR>
 President recognized this problem in 1980 and enacted the Regulatory <BR>
 Flexibility Act (RFA). The RFA requires agencies to seek alternative <BR>
 regulatory solutions when their rules have a disproportionately <BR>
 severe impact on small entities, including small businesses and <BR>
 nonprofit organizations and relatively small government <BR>
 jurisdictions. However, most agencies have failed to perform the <BR>
 required RFA analysis. Rules continue to be issued even though the <BR>
 harm that resulted could have been alleviated had they been examined <BR>
 according to RFA guidelines.(1)<BR>
 <BR>
 For example, in 1986, Congress enacted the Emergency Planning and <BR>
 Community Right-To-Know Act, requiring local reporting of hazardous <BR>
 chemicals. The initial Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <BR>
 implementation instructions required reporting &quot;any amount&quot; of <BR>
 hazardous chemicals. The potential impact on small business was <BR>
 staggering. Even hotdog stands would have been required to report <BR>
 bottles of solvent or metal polish.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Office of Advocacy, which <BR>
 is directed by law to monitor compliance with the RFA, coordinated <BR>
 small business comments with EPA, which explored less burdensome <BR>
 alternatives. As a result of this process, EPA raised the threshold <BR>
 for reporting to 10,000 pounds of hazardous chemicals. This threshold <BR>
 eliminated hundreds of thousands of unnecessary reports, yet still <BR>
 covered more than 95 percent of the total quantity of stored <BR>
 chemicals and 100 percent of those in quantities likely to produce <BR>
 the sort of hazard that was the concern of the legislation.<BR>
 <BR>
 The RFA, which works in conjunction with the fundamental agency <BR>
 rulemaking law, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), leads <BR>
 rulemakers to one of two outcomes:<BR>
 <BR>
 (1) For rules that will have a significant economic impact upon a <BR>
 substantial number of small entities, the agency is required to <BR>
 perform a regulatory flexibility analysis. This analysis defines the <BR>
 burdens of the rule and examines alternatives that will lessen those <BR>
 burdens for small entities.<BR>
 <BR>
 (2) For rules that will not have a significant economic impact upon a <BR>
 substantial number of small entities, the agency must so certify, <BR>
 with a brief statement explaining the rationale behind this <BR>
 conclusion.<BR>
 <BR>
 While SBA's Office of Advocacy can ask agencies to follow the RFA, no <BR>
 mechanism for enforcing compliance exists. As a result, federal <BR>
 agency compliance is spotty at best. A few agencies, such as the EPA, <BR>
 the Food Safety Inspection Service, and the Nuclear Regulatory <BR>
 Commission, now consistently use the RFA to reduce the regulatory <BR>
 burden imposed on small entities. Most agencies employ simplistic <BR>
 analysis that barely meet even the minimal requirements of the RFA. <BR>
 Others, including the Internal Revenue Service, define their <BR>
 rulemaking activities in the Federal Register as &quot;interpretative, a <BR>
 category excluded from RFA responsibilities.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 Several administrative efforts have been made to improve the level of <BR>
 responsiveness to the RFA, but with little success. The fundamental <BR>
 solution is judicial review, an approach favored by small business. <BR>
 Such review is permitted for agency rulemaking under the APA. <BR>
 However, the RFA itself prohibits judicial review of agency <BR>
 compliance with the RFA. Courts have further restricted the use of <BR>
 RFA analysis as evidence in suits brought under the APA.<BR>
 <BR>
 For the RFA to succeed at its goal of avoiding needless government <BR>
 regulatory burdens on small entities, sanctions for non-compliance <BR>
 with the RFA must be created.<BR>
 <BR>
 With judicial review, small entities could challenge an agency's <BR>
 failure to perform an RFA review or a flawed RFA review. They could <BR>
 sue in the appropriate federal court and, if they won, the court <BR>
 could order the agency to explain its RFA determination or develop <BR>
 appropriate alternatives under the RFA. A credible threat of lawsuits <BR>
 would give agencies a strong motive to ensure that the RFA is <BR>
 followed.<BR>
 <BR>
 Judicial review is supported by all major small business <BR>
 associations, including the American Small Business Association, the <BR>
 American Trucking Association, the National Association for the Self-<BR>
 Employed, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National <BR>
 Federation of Independent Business, National Small Business United, <BR>
 the National Society of Public Accountants, the Small Business <BR>
 Legislative Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.(2)<BR>
 <BR>
 To create better compliance with the RFA and avoid needless lawsuits, <BR>
 the availability of judicial review must be accompanied by systematic <BR>
 compliance guidelines for agencies concerning how to conduct RFA <BR>
 reviews. For more than a decade, most agencies have failed to develop <BR>
 such guidelines on their own.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 should be amended to allow <BR>
 for judicial review of agency determinations under the RFA.(3)<BR>
 <BR>
 This approach would allow small entities that have been injured by an <BR>
 agency action to seek judicial relief. This would be possible only <BR>
 after an agency has published a final rule, not at any earlier point <BR>
 in the rulemaking process.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. An Executive Order should be issued requiring the SBA Office of <BR>
 Advocacy to issue governmentwide guidance on appropriate processes <BR>
 for complying with the analytical requirements of RFA.(4)<BR>
 <BR>
 This approach would provide consistent technical guidance--the <BR>
 foundation for avoiding lawsuits.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The potential for judicial review would give agencies greater <BR>
 incentive to meet their present statutory obligations to consider the <BR>
 impact of their rules on small entities. Agency lawyers would ensure <BR>
 that the agency would properly comply with the RFA to avoid the valid <BR>
 threat of litigation.<BR>
 <BR>
 Judicial review is not expected to lead to a large number of <BR>
 lawsuits.(5) No basis for suits would exist if agencies conducted an <BR>
 appropriate RFA review. As a practical matter, most regulations to <BR>
 which small entities have significant objections are already in <BR>
 litigation; judicial review of RFA would at most add another ground <BR>
 to these challenges. A few new cases based solely on RFA failure <BR>
 might result, in instances in which the impact of rules on small <BR>
 entities is sufficiently negative to impose greater costs than the <BR>
 cost of litigation--a fairly high threshold. In these rare cases, a <BR>
 challenge may be in the nation's best interests.<BR>
 <BR>
 In the most extreme cases, judicial review of RFA could lead to an <BR>
 initial flurry of lawsuits. Once the first few cases are decided, <BR>
 however, the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable agency <BR>
 behavior under RFA would become well-known to agency attorneys and <BR>
 the administrative law bar. After that, legal challenges could be <BR>
 expected to fall off dramatically.(6)<BR>
 <BR>
 Both the process for developing SBA guidance and the guidance itself <BR>
 would help achieve compliance with the RFA. The notice, comment, and <BR>
 public hearings phase would raise the level of awareness in federal <BR>
 agencies about the RFA. Furthermore, the Office of Advocacy expects <BR>
 that the guidance ultimately developed will provide agencies with a <BR>
 map sufficiently detailed to allow them to navigate their way through <BR>
 the RFA with minimal effort.<BR>
 <BR>
 The RFA does not impose a requirement for an agency to collect <BR>
 additional data except in rare instances in which data originally <BR>
 collected was insufficient to understand the problem the rule was <BR>
 trying to solve.(7) In such cases, the additional task of information <BR>
 collection should not be attributed to the RFA but to an agency's <BR>
 failure to meet its obligations for reasoned decision-making.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 Judicial review of the RFA imposes no costs outside the government. <BR>
 In rare cases where there is no court challenge of regulations on <BR>
 grounds other than the RFA and the cost of unnecessary or overly <BR>
 burdensome regulations is greater than the cost of litigation, small <BR>
 entities may choose to incur the cost of bringing suit based solely <BR>
 on an RFA violation. The cost to these entities cannot be estimated <BR>
 but would be seen by them as a net savings.<BR>
 <BR>
 Procedures to implement the RFA would be limited to federal agencies. <BR>
 The costs inside the federal government are difficult to estimate <BR>
 because the costs of rulemaking are not a line item and are generally <BR>
 not well-measured. The best estimates available suggest a maximum <BR>
 average of one work day per rule when there is no substantial impact <BR>
 on small entities, a total effort that should be absorbed in the <BR>
 current personnel ceiling.(8) Over the years, SBA has found that only <BR>
 30 to 50 rules a year have significant negative impact on small <BR>
 entities.<BR>
 <BR>
 If agencies do not comply with RFA, costs for litigation would <BR>
 certainly accrue. The marginal cost of RFA suits cannot be calculated <BR>
 in advance. Additional funds should not be budgeted for such costs.<BR>

 &quot;For purposes of section 702 of title 5, determinations made pursuant <BR>
 to this chapter shall only be reviewable upon publication or service <BR>
 of a rule as required by section 553(d) of title 5.&quot; <BR>
 <BR>
 4. Implementing instructions for complying with the analytical <BR>
 requirements in sections 603, 604, and 605 of the RFA can be brought <BR>
 about by the following executive order: &quot;The Small Business <BR>
 Administration Office of Advocacy shall: Issue guidance to federal <BR>
 agencies for the implementation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <BR>
 Such guidance shall be developed after consultation with affected <BR>
 agencies and after such public hearings as may be appropriate. The <BR>
 guidance will be designed to ensure that the analysis conducted under <BR>
 the Act provide data and reasonable alternatives.&quot; This approach was <BR>
 used successfully in 1977 to provide a framework for all federal <BR>
 agencies in meeting the requirement to examine environmental impacts <BR>
 of federal actions mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act <BR>
 of 1969 (NEPA). This approach was tested in the Supreme Court, and <BR>
 has been favorably commented on by that court several times. Such <BR>
 guidance would help agencies defend their actions in any legal <BR>
 challenges under the RFA. <BR>
 <BR>
 5. Conflicting interpretations of NEPA requirements by various <BR>
 agencies often lead to litigation; this problem will be avoided by <BR>
 the systematic guidance called for in Recommendation 2. <BR>
 <BR>
 6. This occurred with litigation under NEPA. <BR>
 <BR>
 7. NEPA imposed a significant obligation on agencies to collect data <BR>
 on environmental impacts, something they had not done prior to the <BR>
 passage of NEPA. This was a source of substantial cost and concern to <BR>
 agencies. <BR>
 <BR>
 8. SBA reviews about 1,500 rules per year that may be relevant to <BR>
 small entities. An average RFA analysis is two paragraphs to two <BR>
 pages in length, and should require less than one work day to <BR>
 assemble. Based on the extreme assumption that no RFA analysis is <BR>
 being done now and that each new one was done at the high end of the <BR>
 range, this would generate a total governmentwide burden of about six <BR>
 work-years for the routine cases. This burden is spread over the <BR>
 policy staff of hundreds of agencies, so it seems unlikely that <BR>
 additional positions would be required.<BR>

 SBA02:Improve Assistance to Minority Small Businesses<BR>
 *****************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 While the efforts of the federal government and Congress have helped <BR>
 to mitigate the effects of years of minority exclusion from the <BR>
 marketplace, and a broad spectrum of minority businesses have <BR>
 benefited from the programs available under the Small Business <BR>
 Administration (SBA), the Department of Commerce, and other federal <BR>
 agencies, minority businesses continue to experience significant <BR>
 obstacles to success.<BR>
 <BR>
 The most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that <BR>
 while minorities constitute nearly 20 percent of the population, they <BR>
 own less than 9 percent of American businesses. These businesses <BR>
 account for less than 4 percent of the nation's gross business <BR>
 receipts and generate less than 3 percent of the employment produced <BR>
 in this country annually--figures that have changed very little over <BR>
 the past 20 years.<BR>
 <BR>
 Minorities have a business participation rate only one-fourth of that <BR>
 found among non-minorities. Despite actions taken to date, it is <BR>
 clear that much remains to be done to bring the nation closer to the <BR>
 goal of ensuring equal participation of all Americans in the free <BR>
 enterprise system.<BR>
 <BR>
 The SBA's Section 8(a) program is one of the federal government's <BR>
 major programs for providing assistance to minority-owned small <BR>
 businesses. The program has provided about 10,000 firms with federal <BR>
 contracts worth $40 billion since 1968.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized SBA to enter into contracts <BR>
 with federal agencies and to subcontract work to small businesses. <BR>
 However, for 15 years SBA did not use its section 8(a) authority <BR>
 because it believed that the effort to start and operate such a <BR>
 program was not worthwhile in terms of developing small businesses. <BR>
 SBA first used its section 8(a) authority in 1968, to support a pilot <BR>
 program initiated as a result of the 1967 civil disturbances. SBA <BR>
 offered noncompetitive contracts to small businesses agreeing to <BR>
 locate in economically depressed areas and hire the unemployed and <BR>
 the underemployed. During the pilot period, SBA recognized that a <BR>
 better solution to unemployment involved more than job creation, and <BR>
 that business ownership opportunities should be offered to minorities <BR>
 and other disadvantaged individuals.<BR>
 <BR>
 Since 1978, Congress has made three major legislative attempts to <BR>
 improve the program and to emphasize the program's business <BR>
 development mission. As currently structured, the Section 8(a) <BR>
 program is administered by SBA for small businesses owned and <BR>
 controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged U.S. citizens. <BR>
 To participate, firms must apply and meet SBA eligibility criteria. <BR>
 Program participation is limited to nine years. Firms may receive a <BR>
 variety of business development assistance, including management and <BR>
 technical assistance, direct SBA loans, surety bond waivers, transfer <BR>
 of government surplus property, and federal contracts awarded under <BR>
 special procedures.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA enters into contracts with federal agencies and subcontracts the <BR>
 performance of the contracts to eligible 8(a) participant firms. <BR>
 Competition is required under the 8(a) program for manufacturing <BR>
 contracts with a total value, including all options, of more than $5 <BR>
 million, and for contracts in all other industries valued at more <BR>
 than $3 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 While the program has produced a number of successful minority-owned <BR>
 small businesses, it has been subject to much criticism and scrutiny <BR>
 by Congress, the General Accounting Office, SBA's Inspector General, <BR>
 and the National Academy of Public Administrators.<BR>
 <BR>
 Congress, during a 1988 revision of the program, found that access to <BR>
 the program was an inordinately lengthy and burdensome process and <BR>
 that the program's administration was inefficient and inequitable. <BR>
 Congress also found that many federal procuring agencies have failed <BR>
 to identify and offer the necessary amount of contract support to <BR>
 allow for the diversification and growth of disadvantaged businesses <BR>
 participating in the program. Finally, Congress determined that <BR>
 insufficient attention and support had been given to the program's <BR>
 business development objectives, so that few concerns were prepared <BR>
 to compete successfully in the marketplace upon exiting the program.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Section 8(a) program still has difficulty in meeting its business <BR>
 development objectives. The application process remains cumbersome, <BR>
 and reporting requirements are numerous. Many program participants <BR>
 receive little or no contract support, and the program's data <BR>
 collection and automation efforts have not yet been fully <BR>
 implemented. Some federal procuring agencies have failed to give <BR>
 serious consideration to the goal-setting process for 8(a) set-aside <BR>
 and small business set-aside contracts. Some SBA offices are slow to <BR>
 make contract awards because of their volume of activity. Even after <BR>
 participating in the 8(a) program, some firms continue to experience <BR>
 difficulties in competing in the private sector and obtaining major <BR>
 federal procurements.<BR>
 <BR>
 Section 8(a) application processing time has been a consistent <BR>
 problem throughout the program's history, prompting Congress in 1989 <BR>
 to legislatively mandate a 90-day processing time for all 8(a) <BR>
 applications. Prior to this, application processing times ran as long <BR>
 as 340 to 560 days. However, the legislatively mandated 90-day <BR>
 application processing time still has not been met; the current <BR>
 process averages about 140 days. Moreover, in 1978, Congress mandated <BR>
 that all program eligibility determinations would be made by one <BR>
 individual, the associate administrator for Minority Small Business <BR>
 and Capital Ownership Development. The substantial number of <BR>
 eligibility determinations that have to be made each year <BR>
 (approximately 2,000) limit this individual's ability to focus on the <BR>
 entire program.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA's role as prime contractor in the 8(a) contracting process has <BR>
 been questioned by the U.S. Commission on Minority Business. The <BR>
 commission concluded that the three-party arrangement is a &quot;process <BR>
 which consumes more time than needed, but contributes nothing of real <BR>
 substance to the development of the 8(a) firm.&quot; The Department <BR>
 of Defense (DOD) Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying <BR>
 Acquisition Laws (Section 800 Panel) reached the same conclusion.<BR>
 <BR>
 Historically, the amount of federal prime contracts awarded to <BR>
 minority firms has been limited. Currently, DOD is the only federal <BR>
 agency with the authority to set aside contracts for competition <BR>
 among small disadvantaged businesses, which gives the agency an <BR>
 additional tool to assist minority small businesses. Extending this <BR>
 authority to civilian agencies would expand federal procurement <BR>
 opportunities for both 8(a) program participants and other minority <BR>
 small businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Prior to fiscal year 1993, SBA provided &quot;advance payments&quot; to <BR>
 8(a) program participants to help them meet financial requirements <BR>
 related to the performance of a specific 8(a) sole-source <BR>
 subcontract. Advance payments were considered a source of last-resort <BR>
 financing and were only available to a firm if it could demonstrate <BR>
 that it had been unsuccessful in obtaining financing from any other <BR>
 commercial or governmental source. Advance payments and contract <BR>
 proceeds were jointly controlled by SBA and the 8(a) participant <BR>
 through the use of a special bank account, and SBA was repaid during <BR>
 the course of contract performance.<BR>
 <BR>
 Effective October 1, 1992, SBA's ability to provide advance payments <BR>
 ended. The termination of this program resulted from SBA's <BR>
 determination that the advance payment program was a loan program <BR>
 under the meaning of the Credit Reform Act of 1990 and therefore <BR>
 required specific appropriation. Despite SBA's request, Congress did <BR>
 not appropriate funds for advance payments during fiscal year 1993. <BR>
 In addition, when reprogramming of funds was sought to finance this <BR>
 program, the staff of the House Small Business Committee questioned <BR>
 whether SBA was authorized to provide advance payments.<BR>
 <BR>
 In recognition of the tremendous problems facing minority small <BR>
 businesses and as a part of their internal reinvention efforts, the <BR>
 administrator of SBA and the Secretary of Commerce have established a <BR>
 joint working group to re-examine the services and products targeted <BR>
 for the minority small business community through the Minority <BR>
 Business Development Agency (MBDA), SBA, and other federal programs. <BR>
 This working group is in the early stages of reviewing these programs <BR>
 and will develop recommendations for consideration by the SBA <BR>
 Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce.<BR>
 <BR>
 This joint review is currently focusing on making minority programs <BR>
 more accessible, making it easier to monitor program compliance, <BR>
 providing better business development assistance, making it easier <BR>
 for procuring agencies to support minority small businesses, <BR>
 expanding contract opportunities for minority small businesses, and <BR>
 providing assistance to those firms that have completed the 8(a) <BR>
 program. The objective is not only to increase the participation rate <BR>
 of minority small businesses in the U.S. economy but also to make <BR>
 these programs operate efficiently at a lower overall cost to the <BR>
 government.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. By December 1, 1994, The Administrator of SBA and the Secretary of <BR>
 Commerce, on completion of their review of federal minority business <BR>
 assistance programs, should recommend improvements in federal <BR>
 assistance to minority small businesses to the President.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The SBA Administrator should streamline the 8(a) application <BR>
 process to reduce the amount of time involved.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 3. The Small Business Act should be amended to allow the associate <BR>
 administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership <BR>
 Development to delegate authority for final determinations of Section <BR>
 8(a) program eligibility.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 4. The Small Business Act should be amended to allow SBA to delegate <BR>
 contract award functions to federal procuring agencies, so long as <BR>
 they consistently abide by federal acquisition and SBA 8(a) program <BR>
 regulations, and to provide SBA with the authority to conduct reviews <BR>
 to verify compliance with 8(a) program regulations.<BR>
 <BR>
 This recommendation would not alter SBA's authority to ensure that a <BR>
 contract requirement offered for the 8(a) program is appropriate for <BR>
 award under the program, or that the business selected to perform the <BR>
 contract is eligible for the award.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 5. The Small Business Act should be amended to require federal <BR>
 procuring agencies to use their existing authority to provide advance <BR>
 payments on 8(a) contracts, when such funding is necessary to <BR>
 contract performance.<BR>
 <BR>
 This would not require any additional appropriation of funds, since <BR>
 it would involve an advance of contract proceeds.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 6. The Small Business Act should be amended to provide civilian <BR>
 agencies the same authority that DOD currently has for its own &quot;Small <BR>
 Disadvantaged Business Set-Aside&quot; program.<BR>
 <BR>
 These amendments should be structured to ensure the continued support <BR>
 of the 8(a) program by precluding agencies from reducing the number <BR>
 and dollar value of 8(a) contracts.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Improved assistance to minority small businesses would contribute to <BR>
 the growth of the U.S. economy. Effective programs promoting the <BR>
 ability of minority business enterprises to participate in the <BR>
 competitive market would be an important element in the planning and <BR>
 implementation of strategies to reduce unemployment and other <BR>
 problems in minority communities. Coordination of the two major <BR>
 federal minority assistance programs would more effectively address <BR>
 the practical problems that hinder the development of minority <BR>
 businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Reducing the regulatory burden of 8(a) certification and program <BR>
 participation should reduce the cost of participating in the program. <BR>
 Streamlining the application process and allowing the delegation of <BR>
 eligibility determinations would make the program more accessible, <BR>
 lower application processing times, and increase the number of <BR>
 participants.<BR>
 <BR>
 Allowing SBA the authority to delegate its contracting function to <BR>
 federal procuring agencies would provide them with an additional <BR>
 incentive to offer contracts to the program.<BR>
 <BR>
 Requiring federal procuring agencies to use their existing authority <BR>
 to provide advance payments to 8(a) participants would create a <BR>
 valuable source of financial assistance without any additional <BR>
 appropriation.<BR>
 <BR>
 A complete review of federal minority business assistance programs <BR>
 should result in comprehensive legislation to ensure that minority <BR>
 small businesses receive the necessary assistance to compete and grow <BR>
 in the U.S. economy.<BR>
 <BR>
 Allowing civilian agencies the same authority as DOD to establish a <BR>
 Small Disadvantaged Business Set-Aside program would produce an <BR>
 additional vehicle to meet disadvantaged goals, and give small <BR>
 disadvantaged businesses greater access to the federal procurement <BR>
 market.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>

 budget authority.<BR>

 SBA03:  Reinvent the U.S. Small Business<BR>
         Administration's Credit Programs<BR>
 ****************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA's) primary role is as a <BR>
 lender of last resort for the nation's small businesses. SBA also <BR>
 promotes the expansion of credit and capital available to small <BR>
 businesses in the private sector. With a total loan portfolio of $20 <BR>
 billion, SBA's credit programs have provided some relief for <BR>
 borrowers unable to obtain loans without a federal guaranty. Demand <BR>
 for the agency's credit programs is at an all-time high, forcing the <BR>
 agency to seek supplemental budget authority in fiscal years 1992 and <BR>
 1993.<BR>
 <BR>
 About 95 percent of all business credit extended by SBA is provided <BR>
 in the form of loan guaranties. In 1992, nearly $6.4 billion of SBA-<BR>
 backed, generally long-term credit was provided to small businesses <BR>
 through banks, non-bank lenders, state and local development <BR>
 companies, and SBA-licensed investment companies.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA administers a number of small direct loan programs, with 1992 <BR>
 approvals totaling approximately $100 million. These programs are <BR>
 designed to assist small businesses owned by handicapped persons, <BR>
 veterans, minorities, and other disadvantaged individuals and <BR>
 participants in the section 8(a) program. A new microloan program <BR>
 received a little more than $30 million in funding annually over the <BR>
 last two years to provide small loans of up to $25,000 (averaging <BR>
 $9,700) to individuals attempting to start or expand businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 The lack of access to credit for small and medium-size businesses has <BR>
 been of great national concern over the past few years. The <BR>
 Comptroller of the Currency, in April 29, 1993, testimony before the <BR>
 U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Small Business, reported <BR>
 that total lending by national banks has fallen by $85 billion, or <BR>
 6.7 percent, over the past two years. Furthermore, commercial and <BR>
 industrial loans and real estate construction loans have accounted <BR>
 for most of this decline.<BR>
 <BR>
 Some of the decline in loan volume is due to weak loan demand and <BR>
 structural changes in the banking industry that have tightened <BR>
 lending standards. Also contributing to the problem is an ongoing <BR>
 decline in the availability of credit from troubled banks that seek <BR>
 to work out bad loans and rebuild capital.<BR>
 <BR>
 To address this lack of credit, the administration has taken several <BR>
 initiatives to encourage banks to increase loans to small and medium-<BR>
 size businesses. While these efforts are expected to increase private <BR>
 lending to small businesses, the demand for SBA loans probably will <BR>
 continue to increase and to exceed the funding levels available to <BR>
 support SBA credit programs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Most of SBA's credit programs have been in place for several years, <BR>
 and held to the same application and credit review processes since <BR>
 the programs were first designed.<BR>
 <BR>
 The SBA Administrator, in recognition of small businesses' credit <BR>
 difficulties, and of the fact that SBA's credit programs have changed <BR>
 very little since their creation, has undertaken a complete review of <BR>
 SBA's credit programs. This review involves the participation of <BR>
 small businesses, private lenders, and SBA employees.<BR>
 <BR>
 The objective of this review is to make credit programs more user-<BR>
 friendly and more accessible to lending partners and small business <BR>
 clients. Moreover, the review is attempting to find ways to increase <BR>
 small loans to firms and to become more proactive in credit programs <BR>
 for industries with a potential for creating jobs, becoming involved <BR>
 in international trade, and producing critical technologies. In <BR>
 addition, the agency plans to work with its leading lenders to <BR>
 identify ways to increase lending in areas specified under the <BR>
 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 The SBA Administrator, upon completion of his review of SBA's credit <BR>
 programs, should provide a report to the President that outlines <BR>
 specific recommendations, including necessary legislative changes, to <BR>
 improve, expand, and lower the costs of the SBA credit programs.<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations should be made by November 1, 1994. The SBA <BR>
 review should seek to accomplish its objectives without additional <BR>
 funding. The review should result in reduced costs (subsidy rates) <BR>
 for SBA credit programs and effective leverage of public- and <BR>
 private-sector resources to expand the availability of SBA credit.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Improvements in SBA's credit programs would make more funds available <BR>
 to small businesses at lower overall costs, enable the agency to <BR>
 operate more effectively, become more responsive to small business <BR>
 credit needs, and be more acceptable to financial institutions.<BR>
 <BR>

 SBA04:  Examine Federal Guidelines for Small<BR>
         Business Lending Requirements<BR>
 ********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 Economic recovery depends in part on the effectiveness with which <BR>
 bank loans support small business. Unlike previous post-war <BR>
 recessions, many of today's new jobs will be created by small <BR>
 businesses, while large businesses continue to &quot;downsize.&quot;     <BR>
 <BR>
 Big business has other sources of credit; private individuals can <BR>
 choose between numerous institutions for savings and investment; <BR>
 commercial finance companies and venture capital firms now meet some <BR>
 financial needs. But banks are the primary lend<BR>
 <BR>
 Many factors constrain a bank's decision regarding loans to small <BR>
 business. The stringent review and documentation requirements imposed <BR>
 on small business loans by banking regulators have helped discourage <BR>
 banks from making such loans and encouraged them to shift their <BR>
 resources elsewhere.<BR>
 <BR>
 On a large loan, the cost of this burden can be amortized over a <BR>
 large base. But the paperwork burden--virtually a fixed cost--is <BR>
 proportionately much greater for a small loan. Banks report that <BR>
 their cost for making small business loans has reached the point that <BR>
 many no longer find it worth the trouble.<BR>
 <BR>
 The President has called this difficulty in obtaining credit for <BR>
 qualified small business borrowers a &quot;credit crunch.&quot; The <BR>
 administration has moved aggressively to address the problem. On <BR>
 March 10, 1993, the President unveiled his Credit Availability <BR>
 Program. The program is designed to be completed in two phases. The <BR>
 first phase focused on several regulatory areas to be addressed <BR>
 within three months of the program's announcement, including the <BR>
 following five initiatives.<BR>
 <BR>
 First, the regulators released a policy statement permitting strong <BR>
 banks to make and carry some loans to small and medium-sized <BR>
 businesses and farms with minimal documentation. Such loans may equal <BR>
 no more than 20 percent of an institution's capital. Instead of <BR>
 concentrating on the underwriting standards of such loans, the <BR>
 examiners will look more to performance and the borrower's prospects <BR>
 for repaying.<BR>
 <BR>
 Second, the regulators are revising regulations to reduce the burden <BR>
 of real estate appraisals, by increasing to $250,000 the threshold <BR>
 level at or below which certified or licensed appraisals are not <BR>
 required. The administration is concerned that, in some cases, <BR>
 appraisals are so expensive that they make sound loans to small <BR>
 businesses uneconomical. Another regulatory change will enable banks <BR>
 to dispose of foreclosed real estate more quickly. By getting <BR>
 acquired properties into the hands of homeowners and investors <BR>
 sooner, banks will free up money used to carry these properties for <BR>
 use in new loans.<BR>
 <BR>
 Third, the regulators are working to eliminate duplicative <BR>
 examination processes and procedures involving two or more agencies. <BR>
 By coordinating their efforts, the agencies will reduce the time <BR>
 bankers must spend dealing with regulators and increase their time <BR>
 available for serving customers.<BR>
 <BR>
 Fourth, the regulators are improving the fairness and effectiveness <BR>
 of their appeals processes. The Office of the Comptroller of the <BR>
 Currency (OCC) has created a new Ombudsman to manage its appeals <BR>
 process. A better organized appeals process should greatly improve <BR>
 communication among bankers and regulators and help solve problems <BR>
 and confusion regarding regulatory requirements. This will enable <BR>
 bankers to get back to the business of making loans rather than <BR>
 wrestling with confusing examiner practices.<BR>
 <BR>
 Fifth, the OCC has begun using new procedures to detect <BR>
 discrimination in residential lending by national banks, to ensure <BR>
 that credit is available more broadly and fairly. The new procedures <BR>
 should clarify for bankers what types of lending are appropriate to <BR>
 satisfy fair lending rules and should reduce the required paperwork. <BR>
 These changes should increase banker confidence, reduce costs in <BR>
 making new loans, and reduce discrimination.<BR>
 <BR>
 Phase two of the President's program is an ongoing regulatory and <BR>
 paperwork burden reduction effort to be carried out by the <BR>
 regulators. The OCC is leading this effort and is addressing every <BR>
 agency rule, regulation, and interpretation to reduce paperwork and <BR>
 other burdens. The regulators have already identified several rules <BR>
 that should be addressed, including legal lending limits, investment <BR>
 securities regulation, and securities offering disclosure rules. This <BR>
 effort is designed to eliminate unnecessary regulations that impede <BR>
 bank lending or raise its cost through excessive paperwork. The <BR>
 regulators want to modernize all their regulations to make them more <BR>
 user-friendly and to promote credit availability without adversely <BR>
 affecting bank safety and soundness.<BR>
 <BR>
 Furthermore, the OCC implemented a separate study to review all <BR>
 paperwork burdens associated with OCC guidance to banks and <BR>
 examiners. The first phase of this study, a compilation of all <BR>
 paperwork burdens, should be completed by November 1993.<BR>
 <BR>
 Given the nature of the President's program, it will be difficult to <BR>
 quantify its success. However, early indications suggest that the <BR>
 program is having a positive impact on credit availability. For <BR>
 example, commercial and industrial lending increased during second <BR>
 quarter 1993 by 1.2 percent, or $1.7 billion. This follows a 4 <BR>
 percent decline for all of 1992.<BR>
 <BR>
 Moreover, the costs of lending and of borrowing have been decreased. <BR>
 From a microeconomic standpoint, this implies an expected increase in <BR>
 lending. The program has already reduced costs and will continue to <BR>
 do so during its second phase. Bank examiners are working to ensure <BR>
 that bankers understand the program and have confidence in it. This <BR>
 should ensure that the benefits of the program are widely <BR>
 distributed.<BR>
 <BR>
 A major difficulty in addressing the impact of reforms is the lack of <BR>
 an appropriate, objective measure of small business lending. To <BR>
 provide such a measure, Congress added Section 122 to the Federal <BR>
 Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, which directs <BR>
 financial institutions to submit small business loan data to the <BR>
 banking regulators. Current regulations do not require any <BR>
 specification of the size of the business receiving a loan. Data <BR>
 collected are by loan size only. The decision to collect data by loan <BR>
 size alone has made the data unreliable indicators of whether small <BR>
 business owners are receiving credit.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The Department of the Treasury, in conjunction with the bank and <BR>
 thrift institutions' regulators, should examine guidelines for <BR>
 depository institutions to determine whether all small business loans <BR>
 made by well-capitalized institutions should be examined solely on <BR>
 performance.<BR>
 <BR>
 Legislation is not required for this recommendation, as the changes <BR>
 would be in the review practices of the regulators, not in the law. <BR>
 However, coordination between the various regulatory agencies would <BR>
 be required.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 2. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council should <BR>
 develop an objective economic indicator of lending to small business.<BR>
 <BR>
 This would reaffirm the collection of small business loan data as <BR>
 directed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act <BR>
 of 1991, Section 122 and its ensuing regulations. Loan data collected <BR>
 should include the size of the business receiving the loan as well as <BR>
 the size of the loan. As already directed in the regulations, the <BR>
 data should be collected by geographic region. It may be appropriate <BR>
 to exempt small banks from the reporting requirement, as they rarely <BR>
 loan to large businesses and their commercial loans are already <BR>
 tallied.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The minimal loan documentation policy would be limited to well-<BR>
 capitalized banks. The definition of well-capitalized is firmly <BR>
 established in regulation and regulator review practice and <BR>
 universally understood within the banking industry. Limiting the <BR>
 proposed examination to these banks would exclude those with risky <BR>
 practices or limited resources.<BR>
 <BR>
 The minimal loan documentation policy creates incentives to ensure <BR>
 that loans are sound without emphasizing stringent documentation <BR>
 requirements. If a well-capitalized institution has an abundance of <BR>
 overdue loans, bank regulators would be permitted to review all of <BR>
 its loans. Financial institutions realize that unnecessarily risky <BR>
 loans not only jeopardize their status as a well-capitalized <BR>
 institution but could also lead to higher insurance premiums.<BR>
 <BR>
 Any changes resulting from this recommendation may lead to increased <BR>
 community reinvestment, as most small loans to small businesses are <BR>
 made by community banks, which tend to loan in their immediate areas.<BR>
 <BR>
 The collection of small business loan data is already being done by <BR>
 financial institutions. This recommendation would simply change the <BR>
 regulations by requiring banks to report the size of the business <BR>
 receiving the loan. The size of the loan is already required by an <BR>
 existing regulation, so reporting mechanisms already exist. <BR>
 Implementing the change would require little more than indicating <BR>
 which box was checked, as SBA provides a standard breakout of firm <BR>
 size. This is not a costly addition, particularly in view of the <BR>
 exemption for small banks.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 There are no direct costs in these recommendations. The indirect <BR>
 costs are limited to the cost of examining the issues and writing the <BR>
 regulations and guidance at various agencies which regulate banks. <BR>
 The proposal has no implications for insurance or risk because the <BR>
 recommendations are restricted to well-capitalized institutions.<BR>

 SBA05:  Change the Microloan Program to Increase <BR>
         Loans for Small Business<BR>
 ************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Microloan Demonstration <BR>
 Program, a five-year pilot program, is almost two years old. The <BR>
 program provides direct loans to nonprofit intermediaries who in turn <BR>
 provide loans of up to $25,000 to small businesses. At present, these <BR>
 loans average about $9,700 each. Microloans are made to low-income <BR>
 individuals, women, minorities, and other entrepreneurs unable to <BR>
 obtain credit through traditional lending sources. The program fills <BR>
 a void in the credit market; very small loans (those under $25,000) <BR>
 often are not available from mainstream lenders due to the high costs <BR>
 associated with offering and servicing such financing. Yet as the <BR>
 current Small Business Administrator has pointed out: &quot;Two-thirds of <BR>
 the business started in America are started with less than $10,000 in <BR>
 capital; one-half with less than $5,000.&quot;     <BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to lending capital, the microloan program provides grants <BR>
 to intermediary lenders and other technical assistance providers. <BR>
 These grants are used to strengthen the skills of small business <BR>
 owners in accounting, marketing, and other basic business practices.<BR>
 <BR>
 At the end of July 1993, SBA had selected 96 nonprofit intermediaries <BR>
 nationwide to participate in the program. The program is fully <BR>
 supported by the administration and Congress. In a recent White House <BR>
 ceremony, President Clinton commented: &quot;The microloan program, by <BR>
 encouraging entrepreneurial instincts, can help change an <BR>
 economically dependent person into a productive and financially self-<BR>
 reliant citizen.&quot;(1)<BR>
 <BR>
 Currently, SBA makes direct loans to intermediary lenders. These <BR>
 loans can be as high as $1.25 million to any single intermediary (one <BR>
 firm or a consortium of many). SBA charges a rate equal to that of a <BR>
 five-year U.S. treasury bill. SBA then reduces the interest rate to <BR>
 the intermediary by up to 2 percent based on the average loan size of <BR>
 the intermediary's microloan portfolio. Grants are provided to <BR>
 intermediaries in the amount of 25 percent of any SBA loan amount <BR>
 disbursed to intermediaries. Further grant dollars are offered to <BR>
 non-lending technical assistance providers.<BR>
 <BR>
 For 1994, the President's budget includes $12.8 million for the <BR>
 microloan program. Expansion of this program will require either an <BR>
 increase in appropriations for further cash outlays or a change in <BR>
 the program to lower costs and stretch the current appropriation. <BR>
 Currently, SBA provides 100 percent direct loan funding to nonprofit <BR>
 intermediaries under this program.<BR>
 <BR>
 Changing this direct loan program into a guaranty program would <BR>
 require banks to lend directly to nonprofit intermediaries, with SBA <BR>
 guaranteeing the loans. The intermediaries would in turn make <BR>
 microloans to small businesses. This proposal would reduce federal <BR>
 cash outlays and lessen the administrative burdens associated with <BR>
 direct lending.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 Subsection (m), Section 7 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636, <BR>
 should be amended to allow SBA to provide a 100 percent guaranty on <BR>
 loans made by approved lenders to intermediaries selected by SBA.<BR>
 <BR>
 This recommendation would change the microloan program from a direct <BR>
 loan program to a loan-guaranty program, allowing the agency to make <BR>
 loan capital available to intermediaries under guaranty authority. <BR>
 The amendment also would give SBA the authority to sell such loans on <BR>
 the secondary market, providing investors with the full faith and <BR>
 credit backing of the U.S. government. SBA would still provide <BR>
 technical assistance grants and interest rate buy-downs.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA authority to sell guaranteed loans on the secondary market would <BR>
 allow private investors, such as pension funds, to participate in the <BR>
 program. The proceeds from sales on the secondary market would be <BR>
 returned to banks so that funds could be recycled to the <BR>
 intermediaries, providing fast access to capital for continued <BR>
 microlending under this program.<BR>
 <BR>
 Changing the program would alter the SBA's current anticipated <BR>
 administrative burden, allowing it to deliver a $40 million (as <BR>
 opposed to $33.7 million) program with no increase in the budget. <BR>
 Estimates regarding servicing and collection costs would decrease as <BR>
 these functions became the responsibility of the lenders.<BR>
 <BR>
 Private-sector involvement would increase, and future agency outlays <BR>
 would be reduced.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to increasing assistance to small businesses, the <BR>
 guaranty program would help such businesses establish a credit <BR>
 history that could ease the transition into traditional lending, when <BR>
 their credit needs exceed the maximum $25,000 permitted under the <BR>
 microloan program.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 The 1994 budget request provides $6.8 million in subsidy (loss <BR>
 reserve) for direct loans to microloan intermediaries. It also <BR>
 contains $6 million for technical assistance grants, for a total <BR>
 budget request of $12.8 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 The subsidy rate currently used in the microloan program is based on <BR>
 the results of direct loans approved under the 7(a) program. The <BR>
 current subsidy rate is 15.25 percent. An additional 5 percent is <BR>
 provided for interest rate buy-downs, providing a total subsidy rate <BR>
 (losses plus buy-downs) of 20.25 percent.<BR>
 <BR>
 By making the program a guaranty program, the subsidy rate could be <BR>
 lowered (assuming the 1993 7(a) guaranty rate), to 2.2 percent plus <BR>
 the 5 percent for interest rate buy-down, making the total subsidy <BR>
 rate for the Microloan Demonstration Program approximately 7.2 <BR>
 percent--approximately a third of the current proposed rate of 20.25 <BR>
 percent.<BR>
 <BR>
 The program would be expanded using the $12.8 million budget requests <BR>
 as follows:<BR>
 <BR>
 --- $2.8 million of the $12.8 million would provide guaranties for <BR>
 approximately $40 million in loans to intermediaries.<BR>
 <BR>
 --- The remaining $10 million would provide funding for the 25 <BR>
 percent technical assistance grants required for a $40 million <BR>
 program.<BR>

 SBA06:  Establish User Fees for Small Business <BR>
         Development Center Services<BR>
 ***********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Small Business <BR>
 Development Center (SBDC) program was established in 1980 to aid <BR>
 economic development by providing management and technical assistance <BR>
 to small businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 Fifty-seven lead SBDCs are located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and <BR>
 the Virgin Islands, with a network of approximately 946 service-<BR>
 delivery locations. To receive federal funds, SBDCs must provide an <BR>
 equal amount of matching funds from sources other than the federal <BR>
 government. The program's fiscal year 1993 appropriation is $67 <BR>
 million.<BR>
 <BR>
 SBDCs provide a wide variety of services designed to assist the <BR>
 economic development of a state or region through the cultivation of <BR>
 its small business sector. Core activities of one-on-one counseling <BR>
 and a variety of training events are augmented by specialized <BR>
 assistance in areas such as procurement, exporting, mentoring <BR>
 programs for women-owned businesses, and veterans and minority <BR>
 assistance programs. By law, all counseling is provided free of <BR>
 charge. SBDCs also offer counseling and other services to state and <BR>
 local economic development agencies that are attempting to respond to <BR>
 the loss of defense-related jobs and businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 In fiscal year 1992, SBDCs counseled 222,497 clients and trained <BR>
 319,535 clients. From 1980 through 1992, more than 1.2 million <BR>
 clients received counseling and more than 2.5 million attended <BR>
 training.<BR>
 <BR>
 Data in the 1991 and 1992 annual reports of a sample of 10 SBDCs show <BR>
 that, for a total of $11.4 million in federal funding disbursed over <BR>
 a 12-month period, the SBDCs created 11,190 jobs and preserved and <BR>
 stabilized 6,559 other jobs. Six of the 10 SBDCs secured a total of <BR>
 $189.6 million in capital investment for clients in their states.<BR>
 <BR>
 If these data are assumed to reflect the activity of all 57 SBDCs, <BR>
 the program's current annual appropriation could provide as many as <BR>
 80,000 new jobs and preserve 148,000 jobs, for a total positive <BR>
 impact of 228,000 jobs in a single year. The cost to the federal <BR>
 government of this activity is about $300 per job, a minimal figure <BR>
 compared to the taxes and other benefits related to employment. <BR>
 Moreover, this impact is in addition to the capital-investment <BR>
 benefits secured for clients by SBDCs.<BR>
 <BR>
 In 1989, the U.S. General Accounting Office evaluated the SBDC <BR>
 program. The evaluation found that: &quot;Overall, 69 percent of clients <BR>
 were satisfied with the counseling they received. 76 percent <BR>
 indicated they would contact the program for future help if needed, <BR>
 and 82 percent would recommend the SBDC program to others.&quot;(1)<BR>
 <BR>
 Given the high level of user satisfaction and perceived value of this <BR>
 program, a small user fee should not dampen clients' enthusiasm. Such <BR>
 a fee could be set at a level easily affordable to the average small <BR>
 business owner.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 Title II of the Small Business Development Center Act of 1980, Public <BR>
 Law 96-302, should be amended to allow the SBA to establish user fees <BR>
 for SBDC counseling services in the amount of $15 per hour.<BR>
 <BR>
 This rate is not intended to fully recover the actual cost of <BR>
 services provided by SBDCs, which is approximately $25 per hour. Such <BR>
 a rate might be burdensome to the majority of SBDC customers, which <BR>
 are predominantly start-up businesses. The $15 hourly rate is based <BR>
 on what these customers can reasonably afford.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 The implementation of the user fee charge would generate significant <BR>
 revenues for the SBDC program. SBA would make appropriate <BR>
 arrangements with local SBDCs to implement the user-fee <BR>
 recommendation. The $15 fee is well under the rates usually charged <BR>
 by consulting, accounting, legal, or other professionals.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition, SBDCs offer the small business owner comprehensive <BR>
 services without the need to engage multiple consultants in different <BR>
 locations. SBDCs would continue to offer &quot;one-stop&quot; services at <BR>
 a reasonable price. Since SBDCs are widely dispersed geographically, <BR>
 they are accessible to most small businesses without significant <BR>
 travel time.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 The proposed user fee is based on the number of hours used for <BR>
 counseling purposes. The fee would yield an estimated $17 million per <BR>
 year to be used toward current and future program costs. In fiscal <BR>
 year 1993, SBA received $67 million to support the SBDCs. With user <BR>
 fees, this amount could be reduced by $17 million.<BR>

 SBA07:  Distribute SBA Staff Based on Workload <BR>
         and Administrative Efficiency<BR>
 **********************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The average tenure of nine of the last 12 Small Business <BR>
 Administration (SBA) Administrators has been approximately 16 months. <BR>
 This high turnover rate has allowed numerous management difficulties <BR>
 to go unresolved, including problems concerning efficient staff <BR>
 distribution.<BR>
 <BR>
 In recent years, the number of SBA employees has fallen, while the <BR>
 number of programs the agency manages has risen. Substantial <BR>
 improvements in computer capability have been made but not yet fully <BR>
 implemented. There has been an increase in administrative positions <BR>
 relative to front-line employees, and population and economic shifts <BR>
 around the country have not yet been matched by changes in SBA <BR>
 staffing patterns.<BR>
 <BR>
 As a result, the distribution of SBA staff has diverged from the <BR>
 agency's workload distribution. For example, the largely rural Region <BR>
 VII (Kansas City) has one SBA employee per 54,000 people, while <BR>
 largely urban Region V (Chicago), has one agency employee per 131,000 <BR>
 people. This staff distribution problem is widely recognized within <BR>
 SBA, and numerous studies have been undertaken to solve it, most of <BR>
 them with broad staff participation.<BR>
 <BR>
 For example, in 1991, the Resource Allocation Task Force, consisting <BR>
 of both headquarters and field staff, made a detailed review. While <BR>
 there was some disagreement about the precise index that should be <BR>
 used for comparisons (total population, business population, or other <BR>
 factors), the task force agreed that SBA staffing was <BR>
 disproportionate both by region and program. The task force made <BR>
 specific recommendations to remedy the situation, but none of these <BR>
 have been implemented, again largely because no SBA Administrator has <BR>
 been in place long enough to follow through with them.<BR>
 <BR>
 Currently, each of the SBA's 67 district offices has a small cadre of <BR>
 loan officers that service its loans. SBA has conducted a successful <BR>
 pilot program in Fresno, California, that provides routine loan <BR>
 servicing for several district offices. The program demonstrated that <BR>
 an automated loan-servicing center could substantially reduce the <BR>
 number of loan officers required in district offices.<BR>
 <BR>
 Another problem concerns redundant support systems. By legislative <BR>
 mandate, SBA has several different direct loan and loan-guaranty <BR>
 programs, each targeted at a different population. These programs use <BR>
 the same application forms and credit analysis but maintain <BR>
 duplicative regulations, training, staff and administrative support.<BR>
 <BR>
 A third problem concerns the agency's current headquarters structure. <BR>
 About 75 percent of the agency's personnel resources fall under one <BR>
 division--Finance, Investment, and Procurement Assistance. However, <BR>
 the finance and investment portions of its duties demand so much <BR>
 attention that procurement assistance and minority business <BR>
 development receive little attention from division management. In <BR>
 addition, procurement programs are distinctly different from either <BR>
 finance or investment programs. If procurement assistance and <BR>
 minority small business programs were administratively separated from <BR>
 the division and placed under an experienced and committed manager, <BR>
 it seems likely that they would receive greater attention.<BR>
 <BR>
 The general solution to each of these problems is to establish a <BR>
 basic principle of staff distribution based on administrative <BR>
 efficiency and program workload. The mechanics of accomplishing this <BR>
 should be left to SBA.<BR>
 <BR>
 The new Administrator has indicated that he wishes to address these <BR>
 issues from the ground up, and has called for a series of proposals <BR>
 from various levels of SBA to streamline administration and allocate <BR>
 more employees to direct client services. The Administrator intends <BR>
 to combine these proposals with previous studies not yet acted upon <BR>
 to develop an efficient and effective management structure.<BR>
 <BR>
 Analysis conducted over the years suggests that major actions such as <BR>
 these could and should be initiated immediately and simultaneously, <BR>
 to minimize disruption. The agency's turnover rate may permit many <BR>
 changes to be accomplished over time through attrition. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Action<BR>
 ******<BR>
 <BR>
 The SBA Administrator should reallocate SBA staff in line with basic <BR>
 principles of administrative efficiency and program workload.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Administrator should be instructed to review existing studies in <BR>
 conjunction with his own studies and develop a comprehensive plan for <BR>
 speedy implementation to improve service delivery. The Administrator <BR>
 should take whatever personnel actions are needed to achieve highly <BR>
 automated administrative efficiency, establish objective workload <BR>
 measures, allocate program staff based on objective and uniform <BR>
 workload indicators, and thereafter fill vacancies only if workload <BR>
 studies support such moves.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 Reallocating staff based on these principles would substantially <BR>
 improve the service provided to small businesses. The exact level of <BR>
 improvement cannot be known until the Administrator develops a plan, <BR>
 but previous studies suggest that as many as 600 positions could be <BR>
 shifted to direct client support.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>
 *************<BR>
 <BR>
 Studies to date suggest that these moves can be accomplished with <BR>
 current resources. No net changes are anticipated in the agency's <BR>
 total number of positions, as affected positions would be shifted to <BR>
 district offices to improve service. This increase in the district <BR>
 offices will lead to better service while the concentration and <BR>
 automation of administrative support functions would lead to faster <BR>
 response times and better data. Both of these in turn should produce <BR>
 stronger small businesses. <BR>
 <BR>

 SBA08:  Improve Federal Data on Small Businesses<BR>
 ************************************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background<BR>
 **********<BR>
 <BR>
 The Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the <BR>
 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) all collect a great deal of hard data <BR>
 on U.S. businesses. However, none of this wealth of information is <BR>
 organized by firm size or other indices that would allow users to <BR>
 focus on businesses with less than $10 million in assets or receipts-<BR>
 -in other words, small businesses. This means that even the most <BR>
 basic small business indicators, such as capital flow, job creation, <BR>
 or business dynamics, cannot be extracted from the data currently <BR>
 gathered.<BR>
 <BR>
 As a result, the federal government lacks the data needed to support <BR>
 its policymaking, target economic recovery programs to meet small <BR>
 business needs, evaluate the value of existing programs, or meet <BR>
 congressional mandates.<BR>
 <BR>
 Even in the rare instances in which agencies have attempted to obtain <BR>
 data by firm size, the usefulness of the data is limited. Census's <BR>
 Enterprise Statistics is five years out of date. IRS's limited data <BR>
 on sole proprietorships are three years out of date and ignore most <BR>
 significant parts of the small business sector, such as partnerships, <BR>
 sub-chapter S corporations, and regular &quot;C&quot; corporations. <BR>
 Although BLS collects data on business &quot;establishments&quot; and <BR>
 &quot;reporting units,&quot; neither of these categories are related to <BR>
 firm size, making comparisons between large and small firms <BR>
 impossible.<BR>
 <BR>
 Significant amounts of money are spent on the collection of business <BR>
 data; BLS alone has a statistical research budget of $190 million. <BR>
 Adding a simple question on firm size to existing data collection <BR>
 conducted by federal agencies would greatly increase the usefulness <BR>
 of these data and eliminate any need for a substantial increase in <BR>
 the SBA research budget to acquire the information independently.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Actions<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 1. The SBA Administrator should work with OMB and the relevant <BR>
 statistical agencies to include a size-of-firm question in all future <BR>
 federal household and employer surveys that collect data on <BR>
 businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 A single demographic item would be sufficient, such as: &quot;About how <BR>
 many people are employed by this employer in total, counting ALL <BR>
 locations?&quot;     <BR>
 <BR>
 - less than 10     - 100-249<BR>
 <BR>
 - 10-19            - 250-499<BR>
 <BR>
 - 20-49            - 500 or more<BR>
 <BR>
 - 50-99            - Don't know<BR>
 <BR>
 These are standard size breakdowns used by SBA.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Implications<BR>
 ************<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations do not affect current studies and do not <BR>
 propose new studies.<BR>
 <BR>
 These recommendations would affect only a narrow segment of future <BR>
 federal studies. A survey of recent federal economic questionnaires <BR>
 identified only 10 documents that could provide useful information on <BR>
 small businesses. These were issued by the Department of Health and <BR>
 Human Services, the Treasury Department (including the IRS and <BR>
 Customs), and the Department of Commerce (including BLS and Census). <BR>
 It is unlikely that many studies other than these would be affected.<BR>
 <BR>
 This small change, however, would make a very large improvement in <BR>
 the quality of information available to shape federal legislative and <BR>
 regulatory actions with a differential effect on small and large <BR>
 businesses. Such actions have implications for environmental <BR>
 initiatives, tax-law changes, changes in workplace requirements, and <BR>
 trade and energy policies. Public actions, in turn, affect private-<BR>
 sector decisions regarding hiring and firing, opening and closing <BR>
 locations, introducing new products, investing in new plant and <BR>
 equipment, human resource expenditures, and the magnitude, timing, <BR>
 and choice of financing.<BR>
 <BR>
 Agencies may have two concerns about this additional demographic <BR>
 item: they might feel that they would have to drop an important item <BR>
 to make room for it, and could wonder whether it opens the door for <BR>
 other additions. However, as a practical matter, the addition of one <BR>
 item is not a great burden, particularly since the requirement would <BR>
 be known during the survey design stage. And if other items that <BR>
 could be added would have a significant impact on economic recovery, <BR>
 perhaps this door should be opened.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Fiscal Impact<BR>

 This proposal would create only negligible additional costs.<BR>

 Agency Reinvention Activities<BR>
 *****************************<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Summary<BR>
 *******<BR>
 <BR>
 Reinventing the Small Business Administration (SBA) has been a <BR>
 priority for current Administrator Erskine Bowles since the beginning <BR>
 of his tenure. His first official act as Administrator was to <BR>
 introduce Vice President Gore to a group of state small business <BR>
 owners at a meeting to discuss reinventing government. Bowles <BR>
 commitment continues with the establishment of an internal SBA team <BR>
 that will operate during his tenure.<BR>
 <BR>
 At a presentation before National Small Business United and the <BR>
 National Association of Women Business Owners in May 1993, Bowles <BR>
 stated, &quot;If a reinvented government is operating more efficiently, <BR>
 small companies will be able to work more productively with that <BR>
 government.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;There is no more important <BR>
 reason to move ahead with this than to provide a better environment <BR>
 in which America's entrepreneurs can continue to be the nation's job <BR>
 creators and innovators.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA's reinvention effort has been organized around the <BR>
 Administrator's philosophy that the best way to serve customers is to <BR>
 listen to their concerns. SBA has three types of customers: the small <BR>
 business owner, the lender, and the &quot;internal&quot; customer--the <BR>
 employee. The information-gathering component of SBA's reinvention <BR>
 effort cannot be overemphasized. In addition to using traditional <BR>
 methods for soliciting input, such as asking customers to submit <BR>
 their ideas in writing, the Administrator is going directly to the <BR>
 customers. <BR>
 <BR>
 Eight cities across the country have been selected to host a three-<BR>
 part town hall meeting over a two-day period. In each session, a <BR>
 meeting is held with small business owners on the first evening. <BR>
 These meetings are held in a &quot;talk-show&quot; format that allows the <BR>
 Administrator to answer questions and hear suggestions and ideas. On <BR>
 the second day, the Administrator meets with local lenders to discuss <BR>
 their experiences with SBA programs. A third meeting focuses on input <BR>
 from SBA employees.<BR>
 <BR>
 The first town hall meeting, held in Hartford, Connecticut, on July <BR>
 15-16, 1993, generated several ideas. Similar meetings in Los <BR>
 Angeles, California; Des Moines, Iowa; Atlanta, Georgia; Portland, <BR>
 Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio; Houston, Texas; and Denver, Colorado will be <BR>
 held through November 1993.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Administrator also used his first national meeting with SBA <BR>
 district directors as a reinvention vehicle. With an agenda titled <BR>
 &quot;Reinventing SBA,&quot; the three-day meeting provided numerous <BR>
 opportunities for SBA's top managers to provide ideas and suggestions <BR>
 to improve SBA's program delivery. Hundreds of suggestions submitted <BR>
 at that meeting have been compiled into a report that is being used <BR>
 in the agency's reorganization plan currently under way.<BR>
 <BR>
 In addition, a 17-member group has been established in SBA's Central <BR>
 Office to organize a permanent internal SBA reinvention team. Called <BR>
 the &quot;Entrepreneurial SBA Team&quot; (E-SBA), this group is composed <BR>
 of employees representing all grade levels and program divisions. The <BR>
 employees were selected, in part, for their substantial experience in <BR>
 SBA's field offices.<BR>
 <BR>
 The E-SBA team has two important functions and has been divided into <BR>
 two sub-groups. First, an outreach team has been established to <BR>
 develop ways to continue involving all of SBA's customers in the <BR>
 reinvention process. Second, an issue team has been created to <BR>
 categorize suggestions from employees, lenders, and small business <BR>
 owners. Its goal is to ensure that each idea receives a fair and <BR>
 impartial review. Both teams meet regularly; the full E-SBA team <BR>
 meets weekly.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Specific Reinvention Projects<BR>
 *****************************<BR>
 <BR>
 Five themes have emerged among the ideas and suggestions SBA has <BR>
 received through the reinvention process. Although a final evaluation <BR>
 process for individual ideas has not been officially adopted, it <BR>
 appears that SBA's reinvention projects will fall into five areas:<BR>
 <BR>
 (1) Reallocation of Resources--The Administrator has told all SBA <BR>
 employees to expect fewer resources in Washington and at the regional <BR>
 office level, and more resources in some district offices. Using <BR>
 limited resources effectively at the local level is the guiding <BR>
 principle behind SBA's reorganization plan.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 (2) Customer Service--All of SBA's customers have submitted ideas on <BR>
 how to make SBA more user-friendly and efficient. These suggestions <BR>
 range from how best to handle initial inquiries to the design of new <BR>
 lending mechanisms.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 (3) New Way of Measuring Performance--As with many federal agencies, <BR>
 SBA has measured its program success by the number of people that <BR>
 have used its services. Small business owners, lenders, and employees <BR>
 alike have suggested that a more meaningful way to measure SBA's <BR>
 effectiveness is to link its performance to job creation and other <BR>
 small business indicators. This type of measurement holds SBA <BR>
 accountable in ensuring that the agency's programs actually assist <BR>
 businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 (4) Personnel Procedures--About 40 percent of the reinvention <BR>
 suggestions from employees deal with personnel matters or procedures.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 (5) Lines of Communication--As with all large organizations, good <BR>
 communication continues to challenge even the most earnest manager. <BR>
 Many suggestions have revolved around improving lines of <BR>
 communication within and outside of the agency.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Lessons Learned<BR>
 ***************<BR>
 <BR>
 Because the Administrator envisions the reinvention effort as an <BR>
 ongoing process at SBA, a substantial amount of effort continues to <BR>
 be devoted to creating the best possible mechanism for submitting and <BR>
 evaluating ideas. SBA is relatively decentralized (10 regional <BR>
 offices and 66 district and branch offices); the most challenging <BR>
 component of the reinvention effort has been the development of an <BR>
 infrastructure that encourages field staff not only to participate by <BR>
 submitting ideas, but to become involved in the evaluation process as <BR>
 well.<BR>
 <BR>
 Currently under testing as a pilot project is an evaluation process <BR>
 designed to incorporate field input. The procedure is as follows: An <BR>
 issue would be sent to the person at headquarters with the most <BR>
 hands-on working knowledge of the program in question. This process <BR>
 intentionally bypasses one or more levels of management who may or <BR>
 may not have reviewed this idea previously.<BR>
 <BR>
 The designated staff person will be asked to respond with a brief <BR>
 &quot;good-idea&quot; or &quot;bad-idea&quot; assessment and reasons for this <BR>
 decision. He or she would also select two appropriate field <BR>
 employees--one from a regional office and another from a district <BR>
 office--to provide additional evaluations. The evaluations are <BR>
 returned to the E-SBA Issue Team for a final determination as to <BR>
 whether or not the recommendation should be forwarded to the <BR>
 Administrator for consideration.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Synopsis<BR>
 ********<BR>
 <BR>
 SBA's reinvention effort has both short and long-term goals. Many of <BR>
 the initial ideas and suggestions offered through this process will <BR>
 be incorporated into the reorganization plan that should be unveiled <BR>
 by the end of this fiscal year. The major long-term benefit is the <BR>
 creation of a permanent reinvention vehicle to ensure that helpful <BR>
 ideas and suggestions always have a forum.<BR>
 <BR>
 The administrator has made it clear that reinventing SBA is not <BR>
 merely a management exercise. A more efficient and effective SBA will <BR>
 provide better assistance to small businesses who, in turn, will <BR>
 create jobs and help their communities. An invigorated small business <BR>
 community will help to create and maintain a healthier national <BR>
 economy.<BR>

<p> This accompanying report, prepared by the staff of the 
 National Performance Review (NPR), laid the groundwork 
 for the recommendations in the NPR report "From Red 
 Tape to Results: Creating a Government that Works 
 Better and Costs Less," released on September 7, 1993. 
 This report is based on the best information available 
 at that time. The specific recommendations within these 
 reports have been and will continue to be given 
 priority as part of the FY95 Budget, legislative 
 proposals, or other Administration initiatives, as 
 appropriate.

** NATIONAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW: **<BR>

<P>** FOCUS OF THE SECOND PHASE    **<BR>

<P>** December 1994                **  <BR>

<P>            <BR>

<P>President Clinton and Vice President Gore have<BR>

<P>announced a second performance review, beginning<BR>

<P>today. This new review -- to create a leaner, not a<BR>

<P>meaner government -- will expand on the first effort<BR>

<P>in the following ways:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The first phase of NPR cut back to basics, but we<BR>

<P>can do even better. The second phase of NPR will:<BR>

<P>            <BR>

<P>- eliminate remnants of yesterday's government that<BR>

<P>  just don't make sense in today's world, and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- restructure things that can be better run as a<BR>

<P>  business instead of a bureaucracy.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The first phase of NPR devolved authority to state<BR>

<P>and local government, but we can do even better. The<BR>

<P>second phase of NPR will identify things that can be<BR>

<P>done better by:<BR>

<P>            <BR>

<P>-- the states and communities involved. and<BR>

<P>-- individual Americans<BR>

<P>                 <BR>

<P>The first phase of NPR improved the regulatory<BR>

<P>process, but we can do even better. The second phase<BR>

<P>of NPR will undertake a major reinvention of the way<BR>

<P>the federal government regulates and how it enforces<BR>

<P>its regulations.<BR>

<P>             <BR>

<P>We will continue to deliver on the promises we made<BR>

<P>in the first phase of the National Performance<BR>

<P>Review.<BR>

****************************************************<BR>

<P>NPR Phase II Putting It Together: Objectives,<BR>

<P>Working Principles, and Approach<BR>

<P>****************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The driving question for the first phase of NPR was<BR>

<P>&quot;how can government work better and cost less?&quot;  The <BR>

<P>overall purpose of the second phase of NPR is to<BR>

<P>answer the question, &quot;what should the federal<BR>

<P>government be doing?&quot;  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>What is our vision of success?  Our vision of<BR>

<P>success is a smaller federal government that helps<BR>

<P>communities and individuals  solve their own<BR>

<P>problems, and delivers quality services where<BR>

<P>Americans believe they are receiving value for their<BR>

<P>tax dollars and know who they can hold accountable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>How will we know when we are successful?  We will<BR>

<P>know we are successful when there are fewer federal<BR>

<P>agencies and programs, when there are fewer<BR>

<P>decisions being made by the federal government that<BR>

<P>can best be made elsewhere, when customers of the<BR>

<P>federal government see substantial improvements in<BR>

<P>services, and when Americans increase their level of<BR>

<P>trust in the federal government.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>How will we do our work?  To do this work, we<BR>

<P>propose four concurrent efforts (agency<BR>

<P>restructuring, devolution of federal programs to<BR>

<P>states and localities, regulatory reinvention,<BR>

<P>and continued implementation of NPR phase I).  These<BR>

<P>will be supplemented a set of crosscutting teams<BR>

<P>that will help the agency and advisory teams by<BR>

<P>providing expertise on restructuring techniques,<BR>

<P>such as privatization and streamlining, that would<BR>

<P>be helpful to agencies in developing their options<BR>

<P>proposals.  Also, since most of the recommendations<BR>

<P>will require legislative action, we will communicate<BR>

<P>early with congressional offices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>** 1. Agency Restructuring Initiative **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Objectives*:  Examine the basic missions of<BR>

<P>government to find and eliminate things that don't<BR>

<P>need to be done by the federal government and sort<BR>

<P>out how best to do the things the federal government<BR>

<P>should continue to do.  Create a smaller federal<BR>

<P>government -- by eliminating, privatizing, or<BR>

<P>devolving programs and subsidies -- that focuses on<BR>

<P>areas where the federal government should provide<BR>

<P>quality service to its customers -- and can do a<BR>

<P>good job of it.  The resulting smaller government<BR>

<P>will be results-oriented and customer focused.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>*Working Principles*:  Agencies have been asked to<BR>

<P>fundamentally rethink their missions.  The Vice<BR>

<P>President (in a January 3, 1995 memo to agency<BR>

<P>heads) proposes the following criteria:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- If your agency were eliminated, how would the<BR>

<P>   goals or programs of your agency be undertaken --<BR>

<P>   by other agencies, by states or localities, by<BR>

<P>   the private sector, or not at all?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- If there are goals or programs of national<BR>

<P>   importance that will remain undone and require a<BR>

<P>   federal role in order to be accomplished, should<BR>

<P>   they be done differently than they are being done<BR>

<P>   today in order to enhance service to the<BR>

<P>   customers? <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How do your customers (not just interest groups)<BR>

<P>   feel about the possible eliminations or changes?  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Attachment 1 contains the Vice President's memo<BR>

<P>which is accompanied by a sample &quot;decision tree&quot;<BR>

<P>that agencies should use to develop their analysis<BR>

<P>of their mission and programs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Approach*:  The agencies themselves will create<BR>

<P>internal review teams. These agency-led teams will<BR>

<P>be headed, in most cases, by the agency's chief<BR>

<P>operating officer. In the case of smaller agencies,<BR>

<P>the agency head may choose to lead the team.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB, NPR, and appropriate White House policy<BR>

<P>councils also will create a set of six small<BR>

<P>advisory teams covering the roughly 150 federal<BR>

<P>agencies. Five of these teams -- with the same<BR>

<P>jurisdictions as OMB's resource management offices<BR>

<P>-- will focus assistance on the 19 major agencies<BR>

<P>that have not yet put forward a Phase II<BR>

<P>restructuring proposal.  Smaller agencies, in most<BR>

<P>cases, will be reviewed by the sixth team, in the<BR>

<P>context of related program areas.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To assist the agencies, several crosscutting teams<BR>

<P>will offer a series of topical workshops and<BR>

<P>seminars for agencies to share information about<BR>

<P>soliciting customer input, privatization, creating<BR>

<P>voucher programs, etc. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The dynamics of the review process will be similar<BR>

<P>to that used by OMB, NPR, and the agencies<BR>

<P>participating in the first five restructurings<BR>

<P>announced on December 19th.   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- The overall review will be a collaborative effort<BR>

<P>   among the President's Management Council, agency<BR>

<P>   staff, and NPR, OMB, and White House policy<BR>

<P>   staffs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- Agencies will be asked to prepare a short 3-5<BR>

<P>   page summary paper (with any needed attachments)<BR>

<P>   proposing options for both termination and major<BR>

<P>   restructuring of their operations along the lines<BR>

<P>   of the principles articulated by the Vice<BR>

<P>   President in his letter to agency heads.  The<BR>

<P>   advisory teams will assist agencies in preparing<BR>

<P>   the option paper and encourage agencies to<BR>

<P>   present bold, innovative ideas (see Attachment 2 <BR>

<P>   for format).   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- The draft option paper would then be used to<BR>

<P>   guide the agency's discussion before the Phase II<BR>

<P>   Steering Committee.  The option papers for large<BR>

<P>   agencies should be delivered to OMB for<BR>

<P>   distribution to the Phase II Steering Committee<BR>

<P>   at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- We currently envision two agency presentations<BR>

<P>   that will center around the option papers for the<BR>

<P>   large agencies: one to the Phase II Steering<BR>

<P>   Committee and the second, after any revisions to<BR>

<P>   the option paper, to the Vice President and the<BR>

<P>   Director of OMB to take to the President for<BR>

<P>   final decisions.  Presidential decisions would be<BR>

<P>   made public as soon as practical and work should<BR>

<P>   begin immediately on draft legislation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- For small agencies, the draft option paper will<BR>

<P>   go to NPR and initial decisions on groups of<BR>

<P>   small agencies will be made by the Phase II<BR>

<P>   Steering Committee.  If the initial  <BR>

<P>   recommendation is to terminate or dramatically<BR>

<P>   restructure a small agency, a second meeting will<BR>

<P>   be held where the agency head will have an<BR>

<P>   opportunity to make a presentation.  A second<BR>

<P>   presentation may then be scheduled with the Vice<BR>

<P>   President and Director of OMB before asking the<BR>

<P>   President for a final decision.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- The general timetable for the completion of the<BR>

<P>   first presentation of options is anticipated to<BR>

<P>   be between mid-February and mid-March 1995. The<BR>

<P>   second will begin shortly after the first<BR>

<P>   presentations.  A draft timetable for these<BR>

<P>   papers and presentations is available as a<BR>

<P>   separate handout.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The final product, in most cases, will be draft<BR>

<P>legislation; an extensive report is not envisioned<BR>

<P>at this time.  In addition to drafting legislation,<BR>

<P>agencies then will be tasked to develop strategies<BR>

<P>for operating their restructured missions.  Agencies<BR>

<P>will be asked to prepare this information, in<BR>

<P>conjunction with their strategies for how they will<BR>

<P>collect performance information and shift to<BR>

<P>output/outcome measures of performance.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR's crosscutting teams will conduct a series of<BR>

<P>topical workshops on these and related issues<BR>

<P>(see also item 5).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>** 2.Federalism Initiative **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Objective*:  Where states and localities can<BR>

<P>perform functions more effectively than the federal<BR>

<P>government, the federal government should devolve as<BR>

<P>much authority as possible to states, localities,<BR>

<P>and individuals for the operation of programs.  They<BR>

<P>will be judged on the quality of their services and<BR>

<P>whether programs achieve agreed upon results. In<BR>

<P>cases where a direct federal role remains, the<BR>

<P>federal government's participation will be in a<BR>

<P>partnership role.  Federal agencies would move to a<BR>

<P>&quot;steer, don't row&quot; role, focus on developing the<BR>

<P>baseline data for assessing performance, creating<BR>

<P>incentives for higher performance, and conducting<BR>

<P>reviews to assure national goals are being met.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* Working Principles and Options: *    <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Constitution gives the Federal Government a<BR>

<P>preeminent role in clearly defined categories of<BR>

<P>activity.  In addition, key historical events have<BR>

<P>led the Federal Government to assume certain core<BR>

<P>functions.  The constitutional and historical list<BR>

<P>includes, at a minimum, the following:  conducting<BR>

<P>national defense and foreign relations; safeguarding<BR>

<P>individual rights, as defined by the Constitution;<BR>

<P>regulating interstate commerce; stabilizing the<BR>

<P>national economy; and making basic social insurance<BR>

<P>widely available.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There are other areas where the Federal role is not<BR>

<P>defined as clearly, yet where it may nevertheless be<BR>

<P>quite important.  The nature of certain public<BR>

<P>interests may lead them to be best achieved with<BR>

<P>Federal leadership or participation.  These<BR>

<P>interests include addressing:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ activities having spillover effects that cross<BR>

<P>  State lines (e.g., some environmental issues or<BR>

<P>  investments in transportation networks); and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ distributional challenges caused by mobility of<BR>

<P>  low and high income households and businesses, in<BR>

<P>  which competition among jurisdictions can reduce<BR>

<P>  the effectiveness of tax and transfer systems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Importantly, however, States, localities,<BR>

<P>businesses, nonprofit institutions, and individuals<BR>

<P>may each have comparative advantages in addressing<BR>

<P>much -- or even all -- of many of these<BR>

<P>responsibilities.  In particular, the fact that a<BR>

<P>problem is widespread does not necessarily mean that<BR>

<P>the Federal Government is best suited to tackling<BR>

<P>it.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Federal Government uses several major tools to<BR>

<P>affect outcomes that are ultimately at the State,<BR>

<P>local, or even individual level.  These include:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ requirements -- Federal laws and regulations can<BR>

<P>  require or forbid various processes or outcomes;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ financing -- Federal grants, credit assistance,<BR>

<P>  transfer payments, and tax policies can assist<BR>

<P>  State and local governments, businesses, or<BR>

<P>  individuals;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ direct service delivery --  Federal employees can<BR>

<P>  directly provide a service; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ information provision -- the Federal Government<BR>

<P>  can collect information and promote its exchange.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For each of these methods, Federal involvement can<BR>

<P>range from zero to significant. In addition, mixes<BR>

<P>of methods are possible; thus, the Federal role in a<BR>

<P>given area (such as pollution control or education<BR>

<P>for disadvantaged students) might involve, for<BR>

<P>example, minimal service delivery, partial funding,<BR>

<P>and significant requirements.  Moreover, such<BR>

<P>mixed Federal roles can range from uncoordinated<BR>

<P>collections of programs to carefully designed shared<BR>

<P>responsibilities.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In developing options for an improved Federal role,<BR>

<P>therefore, teams should seek to ensure that the<BR>

<P>Federal Government is undertaking a well justified<BR>

<P>mix of activities and that the nature of Federal<BR>

<P>involvement corresponds well to the type of problem<BR>

<P>being addressed.  There are a number of ways to<BR>

<P>realign Federal and non-Federal responsibilities to<BR>

<P>increase program effectiveness.  For example:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ A reinvention strategy could focus on moving to a<BR>

<P>  reduced Federal role along one dimension (e.g., a<BR>

<P>  restrictive regulation could be relaxed).  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ Alternatively, a combination of strategies within<BR>

<P>  one area might be used.  For instance, development<BR>

<P>  of more flexible requirements might enable Federal<BR>

<P>  financing to be reduced.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ Yet another approach could be a swap across<BR>

<P>  different activities.  For example, the<BR>

<P>  Federal Government could take increased<BR>

<P>  responsibility for financing or directly <BR>

<P>  providing one set of activities (it might fund<BR>

<P>  medical programs or administer certain tax <BR>

<P>  programs) in exchange for greater State and local<BR>

<P>  responsibilities in other areas (such as funding<BR>

<P>  welfare or education programs).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>One approach, which is a combined strategy, is the<BR>

<P>use of performance partnerships.  This approach is<BR>

<P>proposed for several major areas in the President's<BR>

<P>FY 1996 Budget Approach:  Ideally, any federalism<BR>

<P>proposals will be encompassed by an agency's overall<BR>

<P>restructuring effort, as devolution and new forms of<BR>

<P>intergovernmental partnership are among the options<BR>

<P>to be considered by all agencies in how to improve<BR>

<P>services to customers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The agencies will take the lead in developing<BR>

<P>intergovernmental proposals.  A team of internal<BR>

<P>advisors will be created from NPR, the White House<BR>

<P>(Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council,<BR>

<P>Intergovernmental Affairs, Council of Economic<BR>

<P>Advisors), OMB, and Treasury to support the<BR>

<P>agency-based team efforts.  This advisory team will<BR>

<P>provide technical assistance (conceptual framework,<BR>

<P>options, background papers, list of experts,<BR>

<P>bibliography); help involve customers/stakeholders<BR>

<P>by soliciting ideas and vetting ideas (advisory<BR>

<P>panel, focus groups, workshops, etc); share<BR>

<P>proposals across agencies; look for cross-agency<BR>

<P>opportunities; and assist with crafting financing<BR>

<P>options.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Some initial intergovernmental performance<BR>

<P>partnership proposals have been proposed as part<BR>

<P>of the President's FY 1996 budget. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>** 3.  Regulatory Reinvention Initiative **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Objectives*:  Reassess how regulations are<BR>

<P>developed, whether we should delete or change<BR>

<P>existing regulations, and how the federal government<BR>

<P>enforces its regulations.  In all cases, we are<BR>

<P>seeking an approach that reinforces partnership,<BR>

<P>voluntary compliance, and common measures of<BR>

<P>performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Working Principles*:   Agencies should:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- use market, not administrative, mechanisms<BR>

<P>   wherever possible;<BR>

<P>-- change measures of success to focus on results,<BR>

<P>   not process;<BR>

<P>-- form partnerships with regulated entities and<BR>

<P>   accept informed compliance as their mission;<BR>

<P>-- reward compliance and develop new ways to<BR>

<P>   encourage violators to comply.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Existing models that encourage front line staffs to<BR>

<P>form partnerships should be used as a basis for<BR>

<P>reinvention, such as the Customs Service operation<BR>

<P>in Miami, the &quot;OSH Maine 200&quot; project, and EPA's<BR>

<P>&quot;33/50&quot; program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Potential questions to be asked by the review group<BR>

<P>might include:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- Are there regulatory provisions that are<BR>

<P>   especially troublesome to the regulated<BR>

<P>   community that can be reengineered to reduce<BR>

<P>   their intrusiveness while still achieving<BR>

<P>   the intended goals of the program?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How can &quot;command and control&quot; regulatory<BR>

<P>   structures be recast into other approaches<BR>

<P>   to make them less intrusive?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How can we create systems that target violators<BR>

<P>   instead of treating all members of the regulated<BR>

<P>   community as violators?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- What examples already exist in agencies of<BR>

<P>   partnerships formed with those being regulated? <BR>

<P>   Can they be built upon?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How can agencies change the way they assess the<BR>

<P>   performance of their front line workers and<BR>

<P>   measure their agencies' success so these measures<BR>

<P>   focus on results? <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How can information technology be used to improve<BR>

<P>   communication with the regulated community --<BR>

<P>   both in disseminating information and obtaining<BR>

<P>   input?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- How can information technology be used across<BR>

<P>   regulating agencies so they can speak with one<BR>

<P>   voice to the regulated community?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Approach*: This effort will focus on 10-15 major<BR>

<P>regulatory policy areas.  There will be a series of<BR>

<P>seminars for the Vice President around each of these<BR>

<P>policy areas. Some will focus on cross-cutting<BR>

<P>initiatives.  Others will be specific to a<BR>

<P>particular area, such as the environment.  OMB's<BR>

<P>Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the<BR>

<P>Office of the Vice President are organizing these<BR>

<P>meetings -- which are being run by each of the major<BR>

<P>White House policy councils and agency staffs with<BR>

<P>jurisdiction over specific policy areas. Following<BR>

<P>these meetings, teams will be formed to put together<BR>

<P>specific proposals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Participation by regulatory agencies varies,<BR>

<P>depending on the issue involved.  Most regulatory<BR>

<P>agencies are involved via the Regulatory Working<BR>

<P>Group established by E.O. 12866. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>** 4.  Implement Phase I of NPR **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Objective*:  In the summer of 1996, President<BR>

<P>Clinton should be able to tell the American people<BR>

<P>that he has created a results-oriented,<BR>

<P>customer-driven government that is smaller and works<BR>

<P>better -- and that they know it is working better<BR>

<P>from their own personal experience.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Principles*:  Create a government that works better<BR>

<P>and costs less by:<BR>

<P>     <BR>

<P>     -- putting customers first<BR>

<P>     -- cutting red tape<BR>

<P>     -- empowering employees<BR>

<P>     -- cutting back to basics<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*Approach*:  Following are several priority items<BR>

<P>that will be critical to keep on the front burner<BR>

<P>over the next few months while NPR Phase II is in<BR>

<P>high gear:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>~ Ensure remaining agencies prepare their promised<BR>

<P>  Customer Service Standards, measure performance<BR>

<P>  against these standards, and publish results.<BR>

<P>~ Create a &quot;Virtual Department of Business&quot; to<BR>

<P>  provide a single &quot;face&quot; to businesses that come<BR>

<P>  into contact with the 55 agencies that have set<BR>

<P>   customer service standards for business.<BR>

<P>~ Ensure swift consideration of legislation to<BR>

<P>  reform the civil service.<BR>

<P>~ Continue communication and culture change in the<BR>

<P>  federal government through the use of NetResults<BR>

<P>  -- the NPR information exchange on the Internet --<BR>

<P>  and the NPR newsletter.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition to these key initiatives, we will<BR>

<P>continue tracking the implementation of over 1,200<BR>

<P>other recommendations and, where possible, leverage<BR>

<P>action by others to act on implementation.  We will<BR>

<P>also expand efforts to communicate with federal<BR>

<P>employees via a variety of different initiatives as<BR>

<P>part of our effort to change governmental cultures.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>** 5.  Crosscutting Team **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A pool of NPR staff, OMB staff and agency advisors<BR>

<P>will support the three major efforts in Phase II<BR>

<P>(agency restructuring, devolution, regulatory<BR>

<P>reinvention) by operating regular informational<BR>

<P>seminars and providing advice to individual agencies<BR>

<P>and advisory teams.  These staff will have skills<BR>

<P>in:<BR>

<P>     -- privatization and franchising<BR>

<P>     -- streamlining agency and field operations<BR>

<P>     -- identifying opportunities for individual<BR>

<P>        empowerment (e.g., use of vouchers)<BR>

<P>     -- building accountability for results into<BR>

<P>        programs <BR>

<P>     -- developing customer service standards and<BR>

<P>        surveys<BR>

<P>     -- identifying subsidies and other savings.  <BR>

<P>     <BR>

<P>These individuals will work with other NPR staff,<BR>

<P>the agencies, OMB, and White House staff to identify<BR>

<P>options that should be considered.  These people<BR>

<P>would provide options, ideas, and technical support<BR>

<P>to agency and advisory teams.  They will share<BR>

<P>similar innovations across agency lines as well as <BR>

<P>search for new ideas.  They would also be familiar<BR>

<P>with related efforts in states, localities, and<BR>

<P>other countries.   They would, for example, look at<BR>

<P>the OMB&quot; high risk areas&quot; for potential reinvention<BR>

<P>opportunities and talk to groups such as the General<BR>

<P>Accounting Office, the Concord Coalition, Citizens<BR>

<P>Against Waste in Government, and other groups.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>** 6.  Legislative-Executive Branch Relations **<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Using the traditional OMB clearance process, we will<BR>

<P>continue to ensure development of legislation<BR>

<P>designed to implement recommendations made during<BR>

<P>the first phase of NPR that require legislative<BR>

<P>action.  To help assure progress, we will also seek<BR>

<P>to develop an informal working group at the staff<BR>

<P>level with appropriate congressional offices to<BR>

<P>sequence approaches and priorities.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* What Is the Timetable? *<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- The Vice President sent out a memo on January<BR>

<P>   3rd to agency heads outlining the general<BR>

<P>   principles of the second phase of NPR and invited<BR>

<P>   senior agency representatives to a kickoff<BR>

<P>   meeting January 12th.  Most of the Phase II<BR>

<P>   Steering Group meeting and decisions should be<BR>

<P>   completed before the end of March 1995. <BR>

<P>   Legislative packages for Phase II proposals will<BR>

<P>   be developed and submitted to Congress by early<BR>

<P>   Summer.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- OMB/NPR already provided some background<BR>

<P>   materials to the President's Management<BR>

<P>   Council at its meetings on December 21st and<BR>

<P>   January 4th and the Vice President spoke<BR>

<P>   with the Cabinet about it on January 11th. <BR>

<P>   Additional materials were shared with agencies on<BR>

<P>   January 12th.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- A draft timetable for the delivery of option<BR>

<P>   papers and meetings with the Phase II Steering<BR>

<P>   Group and the Vice President is attached.  This<BR>

<P>   timetable will be continually updated as we go<BR>

<P>   forward.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-- While some of NPR Phase II's results are in the<BR>

<P>   FY 1996 budget, most of the work will be done<BR>

<P>   over the next 3 months.  After Presidential<BR>

<P>   decisions are made, agencies will be responsible<BR>

<P>   for drafting implementation legislation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>* Assessment of Key Functions *<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Answer the following questions for each of the key<BR>

<P>functions:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>-- is this critical to the agency's mission, based<BR>

<P>   on &quot;customer&quot; input?<BR>

<P>-- if no, can it be privatized or terminated?<BR>

<P>-- if yes, can it be done as well or better at the<BR>

<P>   state or local level?<BR>

<P>-- if yes, devolve to states, localities, or<BR>

<P>   individuals.<BR>

<P>-- if no, is there any way to cut costs or improve<BR>

<P>   performance by introducing competition?<BR>

<P>   (competition options include franchising,<BR>

<P>   privatizing, or major reinvention of operations<BR>

<P>   by reengineering)<BR>

<P>

<H3><B>Executive Summary</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The government's customer service revolution started in 1993 with a recommendation from Vice President Gore's National Performance Review team, followed by President Clinton's Executive Order, &quot;Setting Customer Service Standards.&quot; The President directed federal agencies to survey their customers to see what kind of service people want and whether they are getting it; to get ideas from front-line workers who deal with customers day-to-day; to give customers choices and easy access; and to develop a way for citizens to complain and get problems fixed. He set a goal for the government to deliver service equal to the best-in-business.<BR>

<P>In 1995, President Clinton reinforced his order to put customers first. It leaves no doubt that the goal is a revolution in how government does business so that customers are the focus. Customer service standards and measures are to be part of strategic plans, training programs, personnel systems, and anything else that ought to be changed to advance the citizen's satisfaction with government service.<BR>

<P>To comply with the Presidents directive, teams of government agencies embarked on a series of benchmarking studies. For purposes of this study, Benchmarking means determining which businesses--public and private--are doing the best job of customer complaint resolution (request study), understanding the gap between the agencies' own performance and taking action to close that performance gap. When the best-in-business were identified, government teams set out to determine why they were the best and then set forth an action plan to make their agencies as good as, or better than, the benchmarked businesses in resolving customer complaints.<BR>

<P>Some of the valuable lessons learned during this process are:
<P>	*	<I>Make it easy for your customers to complain and your customers will make it easy for you to improve.</I> A dramatic lesson was learned by the teams involved in this study; the best-in-business want their customers to complain. Informed customers know how your services should work. If things are not working, customers are the first to know. Customers who are dissatisfied tell twice as many people about it as those who are happy with your service. The best-in-business use feedback from 1-800 calls, letters, and surveys to identify and resolve root causes of dissatisfaction and to change their services to ensure that the customer will be quickly satisfied.
<P>	*	<I>Respond to complaints quickly and courteously with common sense and you will improve customer loyalty</I>. We found that customers reward companies that quickly solve problems by remaining loyal customers. A speedy response can add 25 percent to customer loyalty. Toyota Motor Sales USA, Inc. has adopted a formula for customer satisfaction; doing the job right the first time + effective complaint management = maximum customer satisfaction/loyalty. Government agencies can develop the same kind of loyalty and trust from the public if we match or exceed the best-in-business.
<P>	*	<I>Resolve complaints on the first contact and</I> (1)<I> save money by eliminating unnecessary additional contacts that escalate costs and</I> (2) <I>build customer confidence</I>. A call back which involves two or more employees just has to cost more than a call that is handled right the first time. Our research confirms that resolving a complaint on the first contact reduced the cost by at least 50 percent.
<P>	*	<I>Technology utilization is critical in complaint handling systems</I>. Use your computers to develop a data base of complaints. See if you find a trend. Then fix it! We learned that the best-in-business electronically compiled customer complaint information and presented it to everyone, including management, so that the organization could better align services and products to meet customer expectations.
<P>	*	Recruit and hire the best for customer service jobs. The customer service and complaint resolution specialist positions established by benchmarking partners tend to be highly sought-after positions. Complaint specialists learn the company so well they get promoted. Some organizations built the customer service position into a formal career ladder for advancement in the company. In all instances, front-line employees were valued for feedback in making decisions.
<P><BR>
There is no reason why each government department cannot equal the best-in-business customer complaint resolution systems. The blueprint is in this book. Follow this simple plan and you will improve customer satisfaction and reduce your costs at the same time.<BR>

<P>In a nutshell, a manager who wants to have a first-rate complaint system with results within six months should take five steps:
<P>1.	Issue a policy statement that says our organization embraces complaints; we view complaints as opportunities.
<P>2.	Establish an implementation team with representatives from each step in the complaint handling process and identify each step in the process.
<P>3.	Establish a tracking system. Your staff should record and classify complaints which will allow them to analyze the complaint data and report to top management. The difference between your process and the best-in-business process is known as the gap. A gap analysis will show you what to improve.
<P>4.	Develop recommendations to improve your core processes and empower front-line employees to resolve complaints on first contact.
<P>5.	Implement. The team should put together an action plan for implementing the approved recommendations. 
<P><BR>
Done right, your customer will notice changes within six months! <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Overview</B></H3>
<P><I>All executive departments that provide significant services to the public shall provide  a means to address complaints and make information, services, and complaint systems easily accessible.</I><BR>
President Bill Clinton
<P><B>Introduction</B>
<P>When Americans have a problem with something, they tell someone about it. They talk about companies that have overcharged them, provided poor service or who have rude employees. In fact, research shows that people who have a problem are likely to tell eight to ten people about it. However, fewer than one in twenty people who have a complaint will formally complain to the company itself. Best-in-class companies welcome complaints because complaints are customer feedback which can be used to improve service performance/reduce cost, thus improving the bottom line. They make it easy for customers to complain, even encourage complaints, and then they bend over backwards to set things right and make changes so that future customers do not experience similar problems.<BR>

<P>In the past, too many Americans have found a deaf ear when trying to complain about a problem to a government agency. Consider one man's experience when he tried to get a problem solved:  <I>I had written in February . . . and again in June . . . Now it is September. I still have not had a satisfactory response . . . what do I have to do to get someone to listen to me?</I><BR>

<P>This man--legitimately frustrated by his inability to get someone's ear--would be even angrier if he realized how much &quot;handling&quot; his complaint cost. One study estimates that a written response to a single complaint escalated to the Congressional level may cost the agency and the taxpayer over $1,000 in staff time.<BR>

<P>Fortunately, government agencies are beginning to change the way they look at and treat citizens who have problems. Spurred on by Vice President Gore's National Performance Review and its September 1993 report, <I>From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government That Works Better and Costs Less</I>, government agencies are working hard to make the federal government work better and cost less. Already, the recommendations have resulted in more than $60 billion in savings and elimination of some 200,000 government positions (noted in President Clinton's State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996). <BR>

<P>Customer service is an important part of the reinventing government efforts. Directed by President Clinton, government agencies have conducted focus groups and surveys and set customer service standards to respond to customers' needs. Agencies are starting to eliminate unnecessary regulations, cut red tape and address other root causes of citizen complaints. And many agencies are taking steps to improve how they deal with complaints. For example:
<P>	*	The U.S. Postal Service has established a Consumer Affairs Tracking System that records and reports every customer contact. It uses state-of-the-art imaging and database management technology coupled with highly sophisticated correspondence generation software. This system is comparable to our best-in-business models. U.S. Postal Service also established a Call Management Initiative that will begin later this year to create a single 1-800 number available 24 hours a day. It will provide a centrally-managed consistent interface to all customers seeking information or problem resolution.
<P>	*	The Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers have two formats for complaint and complimentary data collection. One is ongoing complaint tracking, the other is the annual survey. Patient Representatives throughout Veterans Health Administration have a tracking system for compliments and complaints. This system identifies trends that are occurring by specific problem, by a service, and or by an individual. The complaint codes are correlated with the National Customer Service Standards, which provide ongoing measurement. Alerts are sent to Service Chiefs identifying more serious problems. This allows the Service Chief prompt notification of the problem and provides expeditious resolution. The National Patient Feedback program is also correlated with the National Customer Service Standards. Annually, surveys are sent to outpatients and recently discharged inpatients. These surveys are used to identify trends that are occurring. Medical Centers are responsible for improving the areas where problems exist.

<P><BR>
Citizens are starting to notice as well and are even writing letters, not to complain, but to compliment the people who work in government: 
<P><I>I wish to thank you and your department for your expeditious and thorough consideration and solving of my problem. . . .Mr. . . . was able to provide me with the necessary information. In addition, when Mr. . . . received additional information that he thought might be useful, he forwarded it also. Mr. . . . follow up was a surprise and a good example of real interest in my problem. This kind of thoughtfulness and follow up is greatly appreciated.</I><BR>

<P><I>I'm still in shock at how fast FEMA responded to my need. I thought FEMA was just a lot of red tape, to make people feel they could get help. </I><BR>
	Georgia
<P><I>Human nature, alas, often has us eagerly voice complaints but keep silent when praise is warranted . . . My hunch is I speak for a large number when passing along a deserved WELL DONE for the fantastic job you do--often with limited funds and staff.</I><BR>

<P>Part of the reason for the change is that government agencies are holding themselves to a higher standard. This study represents the efforts of ten government agencies and other interested parties to learn from the best in America's leading companies and find ways to improve their own complaint processes.
<P><B>Why Tackle Customer Complaints?</B>
<P>Companies find that effectively handling customers with problems is critical to their reputations as well as their bottom lines. When customers complain and they are satisfied with the way their complaint is handled, they are more likely to purchase another product or service from the same company. Companies that resolve complaints on the first contact increase customer satisfaction and product loyalty, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce costs. Companies even encourage complaints. Most dissatisfied customers do not complain. By making it easy for customers to complain, more customers will come to you with their problems, giving you greater opportunity to correct your service delivery or production processes. Customers who get their problems satisfactorily and quickly solved tell their friends and neighbors, and they are not easily won over by the competition.<BR>

<P>There is a bottom-line concern for government as well. As noted above, complaints can be costly. Repeated hand-offs increase costs and waste precious resources. When complaints are not promptly resolved, frustrated customers seek redress in different agencies or at different parts or levels of the same agency, resulting in duplicate effort and compounding costs. <BR>

<P>Just as costs compound when there is a poor complaint system, trust also erodes as citizens become frustrated with a non-responsive bureaucracy. Indeed, there has been a cumulative erosion of public confidence in government. Thirty years ago, 70 percent of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing most of the time. In 1993, only 17 percent of Americans said that they trusted the government.(2) There are many factors contributing to this decline in trust and confidence, particularly the huge volume of regulations that did not make sense to the public and the high cost of government. However, we learned from our benchmarking partners that an effective approach to resolving complaints is invaluable in winning the trust and loyalty of our customers--the public.<BR>

<P>There are costs associated with a poor complaint system and there are benefits associated with a good one. Studies have shown that handling customer complaints well can be a critical part of a turnaround strategy. If a complaint is handled well, it sustains and strengthens customer loyalty and the company's image as a leader. It also tells the customer that the company cares and can improve because of their contact. In government agencies, it promotes public confidence in government services.<BR>

<P>Customer complaints also represent valuable information about recurrent problems. They can point the way to understanding the root causes of customer problems and help an organization target core processes that need improvement. If acted upon to improve core processes, customer complaints can be a source of information that can reduce costs as well as improve services.
<P><B>What do the Best-in-Business do?</B>
<P>Federal employees initiated and led this consortium benchmarking study to learn from the best-in-business how to design and implement a world-class complaint and customer response handling system. That's what benchmarking is all about--systematically learning from the best-in-business and using that information to improve one's own performance. <BR>

<P>We asked some of America's leading companies to help and they did. They had a lot to offer. The customer service revolution means that, today, most companies strive to exceed the expectations of their customers with problems. The study team got a surprise when it looked for best practices; some best-in-business practices were found in government organizations that have practices that rival the best in the private sector. The team is grateful to each of the businesses and agencies for sharing their experiences.<BR>

<P>Each study team member reviewed how their agency currently handles customer complaints and identified key areas where they wanted to learn how the best-in-the business did it. They reviewed written literature, met with experts, and identified benchmarking partners. A team member from each participating agency led one site visit and shared the results with the others; this way the team could benefit from visits to ten companies and agencies at the lowest cost. <BR>

<P>The team defined a customer complaint as any indication that the service or product does not meet the customer's expectations. This definition reflects the fact that some companies do not even use the term complaints, they call them problems or opportunities. The team found variation in what companies did, but the best companies used similar approaches to handling complaints. They are:
<P>	*	Train and empower their front-line employees to resolve most complaints during the first contact. 
<P>	*	Make it easy for customers to complain through the extensive use of centralized customer help-lines, 1-800 numbers, complaint/comment cards at the point of service, and easy-to-use customer appeal processes. 
<P>	*	Enter complaint data in fully automated and integrated information systems, and analyze and use data to identify and fix root causes of dissatisfaction and to determine future directions for product and service improvements. By centrally collecting the data, at the headquarters level, this valuable information can be incorporated into the strategic planning process, assuring future competitiveness.
<P>	*	Consider complaints as customer feedback and opportunities to improve, alongside other measures of customer satisfaction. 
<P>	*	Use various organizational arrangements, but have important similarities, such as seeking to maximize resolution at first point of contact and dedicating a cross functional team to collect and analyze data and report complaint information to top management.
<P>	*	Credit their overall success, at least in part, to a pending organizational crisis, normally related to their survival or significant loss of revenue.
<P><B>What's Next?</B>
<P>Agencies that participated in this complaint resolution study are using its results to make changes in their own complaint handling systems. Indeed, benchmarking that consists only of field trips to world class companies is known as &quot;industrial tourism.&quot; For a benchmarking study to be worthwhile, an organization needs to understand the gap between its own performance and best practices and take actions to close that performance gap. Already:
<P>	*  The Patent and Trademark Office is using the study's findings along with reengineering efforts to design a Patent Assistance Center and redesign an existing Trademark Assistance Center as one-stop sources for Patent and Trademark information.
<P>	*	The U.S. Postal Service is using what it learned from this study as a guideline to reevaluate its complaint handling function for 1996. U.S. Postal Service is also responding to inquiries and complaints received over the Internet.
<P>	*	The Department of Interior, in several of its Bureaus has developed and used surveys to get customer feedback. They are incorporating lessons learned from this study in their ongoing Customer Service initiatives, i.e. Customer Service Standards and Customer Satisfaction Measurements.
<P>	*	The Customs Service conducted a gap analysis, designed recommendations, and prepared an action plan for FY 1996 which includes two goals: (1) training for their Air Passenger Service representatives, and (2) automating an input system to improve the tracking of complaints and compliments.
<P>	*	The IRS team prepared a FY 1996 action plan to develop cost estimates of processing the Problem Resolution Program (PRP) and Application Taxpayer Assistance Orders (ATAO) cases and to develop a network of Problem Resolution Program coordinators to better address cross-functional issues that cause problems for taxpayers.
<P>The goal, of course, is for government to listen to its customers (1) routinely through surveys and (2) when products or services do not live up to expectations, through an effective complaint handling system. We know that we've only begun, but we're working hard. We expect a number of agencies will use this report to begin reengineering their complaint handling processes.
<P><BR>
Other agencies can make use of this benchmarking study as well, by answering the questions about your organization included in <B>How Does Your Organization Measure Up</B>? See Reinventing Complaint Resolution, Appendix 1, for how to use this book to strengthen the complaint system in your organization. 
<P><B>Section 1: Leadership Strategies for Satisfying Customers</B>
<P><I>The philosophy indoctrinated by the leaders of the company is that every experience the customer has from the time of initial contact, during purchase, and throughout the life of the product, focuses on complete customer satisfaction. All employees have a part in customer relations and ensuring the best quality service and the best product. The emphasis is &quot;Customer First.&quot;</I><BR>
Benchmarking Study Partner
<P>There is little question that the leaders in the best-in-business companies see customers as their top priority. The leaders of these organizations practice the following initiatives.
<P><B>Listen to the Voice of the Customer </B>
<P>One company knew they'd begun to hear the voice of their customers when they went from 10,000 letters a year, mostly complaints, to 4,000 a year, mostly compliments. The leaders followed two simple rules: make it easy for customers to complain and just as easy for employees to fix problems.<BR>

<P>The leaders demonstrate their commitment to customer concerns by investing corporate resources--money for tools like state-of-the-art computers and phone systems, and support, training and recognition for their employees. They see their job as making it easier for employees to respond to customers. They partner with organized labor to achieve results. They invest a lot of their own time in communication, talking to customers and employees and recognizing results. They have flattened their organization to cut the number of layers between the customer and the chief executive officer (CEO)--usually no more than three management levels separate the front-line workers from the CEO. Leaders of customer service departments are part of the management team.<BR>

<P>In all of the best-in-business organizations, customer complaints are seen as opportunities to improve. How complaints are handled reflects the organizations' overall commitment to customer service. Indeed, customer service is a core value in these organizations, reflected in mission statements, plans, performance measures, budget and personnel decisions and decisions about contractor selection and retention. Leadership communicates their commitment to customers so effectively throughout the organization that the value is pervasive. Customer service does not depend on a single leader; it has been built into the way these organizations do business. 
<P><B>Know That Front-Line Complaint Resolution Saves Time and Money and Improves Customer and Worker Satisfaction </B>
<P>It's not rocket science to realize that solving problems when and where they occur is not only better and faster, it's cheaper. If a teleservice representative or a front desk clerk can solve the problem, it saves time and money. Written complaints are similar. If the person who first reads the letter can solve the problem, it costs less and results in a faster response and fewer follow-up letters and phone calls trying to find out what happened. Audits by Technical Assistance Research Programs, Inc. (TARP) at over a dozen financial service companies shows that poor service and poor customer communication increase the total workload by up to one-third!(3)<BR>

<P>Smart CEOs recognize that it makes good business sense to empower front line employees to do what it takes to satisfy customers, by ensuring their front line has the authority, the training and the responsibility for customer recovery. Customer recovery takes a lot of different forms. At one company, front-line employees can offer discount coupons that range in value from twenty to two hundred and fifty dollars. At one government agency, customer representatives can speed up lost refunds or waive penalties that have been inappropriately applied. Sometimes, a careful explanation of the reason for a decision or empathetic listening along with an apology is all that is needed.
<P><B>Focus on Improving Quality not Dealing with Symptoms</B>
<P>If routine problems are effectively resolved on the front-line, leaders can focus on improving core processes that improve service quality and customer satisfaction. One team member likened the good complaint systems she saw in service organizations to a quality program in a manufacturing plant. &quot;The sooner these companies find out about complaints, the faster the core processes can be improved. Good managers don't play 'gotcha' with employees. They understand that most complaints are due to procedures and policies that don't meet customers' expectations. Best-in-business companies use complaints to find the problems that had somehow been overlooked. They told us that when employees know that the leadership is focusing on doing a good job for the customer rather than on finding someone to blame, fear and resistance go out the window--the employees want to help find and fix the problems so that next time the job is done right the first time.&quot;<BR>

<P>One of our benchmarking partners goes a step further to involve employees and integrate customer feedback. They try to capture customer satisfaction data from every customer contact. They do not believe that a separate complaint handling system captures the whole picture. Thirty percent of their entire workforce wears the title Customer Service Representative. These representatives record customer contacts on a sophisticated computer system that allows them to code the root cause of any problem or question. This information is fed to a staff that analyzes the data to look for patterns and trends and for ways to make improvements in systems, procedures and training. Senior management uses the feedback for planning and communication with employees. <BR>

<P>Another company described the transformation of its own customer operations in three phases. In the first phase, customer complaints were seen as a necessary evil and some customers were considered to be &quot;chronic complainers.&quot; In the second phase, the company provided &quot;knee jerk&quot; customer service to pacify complaining customers. Today, the company's response operation not only assures a response in individual cases but collects information and analyzes all customer complaints to understand what underlies them and to identify root causes. When they identify a pattern that is causing problems, they introduce broader changes to remove the cause.

<P><B>Section 2: Information and Analysis</B><BR>

<P><I>We've significantly decreased cycle time and increased consistent and accurate responses with a database of standard letters and core language. Employees can use standard letters to reply to many complaints or inquiries such as the price of a stamp or where a customer can buy a used mail truck.</I><BR>

<P>U.S. Postal Service<BR>

<P>Not every organization gets frequent requests for used mail trucks, but every organization benchmarked supports its front-line employees with the information and tools they need to respond to customer complaints and inquiries. Every organization sees the information provided by customers with problems as valuable and collects and analyzes information about customer complaints. One organization described the information as &Ograve;free market research.&Oacute; The organizations use a variety of approaches to capture and analyze the information and to use the information for both routine and strategic management decisions. Best practice organizations use the following techniques.
<P><B>Support Front-Line Employees with Integrated On-Line Data Bases</B>
<P>Companies use integrated, on-line information systems designed to support the performance of the front-line employees who interact with customers and assist them in answering customer inquiries quickly and accurately. Characteristics of state-of-the-art desktop computer information systems include:
<P>	*	User-friendly screens equipped with standardized formats to assist the customer service process; including for example, frequently asked questions with appropriate responses, standard response letters or actual scripts to reinforce training and prompt the employee. 
<P>	*	Unique customer identification and access to customer information so that the customer representative can give customized service. 
<P>	*	Simple on-line procedures manuals, often with help screens.
<P>	*	Avoidance of complex codes and &quot;user hostile&quot; features in information systems.
<P>	*	Employee participation in development and testing to make sure that systems are accurate and easy to use.
<P>	*	Real-time information exchange and retrieval and tools (such as electronic mail and fax capacity) so that employees can complete transactions quickly.
<P>	*	Links to fully integrated information databases, including documents submitted in paper form that have been imaged and archived electronically, press releases, new product developments, standard responses, information about hot topics and performance statistics.
<P>	*	On-line technical support as a first-alarm response to ADP difficulties, to help the front-line employees. 
<P><B>Capture Information About Customer Problems and Questions</B>
<P>Front-line employees generally enter data to avoid duplication of effort, improve accuracy and avoid backups in obtaining information about customer problems. Data analysis is generally centralized with a dedicated team or department responsible for analyzing data as their primary duty. Analysis groups often identify the most common concerns, analyze hot topics and facilitate problem solving. For example, determining how to prevent customers from being dissatisfied or from needing to call for information--this leads to a preventive strategy known as &quot;call avoidance.&quot;<BR>

<P>Managers in world-class organizations have real-time trend information, rather than end-of-the-period updates. They also get analysis that links front-line performance with corporate goals for customer satisfaction. Menu-driven programs allow users across the organization to develop reports and graphs from data specific to their area of responsibility. Using off-the-shelf software tailored to organizational needs, managers can retrieve and see complaint data displayed by type, region, product or service line, injury or catastrophic event, units responsible, root cause, volume, etc. Informed management makes better decisions.<BR>

<P>Effective analysis groups use integrated and non-duplicative databases. These data bases include complaints from all sources, e.g., telephone calls, surveys, focus groups, correspondence, complaint/concern cards available on site and/or personal visits. Database records include names, addresses, telephone numbers, individual employee assigned, actions taken, due dates, progress, disposition, and other descriptive information used to enhance all customer contacts.
<P><B>Use Information to Fix Problems Fast</B>
<P>The first priority of the front-line employee is to satisfy the customer. At the same time, the employee enters the customer's concern into a database along with the action taken to satisfy the customer. In some organizations, the front-line employee also enters a description or codes the root cause of the customer's concern. <BR>

<P>Information about customer interactions is then referred to analysis teams and to appropriate process improvement teams that are charged with solving problems. Simple changes are made quickly, often within 24 hours of a problem being identified. The automated tracking system follows the problem to resolution. The features of these systems include precise categories and types of concerns, automated hot topics, automated ad hoc reporting, and competitive information gathering. Front-line employees can propose changes also via the same electronic system.
<P><B>Address Underlying Causes of Problems</B>
<P>More complex problems or ones with policy implications are prioritized by the analysis group based on customer impact and referred to the area of the organization that can fix the problems or to a team of employees that is charged with solving it. Some companies prioritize customers and attack the core complaints of the most frequent or highest volume customers. Where there is a fully integrated automated complaint system, core problems are automatically routed to action agents. <BR>

<P>Action agents further analyze the data and refer problems to the area of the organization that can best fix the problems, and organize cross-functional teams of employees from all levels in the chain-of-command to get at the root cause and correct it. By fixing root causes, future problems of the same nature are avoided, resulting in improved customer loyalty and organizational productivity. For example, critical analysis of data at one organization found that a large percentage of the 35,000 calls they received each month were simple billing questions. Now a voice response system can answer these questions, decreasing the number of calls they receive per month and giving customers faster access to the information they need. <BR>

<P>There are regular activity reports on actions taken to fix problems. Information on actions taken and overall improvements are communicated to top management, staff employees and front-line employees through briefings, newsletters, bulletin boards, direct interaction, complimentary letters, and, especially, an interlocking team structure. Information is communicated to customers through corporate media publications, telephone calls and letters. As problems may relate to either lost productivity or lost revenue, the responsible department&Otilde;s budget may be charged for activities (root causes) for which they have been made aware of and that have not been corrected. There is thus a financial incentive for corrective action.
<P><B>Track Contractor and Supplier Performance</B>
<P>Organizations that rely on contractors for customer interactions measure how well they perform. They track the performance of contractors and suppliers&Otilde; products and services against customer satisfaction factors. An analysis is made to determine if corrective action is needed by these outside sources in order to prevent future complaints. Some companies are using shorter contracts and expecting greater accountability for performance. Some are moving to performance contracts that specify expected performance levels with the parent organization conducting surveys of customer satisfaction and monitoring other measures of contractor performance. 
<P><B>Lessons Learned</B>
<P>*	Observe trends. When corrective actions have been taken, determine whether the volume of complaints is decreasing to assess if products and/or services have improved.
<P>*	Technology utilization is important in complaint handling systems. A standardized, automated systems approach captures and analyzes root cause data.  
<P>*	Bring in technology to support change; don&Otilde;t change to support the technology that you bring.
<P>*	Data must be translated into information and presented to everyone including management in a useable format so that the organization can better align services and products to meet customer expectations.
<P><B>How Does Your Organization Measure Up?</B>
<P>	*	How does your organization support front line employees so that they can serve customers with complaints?
<P>	*	How does your organization track and analyze complaints?
<P>	*	How does your organization use information about complaints to fix easy problems fast?
<P>	*	How does your organization use information about complaints to identify and address underlying problems?
<P><B>Section 3: Planning</B>
<P>The benchmarked organizations would not be where they are today if they operated the same way they did five years ago--or even last year. And they do not expect to be operating the same way next year--and certainly not five years from now. Information generated from complaints is an important component of customer feedback that drives business decisions and strategic planning in these companies. They integrate information and use it effectively to serve customers. They implement new lines of business because their customers ask for it. The age and needs of their customers are changing so they are making changes to respond to new customer's needs. The best-in-business organizations all do the following.
<P><B>Use Customer Feedback for Decisions About how Resources are Used</B>
<P>Finding the best way to acquire new customers and maintain long term customer loyalty is the reason for the planning process. Obviously complaint data are only part of customer feedback, but it is the importance of all forms of customer feedback, including complaint data, that characterizes their planning. Using this information, these organizations make decisions about the use of people, technology and other resources to meet customer needs. Officers and departments responsible for customer service are part of the planning team. Senior management uses customer feedback to identify opportunities for improvement and to align the organization's services and/or products to meet customer expectations. 
<P><B>Communicate Their Strategic Plans Throughout the Organization</B>
<P>There is no question about how important customers are at every level in world-class organizations. Mission and vision statements about the importance of customers are only as good as their impact on behavior from the board room to the mail room. Managers need to &quot;walk the talk.&quot; Every employee needs to know how their work contributes to the organization's goals and performance plans. For example, one Baldridge-Award winning company has a single objective, &quot;customer satisfaction through total quality.&quot; The policy requires that every employee understand the customer-related requirements in their job and meet those requirements. Company policy emphasizes listening to customers before designing new products or services, through production and beyond the sale, to ensure customer satisfaction. This theme is communicated throughout the company and is clear to every employee. The corporate culture applies all of its creativity and intellect to delighting the customer.
<P><B>Have Dynamic Planning Processes</B>
<P>Best-in-business organizations look to the future and recognize that the way they do business has to change to keep the competitive edge. They project information about customers, as well as other aspects of the business environment, to develop future scenarios and determine what changes are needed in products, services and other aspects of their business. One company has projected changes in membership into the next century and is already making changes in how they respond to younger customers. Constant assessment of customer feedback, as part of the planning process, leads to new product lines and services, notably the 24-hour telephone service that is now common. One government organization uses customer data from the appeals process to identify trends and problems and reassess their strategic and business plans, leading to changes in policy, guidelines and procedures.
<P><B>Lessons Learned</B>
<P>*<B> t</B>Your mission statement and vision reflect your values. Your environment should support your philosophy.
<P>*	You can't over-communicate. 
<P>*	Keep the customers' perspective in your planning processes.
<P><B>How Does Your Organization Measure Up?</B>
<P>	*	How is customer service incorporated in your organization&Otilde;s vision, plans and actions? 
<P>	*	How well are resource decisions aligned with customer needs?
<P>	*	How dynamic is your planning processes?
<P>	*	How do you get complaint information to the CEO or top management?
<P><B>Section 4: Human Resource Development and Management</B>
<P>Resolving complaints on a regular basis can be extremely stressful. Successful organizations know that and treat their customer service representatives with respect and dignity. They select people carefully for the job, train them and foster a supportive working environment. Front-line employees count in these companies. The best-in-business organizations do the following.
<P><B>Recruit and Hire the Best for Customer Service</B>
<P>The customer service and complaint resolution specialist positions established by the benchmarking partners tend to be highly sought-after positions; sometimes there are over one hundred applicants for each open position. Complaint handling employees are considered complaint handling professionals or customer service professionals. Companies who fill openings from within the organizations draw only from a list of highly qualified employees with a demonstrated interest and skill in working with the public. One benchmarking partner did not have a separate customer service position, but rather trained their technical experts to handle complaints as part of their job. Another company hires from outside, but has a highly selective screening process, and a competitive marketplace starting salary.<BR>

<P>The most important factor in hiring was selection of individuals who fit in with the customer service culture and have a demonstrated skill and interest in working with the public. Organizations used a variety of selection techniques, including temporary assignments to determine the suitability of an employee for resolving customer complaints; initial telephone interviews for call center employees, extensive staff and peer interviews--up to 14 interviews in one company. Companies look for a variety of character traits, skills, and experience for customer service jobs: 
<P>	*	Problem solving ability.
<P>	*	Skill in handling tense, stressful, and multi-task situations.
<P>	*	Strong sense of responsibility.
<P>	*	Good communication skills and voice clarity.
<P>	*	Business writing skills.
<P>	*	Knowledge of relevant processes.
<P>	*	&quot;People skills&quot; with customers and co-workers. 
<P>	*	Compassionate, customer-oriented attitude.
<P>	*	Strong desire to help customers. 
<P>	*	Computer skills or aptitude.
<P>	*	College degrees are desirable and sometimes required.
<P>	*	Typing and other diagnostic tests may also be required.
<P><B>Promote and Pay People who Satisfy Customers </B>
<P>Some organizations build the customer service position into a career ladder for promotional advancement in the company. At one company, the customer relations position is an 18-month to two-year assignment, with the employees advancing to higher levels within the company. In other organizations, progression is built into the position via skill based pay systems. That is, new skills and improved performance results in increased pay and responsibility. Another company develops the representative's expertise within certain areas of complaints, and the individual  handles all the complaints in that specific area. The turnover rate for these positions tends to be in the single digits. Individuals generally leave because they are excelling in their careers, which is a cause for celebration. Agencies need to review and revise their policies and procedures that limit rewarding results, legislative changes are not needed.
<P><B>See Training as a Critical Investment, Not an Expense</B>
<P>Best-in-Business leaders consider training an investment, not an expense. They use complaint trends/data to identify training needs. One organization increased training from 17 to 71 hours per person per year. Another, with 70 hours of training per employee, devotes three percent of its personnel budget to training. One company gives approximately 100 hours in training to all employees. Most world-class organizations fund college courses. One organization we visited provides space for evening classes held by local colleges and universities. Typically, new employee training consists of classroom instruction and on-the-job training, working with someone more experienced. They are educated in the underlying principles and mission of the organization, and in the performance expected of them to maintain those principles and mission.<BR>

<P>On going training classes for different categories of skills is crucial. To enhance individual interpersonal relationships, training offerings cover active listening, behavioral interviewing, communicating across cultures, correction (assertive ways to give and accept criticism to and from peers), and building relationships. To develop group relationships, courses cover facilitation, negotiation, leading teams, and coaching. Personal growth skills benefit from offerings such as effective writing, software training, personal presentations, and <I>The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People</I>.(4) Other categories deal directly with the business operations. One category teaches process management skills, e.g., process mapping (especially in the employee's processes), developmental processes, problem solving, quality improvements, and gap analysis. Another area covers measurement skills, such as operation effectiveness, surveying, and measuring. Lastly, organizations educate their employees on the mission statement, and how their jobs relate to it.  
<P><B>Create a Performance Culture </B>
<P>The organizations we visited have a performance-focused culture. Organizational vision, values, goals and objectives reach all the way down to the front line. The work environment may be casual or formal, but customer and quality concerns are always present. In this atmosphere, complaints are viewed as an opportunity to improve rather than an indictment of performance.<BR>

<P>Employees feel encouraged to contribute their ideas for improving processes, regardless of rank or function. A well-developed feedback loop lets the employee know the disposition of the recommendation. Employee feedback is also valued in focus groups, customer on-line comments, assessment tools, internal surveys, and management information sessions. 
<P><B>Use Teams and Teamwork</B>
<P>A team-oriented culture is the norm with world-class organizations. Teams accept ownership of complaints, and work together to handle complaints, analyze the problems, and generate new ideas. All employees are involved in the vision. Everyone is part of the team.<BR>

<P>At one organization, there is no hierarchy, no job titles, and everyone works on the front-line on a schedule determined by the team. They have state-of-the-art equipment. The information technology staff that developed the software spend time on the telephone with customers so they learn what is needed to satisfy customers. Work stations are designed as a neighborhood environment, partnering employees with different skills into self-managed work teams. Morale has soared; turnover dropped from 106 percent to five percent and more work is being done with 76 employees than was previously done by 126 in the headquarters and at distant locations. The goal of the operation is to delight the customer in world-class fashion and the customer service professionals on the front-line work together to do so.
<P><B>Give Employees Authority and Responsibility to Resolve Complaints</B>
<P>Empowerment of customer service representatives is crucial to providing customers on-the-spot, just-in-time resolution to their problems. They must have the authority to do what it takes to make things right in the customer's eyes. Also crucial is arming those employees with the resources to properly handle complaints. <BR>

<P>Employees with a feeling of ownership in the company help each other for the good of the organization. They take responsibility for improving their own skill levels, solving problems, and sharing information. They share information via newsletters and town meetings so the same mistakes do not recur.
<P><B>Recognize and Reward Success</B>
<P>World-class organizations recognize their employees' individual and team accomplishments frequently and in a large variety of ways, monetary and non-monetary. These organizations use employee appreciation events, celebrations, representative/team of the quarter/year awards, bonuses, and merchandise. At one organization, non-salaried employees participate in profit-sharing based on merit, with their share of the profit determined by their team's performance against company goals. <BR>

<P>Evaluation methods are geared toward customer recovery and performance improvement. For example, supervisors use call monitoring as an evaluation tool to help the employee perform better, not to give them a poor appraisal rating. At one organization, peers are responsible for monitoring calls and are trained to give constructive criticism. At another organization, individuals rate themselves by listening to their own audiotaped calls. A comprehensive 360 degree performance system includes the supervisor, customer and peer input into the evaluation. Feedback is continuous throughout the year rather than one-time, and is both oral and written. Performance measures tie back to the company&Otilde;' mission, goals, and customer satisfaction. One company rewards its employees for results by fixing something, not for suggestions.
<P><B>Involve Front-Line Employees in Solving Problems</B>
<P>In these companies, managers value feedback from front-line employees, to the point of using the feedback in making decisions. Front-line employees are held accountable, but are given authority to go with accountability. They are encouraged to tell management about their customer's concerns. These employees buy into the system because they can see results based on their suggestions and input. Documenting customer calls helps to decrease the number of dissatisfied customers by determining the root cause of the problems. The company brings front-line employees in from the field to analyze problems, recommend alternatives to management, and implement the accepted solution. Employees embrace the corporate culture that complaints are opportunities to improve. All employees feel responsible for solving problems. <BR>

<P>Managers take care and pride in positively motivating employees. They recognize the importance of the job of front line employees by listening to and acting on the employees&Otilde; ideas, rewarding their efforts, highlighting the position in the company's career ladder, and offering training for growth. Front-line workers' personal well-being is also important, and management provides benefits such as child care centers and fitness facilities. These organizations adhere to the policy that employee satisfaction is as important as customer satisfaction to the success of their business.

<P><B>Section 5: Customer Focus, Expectations and Satisfaction</B>
<P><BR>
<I>When you buy a tank from the Red River Army Depot, there's a 1-800 number in the &quot;glove compartment&quot; so you know who to call if you have a problem with the vehicle. At Red River, customer calls come into the 24-hour production control center. At the center, the officer on duty coordinates customer response by initiating, tracking, and evaluating the quality of support provided by the organization. If you have serious trouble with your tank, a customer service team can be mobilized to fly out to fix the problem. </I>
<P>While troubles with a tank are not a typical customer problem, organizations like Red River, a winner of the 1995 President's Quality Improvement Prototype Award, go out of their way to make it easy for customers to complain. They organize to respond rapidly when their customers have a problem. These organizations understand what their customers need and expect. The best-in-business organizations practice the following.
<P><B>Encourage Customer Complaints</B>
<P>One public agency found that three quarters of its customers had no idea who to talk to if they had a problem. Many customers think it's simply not worth the hassle to complain. They are skeptical that the organization will do anything or they may even fear retribution.<BR>

<P>Best-in-business organizations actively encourage customer complaints. Some companies even refer to what they do to encourage complaints as &quot;marketing&quot; their complaint system. Companies make consumer service cards available at the place of business. Many solicit feedback wherever they post or publish customer service standards, on all correspondence, on bills, and in the telephone directory. Some offer discount coupons to encourage customer feedback. Many publish information on how they can be contacted in more than one language. They publish 1-800 and other numbers for the company where consumers are most likely to see them, e.g., on the product packaging. Companies also market their complaint handling systems during conferences and meetings, in annual reports, newspapers, association circulars, videos, audio tapes, letters, press releases, speeches, training sessions and via electronic mail.
<P><B>Seek to Delight Their Customers</B>
<P>The benchmarking partners often use the phrase &quot;delight the customer&quot; and go out of their way to exceed expectations. Often this means a compassionate ear. An insurance company has a special team that deals with the needs of grieving spouses. Companies give front-line employees the authority to award customers who have complaints with products, coupons, or even cash when it is necessary to resolve a complaint. Even public sector employees are able to give certain products and services to customers with complaints. For example, the U.S. Postal Service can give up to $20 in stamps when it is appropriate. One service company sets no limits on the front-line employees' authority but tracks company norms for what it takes to resolve particular types of problems. Team leaders look at and discuss variances from these norms. Additionally, employees share ideas for ways to resolve complaints creatively within or below company norms. 
<P><B>Understand Their Customers</B>
<P>These organizations demonstrate a commitment to understanding the customer's perspective. Most of the benchmarking partners send surveys to customers who have complained recently to see how satisfied they were with how the complaint was handled. Some call the customers to determine satisfaction. One organization surveys every fourth customer with a complaint. Another described complaints as &quot;free information&quot; about their customers needs and expectations. <BR>

<P>These organizations supplement surveys of people who complain with routine and often extensive data collection tools in order to understand their customers. Customers are surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with existing services. Surveys are sent with questions, often in a Likert Scale format where the customer can select the degree of satisfaction on a scale, e.g., from one to five. <BR>

<P>These surveys assess customer satisfaction with existing services, delivery of services, helpfulness of employees, and overall performance of the organization. Some companies add a few short questions to the end of customer calls or correspondence. Companies also survey their front-line employees for their attitudes as well as for their ideas for improved service, asking their employees to take the customer's perspective. After the nearby community complained about noise levels, the Red River Army Depot changed the times they detonated ammunition and put &quot;listeners&quot; (members of the community) at check-points throughout the surrounding area to monitor noise levels. <BR>

<P>The partners focus on clear customer target groups. One company that serves a wide variety of customers decided to focus on its high-volume business customers. Three months after a high-volume business customer has complained, the company follows up to find out whether they are still using their services and, if not, the reasons for dissatisfaction. In addition, the company routinely solicits feedback before, during, and after service. It conducts focus groups and has established a Customer Advisory Council to drive decisions related to this key target group.
<P><B>Manage Customer Expectations</B>
<P>These organizations do not wait for complaints to come in the door. They try to anticipate the needs and problems of customers and to set realistic expectations through customer education and communication strategies. Research shows that 40 percent of complaints come from customers having inadequate information about a product or a service.(5) Using customer feedback to understand customer expectations and needs, organizations educate their customers and/or the public on what they can expect from their products and services and what obligations and responsibilities their customers have. For example, one enforcement/ regulatory partner has extensive education on the requirements and reasons for utilizing their services. 
<P><B>Know How to Say No</B>
<P>Both companies and government agencies, especially regulatory agencies, need to draw limits. When it is not possible to give the customer what they would like, it is still possible for a customer to feel that he or she has been heard and has been treated fairly. A number of techniques convey concern--calling customers and telling them the company understands; giving the customer the best explanation they can; and being open and honest with customers concerning laws and policies of the organization. Being professional and considerate of customers enhances their view of the organization--even when the customer may be disappointed with the outcome. A recent taxpayer letter to the Internal Revenue Service shows that the techniques cited above really work:<BR>

<P><I>For the first time in a long time, a communication from IRS is clear, concise, informative and user friendly. . . The attached--while I'd preferred not to have made the mistake--points out exactly what happened and what needed to be done. </I>
<P><BR>
In a small percentage of cases, it will be necessary to close a complaint when it is felt that the company or agency has done everything that can be done. Recognizing that it is not always possible to satisfy a customer, having procedures and trained staff to handle these cases, is part of an effective complaint handling system. 
<P><B>Keep the Human Touch</B>
<P>One company found that it made a major mistake when it introduced enhanced information technology. Employees lost eye contact with their customers. Keep the human touch--don't let automation get between the front-line employee and the customer. Eye-to-eye contact may be lost with computers. 
<P><B>Lessons Learned</B>
<P>*	Customer education is key to managing customer expectations.
<P>*	Know how to say no.
<P>*	Exceeding customer expectations for customers who have problems improves loyalty. 
<P>*	Make it easy to complain.
<P>*	Understand what customers want.
<P>*	Maintain a one-on-one relationship with customers
<P><B>How Does Your Organization Measure Up?</B>
<P>	*	How do you delight customers who have problems?
<P>	*	What access do customers have to your organization so that it is easy for them to complain?
<P>	*	How do you make sure that you understand what your customers want?
<P>	*	How do you manage the expectations of your customers?
<P>	*	How do you train and prepare the people who work for your organization to say &quot;no&quot;?
<P>	*	What do you do to make sure that information technology doesn't stand between your front-line employees and customers who have a problem?
<P><B>Section 6: Complaint Process Management</B>
<P><BR>
World-class service providers, which is what Americans expect their government to be, have a carefully developed complaint handling process. That process is customer-focused, is clearly understood by all employees, has performance standards, and is linked to the core operation. Without a well-designed and well-managed process, complaints are often handed off to different offices for response, delaying and generally increasing the cost of the response. The best-in-business organizations do the following.
<P><B>Really Know Their Processes</B>
<P>Each and every one of this study's benchmarking partners had a process map for their complaint handling processes. They told us that the map was key to understanding what was going on and was invaluable in perceiving the gaps between the goal of delighting the customer and what was currently taking place. Many companies begin by using simple flow charting methodology. Some have subsequently developed more complex and more graphic maps, but they all map their process.<BR>

<P>Customer representatives and complaint process managers clearly understand the services and products offered by their company or agency. They study and understand the customers' expectations. For example, at one company, customer telephone surveys are used to monitor the expectations of customers who call with a problem. At one public sector organization, managers analyze verbatim comments from complaints when they set performance goals for customer representatives. Another, with a client feedback program, surveys and analyzes survey information from recent clients, forwards all comments anonymously to the client representative at each facility. These concerns are included as part of each facility's client representative program performance.<BR>

<P>Research by this benchmarking team indicated that the best complaint departments have immediate goals to fix the problem at hand, satisfy the customer to the extent allowed by company policy or the law, and to make systemic improvements to prevent the problem from recurring. They strive to prevent problems through revised procedures and support for on-the-spot and post-event complaints recovery by front-line staff and managers. All of the offices that we visited knew how well they were meeting this goal.<BR>

<P>There are different processes for meeting the goal depending on how the customer contacts the organization. For example, customers contact service providers by telephone, letter, in person or via the Internet. The goals, resources, personnel, and results varied, but universally the best in business knew their processes thoroughly and they made it easy to complain. They provide one-stop resolution and if hand-offs are necessary, they are seamless (transparent to the customer). First call problem resolution while the customer is on the telephone is an element of world-class complaint handling. 
<P><B>Use Customer and Employee Input to Design processes</B>
<P>Developing a world-class complaint process begins and ends with the customer. At one company, customers participate throughout the process of product design, development, and support in order to express concern at the front-end of product delivery. Program managers respond to customer problems directly, and senior executives maintain ongoing, personal contact with customers. The U.S. Postal Service has more than 1,700 active Customer Advisory Councils that advise on the public's needs for both delivery and problem resolution. The U.S. Postal Service used focus groups of both customers and employees from various areas of the country and feedback from customer satisfaction surveys to develop their complaint resolution process. As a result of using extensive customer and employee input, the U.S. Postal Service found that they were able to improve the quality of responses and reduce cycle time and costs. <BR>

<P>The best-in-business design their complaint process with input from both customers and employees. They develop a culture that supports teamwork with the customer as part of the team. They design the process with top management commitment, performance measurements and a direct link to core processes. At one of our benchmarking partners, the customer relations personnel monitor customer feedback. They select a small number of items the customers complained about most often as target issues. Once these issues are identified, individual customer satisfaction committees are formed that link those issues with mission objectives. The complaint process is monitored to correct root causes of dissatisfaction.and the results for these target customer satisfaction issues are reported to the Executive Committee
<P><B>Use Technology to Support and Improve the Complaint Process</B>
<P>The benchmarked companies and agencies had built a technologically advanced infrastructure to answer complaints and other customer inquiries. They use 1-800 numbers, sophisticated telecommunication systems, Automated Call Distributors (ACDs), caller ID, imaging systems and office automation for state of the art on-line customer support systems. For example, one company has an automated system that allows service representatives to capture information about each member contact and make it accessible to everyone in the organization. 
<P><B>Practice Continuous Process Improvement</B>
<P>In business as in the Olympics, the bar is constantly being raised. Whether it be foreign competition, technological innovation, or more effective management and teamwork, each of us must produce more and better results with fewer and fewer resources. The key to beating the competition and keeping up with the times is continuous improvement. The key to continuous improvement is to refine, redesign, and improve your processes while putting the customer first. <BR>

<P>All of our benchmarking partners focused their attention on process improvement and they were good at it. Customers were kept involved, employees were recruited and trained with long range improvement in mind. Top management was kept informed along with the front-line. Best practices were developed by benchmarking and were carefully implemented and recorded. Performance measures were constantly monitored to identify gaps that could lead to opportunities to make things better. Employees were empowered to suggest and make process changes that help customers. Improvements were recognized.The complaint process was viewed as a loop with the customer at the beginning and at the end and with the core operating processes in the middle. Constant feedback from both customers and employees and constant reevaluation based on satisfaction measurement assure constant improvement. These incremental improvements lead to service excellence which is a winning strategy that can make government work better and cost less. Everyone wins! 
<P><B>Lessons Learned</B>
<P>*	Both customers and employees must understand the complaint process.
<P>*	If the goals for response time are too stringent the quality of the resolutions will be negatively affected. 
<P>*	Future directions: Customers&Otilde; ability to answer their own questions will increase with more information being published on e-mail and telephone systems that facilitate automated account information.
<P>*	Continuous improvement is key to beating the competition.
<P><B>How Does Your Organization Measure up?</B>
<P>	*	How does your organization design its complaint handling processes?
<P>	*	How do you involve the customer in the recovery process?
<P>	*	How does your organization create a culture that builds continuous improvement into all processes?
<P>	*	Does your organization invest in the infrastructure needed to make your complaint handling process effective both in customer recovery and minimizing costs?
<P>	*	How does your organization use complaint information to make operational improvements?
<P><B>Section 7: Business Results</B>
<P><I>If you don't measure results, you can't tell success from failure.(7)</I><BR>

<P>    David Osborne and Ted Gaebler<BR>

<P>Success for commercial companies is long term profitability, generated by maximizing customer satisfaction and loyalty. While the primary goal of government is to provide services to citizens, over the long term success is also generated by maximizing customer/citizen satisfaction and loyalty and earning the public trust. In both arenas we must know what our customers expect, we must know how well we are meeting those expectations, we must know what problems our customers encounter, we must know how much these problems cost us to respond to and how much they impact customer satisfaction. Finally we must change our processes to eliminate those problems. The best-in-business organizations reduce their costs and increase their profits by using the following.
<P><B>Key Performance Measures</B>
<P>The benchmarking partners use a variety of measures to assess the performance of their complaint handling systems. These measures are part of a balanced scorecard--a set of organizational performance measures which includes such bottom line measures as return on investment and sales, and compliance rates for regulatory agencies, measures of overall customer satisfaction, financial and other measures.<BR>

<P>Performance measures are dynamic. They change as goals are met, improvements are made, priority customer segments are identified, and more predictive measures are developed. Companies with more mature measurement and complaint handling systems described changes over time in the measures that they used. In the past, individual employee performance was measured and individual awards were given. Today performance is more often measured for groups or teams and individuals receive team awards. Many companies and agencies began measuring customer satisfaction several years ago. They measure customer satisfaction not only with their products and services, but also with their complaint resolution process.<BR>

<P>Our partners had accomplished significant changes in key measures. For example one highly technical organization decreased the average number of days it takes to resolve a complaint from 55 to 19 days. A second organization reduced the time required to resolve cases from 27 to 6 days, well below their standard of 15 days.
<P><B>Timeliness and Efficiency</B>
<P>The best-in-business organizations measure timeliness with a strong focus on first-call resolution or on-line resolution and they average an 85 percent resolution on the first contact for all calls received. Timeliness standards vary by complexity and by industry but were specific--e.g. resolution within 14 days, response within five business days. At one company, the customer is asked to set the deadline for an answer to the problem. The deadline is entered in the system and becomes part of the company's commitment to the customer. The customer is notified if the deadline cannot be met. A tracking system monitors the status of open cases. Preventive measures are more difficult, although some organizations quantified &quot;calls avoided&quot; and other complaint-prevention strategies. Examples of measures and some high-end norms include:
<P>	*	First call/contact resolution: 85% average for all calls/contacts received.
<P>	*	Backlog: 0%
<P>	*	Cycle time - based on customer expectation
<P>	*	Call avoidance - through customer education
<P><B>Customer Satisfaction</B>
<P>Benchmarking partners see quality and customer satisfaction as their first priority and a variety of measures are used to track the performance of the complaint handling system from the customer's perspective. Overall levels of satisfaction with how a complaint was handled are often tracked using survey responses from customers who have made complaints. A variety of other qualitative characteristics are measured, such as whether the parties understood the decision and whether they felt that they had been treated fairly. The best-in-business continually monitor customer expectations for and satisfaction with their complaint resolution system.
<P><B>Call Center Measures</B>
<P>Organizations responding to complaints through call centers use a variety of measures:
<P>	*	Average speed of answer: e.g. , 10 seconds or less
<P>	*	Abandoned call rate: 2-3%
<P>	*	Busy rate: less than 1%
<P>	*	Service level (total calls less busy signals and abandoned calls): 98%
<P>	*	First call resolution (one agent/no transfers)
<P>	*	Queue waiting time: less than 60 seconds
<P>	*	On hold waiting time less than 15 seconds
<P>	*	Team leaders typically monitor 5-10 calls per month for each front-line employee.<BR>
Note:  For further information see NPR's Benchmarking report titled, <I>Best Practices in Telephone Service.</I>
<P><B>Correspondence Center Measures</B>
<P>Organizations responding to written complaints, use measures:
<P>	*	Average response time for standard or information responses
<P>	*	Average response time for specialized/individual responses
<P>	*	Cycle time for each type of response
<P><B>Workload Measure</B>
<P>All the benchmarking partners track work load through measures such as numbers of calls, complaints or letters. However, they are cautious about how these numbers, especially numbers of complaints, are interpreted. Is it good or bad that the number of complaints goes up in a given time period? Does it reflect more effective marketing of the complaint system? The introduction of a new product? A problem with educational material? Repeat calls from people trying to get a response? <BR>

<P>If it has been difficult to complain and an organization makes it easier, the number of complaints should increase initially. Then, as complaint data and other customer feedback are used to eliminate underlying problems, the number of complaints should decline. The best companies do everything they can to encourage complaints and as a result they greatly reduce the number of complaints received. 
<P><B>Employee Satisfaction:</B>
<P>Employee satisfaction is considered to be a key indicator of productivity and customer satisfaction. Best-in-business organizations track employee satisfaction through the use of employee satisfaction surveys and/or through predictive indicators, such as :
<P>	*	Employee satisfaction survey results
<P>	*	Attrition rates of employees
<P>	*	Training hours in customer service per employee
<P>	*	When service is good and the organization&Otilde;s culture encourages teamwork, both customers and employees are happy.
<P><B>Lessons Learned</B>
<P>*	Best-in-business companies listen to the voice of the customer and the voice of the employee.
<P>*	What you measure is what you get.
<P>*	Customers who have minor problems that are promptly and effectively handled are more loyal than customers who never have a problem.
<P><B>How Does Your Organization Measure up?</B>
<P>	*	How does your organization measure customer satisfaction for your overall service?
<P>	*	How do you measure your workload?
<P>	*	How does your organization listen to the voice of the employee, who directly serves the customer?<BR>

<H3><B>Appendix I: Reinventing Complaint Resolution</B></H3>
<P>
<H3><B>A Check List for Implementing Best Practices in Complaint Resolution</B></H3>
<P><I>Serving the American Public: Best Practices in Resolving Customer Complaint</I>s documents some of the best practices in handling complaints. This check list is a guide to implementing the best practices documented in the study to achieve quantum performance leaps in resolving complaints at other federal agencies. Actions for:
<P>	*	Get executive buy-in. In order to achieve any real success, senior management must support the team. This should be done early. Include visual material when appropriate.
<P>	*	Put together an implementation team. This team should include a representative from each step in the complaint handling process: front-line workers, information systems support, union representatives, management, quality improvement, etc.
<P>	*	Map your current processes--both for complaints and the core processes they relate to. If you're not sure what your complaint system looks like, the team's first activity should be to identify each step in the process of complaint handling, from initial contact to final resolution. 
<P>	*	Conduct a gap analysis. The team should compare its own operations to the best practices listed in the report to understand where there are key differences between the team's organization and world-class performance. The difference between the team's services and the best-in-class processes is known as the gap. A starting point for a gap analysis is the list of questions about your organization. 
<P>	*	Develop recommendations. Based on the gap analysis, the team should develop a list of recommended changes in the organization's processes designed to close the gap. Some teams will tackle a large number of recommendations in the complaint handling report. Others may get better results by focusing on those recommendations that are linked to their core business practices or can provide the largest improvements. [???The team may ask for input from major organizational components (i.e. budget, systems, training, human resources) to identify issues that could affect the implementation of certain recommendations.]
<P>	*	Brief the stakeholders. Senior executives and, where relevant, upper-level union management, should be briefed on the proposed recommendations. Feedback from these sessions should be used to develop final recommendations.
<P>	*	Implementation. The team should then put together an action plan for implementing the approved recommendations.
<P>	*<B>	</B>Achieve measurable results!! Done right, your customers should notice changes within six months.

 <H2 align=center><A NAME=overview>OVERVIEW</A></H2>
<B><I>"The Federal Government must be customer driven."</I></B> -President Clinton
<P>
When Americans reach for their telephone and dial a number, they expect to get an answer. They expect to be treated courteously. They expect accurate information on topics as diverse as flight arrival times or their current bank balance. Essentially, they expect to be able to conduct their business -- from ordering tomato plants or a medium-sized plaid shirt to changing their insurance coverage. In short, they expect excellent customer service. 
<P>
The private sector has set high standards for what Americans expect and get from telephone services. Too often, in the past, when American citizens called their government, they didn't get the service they deserved. Just last year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service put Ann Landers on hold -- it took her 45 minutes "to reach a live, warm body." Just as serious, when people do get through, often, they can't conclude their business or get the information they need. No wonder one frustrated American wrote, "It is appalling that taxpayers are expected to foot the bill for such poor services." 
<P>
We agree and we are working to change it. Changes underway in many agencies have been given a huge impetus by the National Performance Review led by Vice President Al Gore. In September 1993, the National Performance Review issued its report with nearly 400 recommendations on ways to make the government work better and cost less and with a call to all government agencies to put their customers first, to empower their front-line employees, to cut red tape and get back to basics. <P>
Within days, President Clinton issued an Executive Order that called for a customer service "revolution within the Federal government to change the way it does business." He called on government agencies to survey their customers, find out what they want, set customer service standards and compare their services against the "best in business."<A HREF="#endnotes">1</A>
<P>
Many things have happened since that Executive Order was issued. Government managers and workers are listening to their customers, and are conducting surveys and focus groups to find out what really matters to them. Government agencies have set standards for customer service. The first comprehensive set of customer service standards for government was issued in September 1994, entitled Putting Customers First: Standards for Serving the American People.
<P>
 Government agencies are also learning from business. For example, the U.S. Mint, which not only produces the nation's supply of coins but also sells them to collectors, has looked to companies like Lenox China and Black & Decker for lessons it can apply to its operations. 
<P>
We looked to business in this study of the best in telephone service. It was a cooperative undertaking by ten government agencies and eight private companies to identify practices that can be applied in government to raise the level of service to equal the best in business.
<P>
<H3>WHY TELEPHONE SERVICE?</H3>
Why telephone service? First, Americans talk to their government in great numbers. On a single day in January, Americans placed 1.7 million calls to the Social Security Administration. Last year, the Internal Revenue Service received 68.7 million calls and the Immigration and Naturalization Service received some 12 million calls for services and information. Veterans call to find out about health and other benefits. Travellers call to find out about passports. Flood and earthquake victims call to find out how to get help.
<P>
Second, telephone service is a cost-effec-tive way to deliver services to people. One estimate is that it costs more than three times as much to respond to an inquiry by letter than it does to respond to the same question over the telephone. As agencies face severe budget constraints, cost is becoming an even greater factor and many agencies may conclude, just as many businesses have, that telephone service is the most cost effective way of interacting with their customers. 
<P>
Third, there is a lot of room for improvement. Many Americans, like Ann Landers, have a favorite horror story. Unfortunately, statistics bear too many of them out. Twenty-five percent of all callers to government agencies may give up without getting a response; fewer than two percent of callers abandon calls in the best companies. Slow responses and busy signals are too often the rule in the public sector, whereas world class organizations answer in less than 15-20 seconds and rarely allow busy signals. Private businesses operate telephone services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; government generally answers its phone only during regular business hours. The private sector also gives its employees extensive training and updates on-line information frequently so that they can give customers accurate information; government employees often have to thumb through thousands of pages of manuals to find the answer to a caller's question and updates can take weeks or months. Also, private companies give their employees authority to solve problems for customers. Federal employees too often remain bound up in red tape. 
<P>
There are also a lot of positive reasons why this telephone service is a good target for improvement. Leadership is committed. Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater and IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson and other government leaders want to make improvements happen. Agencies across government have established customer service standards for telephone service that include promptness, courtesy and accuracy. And federal employees are working hard to meet these standards and provide excellent service to the American people. 
<P>
There is also a lot going on that we can build on. For example, the Internal Revenue Service has a long term plan to modernize its systems so that it can provide better service and perform its mission more effectively. The Social Security Administration has developed menus so that it can provide selected services 24 hours a day. It has conducted pilot tests of intelligent work stations-- modern, user friendly consoles--that truly support its employees. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is replacing outdated equipment and replacing its 58 message menu with a more user-friendly 10 message system. 
<P>
Finally, business has been willing to help. Some of the companies with the best telephone service in the country, Malcolm  Baldrige National Quality Award 
<A HREF="#endnotes">2</A> winners like AT&T Universal Card Services and the Xerox Corporation, benchmarking leaders like the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse, and cost--management leaders like Citibank, have been willing to open their doors to share what they are doing to provide excellent telephone service and to show federal employees what it takes to be "the best in business." We are grateful to them.
<P>
<H3>WHAT DID WE FIND?</H3>
Federal employees from ten agencies reviewed a wide range of studies to identify world class customer telephone service operations. We identified benchmarking partners and developed a list of questions to guide our data collection. We talked to businesses over the telephone and conducted actual site visits. We talked to front-line employees, managers, union officials and others. We found an amazing degree of similarity among industry's best. All of the bench-marking partners shared a number of common traits:
<UL>
<LI> All have strong corporate cultures which are totally focused on doing more than satisfying customers-on delighting them. 
<LI> The culture is based on guiding principles or values which have become ingrained throughout the organization. Senior managers, front-line and support employees live the values every day. 
<LI> All work towards achieving employee satisfaction because it results in higher quality performance. 
<LI> All commit the resources necessary to meet the customer service standards. This involves heavy investing in hiring and training the right employees, providing expert systems, and empowering employees.
<LI> In all, there is open communication between senior managers and employees. 
<LI> All continuously survey customers and employees in order to understand how to improve services. 
<LI> In all, employees are empowered to handle calls to completion at the first contact. 
<LI> In all, employees are involved in all aspects of the calling center operation and planning process through cross- functional teams.
</UL>
This report summarizes best practices that we identified in industry that may be applicable to government. It is organized around major themes--leadership, information management, planning, human resources, management of processes, results, and customer focus and satisfaction. These categories are also the seven categories used by the Baldrige Award. Threaded through each section is a consistent focus on the customers and an integration of the customers' needs into the organizations' management, technology and human resource systems.

<H3>WHAT'S NEXT?</H3>
Benchmarking isn't just finding out about what the best looks like. It means using that information to take the measure of one's own performance, identifying gaps in performance, and taking action to close the gaps. 
<P>
That's where we are now. The agencies that led this study are now taking those next critical steps, laying the plans that will close the gap in performance. In fact, SSA has developed a comprehensive plan to address every aspect of this report. Meanwhile, the IRS has already taken steps to raise the level of their teleservice operating information kiosks designed to offer more choices on how and where to get information. 
<P>
Other federal agencies are encouraged to use this study to help them identify where they have performance gaps and to take steps to close them. We encourage federal managers to compare these best practices against their own internal operations, identify areas where improvements can be made and develop action plans to adapt relevant practices to the operating environment of their particular agency. The ultimate objective is to give the American public the service they deserve. 
<P>
Federal employees are also encouraged to share their own best practices. A side benefit of this study has been the creation of a net-work of federal employees who are working together to promote benchmarking in the federal government. The network, called BenchNet, is developing a data base of "promising practices" in the federal government in areas as diverse as financial management, procurement, downsizing and strategic planning.<A HREF="#endnotes">3</A> This study, as well as future benchmarking studies, will also be available on BenchNet.
<P>
<H3>STARTING OUT?</H3>
We are just starting out; we know that we have a long way to go. We also know that we have a solid foundation in a work-force that is committed to providing excel-lent service to the American people. This study represents part of our efforts to change the systems so that we can provide that service. Ultimately, we are determined to equal or exceed the best in business. The American people don't deserve any less.<P>

"Putting Customers First: Standards for Serving the American People" Report of the National Performance Review, September 1994 
<HR>
<A NAME=section1><H2 align=center>SECTION 1:<BR>
LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES<BR>
 FOR SUCCESS</H2></A>
<H3>COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE:</H3>
Top leadership "walks the talk" by actively listening and responding to the voice of the internal customers--the front-line workers, and the external customers--the American public. Effective leaders maintain multiple "listening posts" and share satisfaction trend data based on customer feedback for both customer groups with all workers on a monthly basis
<P>
<I>Customer-Driven Mission and Vision: </I>Customer requirements are clearly defined and reinforced by the organization's stated mission, vision and values. These are understood and practiced at all levels of the organization, and used to drive continuous cross-functional process improvements. New initiatives spring from the voice of the internal and external customers, not from the "ivory tower."
<P>
<I>Planning Drives Alignment: </I>A prevention based approach, such as Shewhart's Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle, minimizes "damage control" incidents. Resources are allocated to support internal and external customer requirements, not to "inspect quality into the process." Plans cascade from the stated mission and vision to teams and individual workers, fostering alignment and integration of plans within the organization. Openly shared feedback and performance measures help workers "stay the course."
<P>
<I>Success-Oriented Forecasting:</I> Front -line resource needs are forecasted well over a year in advance, and are based on an external customer satisfaction success strategy. Benchmarked hiring, training and forecasting "successes" are adapted to the organization, and used in place of historical data which may yield less desirable results. Front-line workers are recruited, screened, hired and trained to provide just-in- time resources to address anticipated vacancies and changing customer needs.
<P>
<I>Labor-Management Teamwork:</I> Front-line workers meaningfully participate in the strategic planning process. Their insights are key to helping the organization focus on its internal and external customers.
<P>
<I>Accessible to Customers:</I> A customer feedback loop is built into every phase of the customer service delivery process. It is convenient and easy for customers to con-tact world-class organizations.
<P>
<I>Support Processes are Key:</I> Business process management tools are used to improve those processes which support the core customer service delivery process. 
<P>
<I> Best Practices are Tracked and Used:</I> World-class organizations extensively and continuously benchmark, and maintain a database of best practices for use by the organization's work force.
<P>
<I>Constantly Communicated Values:</I> The organization's emphasis on maintaining a quality culture is demonstrated constantly through various communication mediums that reach the entire work force. These communication formats include newsletters, visual displays, electronic mail, and meetings.
<P>
<I>Communication--a Two-Way Information Flow: </I>Front-line workers are the major customers of the organization's information gathering process. World-class organizations recognize that front-line workers need timely and easy access to pertinent information if they are to provide world-class customer service. This includes information on such topics as new legislation, anticipated peak calling periods, and proposed information technology enhancements. Surveys of front-line workers are used to gauge management's effectiveness at ensuring the effective flow of information.
<P>
<I>Visible Senior Leadership:</I> Senior managers "shadow" a front-line worker for a day to better understand call operations, job procedures, working conditions and customer expectations. Senior managers also participate in, and frequently lead, new hire orientation training sessions.
<P>
<I>Leaders Invest Time in People:</I> Senior managers recognize that they will be developing tomorrow's leaders from today's front-line workers. Leaders encourage front-line workers to identify career growth opportunities. On a quarterly basis, front-line workers are encouraged to shadow the incumbents for a day in those jobs they might like to work in the future.
<P>
<I>Accessible and Approachable Management: </I>Front-line workers have on-line capability to elevate issues to senior management; they can expect to receive a direct response from management within 24 hours. In world-class organizations, all managers treat their front-line workers just like their customers-with courtesy, respect and responsiveness.
<P>
<I>Span of Control:</I> World-class organizations are flat, with typically no more than three management layers separating the front-line worker from the chief executive officer. Supervisors serve as team leaders; they report directly to the call center manager who, in turn, reports to a senior executive. Industry standards average 20-24 front-line workers per team leader.
<P>
<I>Supervisor Role:</I><I></I> Team leaders function as dedicated job coaches, not cops. Super-visors have few administrative duties; their main function is to train, coach and support front-line workers.
<P>
<I>Management Role:</I> Managers help customers by helping front-line work teams remove roadblocks to providing world-class service, and by responding promptly and effectively to customer queries, concerns and other feedback. Managers recognize the impacts their decisions can have on work teams and front-line workers, and place heavy emphasis on promoting a shared vision and values.
<P>
<I>Front-line Authority to Act:</I> Front-line workers are empowered to take all necessary actions to serve the customer. They don't need the approval of a supervisor or manager-but those resources are available to help the front-line workers if needed.
<P>
<I>Teamwork and Sharing Environment:</I> Leaders create a climate that fosters trust, teamwork and shared communication, and which permits learning and risk-taking.
<P>
<I>Cross-Functional Decision Making:</I> Managers in world-class organizations recognize that decisions in one area may affect other areas of the organization. For example, mandating all parts of the organization to take Mondays or Fridays off as part of a new 4-day work schedule may make sense in the support areas but would seriously degrade the effectiveness of the core business process, telephone services, if applied to the front-line workers.
<P>
<I>Organized for Customer Service:</I> The organization's focus is on the customer, not internal operations. Customers are the organization's reason for existence. By the same token, front-line workers are the primary link to these customers.  
<P>
<I>Commitment to Customer Service:</I> Customer requirements are clearly defined, understood at all levels of the organization, and used to drive continuous cross-func-tional process improvements. Progress towards achieving customer delight is monitored daily and published monthly across the entire organization. The organization's guiding principles are centered on customer satisfaction and are used by managers and front-line workers in day-to-day decision making. 
<HR>
<H2 align=center><A NAME=section2>SECTION 2:</A><BR>
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS</H2>
<H3>FRONT-LINE WORKER DESKTOP INFORMATION:</H3>
World-class desktop tools for call center representatives, such as state-of-the-art telephone, computer terminal and associated software applications and data network access, are consistently recognized as a top business imperative for achieving front-line worker and customer satisfaction, reducing costs, and reinforcing management's commitment to maintaining a quality culture.
<P>
<I>On-Line Procedures and Information:</I> Call centers use on-line computer information systems to enable front-line workers to answer customer inquiries quickly and effectively. Desktop information services include databases to retrieve information and on-line procedures manuals. On-line procedures manuals are often built into the database applications using a "help screen" format or a sequence of prompts which walks the front-line worker through each step in the call answering process. On-line procedures significantly reduce the number of pages or procedures necessary, and increase accessibility, speed of access, and ease of use of information. <P>
<I>Fully-Dedicated Support Teams:</I> Information provided by the desktop tools is updated frequently, often daily, to make continuous improvements. More importantly, front-line workers can provide input and propose changes electronically, via the same systems. Simple changes are reviewed and implemented within 24 hours by 1-2 dedicated information support team resources. More complex changes are prioritized against other requests by the information support team based on their impacts to customer service.
<P>
<I>Applying Current Technology:</I> Graphical user interfaces are used to reduce front-line worker training requirements, application time, and keystrokes as compared to non-graphical interfaces. They also help to improve information access time and accuracy, thereby enhancing customer service.
<P>
<I>User-Friendly Desktop Systems: </I>Desktop information, such as work procedures and customer databases, is normally provided by software applications developed in-house and supplemented by commercial software, such as Windows and electronic mail. Front-line workers are principal participants on project development teams and are the immediate customers of the applications development process. By avoiding coded information (e.g., enter 23 to change marital status or 46 to add someone to this account), and by incorporating plain text, menu choices, and icons in application designs, front-line workers benefit from being able to concen-trate on learning business functions, instead of a "user hostile" information sys-tem. This results in significant gains in front-line worker and customer satisfaction levels.
<P>
<I>Real-Time Information Exchange and Retrieval: </I>Send and receive fax servers allow front-line workers to transact with the customer in real time. Imaging systems allow front-line workers to access information quickly, even though it may be in a document that was received in paper form, such as an incoming letter from a customer or an archived transaction history. Electronic newsletters, bulletins, job announcements, and mail help to improve communications and front-line worker satisfaction.
<P>
<I>Management Information:</I> Managers or team leaders monitor calls and statistics on calls. These statistics include numbers of calls, call lengths, after call work time, and other measures for their group or individual front-line workers. They are also able to review system-wide statistics. These are used to help improve customer service and internal forecasting, not to criticize the front-line workers.
<P>
<I>Forecasting for Success:</I> Capacity planning and forecasting are based on many years worth of historical organizational and all-industry call center data. These data cover periods of excellent service, not poor service (high abandonment or busy out levels). Forecasts, down to fifteen-minute increments per day for individual front-line workers, are set at least 18 months in the future, and are used for call center circuitry and equipment capacity planning. These forecasts are reviewed daily and adjusted as needed. Forecasting accuracy is tracked weekly and monthly. Due to the use of the "excellent service" forecasting model and the accuracy of off-the-shelf forecasting and resourcing software, actual call volumes typically do not vary more than one-half of one percent from weekly and monthly forecasts.
<P>
<I>Full-Spectrum Capacity Management: </I>Information from a broad spectrum of sources, such as new product development, service problem resolution and prevention efforts, customer market segmentation (who calls and how often), press releases or media campaign plans, and historical statistics on the types of calls answered are key to effective capacity planning. Information from all of these sources is provided in a user-friendly format to front-line workers and call center managers so that they can anticipate and meet changing customer service needs.
<P>
<I>Total Call Center Management:</I> Effective call center operations conduct integrated resource planning and call center management across all sites, essentially treating several call centers as one large organization. Call loads are balanced across these sites to ensure customer access goals are achieved. Automated tools and analysis techniques are used. Alarms alert control center staff to call volume problems which are outside the norm for the time period. Increased flexibility, redundancy, and call handling capability are the main benefits of this approach as compared to planning on an individual site basis. To further improve efficiency and increase the consistency of the customer service being provided, a substantial site consolidation effort has become the norm for high-performance call center operations. In fact, one organization effectively consolidated over 90 small call centers to one large center with 24-hour customer access.
<P>
<I>Proactive Solutions to Peak Calling Periods: </I>A variety of methods are used to plan for and deal with peak call volumes.   They include call avoidance techniques, voice response unit messages designed to address peak period questions, front-line worker augmentation contingency plans, voluntary or mandatory work schedules or overtime, the postponement of training or leave during forecasted or actual peak periods, and the acquisition of sufficient additional circuit and equipment capacity.
<P>
<I>Key Call Avoidance Concepts: </I>Call avoidance strategies, such as finding out which customers call most frequently and why, play a major role in capacity planning and the handling of peak loads. For example, a large number of callers from one customer group might frequently complain about a particular service. Rather than add more staff, equipment and circuits to handle the large number of callers, the most cost-effective solution might be to eliminate the cause of the complaints, and therefore the calls. Another call avoidance strategy involves the use of such alternate media as on-demand fax or information systems which allow customers to electronically retrieve certain documents and information quickly, 24 hours a day, and without talking to a front-line worker.
<P>
<I>Building Added Capacity into Front-Line Work Stations:</I> Average handling time, abandoned or busy-out calls and queue time can be greatly reduced, and the number of callers success-fully satisfied greatly increased, by providing front-line workers with the work station tools and related training to make a complex and lengthy task a quick and easy one. For example, effective work station configurations identify the probable incoming caller and purpose for calling by automatically linking the caller's phone number and account history, and instantly placing this information on the front-line worker's computer screen. In most instances, this allows the front-line worker to anticipate the purpose of the call and get mentally prepared. This results in significantly improved efficiency and customer service.
<P>
<I>Coaching-Based Quality Assurance:</I> Silent call monitoring techniques are used to assess quality. However, quality assurance "cops" have been replaced by team leader "coaches" who sit with their team members and monitor calls to recognize "success stories" and determine service quality improvement opportunities. This approach has yielded significantly higher productivity and customer service levels at a substantially reduced operating cost. Since feedback is immediate and constructive in nature, front-line morale and skill levels have also greatly improved. Internal and external customer focus groups and short telephone or mail-out customer surveys also provide feedback on the quality levels of the organization and its services. To ensure usefulness of the information acquired, all surveys are administered or mailed out on the same day the call is handled. Survey timeliness has been found to strongly correlate to the quantity and quality of responses received, and the affected front-line worker's recollection of the instances related to the customer responses.
<P>
<I>Customer-Driven Performance Measures: </I>Measures of information and support systems effectiveness are derived from front-line worker and customer satisfaction data and direct feedback. For example, the 15-second Average Speed of Answering (ASA) performance standard typically seen at world-class organizations is based on in-depth studies and analyses of customer behavior and satisfaction data. Customer queue time approaching one minute is universally associated with unac-ceptable levels of customer service, and is strongly correlated to lost business, lost opportunities and high levels of customer dissatisfaction. Customer satisfaction data help determine the key customer service measures which, in turn, drive the information management standards. The  key information management standards are: accurate and timely access to information for front-line workers and their customers; information system reliability (typically over 99.9 percent); timeliness of database update (typically less than 24 hours); and ease of use of front-line work stations.
<P>
<I>Customer Access is Paramount:</I> Access to the call center and its services is the organization's top priority and is reflected in such key call center measures as 24 hour availability, a 15-second maximum queue time, and a 2 percent maximum abandoned call rate. The typical busy-out performance standard is "zero instances." Effective capacity planning, forecasting and resource allocation are pivotal to meeting customer access requirements.
<P>
<I>Informative Queuing: </I>Callers waiting in the queue are provided with information as to the expected length of delay, allowing them to choose whether to stay in queue or hang up. Typically, these estimates are overstated so that impatient callers are not subjected to the further aggravation of being on hold beyond the estimated queue time. Those callers that do elect to wait in the queue typically abandon the call if they remain on hold longer than 30 seconds.
<P>
<I>Front-Line "Internal Customer" Access:</I> Intelligent work stations and a client-server environment are fast becoming the basic operating platform for call centers everywhere. Some of the advantages they offer to the front-line workers are: more timely and accessible information; better efficiency and functionality (especially useful in a downsizing environment); higher productivity, due to "friendlier" user inter-faces; more sophisticated tools, such as image management and expert systems; and greater flexibility, due to empowerment of front-line workers.
<P>
<I>One-Stop Transactions:</I> The speed of transfer to back gates (i.e., to a worker in another part of the calling center) is not measured since virtually all calls are answered by the front-line worker as opposed to a specialty gate. When transfers are made, they are typically introduced by the front-line worker initially receiving the call. This enables the specialty gate worker to help the customer without asking the customer to restate his or her question, concern or comment.
<P>
<I>Call Center Information Technology:</I> Voice and data communications are well integrated, and include the common use of standardized wiring schematics. Voice systems include automatic call distributors and voice response units. Up-to-date, complete databases and on-line work procedures and operating manuals help ensure accurate and timely responses to customer queries. Rapid information updates--typically daily--allow front-line workers to be more responsive to customer needs. For some applications, image processing may speed information access and reduce costly paper storage.
<P>
<I>Automatic Call Distribution:</I> Leading edge service does not necessarily require fancy, high-priced technology. Most equipment involved is typically of an off-the-shelf origin. For example, automatic call distributors (ACDs) are generally not customized, except for occasional management reports (which might be customized by the ACD vendor, a third party, or an in-house cadre). Basic features for effective call centers include informative queuing and the use of high-quality head-sets by front-line workers to improve their freedom of motion and reduce fatigue. Voice response units provide customized services to customers by routing them to a front-line worker with the appropriate specialized skills.
<P>
<I>Key Workstation Design Attributes:</I> Successful desktop information systems are updated daily; do not use coded information; offer sub-second information access times, easy to use interfaces, and built-in procedural information and templates for gathering data in applications; and minimize the number of keystroke entries required from front-line workers. As many as 18 simultaneous applications may be running on one such fielded system.
<P>
<I>Networking: </I>Networking is prevalent both within and across call centers. Local area networks are used to share data with intelligent workstations on each front-line worker's station. The ACD provides voice systems connectivity throughout the site. Networking among ACDs provides load balancing and redundancy for disaster recovery. The number of operating locations needed to handle even the largest call volumes (over 100 million per year) is typically one to three call centers, with a maximum of 600 front-line workers per center. This is widely viewed as the optimum number of operating locations due to overhead and administrative cost, consistency of service, and other business and customer management considerations.

PLANNING</H2>
<H3>DYNAMIC PLANNING PROCESS:</H3>
A continuous cycle of planning and program development drives the integration of key elements of the human resource, information management, customer relationship management, and quality improvement plans and strategies into a comprehensive "master plan."
<P>
<I>Communicating Strategic Plans:</I> Mission and vision statements provide the focus for strategic planning goals and objectives, and help shape the values and the culture of the organization. Vision statements of world-class organizations typically express the goal of providing the best customer service in the business.
<P>
<I>Resource Allocation Strategies:</I> Various off-the-shelf forecasting tools allow call center managers to make highly-effective use of front-line workers to maintain high service quality levels despite cyclical or changing customer demand levels. Continuous evaluations of key performance indicators help to ensure the appropriate alignment of resource allocations with planning objectives. Well-established benchmarking programs help identify improvement opportunities for cross-functional teams.
<P>
<I>Human Resource Planning: </I>Highly-selective hiring practices identify applicants who fit the culture and value system of the organization. New workers are fully trained prior to anticipated need dates-there are typically no human resource shortfalls to contend with. An extensive array of recognition programs helps to encourage high levels of participation in individual and team performance improvement activities. Training is based on detailed needs analyses which are linked to achieving the organization's stated mission and vision, as well as strategic goals and objectives.
<P>
<I>Information Management Strategies:</I> Technology enhancements are continuous-ly explored to improve productivity and the ability of front-line workers to respond to changing customer demands for more services and better service performance. The transition to new systems is accomplished so smoothly that the effort is transparent to customers.
<P>
<I>Extensive Customer Service Plans:</I> Customer feedback programs involve the use of multiple "listening posts," such as inter-views, surveys, focus groups and third party assessments. Customer feedback is continuously analyzed by cross-functional teams to determine key customer satisfiers and dissatisfiers, and the respective "root cause" activities. Customers' increasing service quality expectations have driven the need for world-class organizations to run a 24 hour-a-day operation.

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</H2>
<H3>HIRING:</H3>
The application process for front-line positions is rigorous, taking an average of 6-8 weeks. Applicants are thoroughly screened through written tests, panel and telephone interviews and role-playing scenarios. World class companies may interview as many as 30 or more applicants for every opening. Front-line workers participate in all aspects of the hiring process, including conducting interviews, screening applicants, instructing, coaching and mentoring new front-line workers. Salaries for front-line workers in industry are comparable with those for government. A high school diploma or college degree, plus some customer service work experience, are the minimum requirements for front-line workers at most world-class organizations.
<P>
<I>Job Standards Tied to Customer Satisfiers:</I> Job standards for front-line workers and managers alike reflect a commitment to delighting the customer. Job standards are tied to key customer satisfiers and clearly communicate the extent to which front-line workers are empowered to serve customers. Mixed messages are avoided (e.g., front-line workers are told to take the time needed to satisfy callers and, hence, are not directly evaluated on the average length of the calls they handle). Performance expectations may be documented through a written contract between the team leader and the front-line worker. The contract identifies yearly goals and outlines a course of action the worker intends to take to meet those goals. This process encourages front-line workers to buy-in to the overarching organizational goals and objectives.
<P>
<I>Single-Digit Attrition Rates:</I> While most front-line workers serve full time, most world-class organizations augment this work force with part-time workers to ensure adequate, cost-efficient coverage during peak customer calling periods. The best in the business have extremely low (3- 7 percent) attrition rates for front-line positions. High job satisfaction levels, not high salaries, account for the low attrition rates. Several companies plan for front-line job rotation to occur between 24-36 months on the job to avoid "burn-out" and to foster job growth. Attrition is factored into the call demand forecasting so that just-in-time recruitment occurs.
<P>
<I>Customer Service Performance Determines Worker Incentives:</I> The job performance of front-line workers is continuously evaluated relative to customer service requirements and related job standards and behavior expectations.  The extent to which front-line workers, call center supervisors and managers adhere to the organization's value system or guiding principles, and make use of customer feedback (e.g., customer survey responses for calls handled) to constantly improve are also continuously assessed. Numerous recognition and reward incentives (over 45 such approaches at one world-class organization) help to recognize and reinforce desirable work behavior and noteworthy job performance. Front-line workers play a leading role in the development of performance appraisal and recognition systems at world-class organizations.
<P>
<I>360-Degree Evaluations: </I>Team leaders meet informally on a daily or weekly basis, and formally on a monthly basis, with front-line workers in one-on-one settings to review their progress in meeting individual and team performance goals. Front-line workers receive written monthly summaries documenting individual performance levels and trends. Front-line workers are evaluated by their peers and super-visor on their ability to work as a team, adhere to the organization's value system or guiding principles, meet clearly defined customer service standards and, most importantly, consistently achieve desirable customer satisfaction results. Both service monitoring results and customer recontact survey information are also used for team evaluation purposes. Evaluation measures are performance-based and weighted according to their impact on achieving the organization's mission and vision. For example, customer service measures are most heavily weighted, followed closely by front-line worker satisfaction measures. Business efficiency measures, while important, are given the lowest weighting. Front-line workers evaluate their team leaders and upper management relative to such leadership characteristics as accessibility, responsiveness, problem solving ability, and respect for others.
<P>
<I>Outcome-Based Pay Incentives: </I>A portion of pay for the front-line, support staff and management team is tied to meeting specific call center performance targets for quality and customer satisfaction. Individual worker and management incentives are payable only when the entire center achieves the performance targets. Progress toward meeting the goals is measured daily and reviewed weekly and monthly. Incentives are paid quarterly.
<P>
<I>Empowerment of Front-Line Workers: </I>Front-line workers choose their job titles to reflects the level at which they are empowered to satisfy customers. For exam-ple, a customer service representative, as the title implies, might possess much broader authority to address customer needs than a telephone agent. Similarly, a customer advocate might be empowered to serve as the "voice of the customer" and, hence, have even greater authority to ensure customer needs are addressed. Management delegates such authority to front-line workers as needed to enable them to take those actions required to satisfy and even delight their customers.
<P>
<I>Participation on Cross-Functional Teams:</I> Supervisors and managers are continuously evaluated on their effectiveness at soliciting and implementing ideas from front-line workers on how to improve customer service and operational efficiency levels. Teams of front-line workers meet regularly with team leaders and senior managers to discuss customer concerns and suggest improvements to call center operations, policies, procedures and support systems. Front-line workers participate on cross-functional teams to design, improve or reengineer all aspects of call center operations. An announcement that a team is being formed is communicated directly to front-line workers' work stations. Any front-line worker may nominate himself or herself for consideration. Through participation on these teams, front-line workers are able to develop and refine their leadership skills and help breakdown organizational boundaries. 
<P>
<I>Empowered High-Performance Teams:</I> Decision-making authority needed to satisfy customers is delegated to the front-line employees, who are organized into teams. Team decisions are made by consensus; at least two-thirds of the team members must be comfortable with a team decision and all must be committed to supporting its implementation. Any team member may block a team decision if he or she can provide a reasonable and timely alternative course of action. Problem-solving and conflict resolution are the responsibilities of the front-line teams, with supervisors and managers serving as coaches and "champions" respectively. Champions remove impediments that prevent the front-line work force from operating as a high-performance team.
<P>
<I>Labor-Management Relationship:</I> In collective bargaining arrangements, union and management counterparts perform separate duties as specified by law, but function as an integrated team to jointly address the organization's mission and vision, guiding principles and values, tactical and strategic planning needs, operating philosophy and key customer service success measures.
<P>
<I>Front-Line Worker Suggestions: </I>Each front-line worker typically interacts with some 25,000 customers per year. An integral part of the continuous improvement process is the free flow of ideas from these key customer-contact personnel. World-class call center operations typically implement over five suggestions per employee per year. Managers at successful call center operations actively solicit front-line workers' advice on how to improve processes at biweekly team meetings, and periodically give the suggestion program added emphasis through recurring suggestion contests and specific promotional campaigns. On-line suggestion systems facilitate the sub-mission of ideas. With on-line systems, suggestion receipt is immediately acknowledged. Suggestors are notified within 24 hours as to who is evaluating their ideas, and receive additional feedback as to the status of their idea on at least a weekly basis. In world-class operations, nearly all suggestions are completely processed within 72 hours.
<P>
<I>A "Best Practice" Suggestion System:</I> The top suggestion process uses a combination of cross-functional teams, team leaders and senior managers to address suggestions, depending on the degree of difficulty and level of empowerment involved. Under this approach, every original idea submitted receives monetary compensation. Suggestors earn one dollar for every original idea submitted, even if it is not implemented, ten dollars for every "quality of life" idea implemented and at least fifty dollars for every idea that improves service to customers. For ideas which reduce operating costs, suggestors receive at least seven percent of the savings realized in the first year, and an additional one percent of the first year's savings is donated to the suggestor's favorite local charity. Additionally, those who actually implement the cost-saving suggestions receive three percent of the first year's savings.
<P>
<I>Front-line Worker Recognition Programs--Seeking Successes:</I> Front-line workers are not only recognized for achieving productivity goals, but for delighting customers as well. The most prestigious awards are given for providing exceptional service to customers. Recognition is as consistently applied as performance verification- it is a daily occurrence. Complimentary feedback from customers is shared with all front-line workers and is publicly posted along with the front-line worker's photo on a "wall of fame." Success stories are also shared electronically, in newsletters, and through various other media. Awards are given for high performance ratings received on customer response cards. Frequent on-the-spot recognition from both management and peers is common in world-class organizations, and successful recognition and reward strategies reinforce desired performance for both individuals and teams. Front-line workers frequently nominate peers and team leaders for awards. Cross-functional teams typically manage recognition and reward programs, as well as the associated budget allocations.
<P>
<I>Newcomer's Orientation:</I> Every organization member, from the new clerk trainee to the head of the organization, receives orientation training in the organization's mission, vision and guiding principles before they start to work at world-class organizations. Senior executives personally conduct or participate in all sessions. This shows top leadership's commitment to promoting the organization's quality culture.
<P>
<I>Education, Training and Development:</I> World class companies embrace a philosophy of continuous training. Training hours are allotted for every front-line worker (ranging from 90-150 hours annually) and are factored into the call demand forecasting and resource scheduling at least one year in advance. Both initial and ongoing training is provided on a just-in-time basis to ensure that the front-line worker receives the most current training possible. Initial training is aligned with key customer satisfiers, such as courteous and respectful behavior, and empowers the worker to satisfy and even delight the customer. Front-line workers are trained to recognize and adapt to different caller personality types. A cadre of front-line workers may also be trained to act as facilitators for cross-functional teams. The curriculum for front-line workers also includes extensive training on how the overall organization functions so that front-line workers better understand the "big picture."
<P>
<I>The Quality University: </I>A common concept among world-class organizations is the structuring of training curricula around a university framework. Service observations are used to help determine individual training needs on an ongoing basis. Training effectiveness is verified through self-assessments, service observations, one-on-one coaching and team interactions. Personal development is actively encouraged. Organizations pay college tuition fees and monetarily reward those who earn professional degrees.
<P>
<I>World-Class Training Delivery:</I> World-class organizations deliver superior training by using instructors who have intimate knowledge of the customers and the key service delivery processes. A dedicated training group is an integral part of successful call center operations. Technical training programs are developed and delivered by experienced subject-matter experts (including front-line workers) to ensure the skill and knowledge transfer involves information that is current and relevant, and has a high-impact on the organization's overall effectiveness.
<P>
<I>Worker Well-Being and Satisfaction:</I> Front-line worker satisfaction is as high a priority within the organization as customer satisfaction. The front-line workers' environment in successful call centers is conducive to providing world-class service. Ergonomically-designed furniture, adequate work space, state-of-the-art work stations and tools and an atmosphere for teaming and personal excellence are all common to world-class call centers.
<P>
<I>Guiding "People" Principles:</I> Successful organizations treat front-line workers with dignity and respect, and involve them in planning all aspects of call center operations, especially those impacting customer service and front-line worker effectiveness. Management concern for front-line worker morale and well-being is illustrated by positive actions, such as by making fitness and child care centers, as well as personal development and stress reduction programs available to all workers. These are typically provided on-site, along with high-quality dining facilities that are used by everyone from the top leadership to the new trainees. There are no executive dining rooms at world-class operations. 
<P>
<I>Front-Line Worker Satisfaction Surveys:</I> Front-line worker satisfaction is measured as routinely as customer satisfaction. Comprehensive annual survey results are compared to specifically-targeted weekly and monthly surveys to ensure continuous improvement. In addition to information gathered through team leader meetings, brown-bag luncheons with senior managers and numerous other forums, a dedicated group surveys front-line workers by telephone on a continuous basis. Detailed satisfaction results are communicated monthly to all workers electronically and through newsletters. Action teams are immediately formed to propose solutions to any problems which have been identified through the surveys. Progress toward problem resolution is also closely tracked and similarly communicated to all front-line workers on at least a monthly basis. 
<HR>
<H2 align=center><A NAME=section5> Section 5:</A><BR>
PROCESS MANAGEMENT</H2>
<H3>FORECASTING AND SCHEDULING:</H3>
Call demand is forecast 12-18 months in the future and adjusted quarterly, monthly, and weekly. Resource scheduling involves the determination of all front-line worker leave schedules, work shifts, and new hiring requirements, and is accomplished in accordance with the projected demand for service. Tours of duty are determined by the scheduling system. Multiple sites are scheduled as a single unit. Training is scheduled around the forecasted demand. Established 8-hour or 10-hour work schedules, staggered by 15- minute start time intervals, are assigned by seniority. Bidding for new schedules occurs at regular intervals, at least twice a year. There are no flextime schedules. At one site, front-line workers have developed 29 separate shift schedules--all have been easily accommodated by off-the-shelf scheduling software.
<P>
<I>Incoming Call Flow:</I> All sites in the 800 number network have uniform service delivery. All callers are offered a choice of automated or live customer service. Companies screen incoming calls by prompting callers to choose from a limited number of options, and calls are directed accordingly. Voice recognition is used to ensure that callers with rotary telephones receive a level of service equal to that of touchtone callers. Voice response units (VRU) provide a limited menu of value-added services. Trunking and resources are sized to allow a limited queue of 15-20 seconds and virtually no busy signals. Live customer service is available 24-hours a day.
<P>
<I>Call Transfers:</I> Internal call transfers from one front-line worker to another are rarely made because front-line workers answering the calls are empowered to take the actions needed to satisfy the customers' issues, and because incoming calls are automatically gated to appropriately skilled front-line workers by linking the forecasting/ scheduling and caller history databases. When it is necessary to hand a call off to another front-line worker, it is done by direct (seamless) transfer. The transferring agent introduces the caller and shares all known information so that the customer does not have to repeat information. Customer information is transferred along with the call. If a caller needs to be directed to another number outside the 800 number network, the call is transferred using a post answer call redirection feature. Transferred callers are never gated to a second queue. 
<P>
<I>Contingency Operations:</I> On very rare occasions when immediate demand exceeds available resources, and the queue exceeds 180 seconds, the automatic call distributor (ACD) manages the length of queue and generates busy signals. Research indicates that customers prefer a busy signal over an inordinately lengthy queue. Worker consoles display the number of calls in queue and the length of queue. Use of the ACD to generate busy signals is an emergency measure taken in response to a forecasting failure; it is not a routine action.
<P>
<I>Customer Language Options: </I>Customers are offered language options upon initial contact with the VRU. Callers requiring service in a local dialect or language, such as Spanish in New Mexico or French in Quebec, are automatically gated to bilingual front-line workers by linking the forecasting/scheduling and caller history databases. Calls reaching front-line workers that require transfer to a bilingual agent are made by the receiving front-line worker to a separate gate in the ACD. The caller's preferred language is coded into the caller history database to aid in providing customer service in his or her preferred language in the future. Contract interpretation services are available if the front-line worker needs help communicating with a caller. Some world-class call centers establish a separate 800 number for non-English speaking callers. This number is typically not advertised to the general public, and is only given out by front-line workers to the appropriate customers. Calls from these special 800 numbers are coded into the long distance network to ensure they are delivered to ACD gates within the call center where bilingual workers answer calls.
<P>
<I>Fully-Dedicated Call Servicing Resources:</I> Handling incoming calls is the primary and, in many cases, the only function of front-line workers. Other work, such as outbound survey calling, may be performed during occasional idle-time periods. The work station operating system automatically switches back and forth, from inbound to outbound calling, to adjust to varying inbound calling demands.
<P>
<I>Empowered to Resolve Customer Issues: </I>Front-line workers are empowered to resolve virtually all calls. Front-line workers "own the call" and first-call resolution rates are 85 percent or greater, with customer requested hand-offs accounting for nearly all of the remainder. Front-line workers are expected to take whatever time is necessary to resolve a caller's issues. Individual call handling time is not used for assessment of performance. Monetary write-off authority is high for front-line workers-at one large company it was equal to that of the vice presidents.
<P>
<I>Empowerment Support System:</I> Security/disclosure procedures and safe-guards do not interfere with the front-line worker's ability to resolve calls at the initial point of contact. A multiple-screen viewing capability allows front-line workers to quickly satisfy various caller needs during a single call (i.e., one-stop service). Incoming calls are automatically identified in the network and linked to the customer data base so that pertinent information is available for the front-line worker to effectively serve the caller (i.e., data propagation).
<P>
<I>Service Observations of Customer Calls:</I> Team leader "coaches" typically monitor 5- 10 calls for each front-line worker each month. A primary purpose of the observation is to identify individual training needs as part of an organization-wide continuous improvement effort. Since the emphasis is on constructive suggestions for improving customer service, observations are not necessarily tied to the performance assessment process. Frequent, regular reports based on information gathered from service observation of telephone calls (i.e., "Quality Tips") are distributed to all front-line workers. Front-line workers receive immediate feedback on ways to improve their call-handling skills, and immediate recognition if superior service has been provided to a caller. Both silent/remote and side-by-side monitoring are used.
<P>
<I>Other Call Monitoring:</I> Senior managers regularly listen in on live calls in order to stay in touch with the customer and pulse the effectiveness of their call center operations. Team leaders participate in group monitoring sessions to ensure consistency of measurement. World-class organizations have moved away from using a separate, formal quality monitoring group for service observations. The call monitoring function is performed by the team leaders; separate monitoring groups have been dissolved.
<P>
<I>Performance Assessment:</I> Call evaluations focus on how effectively front-line workers resolve customer issues, and on how well front-line workers demonstrate professionalism, courtesy and respect for the customer during the call. The severity of any noted deficiency is judged based on its impact on the customer. Customer responses to post-call mail and telephone surveys are compared with service observations, shared with the front-line worker who handled the call, and ultimately become part of the front-line worker's performance assessment. Customer service, rather than rigid adherence to policies or procedures, is the most important measure of success.
<P>
<I>Operating Procedures and Other Guidance:</I> Procedures and guidelines serve as reference materials to help empowered front-line workers effectively resolve customer issues at the initial point of con-tact. They are not a substitute for the extensive training and experience that allows front-line workers to exercise sound judgment in making decisions and taking actions in the course of providing customer service. Workers are encouraged to err on the side of the customer in unusual situations. Satisfying and even delighting customers is considered more important than rigidly adhering to scripted procedures. Front-line worker recommendations for needed updates to procedures are continuously solicited. All methods, procedures and other reference materials is on-line and readily available at each work station. Methods and procedures are updated daily to satisfy front-line worker needs. All information is electronically stored, retrieved and communicated. World-class organizations operate in a paperless work setting.
<P>
<I>Contingency Resources:</I> Resource needs are determined with service-oriented fore-casting for anticipated call demand. New front-line workers are hired and fully trained in sufficient numbers and far enough in advance to meet changing call center and customer service demands. Telephone traffic is adjusted between multiple call answering centers to balance demand with available resources. A central control function is responsible for making any needed adjustments to call routings. Workers in other components of the organization are trained to serve as front-line augmentees during unanticipated peak calling periods, such as after a surprise news announcement, but are never used on a routine basis. To the extent possible, public information releases are timed to avoid receiving an influx of calls at known peak periods. One to three large call centers is the normal configuration for world-class organizations. The maximum number of front-line workers at a single call center is typically about 600.

BUSINESS RESULTS</H2>
<H3>KEY MEASURES:</H3>
Key measures include predictive quantitative and qualitative measures. Both are used to predict customer satisfaction rates. However, actual customer satisfaction rates, as indicated by the customer are, the central focus. Productivity and efficiency measures are focused on effective use of staff, technology, and other assets, along with employee satisfaction (considered a primary predictor of productivity and efficiency). Measures are continuously compared to industry data, including industry average, best competitor, and appropriate benchmarks.
<P>
<I>Customer Demographics: </I>Demographic data is gathered and assessed to determine service levels for all major customer groups. Information on trends is provided to managers and employees so they will be able to service the various customer groups more effectively. Customer service is not considered a "one size fits all" business. Services are tailored to meet varying customer requirements.
<P>
<I>Dynamic Performance Measures:</I> As performance goals are achieved, increasingly higher goals are identified. At one world-class organization, the "ten most wanted" process improvements are identified, along with quantitative performance increases. Cross-functional teams work to improve performance. Once improvements yield a stable, high-performance process, it is "retired" from the list. Front-line workers are provided key performance measures on a daily or weekly basis in order to gauge their own progress in continuous improvement.
<P>
<I>Predictive Quantitative Measures:</I> Key quantitative measures used to predict customer satisfaction levels are shown below, along with the high norm group performance levels.
<UL>
<LI> Average speed of answer: less than 15 seconds 
<LI> Abandoned call rate: less than 2 percent 
<LI> Busy rate: less than 1 percent 
<LI> Service level (total calls less busy signals and abandoned calls): 98 percent 
<LI>First call resolution (one agent/no transfers): 85 percent resolution
</UL>
<I>Predictive Qualitative Measures:</I> Predictive qualitative measures are focused on services provided by front-line employees. Measures include courtesy, initiative, accuracy and completeness. The primary technique used to gauge qualitative predictors is call monitoring. 
<P>
<I>Customer Satisfaction Rates:</I> Techniques for assessing satisfaction include:
<UL>
<LI>Random survey (while customer is on the line) 
<LI> Call-back survey 
<LI> Call-forward survey (customer transferred/asked to stay on the line) 
<LI>Mailing
</UL>
Customer satisfaction rates derived from call monitoring is analyzed for trends. More information on customer surveys is found in section 7.
<P>
<I>Productivity and Efficiency Measures:</I> Effective use of assets is measured by:
<UL>
<LI> Occupancy rate (number of employees answering calls) 
<LI> Agent availability (time answering customer calls) 
<LI> Cost per call 
<LI> Personal and average call center answer rates
<LI> Information systems availability (99.999 percent ranked in at high norm)
</UL>
Measures such as "after call work time" or "keystroke time" are not primary measures. Rather, they may be enablers to agent availability or other measures. For example, reducing the number of front line agent keystrokes needed to close a call may increase the availability of the agents. Similarly, information systems management measures support more direct measures of business results. For example, timely update of information systems sup-ports the worker's ability to provide accurate answers to customer inquiries. Section 2 provides more details on information systems management.
<P>
<I>Employee Satisfaction:</I> Surveys and focus groups are two methods used to measure employee satisfaction. 360 degree evaluations or peer evaluations of performance are used to rank satisfaction with management performance. Some of the key indicators are:
<UL>
<LI> Job satisfaction 
<LI>Empowerment 
<LI> Career development opportunities
<LI> Fairness 
<LI> Recognition 
<LI> Teamwork

<H2 align=center><A NAME=section7>Section 7:</A><BR>
CUSTOMER FOCUS AND SATISFACTION</H2> 
<H3> IDENTIFICATION OF CUSTOMER BASE:</H3>
A dedicated quality assurance team is part of the call center team. This group is responsible for collecting "voice of the customer" data and, in partnership with the call center operations group, translating the data into timely information that is used to improve internal processes. Customers are identified by customer group, product or service line, region, and demographics. This information facilitates effective decision-making by empowered front-line workers to address various customer service needs.
<P>
<I>Extensive Surveying Activity:</I> Customers are surveyed constantly to determine satisfaction levels for existing services and gather requests for new services. Surveys are used to measure system accessibility, front-line professionalism, and overall customer satisfaction with the way their calls are handled. Customer focus groups are also used to determine the needs of specific customer groups and how well those needs are being met. Mail and telephone customer surveys are conducted to assess the level of customer satisfaction with specific transactions. Telephone surveys are typically made within 48 hours of the completed customer contact. Mail surveys are automatically sent to customers within 24 hours for those calls which have been monitored. The results from these surveys are shared with call center support personnel and front-line workers.
<P>
<I>Management of Customer Delight:</I> The customer service goal for world-class organizations is to not only satisfy customers, but to delight them. The management team is responsible for collecting and analyzing "voice of the customer" data, and taking action on this data to demonstrate their commitment to delighting customers. To this end, both caller satisfaction and dissatisfaction are measured. Critical analyses are made of positive customer feedback against tough performance standards. Complaints are tracked and general findings are shared with all front-line workers via on-line systems. Management actively seeks front-line worker participation in finding ways to better satisfy customers and improve operations.
<P>
<I>Management of Customer Dissatisfaction:</I> A dedicated customer relations team receives and handles complex customer issues and complaints, policy-related issues, and unusual customer requests or special needs that cannot be readily resolved by front-line workers. This is typically a higher-graded, centralized group of problem-resolution specialists. Customers can either access this team directly, or go through an internal transfer. Information on caller complaints is entered into the database system and used to help identify root causes of problems. The customer dissatisfaction recovery process includes surveying customers for satisfaction with complaint resolution efforts. 
<P>

<LI> It is my job to satisfy or even delight the caller.
<LI> I support a team of 20 to 24 customer representatives.
<LI> My main responsibility is monitoring the representatives' calls to reinforce positive behavior and determine where each individual needs more training or coaching.
<LI> I monitor calls to learn if the representative took all the needed actions, controlled the customer focus, avoided slang and jargon, employed active listening and demonstrated patience. I listen to know if the customer was satisfied. I look to success and reward outstanding customer service.
<LI> I am a coach, not a cop. I was selected for this job because I have good interpersonal skills. I have been trained in leadership skills.
<LI> The job standards for the representatives and the team leaders are tied to key customer satisfiers. There are no mixed messages. For example, we tell the representatives to take all the time they need to fully serve the customer, so we don't measure individual call handle time.
<LI> I meet with my team regularly to discuss customer and employee concerns. We celebrate each other's successes and special occasions, such as birthdays.

<P>
<H3> I AM A SENIOR MANAGER:</H3>
<LI> It is my job to satisfy or even delight the caller. It is also my job to satisfy or even delight the front-line employees.
<LI> We are in business to delight our customers. We don't have a second chance to make a first impression. We treat every call as our only call.
<LI> We listen to our customers. We use focus groups, caller surveys, comment cards and telephone recontact programs to solicit their opinions on our service. We act on their replies.
<LI> Our representatives know the customers better than anyone else in the company, so we ask them how to improve our service. We involve the front-line employ-ees in all aspects of planning and providing customer service.
<LI> It is my responsibility to remove the barriers and roadblocks to providing world class customer service.
<LI> I frequently take the time to listen in on calls and sit with representatives to stay in touch with both the customers and the employees.
<LI> We recognize outstanding customer service with our most prestigious award. We ask the award recipients to act as an advisory council for senior management.
<LI> We treat our employees the way we want them to treat the customers. We have goals for employee satisfaction and we work hard to reach the goals.
<LI> We survey all employees at least once a year, and sample continuously for employee satisfaction. We share the call center results with all employees and take action to correct problems. We also share information down to the unit level.
<LI> We are choosy about who we hire to answer customer calls. We invest much time in selecting and training customer representatives.
<LI> We have replaced damage control with continuous improvement.

<TITLE>Reengineering Your Agency's Travel Process</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<H1>It's the Law:  Start Reengineering Your Agency's Travel Process</H1>
	President Clinton signed 1997 Defense Authorization legislation on September 23, 1996. It contains provisions for the biggest change in government travel rules in 40 years, and was passed with strong bipartisan support in the Congress.
<P>
	The new law finally fixes the underlying legislative problems so that all agencies can reinvent their travel systems, one of NPR's initial recommendations. Implementation will save taxpayers hundreds of  millions a year while improving government travel services. It does this by adopting the best travel practices in the private sector. The law:
<UL>
<LI>	Repeals the 1939 Telephone Act, which requires that all long-distance telephone calls be certified by supervisors as being in the interest of the government.
<LI>	Eliminates senseless red tape for employees who are required to transfer to another location.
</UL>
	
A House version of the bill required agencies to use a corporate credit card for travel expenses. Although that provision did not make the cut in conference, committee members thought the card was a good idea. The conference report urges agencies, when appropriate, to use their discretionary authority  to "maximize the use of the travel charge card."
<P>
	Over the years, the General Accounting Office has highlighted the excessive cost of the government's travel system. Last year it pointed out that, while the Defense Department spent about &#036;5 billion on its travel, it spent an additional 30 percent just to administer the system. Well-run travel systems in the private sector cost about six percent to administer.
<P>
	Government reinventors do not have to look to the private sector for a model. In 1995, the National Security Agency's travel management operation, a reinvention lab, was selected by <I>Business Travel News,</I> the newspaper of the travel industry, as one of the four best in the country. NSA is right up there with Hewlett-Packard, Bankers Trust, and Texas Instruments. NSA's new process, including software under development, can be used by other agencies. Call Chip Mahan at (301) 688-3023.
<P>
 	A task force of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, a government-wide reinvention activity,  developed the new legislation and implementing regulations. Call (202) 512-9201 for the name of a task force member who can discuss the travel provisions. Call (202) 512-6000 to get a copy of the

<H2><B>Governing in a Balanced Budget World</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><I>&quot;The era of big government is over. . . But we have to keep working to give you a government that you feel you can trust and have confidence in.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><I>	--President Bill Clinton</I><BR>

<P>Through its reinvention commitment, the Clinton-Gore Administration has taken significant steps towards creating a government that is smaller and more effective in meeting the needs of the American people.  A balanced budget provides an opportunity to build on the reinvention successes of the last three years.  The Vice President has laid the groundwork for bringing the federal government into this new era and is prepared to lead the way forward.<BR>

<P>Vice President Al Gore is announcing a series of initiatives that will continue to reinvent and improve the federal government by creating various partnerships * partnerships with citizens, states and localities, businesses, and federal workers.  Each initiative aims to improve service and reduce costs for Americans.  Several key themes link these initiatives.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Customize solutions and services.</B>  New information technology allows a shift away from a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to a &quot;custom-fit&quot; approach tailored to the missions of individual agencies.  Creating performance-based organizations, grant partnerships, and single points of contact, as well as forging regulatory partnerships, reflect this customization.  <BR>

<P>	<B>	Focus on the ends, not the means.</B>  For too long, government has been preoccupied with process and hierarchy at the expense of results.  Reversing this policy will mean a major delegation of authority to managers on the front line -- but must include a tight focus and clear accountability for achieving organizational goals.  Results-oriented efforts include dramatically improving agencies' customer service and making the federal workforce a partner in change.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Build on success.</B>  The National Performance Review's hundreds of reinvention labs, Hammer Awards, and agency initiatives to implement the basic principles of reinvention have demonstrated that government can work better and cost less.  These innovations need to be expanded rapidly -- taken to scale -- across the government to maintain, and even improve, service to the public.  All of the initiatives presented here are based on past successes.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Better results don't mean increased costs.</B>  The initiatives are not high-flown, high-ticket programs.  They are made up of practical, practicable steps that agencies can take to maintain and improve their delivery of services in a time of tightening budgets.<BR>

<P>
<H1><B>Reinvention's Next Steps:</B></H1>
<P>
<H2><B>Governing in a Balanced Budget World</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><A NAME=convert><B>1.	Convert to Performance-Based Organizations	</B><BR>

<P>	Give agencies that deliver measurable services a greater degree of autonomy from governmentwide rules in exchange for greater accountability for achieving results.  Convert at least a dozen agencies to this new structure in the coming year.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Improve Customer Service Dramatically	</B><BR>

<P>	Challenge all agencies to set service goals so everyone in America will see that government service is better.  The heads of the 11 agencies with the greatest customer contact are making public commitments to improve selected services; they have created World Wide Web home pages as a means for receiving direct input.  The U.S. Business Advisor and a redesign of the &quot;blue pages&quot; in phone directories will help people quickly find needed government services.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Increase the Use of Regulatory Partnerships	</B><BR>

<P>	EPA and other agencies have successfully piloted a noncoercive partnership approach that focuses on meeting environmental goals rather than on complying with regulatory red tape.  Expand existing pilots in EPA, OSHA, and other regulatory agencies so this partnership approach becomes the mainstream strategy for federal regulatory agencies.<BR>

<P><B>4.	Create Performance-Based  Partnership Grants	</B><BR>

<P>	Develop federal-state-local partnerships that are based on results rather than process.  Develop goals and objectives for major programmatic areas, allow states and localities to be funded for these goals and objectives, and reduce existing federal red tape.  Convert categorical grants to partnerships as they come up for reauthorization.<BR>

<P><B>5.	Establish Single Points of Contact for Communities	</B><BR>

<P>	A major challenge for communities dealing with the federal government is untangling the complexity of its programs to determine who is responsible for what.  Establish a single point of contact for the nation's larger communities. <BR>

<P><B>6.	Transform the Federal Workforce	</B><BR>

<P>	The existing civil service system is based on the concept that &quot;one size fits all&quot;; it cannot respond quickly to change or to the varying needs of different organizations.  Reform the civil service system, increase investment in the workforce to create &quot;learning organizations,&quot; and give senior executives more tools and make them accountable for achieving results.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H2><B><a name=perform>1.  Convert to Performance-Based Organizations</a></B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Government agencies need to change their incentives and internal cultures to shift from a focus on process to a focus on customers and achieving results.  They need to become more responsive to citizens, yet account for program costs and safeguard broader public interests.  This can be done by creating performance-based organizations (PBOs) that set forth clear measures of performance, hold the head of the organization clearly accountable for achieving results, and grant the head of the organization authority to deviate from governmentwide rules if this is needed to achieve agreed-upon results.  PBOs involve structural changes as well as changes in incentives affecting federal employees.  The following activities would be involved in creating PBOs. <BR>

<P>		Separate service operation functions from their policy components and place them in separate organizations reporting to the agency or department head.  Policymaking would be in the office of the agency or department head.<BR>

<P>		Negotiate a three- to five-year framework document between the PBO and the departmental secretary to set out explicit goals, measures, relationships, flexibilities, and limitations for the organization.  Organizations would also be given authority to negotiate alternative approaches for procurement, civil service rules, etc., through their framework documents.  This flexibility would be tied to increased accountability for results, the use of unit cost accounting principles, and achieving productivity and customer service goals as well as budgetary savings.  Where necessary the framework document will result in new or amended authorizing legislation.<BR>

<P>		Create the position of chief executive to head the service operation functions.  The chief executive would be appointed or hired on contract through a competitive search, for a fixed term such as five to six years, with a clear agreement on services to be delivered and productivity goals to be achieved. The chief executive would be held personally accountable for delivering agreed-upon services.  The compensation for the chief executive could be based on existing pay and award authorities or, if warranted, on legislatively authorized rates with a significant portion of such pay contingent on performance.<BR>

<P>The proposal to create performance-based organizations in the federal government is based on an approach used successfully in Great Britain to manage agencies more efficiently and effectively in a period of declining resources.  This approach allowed British agencies to reduce their operating costs an average of about 5 percent a year over the past eight years, while continuing to maintain or improve services to the public.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Been Done?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Through important advances such as the signing of performance agreements between the President and major agency heads, passage of the Government Performance and Results Act and of the Government Management Reform Act, increased flexibilities through procurement reform, and the impending issuance of financial standards, the groundwork has been laid for creating PBOs.  <BR>

<P>In September 1995, Vice President Gore announced the Administration's plans to convert the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) into a PBO.  PTO head Bruce Lehman laid out the concepts to his authorizing committee in mid-September.  The presentation was followed by draft legislation from PTO, which was introduced in early November (H.R. 2533).  PTO is roughly a $600 million operation with a staff of about 5,500.  The issuance of patents is a constitutionally authorized function, so this operation is an unlikely candidate for being converted to a free-standing government corporation or for privatization.  Under the legislation:<BR>

<P>		The &quot;inherently governmental&quot; functions of policymaking and approval of patents and trademark registrations will be separated from the operational functions of patent and trademark searches. The bill creates an undersecretary for intellectual property to handle the inherently governmental functions and a chief executive to lead PTO (renamed the Intellectual Property Organization).<BR>

<P>		The chief executive will be hired by the secretary of Commerce on contract through a competitive search for a fixed six-year term, with a clear contract for services to be delivered.  Half of his or her pay would be based on performance, to be determined based on an annual performance agreement.<BR>

<P>		The secretary of Commerce and the chief executive will be required to set clear, measurable goals and measures of progress and productivity.<BR>

<P>		The organization will receive increased flexibility in personnel, procurement, and other administrative functions.<BR>

<P>PTO already measures its performance and accounts for the quality of its work as well as its productivity and timeliness.  It is now developing cost information.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Following the Vice President's September 1995 announcement, the President's Management Council created a working group to begin identifying additional candidates for conversion.  To date, it has identified a series of initial candidates and is ready to assist these in negotiating with their departments, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration for the kinds of goals, standards, measures, and administrative flexibilities the candidates feel are needed to achieve their goals.  These negotiations have been completed in the initial pilot (the Patent and Trademark Office) and are under way with the National Technical Information Service at the Department of Commerce.  The focus of the conversion process is on <I>functions</I>, not agencies; thus, parts of an agency -- not necessarily an entire agency -- may be converted. <BR>

<P>Once structural flexibilities have been identified the potential PBO will begin discussions with its authorizing and appropriating committees in Congress if statutory changes are required.<BR>

<P>The President's Management Council is using the following criteria in identifying candidates for PBO conversion.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Does the organization have a clear mission and provide a service that is measurable? </B>The candidate organization must have a clear mission (and statement) with broad-based support from its key &quot;stakeholders&quot;  --  both internal and external to the agency -- regarding its mission.  Normally, such organizations will have strategic and implementing plans already in place.  The candidate organization must also be able to make a fairly clear distinction among its policymaking, regulatory, and service delivery functions.  The service delivery function, which must be measurable, would be the portion targeted for PBO status.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Does the organization have the capacity to measure progress toward meeting its mission and objectives?  </B>The candidate organization should currently have the ability to measure progress toward meeting the objectives and missions of the organization.  In particular, the candidate should have a good history of performance management and historical trend data.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Is there a clear line of accountability to an agency head and does he or she support the transformation of the unit to a PBO?  </B>The candidate organization must have strong internal leadership and external management support in terms of both the capacity and motivation to see the PBO process through and to maintain accountability well beyond creation of the PBO.<BR>

<P>Not all agencies can be converted to PBO status.  A PBO should not have a mix of responsibilities, such as regulatory and service delivery, because these need to be accounted for separately.  In addition, PBOs must have measurable results, so a function such as foreign policy development in the State Department or other general policy development in other departments would not be appropriate candidates.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The following candidates will be included in the FY 1997 budget to be presented to Congress in mid-March.  These candidates will begin drafting and submitting necessary legislation in the next few weeks.  Meanwhile, additional candidates are being identified.  <BR>

<H2><B>2.  Improve Customer Service Dramatically</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Over the past three decades, public confidence in the federal government has plunged.  Where the public once trusted the federal government to do the right thing more than three-quarters of the time, today only a quarter trusts the federal government to do the right thing. President Clinton and Vice President Gore are convinced that the public's destiny as a free, self-governing people depends in no small measure on an ability to work together through the instrument of government.  As the Vice President has observed, &quot;There is no way to reestablish confidence in government and confidence in ourselves as a free nation unless we can dramatically change the way the federal government works.&quot;  <BR>

<P>The most visible and concrete interaction between the federal government and the American public is the latter's day-to-day dealings with the former.  This is the focal point of why the government is being reinvented  to put the American people first.  By having federal agencies commit publicly to the standards of service they will provide, Americans obtain a means of more directly holding the federal government accountable for its actions.<B>  </B><BR>

<P><B>What's Been Done?</B><BR>

<P>	<B>	The first phase of reinvention.</B>  A primary theme of Vice President Gore's first report of the National Performance Review (NPR) in 1993 was &quot;putting customers first.&quot;3 Responding to a key recommendation, President Clinton immediately issued an executive order calling for all federal agencies to develop a comprehensive program of customer surveys, training, standard setting, and benchmarking with the goal that government would deliver service &quot;equal to the best in business.&quot;  A year later, NPR published the government's first comprehensive set of customer service standards, covering 150 agencies and bureaus.4<BR>

<P>	<B>	The second phase of reinvention.</B>  The customer maintained center stage during this phase.  In 1995, the Vice President asked all agencies to evaluate the need to continue each of their programs &quot;from the customer's perspective.&quot;  This customer-driven analysis led to major changes in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) public housing programs and other HUD programs.  In addition, work on improving service continued in all agencies under the guidance of the original executive order.  NPR consequently was able to publish a bigger and better set of service standards, this time covering 214 agencies and bureaus.  Evidence of success began to surface.  For example, an independent survey rated the Social Security Administration better than any American business at providing 1-800 phone service.  Also, the Postal Service scored some well-publicized improvements in on-time delivery.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Laying groundwork for a significant improvement in services to the public, the Vice President has asked the heads of the 11 federal agencies that have the most frequent or widespread contact with the public to make significantly visible improvements in some aspect of their customer service.  This group is the &quot;President's Vanguard,&quot; and each has made specific commitments (see the next page for a list of these commitments).<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Improving customer service is critical to efforts to make government work better and cost less.  The Vice President is announcing commitments to improved customer service by the heads of all the Vanguard agencies and is publicizing a way for citizens to comment on these through the Internet (http://www.info.gov/Info/html/customer_service.htm).  He also recently unveiled the improved U.S. Business Advisor --  the high-tech, customer-designed Web site that gives business owners access to the whole government (http:/www.business.gov).  An interagency task force co-chaired by the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration continues to develop the U.S. Business Advisor by incorporating the comments and suggestions of businesses around the country.  <BR>

<P>In addition, the Vice President is announcing a governmentwide initiative to redesign the telephone book &quot;blue pages&quot; so that citizens can efficiently find government services.  Finally, Vice President Gore is challenging all agencies by setting a goal for the year that &quot;everyone in America will know&quot; that government service is better. <BR>

<P>
<H2><B>3.  Increase the Use of Regulatory Partnerships</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The vast majority of Americans believe that their government has an important role to play in ensuring their safety and protecting their environment.  And the Clinton-Gore Administration has an unwavering commitment to fulfilling those responsibilities.  Strong enforcement of environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act have produced tremendous results over the last 20 years, ranging from the restoration of swimmable rivers to the comeback of the American bald eagle.  As the federal government continues to change, reinvent itself, and move forward, the challenge is not only to maintain the progress that has been made, but to make these laws actually work <I>better</I>.<BR>

<P>To this end, regulatory agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should reorient their efforts to focus on results rather than process. The ultimate objective of an emissions reduction program, for example, should be to ensure that Americans can breathe clean air, not to make sure that companies are filling out certain government forms or following prescribed procedures.  Regulatory agencies should move away from their traditional adversarial relationship with the private sector and toward cooperative partnerships to achieve public goals such as compliance with national health and safety standards.<BR>

<P>With regard to environmental protection, President Clinton noted in his State of the Union speech:  &quot;To businesses this Administration is saying:  If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it -- as long as you do it right.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Been Done?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>	<B>	The first phase of reinvention.</B>  Since its inception in 1993, the National Performance Review (NPR) has concentrated on the need to improve the focus and effectiveness of regulatory programs.  In the first NPR report, Vice President Gore advocated changes to the way the federal government develops its rules.  In September 1993, the President issued an executive order to implement these changes.  The Vice President also recommended several specific reforms in the way government protects health, safety, and the natural environment.1<BR>

<P>Recommendations targeting environmental regulation, for example, included cross-agency ecosystem planning and management, environmental accounting to improve federal decisionmaking, and a shift in EPA's emphasis toward pollution prevention rather than control and cleanup.  Broader recommendations covering all regulatory activity included more emphasis on consensus-based rulemaking and alternative dispute resolution.<BR>

<P>		Besides making specific recommendations on regulatory policy, NPR also identified several groups of front-line regulators that had achieved substantially better results by forming partnerships with the entities they regulate.2<BR>

<P>	<B>	The second phase of reinvention.</B>  The second round of the National Performance Review in 1995 included a specific initiative on regulatory reform.  This was a two-pronged effort:  first, to rationalize the huge bulk of federal regulations,3 eliminating the unnecessary, updating the obsolete, and clarifying the confusing.  Second -- and, according to business leaders who are subject to regulation, more significantly -- the effort aimed to change the <I>way</I> regulations are enforced; to move away from adversarial enforcement and toward partnership with common goals.4The President called the heads of all regulatory agencies together and told them to make four changes:  Cut obsolete regulations; measure and reward results, not the number of infractions and fines; get out of Washington and create grassroots partnerships; and negotiate rather than dictate.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Agencies reported to the President last summer that they would eliminate 16,000 pages and streamline another 31,000 pages of the <I>Code of Federal Regulations</I>.  Agencies have completed one-third of this commitment thus far.  For example, the Small Business Administration has cut its regulations by more than half.  Written in plain English, its streamlined regulations are coherent and user friendly.  The Department of Commerce has radically revised its export regulations to make them more user friendly.<BR>

<P>Much of the federal regulatory strategy of the past was based on considering business an adversary that would do only what was required by law or regulation and, even then, only if tough penalties were enforced.  New experiences show that a more productive strategy for many regulatory agencies is to treat business as a partner with common goals.  NPR has found many examples where innovative approaches to regulatory dilemmas produced much better results than did the traditional adversarial strategy.  These initiatives demonstrate two key factors critical to moving forward with regulatory partnerships:  <BR>

<P>		The private sector is, in many cases, committed to achieving the goals laid out in environmental and safety laws, and is willing to work cooperatively toward those goals.<BR>

<P>		The government can better achieve public goals by being more flexible and results-oriented, and by working with industry.<BR>

<P>In Maine, for example, OSHA was setting records for the amounts of fines collected, but was not improving workplace safety.  The agency abandoned its old way of doing business and formed alliances with industry and labor to work cooperatively and proactively to achieve the common goal of increased safety and health in the workplace.  By giving employers a choice between partnerships and traditional enforcement, OSHA was able to leverage its limited resources to get better results.  These new partnerships have identified and corrected 14 times more hazards than before.  Of the 200 companies that participated in this program, 65 percent experienced a decrease in their injury and illness rates.<BR>

<P>Other good examples exist in the environmental area.  <BR>

<P>		Many companies today are run by people who know and care about protecting the environment.  Business leaders also understand that environmental protection is good for business because their customers want to buy from companies that protect, not pollute, the environment.  These leaders are willing to help pull not only their own companies, but also others, in the right direction.  Because they know their businesses far better than the government ever could, they also know best how to attack their own pollution problems, using all of the innovation and incentives available to the private sector.  Continuing to treat them as adversaries wastes those powerful positive inclinations.  Further, it stretches diminishing federal enforcement dollars over an unnecessarily large horizon instead of focusing them on the biggest problems. <BR>

<P>		In Seattle, a unique partnership among EPA, the Justice Department, local governments, and the business community turned a regulatory stalemate into a solution resulting in the cleanup of a hazardous waste site and economic growth and jobs for the region.  EPA's 33/50 program saw 1,300 companies voluntarily stop dumping a billion pounds of polluting chemicals into the environment.  In November 1995, EPA launched its Project XL (for Excellence in Leadership) program, in which new partnerships are being forged with industry to achieve environmental goals.  More than 10 companies are now in the program, working with others in their communities to move forward innovative pilot projects to achieve more environmental protection at less cost. <BR>

<P>		EPA's new Common Sense Compliance Program of incentives for small businesses allows them to seek help to correct environmental problems without fear of a penalty, providing a six-month grace period to correct problems and waiving fines for first-time violators that make a good-faith effort to comply.  EPA has created four compliance assistance centers -- for printing, metal finishing, auto repair, and small farms -- to provide businesses with the information they need about applicable regulations as well as about reducing costs by preventing pollution.<BR>

<P>These partnerships work, and offer tremendous promise for achieving regulatory goals if expanded. <BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The success of the partnership pilots should be expanded into the mainstream of federal regulatory policy.  Incentives for joining these partnership programs are compelling.  For the regulated entity, a partnership offers a more rational, flexible, and results-oriented relationship with its regulator.  For the government agency, partnership focuses efforts on outcome, not process, and allows the agency to target its resources more efficiently.  And for the American people, these partnerships offer the opportunity to attain the goals of greater safety and a healthier environment with less economic disruption.<BR>

<P>Incorporating the positive inclinations and ingenuity of the vast majority of today's business leaders into the regulatory process will best achieve public goals and can reduce costs for both industry and government.  Following are some guidelines that should be considered in developing these new partnerships for all regulatory agencies.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Enhance enforcement.</B>  The partnership strategy provides an opportunity to <I>actually improve enforcement</I>.  Partnerships allow the government and private sector to combine their resources and talents in achieving goals.  This cooperative approach lets the regulatory agency focus its energy and resources on remaining problem areas rather than impose unnecessary burdens in areas where goals are being met.<BR>

<P>		Businesses that want to become partners would have to demonstrate, through independent audits or other means, that they are achieving the goals of the partnership.  This would give EPA a very low-cost method of getting far more inspection and enforcement -- and results -- than it can with today's workforce and resources.  Companies acting in good faith would receive the benefits of the partnership.  Should participating companies not live up to their end of the bargain, EPA still has all of its enforcement tools available.<BR>

<P><B>		Tailor plans for each business.</B>  Particularly with all of the new tools available in this information age, regulatory strategies should not assume that one size fits all.  Regulatory programs should focus on outcomes, not on how they're achieved.  Virtually every regulatory situation is unique and may be resolved best by a unique solution.  The terms of each partnership should be defined by the partners, as partners.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Add extras.  </B>When offered the incentives and opportunities, companies have shown a willingness to go well beyond the requirements of law in order to get out of an adversarial mode.  For example, one company, as part of a broader partnership pilot with the EPA, agreed to establish a recycling facility in a town where none existed.  As the result of a more cooperative, results-oriented relationship between EPA and the private sector, the public received not just better focus on the goals of clean air and water laws, but also a jump-start in its efforts to keep recyclables out of its landfill. <BR>

<P>
<H4><B>1. </B>These recommendations are elaborated on in the following NPR reports:<I>  Reinventing Environmental Management</I>, <I>Improving Regulatory Systems</I>, and <I>Environmental Protection Agency</I>.  These reports were issued in September 1993 and are available from the U.S. Government Printing Office.</H4>
<P>
<P>2. The most publicized example was the partnership between the Customs Service and the airline and shipping companies that serve the port of Miami.  Led by Miami Customs chief Lynn Gordon, the two-year-old effort has transformed an adversarial, even litigious, relationship into a smooth, working partnership which has both improved drug interdiction and sped the clearance of passengers and cargo.<BR>

<P>3. These regulations are codified in the <I>Code of Federal Regulations</I>, which is over 132,000 pages long, and contains such detailed items as instructions on how to smell a fish and specifications for testing the proper size of particles of grits.<BR>

<P>4. Other partnership efforts, besides the Miami Customs example described above, are EPA's 33/50 program, OSHA's Maine 200 program, and the Comptroller of the Currency's regulations concerning bank operations.  Each of these programs is based on trust, partnership, flexibility, and better results.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H2><B>4.  Create Performance-Based Partnership Grants</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>A <I>performance-based partnership grant</I> between the federal government and another level of government is an agreement based on goals -- and progress toward meeting those goals -- rather than on regulatory inputs and micromanagement.  The objective of such a partnership is to focus on program results and the needs of the program's intended recipients.  <BR>

<P>Performance-based partnership grants shift the focus from processes and inputs to a system of accountability for performance and results.  All organizations in the partnership are accountable, and all work together to achieve the results.  In exchange for commitments to specific performance levels, state and local governments receive increased administrative flexibility on how to achieve these levels of performance.<BR>

<P>The principles of performance-based partnership grants are as follows:<BR>

<P>	<B>	Focus on results.</B>  Partnerships are negotiated and structured to achieve mutually agreed-upon results oriented to community needs and customer satisfaction.<BR>

<P><B>		Create partnerships.</B><BR>

<P>		-	Partners share accountability to the public for outcomes and progress toward outcomes.<BR>

<P>		- 	Intergovernmental and interagency partners work together toward desired results.<BR>

<P>		- 	Partners work together to remove barriers to success.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Increase flexibility.</B><BR>

<P>		-	Partnerships reduce red tape and micromanagement at all levels of the service delivery system.<BR>

<P>		-	Partnerships provide greater flexibility at all levels to achieve more effective performance toward results.<BR>

<P>		-	Partnerships create mutual trust and delegate responsibilities as to how services are designed and delivered to front-line, local-level providers.<BR>

<P>		-	This approach is not about more money but about more effective use of funds to better achieve results.<BR>

<P>Performance-based partnership grants yield improved results, better use of public resources, and greater confidence in public sector services.  They also enable localities to design and implement solutions tailored specifically to their community needs.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Been Done?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Several initiatives over the past three years have laid the groundwork for improved partnerships between the federal government and states and localities.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Performance partnership grants.  </B>The President's FY 1996 budget proposed consolidating 271 grant programs into 27 performance partnership grants with state and local governments in the areas of public health, rural development, education and training, housing and urban development, and transportation.  For example, the Public Health Service would consolidate over 100 programs into categories of performance partnership grants such as chronic diseases.  Small categorical grants would be replaced with larger, flexible pools of funds.  Under this proposal, grantees would determine how to use funds but would develop, report on, and show progress toward performance goals (for example, the percentage of women whose breast cancer is detected at an early stage).  Legislation for these and a related Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) performance grant are awaiting final congressional approval.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).</B>  This act requires agencies to define their long-term goals, set specific annual performance targets, and report annually on performance compared to targets.  GPRA takes effect governmentwide in FY 1999; until then, its requirements apply to various pilot programs.  GPRA reporting will undoubtedly be easier for services delivered directly by the federal government than for those delivered through the intergovernmental system.  Very few of the early GPRA pilots are intergovernmental programs; however, some-- such as the Child Support Enforcement program -- have been making great progress in identifying goals and performance measures with their intergovernmental partners.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Community empowerment zones and enterprise communities (EZ/ECs).  </B>The Administration has entered into performance partnerships with localities primarily through the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community initiative.  The 105 designated EZ/ECs have developed comprehensive strategic plans to address the economic, physical, and human needs of their communities, with action plans and benchmarks to measure progress toward community goals.  The federal government is providing financial and technical assistance to the EZ/ECs and is eliminating red tape and micromanagement where possible.<BR>

<P>	<B>	State partnerships.</B>  An interagency partnership begun in 1994 with the State of Oregon focuses on specific outcomes -- healthier children, more stable families, and a more developed workforce.  Partners work to implement promising practices that will achieve outcomes, break down barriers to achieving outcomes, and measure progress toward those outcomes.  The Administration signed an agreement on February 24, 1996, to create a similar partnership with Connecticut to improve that state's poorest communities through economic development and neighborhood revitalization.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Agency-based partnerships.</B>  Individual federal agencies have moved ahead with performance-based intergovernmental partnerships.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, entered into a partnership with Dallas and Texas to work together to revitalize the city; the agreement includes deadlines for accomplishing specific objectives.  EPA entered into an agreement with Tulsa to provide that city with sufficient flexibility to try an approach that the city believes will lead to better ambient air quality standards than EPA currently requires.  EPA has also launched an initiative called &quot;XL for Communities&quot; that offers -- to local entities that can demonstrate excellence and leadership -- assistance and flexibility to implement community-designed strategies to achieve greater environmental quality.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>States and localities are developing more sophisticated means of budgeting and wiser ways of using their resources.  As they begin to develop broad strategic approaches to solving the problems they confront, they need the federal government to be a partner, not an impediment.  States such as Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon, and West Virginia have approached the federal government seeking partnerships in solving diverse problems, including children and family needs, economic development, and health care.  Cities, too, are approaching the federal government with similar requests.  The Administration has granted hundreds of waivers to its rules, but a more comprehensive approach is warranted. <BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Building on GPRA and other initiatives, the federal government can begin to turn every interaction it has with another level of government into a performance-based approach.  Partnerships with individual states or in individual programs are a start, but they make only a small dent in the more than 600 separate federal categorical grant programs administered through the intergovernmental system.  Of these 600 programs, some 450  or 75 percent  are grants of $50 million or less.  In FY 1995, total discretionary federal funds for state and local grants was over $125 billion. <BR>

<P>As individual programs come up for reauthorization, agencies and Congress should review them in the context of other programs with related objectives.  For example:<BR>

<P>		Agencies should -- in conjunction with state and local partners -- develop and submit to Congress national program goals and objectives consistent with their strategic plans. <BR>

<P>		Based on these goals, Congress should develop legislation authorizing performance partnerships that would give state and local governments greater flexibility as to how to achieve agreed-upon levels of performance (for example, encourage funding flexibility, provide waiver authority to enable compliance or achievement of agreed-upon goals, reduce micromanagement and paperwork for programs that work, create funding incentives to reward desirable results). <BR>

<P>		Agencies should identify corresponding reductions in federal regulations and administrative procedures.<BR>

<P>Finally, Congress should remove statutory barriers or provide statutory ability for federal agencies to provide greater flexibility  to state and local governments regarding how programs are administered.  Congress should also adopt an acceptable version of the proposed Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act to give states and localities a chance to propose plans for better coordination of federal, state, local, and nonprofit funds and services, and to request waivers from federal laws and regulations that hinder a locality's ability to achieve agreed-upon results.  Under S.88, proposed by Senator Mark Hatfield (and its companion House bill, H.R. 2086, sponsored by Representative Christopher Shays), a team of cabinet-level officials would review local plans to integrate federal funds, and federal agencies could grant waivers to provide more flexibility to achieve results.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H2><B>5.  Establish Single Points of Contact for Communities</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Vice President Gore challenged federal agencies three years ago to change the way they interact with Americans at all levels -- not by reorganizing the agencies, but by restructuring how they work.  His vision of a &quot;virtual government&quot; that is straightforward in its delivery of services is being realized in several areas.  For example:<BR>

<P>		The <I>U.S. Business Advisor</I> is an Internet-based system that allows access to over 30 federal agencies in one place (http://www.business.gov).  It provides a &quot;one-stop&quot; electronic shop for information and services that the government offers to help businesses grow and prosper.<BR>

<P>		In Houston, the pilot <I>U.S. General Store</I> lets businesses receive integrated services from more than a dozen federal agencies at one location.<BR>

<P>		Public assistance recipients are having their aid integrated across programs with increased security and reduced fraud through <I>electronic benefit cards</I>, which are similar to bank cards.<BR>

<P>The federal government is now ready to pilot more difficult forms of service integration with large communities around the country.  <BR>

<P>Over 600 federal programs are administered through state and local governments.  These programs often serve similar populations.  However, the local community has no authority to integrate these for their customers.  The federal government should help by designating a federal contact point to work <I>across</I> these programs to meet the needs of the people in individual communities.<BR>

<P>Establishing a single point of contact for each of America's larger communities would completely restructure the way the federal government does business with these communities.  At the local level, federal employees would work directly with the priorities, opportunities, and problems the communities themselves identify -- not those defined by the federal government.  In this way, federal and local public employees would become partners working together to achieve measurable results rather than one level of government micromanaging another.  <BR>

<P>Under this scheme, cities over a certain size would have a single federal point of contact.  This person would be trained to:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>		troubleshoot,<BR>
 <BR>
		respond to community complaints, <BR>

<P>		help communities identify and overcome federal and other impediments to achieving local priorities and results, and<BR>

<P>		help communities navigate through the maze of federal programs and processes.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Been Done?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Over the past three years, a dramatic reinvention of the federal relationship with communities has begun  particularly through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) reinvention activities under the leadership of President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary Cisneros.  Empowerment zones and enterprise communities are using flexible federal resources to create jobs and businesses and leverage private sector investment; they are also working with federal partners to break down barriers and achieve real results for the residents in their communities.  For example, the Small Business Administration has joined with other federal, state, local, and private sector partners to establish One-Stop Capital Shops that help small firms get in business, stay in business, and grow.<BR>

<P>Several performance partnerships have been established with individual cities and states.  These efforts focus on measurable results and on breaking down local, state, and federal barriers to achieving those results.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working closely with communities on the Brownfields Initiative to reclaim abandoned hazardous waste sites, and with other federal and state agencies on community advisory groups.<BR>

<P>In 1994, the Vice President and seven cabinet secretaries signed an agreement with the governor and local officials in Oregon to test a new service delivery system that aims at, and holds all partners accountable for, achieving measurable results.  Interagency and intergovernmental partners of &quot;the Oregon Option&quot; are working together toward agreed-upon results involving healthy children, a developed and well-prepared workforce, and stable families.  They are trying to determine promising strategies to achieve results, eliminate barriers to those strategies and results, and measure progress toward results.  A similar agreement was signed with officials in Connecticut in February 1996.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Together with states and localities, the federal government faces funding constraints that compel it to seek joint solutions to commonly recognized problems.  The new fiscal realities call into question the usefulness of many small, narrowly targeted federal grant programs.  Hence, agencies are more willing to address the existing barriers in the federal grant system.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Considerable progress has been made in streamlining and consolidating programs and requirements and entering into performance partnerships over the last three years.  Still, most federal programs offer a very limited ability for localities to use funds creatively to meet their unique needs.  Community problems and opportunities do not fit neatly into the organizational and programmatic framework the federal government currently uses. <BR>

<P>In general, the federal government is not organized in a way that allows attention to be focused on the overall effects of federal actions on a city.  And yet its actions -- undertaken not unilaterally, but as extensions of individual offices and agencies -- can have unintended consequences.   For example, communities face daunting federal rules when they attempt to integrate services to poor families.  When they try to do so, federal rules often prevent common sense solutions -- such as prohibiting part-time workers for two different programs funded by two different federal agencies from using the same desk.  The federal government must integrate its approach and resources to deliver services in a common sense way from the point of view of the customer, starting in larger communities.<BR>

<P>HUD has already begun this integration with its own programs.  It is moving away from <BR>
&quot;faceless bureaucrats&quot; toward individual accountability in the field.  Starting with a complete transformation of HUD, the federal government -- where appropriate -- can begin to change its relationship with communities.  The HUD vision for broader federal action will encompass the following activities: <BR>

<P>		HUD will invert its organizational structure so that federal representatives who meet with the public are on the highest level, and every other function supports a highly competent front-line staff.  HUD will also give its field offices and field office directors more power to solve problems, cross agency lines, and meet customer needs.  HUD's headquarters staff should be reduced as program delivery functions are moved to the front-line field offices.  Remaining Washington-based staff should focus on policy development, budgeting, and congressional relations.<BR>

<P>		Over the next year, the President will begin designating a single point of contact for localities; initially, this will be through HUD, and eventually, through other agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services or the Environmental Protection Agency, depending on the prevalent issues and topics.  This process will likely begin with the approximately 183 jurisdictions that have populations over 150,000 or are the largest city in each state, and with counties whose populations exceed 700,000.  While these contact persons will not have decisionmaking authority over other federal departments, they will be charged with convening other federal officials to resolve problems identified by localities.  These staff and their partners will receive training to ensure that they have the expertise to help communities achieve their visions.  The first of such contacts, Ray Jordan, was designated to coordinate interagency efforts in Connecticut on February 24, 1996.<BR>

<P>		These actions will complement HUD's proposal to consolidate its 60 programs into a core of three to four programs that give communities more power and flexibility in return for results.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>6.  Transform the Federal Workforce</B></H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Background</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Congress laid the foundation of the current Civil Service system in 1883.  It has modified the basic Civil Service legislation many times since then in order to create uniform job classifications, standardized efficiency ratings, and benefit programs.  The 1978 Civil Service Reform Act created the Senior Executive Service (SES) and instituted performance management features such as merit pay.  Other recent changes have included locality pay, a new retirement system, and reform of the Hatch Act.<BR>

<P>The system in place was characterized by the National Performance Review (NPR) as an elaborate, complex, and overregulated one that prevents agencies and their managers, employees, and unions from designing effective and mission-supporting human resource management programs.  As the General Accounting Office points out, the private sector and other government entities are moving in a quite different direction:<BR>

<P>	. . . It is clear that today's leading private sector employers  as well as some government entities both here and abroad  are creating personnel systems that diverge sharply from the federal government's traditional approach.  The new model is more decentralized, focused more directly on mission accomplishment, and set up more to establish guiding principles than to prescribe detailed rules and procedures.1 Making government work better and cost less means giving its workforce greater accountability and focusing more on results.  But several factors challenge this goal, not least of which are that the federal workforce today faces less stability, tighter resources, and greater uncertainty about its future than it has at perhaps any other time.  To move forward, the federal workforce will need new tools, a flexible human resource management system, effective training, and a creative and empowered senior executive leadership.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Been Done?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>In 1993, NPR examined workforce issues in the federal government.  It found that a highly centralized, outmoded human resource management system formed a major barrier to innovation in the government:<BR>

<P>	Today, the system's functional operating components present a burdensome array of barriers and obstacles to effective human resource management.  Hiring is complex and rule-bound . . . The classification and pay systems are inflexible.  The performance management system is not adequately linked to the organization's mission and goals . . . Agencies see little value in the efforts of central guidance agencies to monitor and control their activities.2  NPR made a series of recommendations designed to improve human resource management throughout government.  Many of these are in progress or have been implemented.  For example,  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) abolished the <I>Federal Personnel Manual</I> in January 1994, thereby giving agencies greater flexibility in designing their personnel systems.  It has redesigned and simplified performance management and family-friendly leave policies.  Many other initiatives are also under way across the government to improve the human resource management process, strengthen training programs, and enhance senior executive performance. In addition, Congress recently granted departments and agencies the authority to conduct their own recruiting and examining for all positions.<BR>

<P>Two particularly important NPR recommendations addressed streamlining, decentralizing, and deregulating the human resource management system:<BR>

<P>			Dramatically simplify the current job classification system, and give agencies greater flexibility in how they classify and pay their employees.<BR>

<P>			Agencies should be allowed to design their own performance management and reward systems, with the objective of improving the performance of individuals and organizations.3<BR>

<P>These recommendations essentially called for major reform of the existing Civil Service system.  The Administration has drafted legislation that would implement reform by greatly expanding the demonstration authority currently in law.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's New?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>This reform initiative is just beginning.  Although OPM has simplified or abolished its own regulations and a number of agencies have put in place better systems, statutory impediments remain.  Transforming the workforce to make it effective in a balanced budget environment will involve several key elements.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Reform the Civil Service system</B> to:<BR>

<P>		-	Expand agencies' capability to initiate demonstration projects to explore and test new human resource management concepts.  This would include streamlining the current hiring, classification, and performance management processes; expanding the numbers and types of projects; and allowing successful projects to become permanent. <BR>

<P>		-	Increase the authority and accountability of line managers over personnel decisions.<BR>

<P>		-	Strengthen labor-management partnerships that let agencies and their workers and unions work together to increase their organization's performance.<BR>

<P>	<B>	Invest in the workforce.</B>  In high-performing organizations, training constitutes an investment in a strategic resource and is funded accordingly as a means of achieving organizational mission.  These &quot;learning organizations&quot; recognize that the ability to change successfully in an extremely dynamic environment is directly linked to the tools with which the workforce has been equipped. <BR>

<P>	<B>	Broaden senior executives' leadership perspectives and re-energize their leadership role.</B>  A balanced budget environment demands leadership willing to take risks and encourage new, innovative ideas.  Because today's senior executive cadre was trained in an environment of <I>growing</I> budgets and resources, they now need a program to help them develop new perspectives.  This should include training for building expertise and skills in &quot;start-ups,&quot; &quot;turnarounds,&quot; process reengineering, downsizing, customer service and interaction, and other capabilities that will be crucial for successful executives in a new government era.  The program should also encourage executives to get out of their offices and into experiences that put them in touch with the public, give them a better understanding of state and local needs, or work in other federal positions outside their own organizations.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>What's Next?</B></H4>
<P>
<P>		In the near term, the Administration will submit Civil Service reform legislation to Congress that will enhance demonstration project authority by allowing agencies to improve their ability to hire, manage performance, classify jobs, and strengthen labor-management partnerships.<BR>

<P>		Agencies will be encouraged to invest in training their workforce.  They will be required to integrate individual and organizational learning in their strategic plans, which are submitted under the Government Performance and Results Act, as recognition that a continuously learning workforce is a vital investment for achieving strategic goals and objectives.  Agencies designated as performance-based organizations should be granted the authority to earmark up to 50 percent of their savings in operating accounts to be used for training.<BR>

<P>		To enhance the effectiveness of the senior executive corps in a rapidly changing environment, the Administration will consider options that broaden SES experience and expertise.  These would include training to broaden leadership perspectives and increasing voluntary senior executive mobility.  An enhanced mobility program might, for example, include positions in state and local government or private industry, or might provide incentives to transfer.<BR>

<H4><B>FACT SHEET</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Governing in a Balanced Budget World</B></H4>
<P>
<H4><B>Vice President Al Gore</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>March 4, 1996</B><BR>

<P>
<P>		During the last three years, the Clinton-Gore Administration has taken significant steps towards the creation of a government that not only is smaller, but is more effective in meeting the needs of the American people.  A balanced budget environment provides an opportunity to build on the reinvention successes of the last three years.  The Vice President has laid the groundwork for bringing the federal government into this new era.<BR>
	<BR>
		Today Gore announced a series of initiatives to continue reinventing the federal government .  These initiatives will provide significant benefits to Americans in either improved service or reduced costs.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>1.</B>  <B><a name=perform>CREATE PERFORMANCE-BASED ORGANIZATIONS</a></B><BR>

<P>	Separate service operations from policy and place them in separate organizations reporting to the agency or department head.<BR>

<P>	Negotiate a 3-5 year framework document between the Performance-Based Organizations and the departmental secretary that sets out explicit goals, measures, relationships, flexibilities and limitations for the organization.   These organizations will be able to negotiate alternative approaches for procurement, civil service rules, etc. , tied to an increased accountability for results, the use of unit cost accounting principles and achieving specific budgetary savings.<BR>

<P>	Create the position of Chief Executive to head the service operation functions.  He/she would be hired on contract through a competitive search, for a fixed term, such as 5-6 years, with a clear agreement on services to be delivered and savings to be achieved.  A significant portion of the Chief Executives pay would be contingent on performance.<BR>

<P>	Candidates which very likely will be included in the FY 1997 budget as Performance-Based Organizations are:  (1) The Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; (2)  the Technical Information Dissemination (National Technical Information Service) and Intellectual Property Rights (Patent and Trademark Office) of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce;  (3) the Defense Commissary Agency of the Dept. of Defense; (4) the Minerals Royalty Collection Services (Minerals Management Service) of the U.S. Dept. of the Interior; (5)  the Mortgage Insurance Services (Federal Housing Administration and Government Mortgage Guarantee Agency) of the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development;  (6) the Retirement and Benefit Management Services (Federal Retirement and Insurance Service) of the Office of Personnel Management; and  (6) the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation of the U.S. Dept. of Transportation.<BR>

<P><B>2.  IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE DRAMATICALLY</B><BR>

<P>	Establishment of the Presidents Vanguard -- the eleven agencies which have the most frequent or widespread contact with the public (OSHA, IRS, EPA, Forest Service/Park Service, U.S. Customs Service/Immigration and Naturalization Service/Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Service, Veterans Affairs, Passport Service and Social Security Administration)..<BR>

<P>	The Vanguard agencies will make significantly visible improvements in some specific aspect of their customer service in the coming months so every American will see a  positive difference.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>3.  INCREASE THE USE OF REGULATORY PARTNERSHIPS</B><BR>

<P>	Improve enforcement by combining the resources and talents of both government and business to achieve goals, allowing the regulatory agency to focus its energy and resources on remaining problem areas rather than imposing unnecessary burdens in areas where goals are being met.<BR>

<P>	Stop direct government intervention in federal regulatory policy and substitute partnerships with the private sector, focusing on outcomes -- not how they are achieved.<BR>

<P>	Provide a more flexible, results-oriented relationship with business, defined by the partners.<BR>

<P>	Businesses that want to become partners would have to demonstrate that they are achieving the goals of the partnership.<BR>

<P><B>4.  CREATE PERFORMANCE-BASED GRANT PARTNERSHIPS</B>:<BR>

<P>	Create agreements between the federal government and another level of government which is based on goals and progress toward meeting those goals rather than on regulatory inputs and micromanagement.<BR>

<P>	Focus on program results and the needs of the programs intended recipients.<BR>

<P>	Increase flexibility at all levels to achieve more effective performance towards results.<BR>

<P>	Give localities the opportunity to design and implement solutions tailored to the specific needs of the local community.<BR>

<P><B>5.  ESTABLISH SINGLE POINTS OF CONTACT FOR COMMUNITIES</B><BR>

<P>	Completely restructure the way the federal government does business with our nations larger communities.<BR>

<P>	Provide large cities with an empowered, single federal point of contact, trained to trouble-shoot, to respond to community complaints, to help communities identify and overcome federal and other impediments to achieving local priorities and results and help communities navigate through the maze of federal programs and processes.<BR>

<P><B>6.  TRANSFORM THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE</B>:<BR>

<P>	Give all departments and agencies authority to conduct their own recruiting and examining for all positions and abolish all central registers and standard application forms.<BR>

<P>	Focus on training as an investment.   As in the private sector, the ability of organizations to change successfully in an extremely dynamic environment is directly linked to the tools with which it has equipped its workforce. <BR>

<P>	Give senior executives more tools to manage change and make them accountable for achieving results.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Time and Attendance: Its Days Are Numbered</H1>

The General Accounting Office released new policy guidelines on March 22, 1996 that permit agencies to get rid of sign-in sheets and other time and attendance paperwork.<P>

"No excuses anymore. It's time to change," Vice President told participants at a Reinvention Conference. The requirement that federal workers sign in, he said, "is a "waste and indignity."<P>

<H2>What Went Before</H2>

The Vice President's recommendations in September 1993 called for eliminating labor-intensive time sheets and time cards and using technology to enter payroll data on an exception basis (that is, only reporting the hours you don't work).<P>

A 1995 NPR survey on time and attendance in 26 federal organizations showed that most federal agencies do not have<I> policies</I> that require their employees to sign in and out. Nevertheless, most federal workers still have to do it. "Ironically, agencies offering employees the greatest flexibility in arranging their work schedules are also making most of them sign in and out, especially for employees on alternate work schedules," said NPR staff member Laurie Lyons, who conducted the survey for the Chief Financial Officers Council.<P>

The survey also showed considerable confusion in interpreting governmentwide policies, a profusion of approaches, and many requirements embedded in union contracts that will have to be renegotiated. <P>

<H2>Policy Giver Is Also the Model</H2>

GAO, the agency that released the guidelines, does not require its employees to sign in and out on a daily basis. GAO trusts its employees to complete their scheduled number of hours before leaving at the end of the day. If an employee deviates one hour or more, he or she gets the supervisor's verbal approval.<P>

The new guidelines will permit agencies to establish systems based on this model, including the use of electronic signatures, eliminating the need to keep paper records. The guidelines are on the<A HREF="http://www.npr.gov"> NPR homepage </A>(http://www.npr.gov).  For a copy of the guidelines, call (202) 512-6000. For information, call Barry Grinnell at GAO, (202) 512-9530.<P>

<CENTER>
<H1>What is a Reinvention Lab? </H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
At the forefront of reinvention are the national Reinvention Laboratories -- 250 as of July 1996.
Labs are federal government organizations and activities across the United States that have
volunteered and been recognized to lead the transformation of government into the next century.
At the first Reinvention Lab Conference at Hunt Valley, Maryland, in October 1993, a
Reinvention Lab was defined as:
<P>
<DL>
     <DD><I>... a place that cuts through "red tape," exceeds customer expectations, and unleashes<BR>
     innovations for improvements from its employees.</I>
</DL>
<P>
That definition remains true even today. The Reinvention Labs are pushing the envelope of
change. They are designated to lead the way and set the pace of change. They are asked to
experiment with new processes and new ways of doing business. They are called upon to be
creative and innovative, and radically improve service and performance. They are expected to
show all of us, government and non-government alike, the way to a future, common sense
government that serves the public efficiently and effectively.
<P>
<B>Why Become a Lab?</B><BR>
Why do organizations seek to become Reinvention Labs?  There are essentially two reasons.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    First, organizations and activities that are designated as a national Reinvention
     Laboratories gain additional leverage and utility to help reinvent. The importance of the
     Reinvention Labs to the Vice President, the commitment received from top leadership,
     and the high visibility of Lab initiatives all offer added leverage to help overcome
     barriers, obstacles, and organizational resistance that are normally experienced as part of
     significant change efforts. In essence, the Reinvention Labs are empowered.
<P>
<DD>-    Second, designation as a Reinvention Laboratory fulfills the need to be a pace setter for
     the rest of government -- to be a leader and show the rest of government how "good
     government" is accomplished. 
</DL>
<P>
<B>Expanded Definition</B><BR>
These points are illustrated in a slightly expanded, more descriptive definition of Reinvention
Labs offered by the National Performance Review Task Force:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>Reinvention Laboratories are innovative organizations or activities that are established
     to test or prototype new "reinventing government" initiatives. The reinvention
     laboratories are empowered to begin experimenting with radical new ways of doing
     business, and share their ideas, successes and lessons across government.
</DL>
<P>
The role of the Reinvention Labs is critical as we create a government that works better and costs
less. At the Reinvention Revolution Conference in March 1996, Vice President Gore said:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>"Your role as reinvention labs is absolutely critical as we move forward. You are on the
     front lines. You are learning the most valuable lesson and passing on the answers to
     everyone else. You deal directly with customers and taxpayers, providing assistance and
     carrying out critical government responsibilities."</I>
</DL>
<P>
The Reinvention Labs create an environment where Federal workers and their partners have the
freedom to experiment, and can showcase innovation and results. At this same Conference, Vice
President Gore referred to the Reinvention Labs as our "beacons" who will guide the rest of us to
a new, reinvented, common-sense government.
<P>
<B>When Labs Began</B><BR>
The concept of the Reinvention Labs was born at the very beginning of the National Performance
Review reform initiative. In an April 1, 1993 letter, Vice President Gore asked the heads of heads
of each federal department and agency to "designate two or three programs or units to be
laboratories for reinventing government."  He said that the:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>"... point is to pick a few places where we can immediately unshackle our workers so they
     can re-engineer their work processes to fully accomplish their missions -- places where
     we can fully delegate authority and responsibility, replace regulations with incentives,
     and measure our success by customer satisfaction."</I>
</DL>
<P>
In response to this request, according to NPR Task Force officials, the federal departments and
agencies designated more than 100 Reinvention Laboratories across the country. The Labs
encompassed a wide variety of government programs, processes, systems and concepts to be
reinvented. They began with the full and explicit support of top leadership in each department
and agency. The Labs were to be empowered to lead the process of change in the agencies. For
the most part the Labs were front-line organizations who worked directly with their customers,
understood their requirements, could quickly see the problems in service delivery, and were in
the best position to find and experiment with solutions to those problems. 
<P>
Addressing these initial Labs at the Hunt Valley Reinvention Lab Conference, the Vice President
said,
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>"I see the Reinvention Labs as setting the pace for their agencies, for their departments --
     constantly striving to find new and better ways of doing things, scanning the horizon for
     ways to do jobs better and faster and with the same or even fewer resources.</I>
<P>
<DD><I>And those of you working in these labs will have a special role to play too. You will need
     to continue pushing the envelope. You will need to continue thinking boldly and taking
     risks. Perhaps, most importantly, you'll have to encourage others to take those leaps with
     you."</I>
</DL>
<P>
The Vice President asked the Labs to break down barriers that stand in the way of getting the job
done, to identify and drive out rules and regulations that no longer make sense, and to listen to
customers to find out their needs and requirements of government. 
<P>
<B>Lab Principles</B><BR>
The Hunt Valley Conference identified a number of principles that were projected to be key to
the success of the Reinvention Labs:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>Promote leadership in action. It is vital to the Lab that the agency head take a direct
     and influential role in leading or supporting the lab. The agency head must have a sense
     of ownership, with the Lab treated as an area of special importance to the future of the
     department and Agency. Moreover, the "process owner" must buy in. A Lab will be
     successful only to the extend that the belief and enthusiasm of the person in charge of the
     Labs activities is certain. Also, every member of the Lab must get involved as a valued
     and enthusiastic contributor.
     <P>
     <LI>Create a "win/win" environment. Risk taking has to be encouraged, and a "safe
     harbor" for innovation established. Only by taking risks and seeking opportunities can the
     Reinvention Lab learn and succeed. Also, the Labs need to challenge cumbersome and
     needless rules, regulations, procedures and traditions that stand in the way of superior
     performance and results.
     <P>
     <LI>Celebrate and publicize successes. Spotlight heroes and let people tell their stories.
     This is not only for recognition and publicity, and allows other reinventing organizations
     and activities learn and progress from their experiences, successes, and failures.
     <P>
     <LI>Maximize "doing" and minimize "reporting". Let the Labs spend their time reinventing
     instead of continually reporting on what they are doing. Although the Labs have a
     responsibility to share their experiences, endless progress reporting will detract from the
     reinvention that has to take place.
     <P>
     <LI>Adopt a strategy for long-term change. We need to cross-fertilize and apply Lab
     lessons and innovations within other parts of the department or agency, as well as across
     the rest of government.
</UL>
<P>
<B>What Makes a Lab Different from Other Change Activities?</B><BR>
What makes a Reinvention Lab different from other change activities that occur in an
organization?  The answer is that the Reinvention Lab leverages it support of key leadership and
its visibility to help reinvent, to open doors that are normally closed, to get people to listen and
negotiate who, before, wouldn't let the reinventors into the room. It accomplishes this by:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>obtaining unrelenting leadership commitment.
<P>
     <LI>obtaining endorsement and support throughout the entire chain of command.
<P>
     <LI>becoming an identifiable rallying point for employees, managers, customers and
     stakeholders.
<P>
     <LI>linking clearly to the principles and themes of reinvention.
<P>
     <LI>describing, in clearly understandable terms, visions and plans for radical change.
<P>
     <LI>assuring the vision is mission-driven and customer-focused.
<P>
     <LI>creating an environment that unleashes the innovations of its employees.
<P>
     <LI>setting goals and measuring accomplishments for all to see.
<P>
     <LI>challenging unnecessary rules and regulations.

<B>"Reinvention Is My Responsibility"</B><BR>
As reinvention and the transformation of the federal government is about people, so are the
Reinvention Labs. The dedicated women and men who make up the Labs have all committed to
pledges similar to that signed at the Reinvention Revolution Conference:

<P>

</CENTER>     
<P>     
Being a Reinvention Lab is not easy. It's hard work. As a Lab, cooperation and support are not
handed to you on a silver spoon. The Red Sea of Bureaucracy does not part at your command.
The success in being a Lab means you have to research well the changes you propose, lay out the
issues in an objective manner, communicate your vision in clear and understandable terms, make
your requirements known, be willing to negotiate and find "win/win" solutions, and persevere
through the setbacks, resistance and frustrations you will encounter. Formulate, communicate,
implement, measure, and improve! Only if you work, champion and persevere, is meaningful
change possible. It can happen, and in the case of the Reinvention Labs, it is beginning to
happen.
<P>
<B>GAO Evaluation</B><BR>
 In a March 1996 evaluation of the Reinvention Laboratories, the General Accounting Office
said,
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>"... the reinvention lab effort has produced hundreds of ideas to reengineer work
     processes and improve agencies' performance -- ideas drawn from employees with
     hands-on experience in operating government programs. Many of the labs are addressing
     issues that are at the cutting edge of government management ... more innovations are
     possible in these and other areas as agencies review and rethink their existing work
     process."  (Management Reform: Status of Agency Reinvention Lab Efforts,
     GAO/GGD-96-69)</I>
</DL>
<P>
The Reinvention Laboratories are at the forefront of reinvention and new governance. They have
been given the unprecedented opportunity to lead change within the federal government. And as
duly noted by Vice President Gore, they are succeeding.

<H3>Introduction</H3>

One of the Food and Drug Administrations (FDAs) many responsibilities is assuring that drugs used to treat animals are safe and effective.  The agency has worked hard to ensure the expeditious and predictable review of animal drugs and other related therapeutic products.  However, the overall process of developing a new drug is complex, and a significant period exists between the first introduction of the drug into animals and formal submission to FDA, completion of review by FDA, and approval of the drug for marketing.  The reforms in this proposal address both the process undertaken by the sponsor before the application is submitted to FDA, as well as the review by FDA after the agency has received the application.

<H3>Faster Approvals: the New Animal Drug Reinvention Initiative</H3>

To speed up the drug approval process, FDA is implementing a set of policies that will enable faster approval of new animal drugs.  The new animal drug reinvention initiative will introduce numerous new process changes and programs to create a more streamlined new animal drug application review and approval process.  Although the reforms that comprise this initiative are relatively new, they have been positively received by sponsors.  FDA proposes to re-write the new animal drug application (NADA) regulations to provide timeframe incentives for each step of the new process and thereby further encourage participation.  The reform proposal is detailed below.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>FDA'S Proposal for Reform</H2>
<HR>
<H3>Re-engineering the New Animal Drug Approval Process</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  Historically, FDA has reviewed new animal drug applications using a process that has emphasized centralized coordination of the applications review throughout a project.  FDA has also required the submission of a single application package that included data and other information necessary to address all possible efficacy, human food safety, animal safety, and drug manufacturing questions.   While this system had some advantages -- it ensured a single location for administrative processing and quality control -- it also resulted in delays in application processing.  For example, because the project manager was solely responsible for communication with the sponsor, delays could occur in communicating to the sponsor the results of technical review of a portion of a new animal drug application (NADA).  In addition, even though important scientific issues concerning safety or efficacy were often identified by FDA experts, such discoveries and new-data requests were too often spread out over an extended period, unnecessarily prolonged the total review time.  Furthermore, FDA had no centralized means of tracking all applications under review in the Center, and therefore, no way of monitoring overall review performance and progress.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification: </B> Under this initiative, FDA has begun to introduce numerous new process changes and programs that will enable a more streamlined animal drug application review and approval process, and which would result in less regulatory burden upon industry.
<P>
<B>Implementation of pre-submission conferences:</B>  In a change from past practice, FDA is now encouraging sponsors of new animal drug applications to participate in pre-submission conferences during which FDA and the sponsor discuss in detail what studies are necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug for its intended indications and conditions of use.  The purpose of holding pre-submission conferences is to get agreement between FDA and the sponsor on the studies necessary to obtain approval for the desired drug claims.  To date, these conferences have decreased instances where sponsors conduct studies, but after review, FDA determines that the information is not pivotal in making the final decision on approvability.   This process will eliminate unnecessary studies, save drug companies significant resources, and contribute substantially to more expeditious marketing of new products.
<P>
<B>Implementation of protocol reviews:</B>  FDA has begun to encourage sponsors to submit review protocols for the studies to be conducted in support of a NADA.  Once  FDA agrees to a protocol, it is committed to no "moving targets" unless significant, new scientific issues arise.  These commitments enable FDA reviewers to evaluate studies in a more timely manner, and sponsors to embark on a development plan with a more certain understanding of FDAs requirements.  FDA will propose regulations mandating a timeframe for the agencys completion of its protocol review.  
<P>
<B>New Program of "phased review" of data submissions:</B>  During pre-submission conferences, sponsors are being encouraged by FDA to identify the critical studies and timeframes in their drug-development plans.  FDA will commit to review these studies individually in the sequence most advantageous to the sponsor.  For example, FDA will review a dose-determination study prior to the sponsor conducting trials for efficacy and target animal safety, thus allowing the sponsor to ensure that subsequent research is conducted with the formulations and doses that have been confirmed to be effective.
<P>
<B>Direct review of sponsors technical submissions:</B>  FDA has begun to implement a new approach to submission review in which review responsibilities are decentralized.  Under this approach, each individual conducting a technical review on the submission is responsible for the scientific evaluation and administrative processing of a particular section of a submission, and communication with the sponsor on that particular technical review.  Under the previous system, each animal drug application had a single project manager, who was responsible for parceling out work assignments to technical reviewers and communicating with the sponsor.  The new decentralized system encourages more expeditious reviews and more direct communication between appropriate FDA reviewers and drug sponsors by eliminating the "middle man," which means that the appropriate FDA technical reviewers will now speak directly to the sponsors technical experts.  Although CVM (Center for Veterinary Medicine) senior review managers will maintain oversight of the process, with the assistance of STARS (see below), the resolution of technical questions on one part of the submission will no longer be likely to interfere with the review process for other parts of the submission.
<P>
<B>Utilization of sponsor-monitored methods trials:</B>  In order for a new animal drug to be approved, there must be a practical analytical method available that is capable of detecting residues of the drug in tissue of food-producing animals.  In the past, FDA and sponsor companies had been dependent on government laboratories for evaluation of analytical methods,  which often have higher priorities than evaluation of animal drug analytical methods.  FDA now allows sponsors to contract with private laboratories to conduct methods trials.  FDA evaluates the results of the trials and determines the acceptability of the method.
<P>
<B>New requirements for data quality assurance: </B> FDA has undertaken a program designed to improve the quality of the data contained in animal drug applications.  This program has two parts: (1) a major effort to improve guidance to the animal drug industry regarding quality assurance for data collection, analysis, and reporting and (2) an effort to have sponsors assume greater responsibility for data quality assurance.  In order to implement this program, FDA plans to propose regulations requiring that sponsors certify that NADA data have been subjected to a quality assurance audit.
<P>
<B>Implementation of the Submission Tracking and Reporting Systems (STARS):</B>  In November 1992, FDA started using a new computer system.  This system enables FDA to set prioritized time frames for each submission based on the purpose of the submission and the amount and complexity of the submissions data.  STARS is critical to FDAs ability to monitor the status of pending applications and other files.  Furthermore,  STARS enables FDA to much more efficiently coordinate scientific reviews among individual reviewers and reviewing divisions as the reviews move forward in an interactive process among reviewers and the sponsor.  FDA will propose regulations committing to these prioritized timeframes.
<P>
<B>Updated regulations and guidance documents: </B> Largely due to declining resources, FDA had for some years been unable to review and update existing regulations and guidance documents or to prepare new ones.  Recognizing the value of such documents, especially in the drug development process, FDA has renewed its commitments in this area.   FDA will soon propose regulations for the investigational and new animal drug application processes,  as well as guidance regarding responsibilities of clinical investigators, and manufacturing chemistry issues.  Several more documents are in development, including guidance on efficacy studies for production drugs intended to change carcass quality/leanness, efficacy and target animal safety requirements for anticoccidial, anthelmintic, and mastitis drugs.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  These new initiatives will streamline the NADA approval process.  For example, pre-submission conferences are essentially eliminating what sponsors and others in the animal health industry have referred to as the "moving target," in which FDA specifies the studies necessary for approval in an interative fashion over a protracted period.  Phased review has removed a common bottleneck caused by the fact a sponsor had to wait until all technical sections were reviewed before FDA would render an opinion on the sufficiency of an application.  As a result, the technical section in the application that required the longest review could stymie progress on other sections.  Under phased review, however, sponsors can coordinate submission of each technical section as the work for that section is completed.  In addition, the direct review program, when linked with phased review, has resulted in significantly improved and more interactive communication between sponsor and reviewer, enabling a more efficient and logical review process.
<P>
These changes, while relatively new, have been positively received by sponsors.  Because the reform initiative is presently being implemented, very few applications have been completely reviewed under the initiatives reformed procedures.  However, it is clear from FDAs experience with those applications that have had the final stages of review take place under the reformed procedures, that fewer iterations occur in which FDA must ask for additional data and the sponsor must go back to produce the data.  Elimination of each iteration represents a time savings.  Although only a few NADA approvals have been reviewed under these procedures, the average total time for their review was less than that for applications reviewed the traditional way.  The most recent animal drug approval under this program was issued 22 days after filing -- all of the substantive review having already taken place while the drug was still in testing.
<P>
While drug sponsors are pleased with the added efficiency of the program,  they have expressed concern over the lack of statutory timeframes for review.  Therefore, FDA will propose new regulations for animal drug applications and testing that will provide FDAs commitment to prioritized review timeframes -- all of which will be shorter than the current statutory timeframe of 180 days.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline: </B> All of these program changes are being implemented now by FDA.  Proposed regulations describing the administrative process and FDAs commitment to application-review timeframes will publish in 1997.  Guidelines for study protocol development, clinical investigator guidelines (which include data quality assurance guidelines), and manufacturing chemistry guidelines are expected in late 1997, after publication of the regulations.  Guidelines for efficacy studies for production drugs intended to change carcass quality/leanness are expected before the end of 1997, and guidelines for efficacy and target animal safety requirements for anticoccidial, anthelmintic, and mastitis drugs will be produced in early 1998.

<I>I believe we can bring back common sense and reduce 
 hassle without stripping away safeguards for ourchildren,
 our workers, our families.</I> <BR>

<DD>President Bill Clinton -- February 21, 1995

<P>
<H2 align=center>OVERVIEW</H2>

<P>
<P><H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The Clinton Administration has made reforming the Federal government's
regulatory process a top priority.  Consistent with this commitment, President
Clinton and Vice President Gore asked Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala to assist in meeting this priority by carefully examining the
regulatory requirements of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).

<P>HCFA has taken the President s and Vice President s commitment to
reinventing government and government regulations seriously and is meeting
the challenge.  HCFA has a new customer service focus: we are working in
partnership with the rest of the health care community to institute better, more
common sense ways of operating.  HCFA has reviewed its regulations to
determine which requirements could be reduced or eliminated while assuring
that we continually improve the quality of services to some of America s most
vulnerable populations -- Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  This report
contains the initiatives that have resulted to date from the review of HCFA s
regulations.

<P>
<P><H3>Agency Overview</H3>

<P>The Health Care Financing Administration s primary mission is to assure health
care security for nearly 37 million Medicare beneficiaries and, in partnership
with State governments, another 36 million Medicaid beneficiaries.  HCFA
ensures that program beneficiaries are aware of the services for which they are
eligible and that those services are accessible, meet quality standards, and are
delivered in an efficient manner.  HCFA also ensures that health care providers of 
services meet approved standards and that program funds are used
efficiently.

<P><H3>Regulatory Reform Principles</H3>

<P>Regulatory reform means regulating only when necessary and no more than
needed.  When regulations are issued, they must be the most cost effective,
least intrusive, and most flexible types of regulations that achieve the stated
objectives. This common sense way of regulating is accomplished by working
with our partners, including industry groups and States, and by keeping in touch with the needs of our 
customers.  For HCFA, this means knowing what our beneficiaries want and need, and then working with 
our partners to fulfill and even exceed these expectations.

<P>To guide the regulatory review process, HCFA relied on three basic principles
that help define the Agency s new and improved approach to regulations and
customer service. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Communicate not dictate</B> -- The number one tenet of this principle is to
communicate through listening and consulting, thereby increasing our
understanding of what our customers need, what they like and dislike about our 
programs, and how we can serve them better overall.  This principle says that 
HCFA will consult with our partners and beneficiaries about how our programs 
and policies should improve, instead of dictating such changes to them as has 
been done too often in the past.  When changes are a result of legislative initiatives, 
HCFA will  consult with partners and stakeholders on the full range of implementation 
issues that needs to be addressed.  

<LI><B>Educate rather than inundate</B> -- Top-rate customer service also means making
sure that customers understand our programs and policies.  Providing reams
and reams of information is not enough and probably not effective.  The &quot;new&quot;
HCFA is committed to educating instead of inundating.  This principle ensures
that HCFA will educate our customers by developing effective educational
techniques and disseminating information about how our programs operate
rather than inundating them with information that is difficult to understand and
doesn't speak to their needs.

<LI><B>Innovate more than regulate</B> --  HCFA's regulatory reform and improved
customer service initiatives are driven more by innovation than regulation.  
This means that HCFA is relying upon innovation in program operations and
administration more than regulation to foster improved customer service
capabilities.  For example, by streamlining Medicare claims processing and
information exchange, the Medicare Transaction System will make electronic
interaction with Medicare easier for providers and beneficiaries and will enable 
Medicare contractors to devote more time to customer service activities.  
</UL>
<P><H3>Accomplishments</H3>

<P>During the Clinton Administration, HCFA has improved its regulatory process
to focus on results, not red tape.

<P>In March 1994, HCFA published a regulation that replaced the requirement for
physicians to provide hospitals annually with a signed acknowledgment
concerning penalties for misrepresenting certain information with a one-time
signing requirement at the time a physician is initially granted hospital admitting privileges.  
Almost 24,000 hours of physician time will be saved.  One major medical association 
characterized this change as one that will alleviate the  hassle factor  for physicians 
and an important step toward restoring mutual trust between the Federal Government and the medical profession.

<P>HCFA is totally redesigning its system to pay claims for Medicare services. 
Currently, providers must cope with 9 different claims processing systems
operated by 72 insurance companies at 57 sites.  The development of the
Medicare Transaction System (MTS) will increase control of program
expenditures, simplify administrative operations,  and improve services to
beneficiaries and providers.  This integrated, national system will replace the
diverse existing systems and significantly simplify administrative operations for
beneficiaries, providers, and the Medicare program.  Final contracts for the
analysis, design, development, testing, and implementation of the MTS were
awarded in January and March 1994.

<P>HCFA has re-invented its evaluation of Medicare contractors.  The newly
restructured Medicare contractor performance evaluation establishes Medicare
beneficiaries and medical care providers as integral partners in the evaluation
process.  This new evaluation process, which began October 1, 1994, allows for 
greater flexibility in evaluating Medicare contractor operations and
performance.  

<P>The process for obtaining Medicaid home and community-based services
waivers was simplified and now enables States to offer a wide variety of home
and community-based services as cost-effective alternatives to more expensive
institutional care.  Without this regulatory change, published July 25, 1994,
joint State and Federal efforts to expand opportunities to provide cost-effective
alternatives to institutional care would have been frustrated.  The regulatory
provisions were worked out in collaboration with the States (through the
National Governor s Association).



<H3>Regulatory Reform Initiatives</H3>
<P>
<P>The following proposals are the next major HCFA initiatives to evolve 
from our commitment to the regulatory reform process. 
<OL>
<LI>  Physician Attestation:  Eliminate the physician form required to certify the
accuracy of all diagnosis and procedures before submission for payment by
Medicare.

<LI>  Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments:   Reduce burden and
improve the CLIA system by rewarding good performance by laboratories,
creating incentives for manufacturers to develop more reliable testing
equipment, allowing private organizations that meet certain standards to
accredit laboratories, and using proficiency testing as an outcome measure to
monitor laboratory performance.

<LI>  Outcome Performance Measures:   Change current regulations that focus
solely on requirements for measuring processes, rather than outcomes of care. 
Changes affect:
 <UL>
<LI>Home Health Agency Conditions of Participation
<LI>Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation
<LI>ESRD Facility Conditions of Coverage
<LI>Rules for ESRD Facilities - A Pilot for Good Performers
<LI>Elimination of Personnel Requirements for Excellent ESRD Facilities
</UL>
<LI>  The HCFA-1500 Form:   Require participating Federal Employee Health
Benefit Plan (FEHBP) carriers to use the HCFA-1500 form for physicians  and
other practitioners  claims.  The HCFA-1500 is currently used by physicians
and others to submit claims for reimbursement of health care services under
Medicare.  This change will mean that physicians and other practitioners will be 
able to use a single form to submit claims for many patients -- both Medicare 
beneficiaries and patients enrolled in the FEHBP.  

<LI>  Annual Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review
(PASARR):  Currently, two Federal requirements call for the assessment of
nursing home patients.  This change eliminates the requirement under PASARR that 
mentally ill and mentally retarded nursing home residents are assessed annually.  
Resident assessments and reassessments required under the general nursing home 
requirements ensure that residents  continuing needs are properly evaluated and met.  
The preadmission screening for these residents under PASARR is retained.

<LI>   Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluations: Permit States to
approve nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs offered in
nursing homes.
</OL>
<P><H3>HCFA INITIATIVES</H3>
<OL>
<LI>  Physician Attestation

<P>Background:   Since the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment
system (PPS) was implemented by HCFA in 1984, HCFA regulations have
required physicians to sign an  attestation form  for each Medicare patient
discharged from a hospital. The form certifies the accuracy of the diagnoses and
procedures for each patient.  This information is used to ensure that the correct
coding is on the claim, the correct diagnosis-related group (DRG) can be
assigned, and the proper Medicare payment can be made. 

<P>Feedback from physicians, hospitals, and intermediaries has told us that
obtaining the physician s signature is burdensome and results in billing delays
that hurt hospital cash flow and hinder service to the beneficiary.   Peer Review
Organization (PRO) review of attestations has resulted in less than a 0.01
percent denial rate of sampled claims.  In addition, the improvement in hospital
record keeping and coding sophistication make the hospitals the appropriate
focus for combating fraud and abuse. 

<P>Proposal:  Eliminate the form requirement and instead hold hospitals
responsible for the accuracy of their diagnoses and procedures.  With improved
technology and software coding capabilities, hospitals are more equipped than
ever to combat billing fraud and abuse, the form s original purpose. 

<P>Impact:

<P>Reduces paperwork burden and &quot;hassle&quot; on physicians and hospitals.
Decreases administrative costs for hospitals.
11 million forms will be eliminated.Almost 200,000 hours of physician 
time will be saved. Hospitals will have improved cash flow and reduced 
labor costs by approximately $22,500 per hospital per year.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  HCFA will publish this final regulation by 
September 1, 1995. 

<P>

<LI>  Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments

<P>Background: The Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of
1988 established baseline quality standards that ensure the accuracy, reliability,
and timeliness of laboratory testing.  These requirements are based on the
complexity of the test performed, rather than where the test is performed. 
Compliance with the standards is determined through on-site inspection.

<P>HCFA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which share
responsibility for the CLIA program, continually review ways to reduce the
burden and improve the entire CLIA system.  A flexible survey system that
employs data analysis to target good performers and allow for self-attestation
and off-site review has already been initiated for certain laboratories.  HCFA
has reduced information requirements and eliminated unnecessary paperwork
and has taken steps to reduce personnel requirements.  HCFA also revised and
streamlined the inspection process.  Additional burden reductions are being
undertaken that will virtually eliminate oversight for certain laboratories,
establish performance standards in place of process requirements, and use
information and education as a substitute for sanctions.

<P>Proposal:  
<OL>
<LI>  Waive the routine 2-year survey of users of &quot;black box&quot; technology,
conducting surveys only if there are indications of problems or complaints. 
( Black box  technology refers to simple and easy to use test systems that have
demonstrated accuracy and precision through scientific studies.)  We will
develop and implement criteria for accurate and precise &quot;black box&quot; technology that will be followed to determine if the technology qualifies for waiver of the routine 2-year survey.  A small number of surveys will be conducted to validate the criteria for determining  black box  technology and to assure quality.

<P>Impact:

<P>Creates incentives for manufacturers to develop more reliable testing equipment by stimulating demand for accurate and precise technological testing systems.

<P>Reduces paperwork and costs for providers, especially for physician office
laboratories, as well as reducing costs of program management.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:   Proposed rules will be published in
September 1995.
<P>
<LI> Clarify and expand the waiver criteria and streamline the waiver process so
that CLIA regulations can be waived for more tests.  CLIA requirements will be waived for tests approved for home use by the Food and Drug Administration - - that is, tests that do not require trained personnel. 

<P>Impact:

<P>Decreases burden, especially for physician office laboratories because of less
regulatory oversight.

<P>Increases access to greater variety of tests.  Physician office laboratories may
expand the range of tests they perform without an increase in costs/burden.  

<P>Creates incentives for manufacturers to develop more test systems that meet the clarified waiver criteria and criteria for approval for home use.

<P>Eliminates inspection fees for many of the 60,000 physician offices and other
small laboratories not now waived that decide to perform only tests from the
expanded waiver category.

<P>Many additional laboratories will face lower inspection fees because, while they will continue to perform non-waived tests, many more tests will fall into the expanded waiver category.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:   Proposed regulations will be published in 
September 1995.
<P>
<LI>  Use performance standards and require less frequent on-site inspections
(surveys) of excellent performers.  Private accrediting organizations may be
approved for Federal accrediting status ( deemed status ) when their
accreditation standards are as stringent as CLIA.  Exempt laboratories from
CLIA requirements when the State in which they are located has requirements
equal to or more stringent than CLIA's.  

<P>Impact:

<P>Reduces inspection burdens.

<P>Rewards good performers with fewer inspections.  This is a positive incentive
to improve performance.
  
Offers laboratories oversight by peers by approving private accrediting
organizations for Federal accrediting status.

<P>States with strong licensure programs are being approved for exemption from
CLIA.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:   To date, notices to approve four accrediting
organizations (College of American Pathologists, Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Commission on Office Laboratory
Accreditation, and the American Society of Histocompatibility and
Immunogenetics) and the State of Washington have been published.  Notices
for two additional accrediting organizations and one additional State are
pending.   Final rules to eliminate redundancies or unnecessary requirements for Federal review and approval will be published in  March 1996.
<P>
<LI>  Use proficiency testing (PT) &quot;failures&quot; for education and as an outcome
indicator in laboratory quality.  (PT is testing samples of known values to assess
the accuracy of a laboratory's results.)  Sanctions (for example, loss of
Medicare payment or loss of approval to do testing) are imposed only in cases
of immediate jeopardy or when the laboratory has refused to correct the
problem or has had repeated failures on proficiency testing. 

<P>Impact:

<P>Less intrusive than traditional regulation and oversight.

<P>Allows use of proficiency testing as an outcome measure to monitor laboratory
performance, provides laboratories with feedback on test quality, and as an
incentive to improve performance. 

<P>Minimizes the fear of sanctions in 60,000 non-waived laboratories.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  A proposed rule will be published in March
1996.
</OL>
<P>
<LI>  Outcome Performance Measures

<P>Background:   Medicare, as a purchaser of health care, requires hospitals,
home health agencies (HHAs), and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) facilities
to meet health and safety requirements to participate in the Medicare program. 
Historically, these requirements measure &quot;process&quot; (procedural and
administrative systems as proxies for quality health care) rather than
&quot;outcomes&quot; (evaluations of actual patient care) and the adequacy of quality
management programs.  

<P>HCFA is committed to changing current regulations that focus solely on
requirements for measuring processes.  The Agency realizes that not focusing
on outcome measures results in several inherent problems.  First, regulatory
requirements vary by type of facility and provider even when the services
provided in each facility are the same, creating inequities and inappropriate
incentives.  Second, without outcome measures, there is very little information
available for consumers on the quality of care at a given facility.   Third, by law, HHAs must be surveyed yearly--even though historical data show that this
frequency is excessive for many HHAs and does not improve care.

<P>HCFA is revising regulations for hospitals, home health agencies, and End-
Stage Renal Disease facilities to address these issues, eliminate unnecessary
process requirements, and focus on the outcomes of care.

<P>Proposal:   Eliminate unnecessary process requirements and instead develop
outcomes-based performance standards; collect and analyze patient care data
needed for continuous quality improvement and performance evaluation;
increase consistency of requirements across providers; and ask the customer to
provide input on what the outcome measures should be, and to evaluate the
services they received.  We are seeking legislation to give us flexible survey
cycles.

<P>Impact:

<P>Eliminating unnecessary process requirements for compliance will reduce
compliance and survey burdens and make it possible to focus on actual patient
care.

<P>Educating the consumer will produce a strong, non-regulatory force to improve
quality of care.

<P>Powerful data will be available to regulators and providers. 

<P>Produces savings because providers are free to achieve high quality outcomes in the most cost-effective manner. 


<P>
Outcomes Performance Measures Initiatives

<P>HCFA is currently involved in the following new initiatives that focus on the
concept of  Outcomes Performance Measures  and the consensual approach to
developing regulations. 

<P>Home Health Agency Conditions of Participation:  HCFA is developing
revisions to the Medicare Home Health Agency (HHA) conditions of
participation.  The purpose of the revision is to place greater emphasis on
patient outcomes while reducing the current emphasis on process requirements
(e.g., elaborate professional qualifications and other &quot;paperwork&quot; requirements) and enhancing an HHA's flexibility in meeting patient needs.  The Agency has actively involved home health beneficiaries, providers, physicians, professional organizations (American Association of Retired Persons, National Association for Home Care, American Federation of Home Health Agencies, American Medical Association, Visiting Nurses Association of America, American Academy of Home Care Physicians), States (State Survey and Medicaid Agencies), and intermediaries in order to receive input on developing revisions to the conditions of participation.  A work group of HCFA staff and representatives of Medicare beneficiaries, home health providers, physicians, and State Survey Agencies will develop a Standard Core Assessment Instrument for use in home health care.  The use of this tool is central to HCFA s efforts to place the emphasis of survey and enforcement on patient outcomes.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  HCFA will publish a proposed rule in
September 1996.

<P>Hospital Conditions of Participation:  HCFA is revising the current hospital
conditions of participation to center on the patient, support a cross-functional
approach to patient care, and focus on quality.  In developing these revisions,
HCFA has worked closely with organizations representing hospitals,
practitioners, patients, and States and has already distributed informal pre-
regulatory drafts to approximately 70 outside groups for comment. 

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  HCFA will publish a proposed rule in January
1996.

<P>End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Conditions of Coverage:  HCFA s  ESRD
Conditions of Coverage (COC) have not been comprehensively revised since
their original implementation in the late 1970's.  The current COC are primarily
focused on process-oriented requirements, and do not provide adequate support  
for a modern survey system based on an outcome-oriented approach.  Under the 
current regulation, facilities have a substantial paperwork burden.  As a result, 
revised regulations must be issued to increase facility flexibility and to bring the 
ESRD COC up to current standards of practice in the ESRD
community.  The revised COC will address the outcome-oriented, patient-
centered standards process where appropriate, reflect innovations in the dialysis and 
transplant community, and address new issues such as adequacy of dialysis to ensure 
that the Medicare beneficiary is receiving the most progressive quality of care possible.  
Thus, HCFA s emphasis will be on the total patient experience with dialysis, including 
patient functional well-being and continuous quality improvement.  The revised regulations 
will include development of  performance expectations for the facility that result in quality, 
comprehensive care for the dialysis patient.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  HCFA will publish a proposed rule in March
1996.

<P>Rules for ESRD Facilities - A Pilot for Good Performers:  HCFA is
conducting a pilot project to apply a different, less prescriptive set of rules to
excellent ESRD facilities.  Under the pilot project, an ESRD facility's
performance will be measured using only three key patient care outcome
indicators.  The pilot differs from the current system in three important ways. 
First, these indicators will be used in place of the current certification standards
and surveys will be waived.  Second, the pilot project will focus on helping
facility staff use outcome measures in an ongoing way to improve the care
provided to dialysis patients.  Third, facilities that document sustained
achievement in the outcome indicators over six consecutive months will be
awarded a HCFA certificate of excellence.

<P>The indicators measure the quality of hemodialysis in three areas critical to the
health of the patient:  adequate dialysis, control of anemia, and adequate water
supply.  They will be used by the facilities to monitor the condition of each
dialysis patient and to achieve improvement in the patient's health status.  For
the pilot project, excellence will be identified through a process focused on the
quality indicators.  The process will look at whether facilities have an internal
quality monitoring system, whether the results of such monitoring are
documented, and whether results are sustained.  The facilities that qualify in this 
pilot will have established certain internal quality control mechanisms in order to 
participate.  Routine surveys of these facilities will be waived and HCFA will examine 
other appropriate means of providing regulatory relief for good performers.  Surveys 
will be conducted in response to complaints about the quality of care or if the data indicate a potential serious problem.

<P>Information about project results will be packaged in brochures and newsletters
so that ESRD patients and non-participating ESRD facilities will be aware of
the results.  In this competitive industry,  a successful project will stimulate
many other providers to seek recognition as &quot;EXCELLENT&quot; facilities.

<P>ESRD facilities will be notified of their eligibility to participate and participation will be 
voluntary.  The pilot will be limited to facilities in the States of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Washington.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  Planning for this pilot is underway. 
Regulations to permit this pilot will be published in November 1995.

<P>Elimination of Personnel Requirements:  HCFA is conducting a pilot project
that will evaluate the impact of the elimination of Medicare personnel
requirements for ESRD facilities.  Currently, the Medicare conditions for
coverage for ESRD facilities include fairly detailed specifications for several
types of personnel employed in furnishing ESRD services to Medicare
beneficiaries.  For example, the medical director of the facility must be a
physician, board eligible in internal medicine; the nurse in charge must have 12
months of clinical experience, with 6 months experience with ESRD patients;
the social worker must be master level educated, etc.  Over the years, HCFA
has received comments from the industry both in favor of elimination of the
personnel requirements and in favor of strengthening them.  Those in favor of
relaxing the requirements commonly cite the difficulty rural facilities can face in recruitment 
of personnel with the requisite experience.  They believe that the job does not require the 
level of experience and education prescribed in order to perform adequately.   Those in 
favor of maintaining personnel requirements cite the medical condition of ESRD patients 
as justification for the skills level requirements.  They express concern that if the personnel 
requirements are weakened or eliminated, ESRD facilities, most of which are proprietary 
entities, would hire less experienced and more inexpensive personnel to provide care that is of inferior quality. 

<P>The pilot project would be conducted in concert with another proposed project
establishing new rules for historically good ESRD performers (see above). 
HCFA will collect information regarding the skills level of all personnel
employed by those facilities participating in the project.  Facilities would be
informed that as part of the project, Medicare would not apply any of the
personnel requirements contained in the conditions for coverage.   At the end of 
the two-year project period, HCFA will re-collect information regarding the
education and experience level of all the facility's staff and evaluate the impact
of the changes on predetermined measures of quality of care.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:   Planning for this pilot is underway. 
Regulations to permit this pilot will be published in November 1995.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<LI>  The HCFA-1500 Form

<P>Background:  The HCFA-1500 form is currently used by physicians, other
practitioners, and durable medical equipment suppliers to submit claims for
Medicare reimbursement of health care services.  The HCFA-1500 is also used by 
many other insurers for claims submission.  Although many Federal
programs require the use of the HCFA-1500, use of the form is not required by
the Federal Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP).  Currently, more than a dozen
different forms are used by fee-for-service carriers participating in FEHBP.  In
addition, instructions for the forms vary across programs.

<P>Proposal:   After a phase-in period, the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) will require participating FEHBP carriers to use the HCFA-1500 form
for physicians  and other practitioners  claims. 

<P>Impact:  Physicians will be able to use one form to submit claims for services
provided to many patients.  The number of claims forms that are used will drop
from more than a dozen to one and instructions will be standardized.

<P>Implementation and Timeline:  OPM phase-in of the HCFA-1500 will begin
in January 1996 and will be completed in September 1996.  By the year 2000,
the majority of provider claims will be submitted electronically.
<P>
<LI>  Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASARR) of 
Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded Residents

<P>Background:   Nursing homes under Medicare and Medicaid are currently
required by law to conduct an initial assessment of each resident within 14 days of admission, 
with a reassessment whenever a significant change in condition occurs but in any event at 
least once a year.  In addition, there is a statutory requirement that for persons with serious 
mental illness or mental retardation entering a nursing home, the State is required to conduct: 
(1) a preadmission screening to assure that the individual is being appropriately placed in a nursing 
home, and (2) an annual reassessment to assure that the patient continues to be appropriately diagnosed and treated.
 
Proposed Solution:  Legislation would be proposed to eliminate the duplicate
annual assessment.  Resident assessments and reassessments required under the general 
nursing home requirements are entirely adequate to assure that
residents  continuing needs are properly assessed and met.  Preadmission
screening, which deters inappropriate admissions, would continue.
 
Impact:  By eliminating the redundant annual PASARR reassessment, costly
duplication of effort by States would be reduced and nursing facilities would be relieved of 
intrusive annual inspections.
 
Implementation and Timeline:  Legislation will be proposed.
<P>
<LI>  Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluations

<P>Background:  To assure quality of care in nursing homes, current law prohibits
nursing homes from using nurse aides that have not successfully completed a
training or competency evaluation program.  The statute requires the Secretary
to establish requirements for the approval of nurse aide training and
competency programs.  The law further forces States to prohibit, for a period of
two years, nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs operated by or in nursing 
homes that were subject to an extended survey or partial extended survey or certain other sanctions.  
(Extended or partial extended surveys are conducted as more intensive follow-up investigations 
after a routine survey has demonstrated that a facility is furnishing substandard care.)

<P>When a facility's program has been disapproved, the facility may not even be the site of an 
aide program conducted by others during the time that the two-year penalty is imposed.  
The prohibition on approval of nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs 
causes a special problem for rural nursing homes where a community college or other training 
facility may be inaccessible to nurse aides.  Rural facilities can face a serious shortage of 
trained and competent staff due to the expense and inconvenience of sending prospective 
aides to remote locations.  Alternative training programs may not be available.

<P>Proposed Solution:  Specify that a State could choose to approve a nurse aide
training and competency evaluation program offered in (but not by) a nursing
home subject to an extended or partial extended survey or certain other
sanctions if the State determines that there is no other nurse aide training and
competency evaluation program offered within a viable distance.  States would
be required to provide ongoing oversight of these programs in the interest of
patient health and safety.

<P>Impact:  This proposal would safeguard the availability of nursing homes
which might otherwise stop participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs as a result of losing a training programs' approval.  It would also
make it easier for nurse aides to obtain the training they need to provide quality
services to our beneficiaries.

<P>Implementation and Timeline: Legislation will be proposed.
</OL>

<P><H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>Under President Clinton's leadership, HCFA has made communication,
cooperation, and partnership the guiding principles of the regulatory process,
replacing the adversarial environment that often existed in the past.  At a time
when the American health care system is undergoing dramatic changes, HCFA
is committed to putting the Federal government s customers  -- the American
people -- first.  We are pleased to report that the initiatives described in this
report represent just the beginning phases of  HCFA s ongoing work on
regulatory relief.

<H1>REINVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION</H1>

<H3><A NAME=overview>OVERVIEW</A></H3>

<P>&quot;Do we need more common sense and fairness in our regulations?
You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide
safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up
toxic waste dumps. And we ought to do it.&quot;<BR>

President Clinton<BR>
State of the Union Address; January 24, 1995<BR>

<H3><A NAME=intro>Introduction</A></H3>

<P>     We are in the midst of a critical transitional period for our nation's environmental policy. The modern era of environmental protection began in 1970 with the first Earth Day, the passage of landmark legislation, and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. We have accomplished much in 25 years to protect the health of our people and preserve natural treasures for future generations. But much remains to be done.

<P>     It is time to draw upon the lessons we have learned over the last 25 years to reinvent environmental protection for the 21st century. We have learned that the American people are deeply committed to a healthy environment for their children and communities. We have learned that pollution is often a sign of economic inefficiency and business can improve profits by preventing it. We have learned that better decisions result from
a collaborative process with people working together, than from an adversarial one that pits them against each other. And we have learned that regulations that provide flexibility -- but require accountability -- can provide greater protection at a lower cost.

<P>     The American people expect and deserve clean air to breathe,  clean water to drink, a safe food supply and safe places to live, work and play for themselves and for future generations. The Clinton/Gore Administration is committed to providing that
protection in a common sense, cost effective manner.

<P>     This report contains a comprehensive set of 25 High Priority Actions that will substantially improve the existing regulatory system, and take significant steps toward a new and better environmental management system for the 21st century.


<H3><A NAME=25years>25 Years of Progress </A></H3>

<P>     Since the first Earth Day almost 25 years ago, the American people have enjoyed dramatic improvements in public health, worker safety, and the natural environment. We have taken lead out of gasoline and paint. We have virtually eliminated direct
discharge of raw sewage into the nation's water. We have banned DDT and other dangerous and persistent pesticides. Because of these and other actions, lead levels in the average American's bloodstream have dropped by 25 percent since 1976, millions of
Americans can now fish and swim in formerly polluted waters, and the bald eagle -- once close to extinction -- has been removed from the list of endangered species. Improvements in the quality of our air, water, and land represent investments in the future
that will pay dividends for generations to come. But, for all the progress we have made, serious environmental problems remain. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>   Forty percent of our rivers and lakes still do not fully meet water quality standards;

<LI>     54 million Americans - one in five - still live in areas where the air does not meet public health standards; and

<LI>     We are witnessing increases of asthma, breast cancer and other illnesses that may be related to environmental pollution.
</UL>
<P>     It is clear that we have not finished the job. We must build on the successes of the past to construct a framework for continued success in the future. Many of the successes achieved thus far have been based on &quot;end-of-the-pipe,&quot; &quot;command-and-control&quot; approaches. Under this system, Federal and state governments have set standards, issued permits for pollutant discharges, and then inspected, monitored and enforced the standards set for each environmental statute. By regulating emission sources to the air, water, and land, we have addressed many of the obvious environmental problems. 

<P>     But as we achieved these successes, we learned a great deal about the limitations of &quot;command-and-control.&quot; Prescriptive regulations can be inflexible, resulting in costly actions that defy common sense by requiring greater costs for smaller returns.
This approach can discourage technological innovation that can lower the costs of regulation or achieve environmental benefits beyond compliance. Prescriptive regulation is often less effective in addressing some of the more diffuse sources of pollution that we will face in the years ahead.

<P>     We have seen both the value and the limitations of &quot;command-and-control&quot; regulation and end-of-pipe strategies. They will remain possible policy options to be chosen if they are the most efficient, effective -- or only -- solutions to future environmental problems. But we also know that we must expand available policy tools to include new and innovative ways to achieve greater levels of environmental protection at a lower
cost. 

<P>     For example, we have learned that setting &quot;performance standards&quot; and allowing the regulated community to find the best way to meet them can get results cheaper and quicker -- and cleaner -- than mandating design standards or specific technologies. We can promote both lower-cost environmental protection and innovation in pollution control and prevention technology. Using performance standards along with economic
incentives encourages innovation. The lowest-cost and most effective strategies earn a greater return in the marketplace. Accountability and responsibility must accompany this increased flexibility so our citizens have confidence that our environmental goals are, in fact, being met.

<P>     We have also learned that a healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand-in-hand. This growing awareness is demonstrated by the strong support that the concept of sustainable development has received from both industry and
environmentalists across the country and around the world. Our economic and our environmental goals must be mutually reinforcing to produce both jobs and environmental quality.

<P>     We have learned that the adversarial approach that has often characterized our environmental system precludes opportunities for creative solutions that a more collaborative system might encourage. When decision-making is shared, people can bridge differences, find common ground, and identify new solutions. To reinvent environmental protection, we must first build trust among traditional adversaries.

<P>     We have certainly learned that Washington, D.C. is not the source of all the answers. There is growing support for sharing decision-making by shifting more authority -- and responsibility -- from the Federal government to states, tribes and local communities.

<P>     Drawing upon the lessons of the last 25 years, the Clinton/Gore Administration is committed to reinventing our environmental protection system. This is a positive effort to build upon the strengths of the current system, while overcoming its limitations. We will reform the system, not undermine it. We will bring people together in support of reform, rather than further polarizing a debate that has been polarized for too long already.

<P>     In tackling this challenge, we are guided by a commitment to the progress of the last 25 years, a vision for the next 25 years, a set of 10 principles, and the knowledge that the American people want common sense protection of public health and the environment.
<P>

                                                                                                        
<H3><A NAME=vision>A Vision for the Next 25 Years</A></H3>

<P>     We envision a 21st century America in which healthy and economically secure people breathe clean air, drink clean water, eat safe food, and live, work and play in clean and safe communities.

<P>     We envision a 21st century America in which economic incentives, environmental incentives, and technological innovation are aligned so that economic growth improves -rather than diminishes -- environmental quality.

<P>     In the next century, environmental protection must be driven by clear and measurable national goals. Economic, environmental, and social goals must be integrated so policies are mutually supportive, not conflicting. Performance will be measured by achieving real results in the real world, not simply by adhering to procedures.

<P>     We must set environmental standards with full public participation. We must encourage innovation by providing flexibility with an industry-by-industry, place-by-place approach
to achieving standards, building on the work begun in the Common Sense Initiative. But we will require accountability that such standards be met. Rather than focusing on pollutant-by-pollutant approaches, attention must shift to integrated strategies for
whole facilities, whole economic sectors, and whole communities.

<P>     We must employ an inclusive decision-making process that will provide states, tribes, communities, businesses and individual citizens the opportunity to participate. In particular, low-income and minority citizens must have a meaningful voice in decisions that affect their lives. But in addition to providing opportunity, we must encourage individuals, businesses, and governments to accept their responsibility for environmental stewardship.

<P>     The power of information will be critical to the success of this new system. Better information will allow businesses to identify and eliminate inefficiencies that create pollution and reduce profits. Better information will enable government to
avoid &quot;one size fits all&quot; approaches and efficiently tailor solutions to problems. Better information will allow citizens to participate effectively in decisions that affect their families and communities.
<P>     
      This new management system will require everyone to accept new roles and responsibilities. Individuals will have new responsibilities as consumers and as participants in local decision-making. Businesses will make environmental protection a
strategic consideration that will be designed into their products and services, not considered after the fact. State, tribal, and local governments will serve as full partners in the development and implementation of policies to achieve national goals. EPA
will become a partner providing information and research to empower local decision-makers.
<P>


<H3><A NAME=reinvent>Reinvention Yes, Rollback No</A></H3>

<P>     How do we attain this vision of the future? The 25 High Priority Actions assembled in this report provide the road map to  reach our vision. The first set of Actions, listed under the heading &quot;Improvements to the Current System,&quot; are examples of immediate steps to fix problems associated with today's regulatory structure. Additional actions will be identified in a June 1 report to the President following a comprehensive review of all existing regulations. It will recommend eliminating obsolete or unnecessary requirements.

<P>     But we can't be satisfied with simply improving elements of a regulatory system that has evolved piece-by-piece over 25 years. By implementing the second set of Actions included under the heading &quot;Building Blocks for a New System,&quot; we will provide the flexibility to test alternative strategies to achieve environmental goals. The most notable of these initiatives is Project XL (page 14). This program will give a limited number of responsible companies the opportunity to demonstrate excellence and leadership. They will be given the flexibility to develop alternative strategies that will replace current regulatory requirements, while producing even greater environmental benefits.

<P>     The Clinton/Gore Administration is committed to reinventing environmental protection so it will protect more and cost less. But we are not starting from scratch. In the last two years, the Administration has made tremendous progress in adopting common sense reforms to our environmental regulatory system (See Appendix C). We have spearheaded a new, cleaner, cheaper and smarter direction for environmental protection. In the year ahead, we will continue our progress through the ambitious agenda contained in this report.

<P>     But let no one misunderstand us. Our effort to reinvent environmental regulation does not imply compromise on the public health and environmental protection goals to be achieved. While increased flexibility is a central principle of our reinvention effort, flexibility is not a codeword for loophole. Those who abuse this new flexibility will find the traditional tools still at hand to enforce the law.

<P>     The American people, in poll after poll, cite their determination to achieve high standards of environmental quality. This Administration shares that commitment. We will oppose those who would undercut protection of public health and the environment under the guise of &quot;regulatory relief.&quot; America does not need dirtier air or dirtier water. The historic protection we have achieved over the last 25 years must be maintained, sustaining the promise of a clean and healthy environment that has been made and renewed by almost every President since Teddy Roosevelt. We will work with the new Congress whenever possible, but we will not go backwards. Reinvention yes, rollback no.

<OL>
<LI> Protecting public health and the environment are important national goals, and individuals, businesses and government must take responsibility for the impact of their actions. 

<LI> Regulation must be designed to achieve environmental goals in a manner that minimizes costs to individuals, businesses, and other levels of government.

<LI> Environmental regulations must be performance-based, providing maximum flexibility in the means of achieving our environmental goals, but requiring accountability for the results.

<LI> Preventing pollution, not just controlling or cleaning it up, is preferred.

<LI> Market incentives should be used to achieve environmental goals, whenever appropriate. 

<LI> Environmental regulation should be based on the best science and economics, subject to expert and public scrutiny, and grounded in values Americans share.

<LI> Government regulations must be understandable to those who are affected by them.

<LI> Decision making should be collaborative, not adversarial, and decision makers must inform and involve those who must live with the decisions.
 
<LI> Federal, state, tribal and local governments must work as artners to achieve common environmental goals, with non-federal partners taking the lead when appropriate.

<LI> No citizen should be subjected to unjust or disproportionate nvironmental impacts.

<P>
<H3><A NAME=high>25 HIGH PRIORITY ACTIONS</A></H3>

<P>     &quot;We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make today will determine whether we leave to future generations an attractive, livable world or an ever-escalating series of   
problems.  More than ever, we must work vigorously to advance the twin goals of environmental protection and economic growth.&quot;

<DD>         Vice President Gore<BR>
<DD>          July 15, 1994

<P>     Our strategy to reinvent environmental protection will proceed on two tracks that will converge in the future to produce a new era of cleaner, cheaper, and smarter environmental management. The first track is a set of High Priority Actions targeted to fixing problems with today's regulatory programs. These actions demonstrate our commitment to providing flexibility, sparking innovation, and requiring accountability; to cutting red tape; to encouraging collaboration; and to focussing upon achieving environmental results in local communities, rather than adherence to bureaucratic procedures in Washington.

<P>     The second track is a set of High Priority Actions designed to develop innovative alternatives to the current regulatory system. We will enter into partnerships with businesses, environmentalists, states and communities to test alternative management strategies for single facilities, industrial sectors, or geographic areas. The knowledge gained from such bold experimentation will lay the groundwork for developing a new environmental management system for the 21st century.

<P>     This dual strategy is a comprehensive approach to continually improving our environmental management system -- aimed at our twin goals of enhanced environmental protection and vibrant economic growth. One-page descriptions of these 25 High Priority Actions can be found in Appendix A. Appendix B contains a set of Other Significant Actions. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME=improvements>IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM</A></H3>

<B><A NAME=performance>Performance and Market-based Regulations </A></B>
  
     Regulatory policies that rely on performance standards in concert with market-based incentives greatly enhance cost-effectiveness and innovation, by encouraging the lowest cost and most innovative compliance strategies.
<OL>
<LI> <B> Open-market air emissions trading.</B> EPA will issue anemissions trading rule for smog-creating pollutants that will allow states to obtain automatic approval for open market trading of emission credits with accountability for quantified results.  Expanding use of market trading on a local and regional level will give companies broad flexibility to find lowest cost approaches to emission reductions. The rule will encourage experimentation with new trading options, while enabling states to pursue more quickly allowance-based cap systems, which are already under development in some areas.

<LI>   <B>Effluent trading in watersheds.</B> EPA will place top priority on promoting use of effluent trading to achieve water quality standards (e.g., establishing a framework for different types of effluent trading, issuing policy guidance for permit writers, and providing technical assistance). Trading can be used to achieve higher water quality in watersheds at lower cost than inflexible discharge requirements for individual sources.

<P>
<B><A NAME=setting>Setting Priorities based on Sound Science </A></B>

<P>     Sound and credible environment decisionmaking depends on good science and good data.  When hazards are understood and risks have been fully assessed, remedies can be crafted with precision. Twenty-five years ago, little was known about environmental hazards and far less about the risks they posed.  Through the years, we have considered both the hazards and how best to assess the resulting risks. EPA must remain at the
cutting edge of risk assessment and ensure independent peer review of the science used in regulatory decisions to mitigate risk in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

<LI><B>  Refocus RCRA on high-risk wastes.</B> The regulation of hazardous wastes will be reformed so that: low-risk wastes exit the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act hazardous waste system; states are allowed latitude in designing management requirements for low-risk, high-volume wastes generated during environmental cleanup operations; and, a new &quot;common-sense&quot; definition of solid waste will be developed to simplify industry         compliance with RCRA rules.

<LI>   <B>Refocus drinking water treatment requirements on highest health risks.</B> EPA will reorder its priorities for drinking water regulations based on a careful analysis of public health risks and discussions with stakeholders. While working on this realignment, EPA will pursue a postponement of court-ordered deadlines for drinking water regulations. Additionally, EPA will boost support for voluntary efforts to immediately reduce risks through improved management of water treatment facilities and tailor drinking water monitoring requirements to reflect local contaminant hreats.

<LI> <B> Expand use of risk assessment in local communities.</B> EPA  has sponsored the development of computer software that allows non-specialists to conduct simple risk assessments. As part of an expanded risk training  program, EPA will provide (at cost) this computer program to local governments, small businesses, and local citizens groups. This tool will allow estimates of exposures and human health risks on a site-specific basis. Broad availability to training and access to risk assessment tools and data bases will increase public understanding of risk assessment and empower citizens to participate in environmental decisions in  an informed manner.

<P>
<B><A NAME=building>Building Partnerships</A> </B>

<P>     No one has a greater interest in local environmental decisions than the people who are affected by them. States, tribes and communities are anxious for greater autonomy and responsibility for results. EPA is taking an activist role in moving environmental decisions and accountability to the level closest to the problem -- be it state, tribal, or local. A major part of achieving a shift in authority is building the capacity at the state and local levels to solve local problems. Upon enactment of necessary legislation, EPA will vigorously pursue:

<LI>   <B>Flexible funding for states and tribes.</B>  EPA will provide an option for state and tribal governments to combine their existing grant funds to reduce administrative burdens and improve environmental performance. Under these Performance Partnership Grants, states and tribes will be able to target funds to meet their specific needs, as long as they are consistent with environmental requirements. These grants would be subject to performance criteria
negotiated between the EPA Administrator and the grant recipients.

<LI> <B>  Sustainable Development Challenge Grants.</B> This new competitive action grant would prompt local formulation of comprehensive, place-based management connecting sustainable economic development with sound environmental practices.  Within legislatively set national objectives, stakeholders will be challenged to produce coordinated programs, using the action grant to mobilize, organize and attract community and private sector participation. A successful application would demonstrate a high level of stakeholder involvement, and availability of other sources of funds. Recipients would be expected to leverage direct private sector investment in place-based environmental protection.

<LI>   <B>Regulatory negotiation and consensus-based rulemaking.</B>  EPA will review all rules to identify candidates for negotiated rulemaking -- a process that involves all     stakeholders in developing agreement on how best to regulate. Additionally, the Common Sense Initiative process will be used to identify regulations that can be developed through negotiation and consensus.
<P>
<B><A NAME=cutting>Cutting Red Tape</A></B>

<P>          Continuing the work started under Vice President Gore's National Performance Review, EPA will search out opportunities to simplify and reduce paperwork, including up front during the permitting process, and in recordkeeping and reporting. By June of this year, EPA will review all of its regulations and identify those that should be eliminated or simplified. These actions will preserve essential data needed to measure environmental results and determine compliance with the law, but will eliminate low-value requirements. The three examples below illustrate EPA's commitment to eliminating red tape by reducing paperwork, simplifying reporting, and consolidating rules for easier understanding.

<LI>  <B> 25% reduction in paperwork.</B> EPA will reduce existing  reporting and recordkeeping burden hours by 25% beginning with local governments and small businesses.  Initiatives already underway include expanded use of electronic reporting and recordkeeping. EPA will meet extensively with industry, states, and other interested
groups to identify ways of minimizing reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

<LI> <B> One-Stop emission reports.</B> EPA will create a consolidated system for routine emission reporting to the Agency, which will substantially reduce the multitude of reporting forms for different kinds of pollutant discharges from one facility. Given the
magnitude of this change and the logistics involved, consolidated reporting will begin with pilot programs in coordination with states. Based on the experience gained, we will apply the &quot;one-stop&quot; approach more broadly.

<LI>  <B>Consolidated federal air rules (one-industry -- one rule).</B> EPA will work with key industries, beginning with the chemical industry, to eliminate conflicting  and overlapping federal air compliance requirements. Deleting duplicative and confusing regulations will result in increased understanding by industry about emission limits and monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and will reduce compliance costs -- with no measurable loss of environmental protection. Subsequently, consolidation for other media will be undertaken, based on experience gained with air rules.

<P>    <B><A NAME=better> Better Accountability Compliance and Enforcement.</A></B> While environmental requirements can and will be made more flexible and cost effective, the public will continue to expect compliance with the law and accountability for results. We will encourage good actors and provide incentives for compliance while preserving a level playing field and deterring violations through targeted enforcement actions. We will encourage compliance through incentives for self-policing, including penalty reductions and testing of third-party auditing and self certification, and we will provide more effective assistance to small businesses seeking to comply with environmental regulations. We will maintain the level playing field through aggressive enforcement that targets the highest risks and most significant noncompliance problems. Many of these initiatives will be coordinated through EPA's new Environmental Leadership
Program.


<LI> <B>Risk-based enforcement.</B> EPA will target enforcement   actions against significant violations that present the greatest risks to human health and the environment. This will require development of tools that allow analysis of risk as well as patterns of violations among corporations and facilities within a particular sector, and making this information more publicly available.

<LI> <B> Compliance incentives for small businesses and communities.</B> The nation will enjoy greater environmental protection if responsible small businesses and small communities who volunteer to comply with environmental regulations can access compliance assistance without fear of fines and penalties. Thus, EPA will provide up to 180 days for small businesses to correct violations identified through federal or state technical assistance programs. A similar approach will be used for small
communities.

<LI> <B>Small business compliance assistance centers. </B>EPA will develop national customer centers for six small business sectors (including printing, metal finishing, auto service stations) that face multiple environmental requirements. The centers will support trade associations and state small business associations through plain-English guides to compliance, electronic access to information linking pollution prevention and compliance opportunities, and by cutting paperwork and consolidating reporting for the affected industries.

<LI> <B> Incentives for auditing, disclosure and correction.</B> To reward today's responsible companies and eliminate costly litigation and red tape, EPA will provide incentives through reduced penalties for companies that disclose and promptly correct violations -- except for criminal violations, imminent and substantial endangerment, or repeat violations.

<LI><B>  Self certification. </B>Compliance through self certification can reduce the reporting burden for those environmental requirements not associated with emissions or risk data. EPA will develop a self certification program for pesticide registrants, and then expand self certification into other program areas.


<P>
<B><A NAME=power>The Power of Information </A></B>
          

<P>Quality information is central to all aspects of environmental decisionmaking. Government, businesses, and citizens need information about prevailing and projected environmental conditions and trends; about the effects of pollution; about the success of mitigation strategies; and about costs and benefits of these strategies. Businesses need quality information to identify opportunities to prevent pollution and save money. Citizens need access to information to participate in decision-making in a meaningful and informed manner. Alternative performance-based systems of environmental protection -- such as facility-, sector-, and community-based approaches -- can only succeed if high quality information is available and can be easily accessed.

<LI> <B> Public electronic access.</B> EPA will significantly expand its existing programs (e.g., Public Information Center, hotlines) to make information from all EPA programs available through Internet and other electronic means that many Americans can access directly from their homes, schools and libraries.

<LI> <B> Center for environmental information and statistics.</B> EPA will administratively establish a new Agency-wide center charged with assessing, consolidating and disseminating information. The center will sense multiple and diverse stakeholders -- providing products that respond to the expressed needs of its customers.

<P>The center will commission an independent study to evaluate the full range of data needs (including additional data as well as unnecessary data elements that are currently collected).  EPA data management systems and technological improvements that can increase efficiency and access will also be addressed.


<P>                   <B><A NAME=blocks>BUILDING BLOCKS FOR A NEW SYSTEM</A></B>

<P>     It isn't enough to focus on improving the current regulatory system. Incremental change alone will never get us where we ultimately need to be. As we move toward a new century, it is imperative that we challenge ourselves to step outside the
context of the established way of doing things to identify new and innovative means to achieve our goals. The High Priority Actions that follow do just that. They will test the building blocks for a new way to ensure both a vibrant economy and a
healthy environment. By providing flexibility -- with accountability -- we will spark technological innovations that will demonstrate that economic and environmental goals can be achieved simultaneously. The knowledge gained from this bold experimentation will allow us to leapfrog past the limitations of the current system to create a new environmental management system for the 21st century.

<P>
<P><B><A NAME=alternative>Alternative Performance-based Strategies</A> </B>

<P>     EPA has developed a coordinated series of demonstration projects designed to provide the opportunity to implement alternative management strategies for facilities, industrial
sectors, communities, and federal agencies. These projects will provide environmental managers the flexibility to employ technological innovation to achieve environmental goals beyond what the law requires, while requiring accountability for performance. These projects will also encourage collaborative decision-making with increased citizen involvement. EPA will sponsor the following demonstration projects.

<LI> <B>Project XL.</B> This project is a critical component of the Administration's effort to reinvent regulation. In partnership with the states, the Administrator will provide a limited number of responsible companies the opportunity to demonstrate excellence and leadership.

<P>They will be given the flexibility to replace the requirements of the current system at specific facilities with an alternative strategy developed by the company if certain conditions are met: (a) the alternative strategy must produce environmental performance superior to that which would be achieved by full compliance with current laws and regulations; (b) the alternative strategies must be &quot;transparent&quot; so that citizens can examine assumptions and track progress toward meeting promised results; (c) the alternative strategy must not create worker safety or environmental justice problems; (d) the alternative strategy must enjoy the support of the community surrounding the facility; and (e) the alternative strategy must be enforceable.   


<LI> <B> Alternative strategies for sectors.</B> Through the use of industry covenants and other forms of enforceable agreements, EPA and several industries will demonstrate how adjustments and modifications in environmental regulatory requirements can achieve more cost-effective environmental results. The industries involved in the Common Sense Initiative will provide the first opportunities to test this approach.

<LI><B> Alternative strategies for communities.</B> EPA will join with states and communities, and perhaps other federal agencies, to conduct pilot projects that will demonstrate  and assess the merits of community-designed and directed strategies for achieving environmental and economic goals. The pilots will be undertaken with communities that are seeking innovative alternatives that promise greater efficiency and effectiveness than current approaches, as well as with communities that are grappling with limited ability to meet current regulatory requirements. The pilots will apply, in a geographic area, the concepts contained in the facility and sector projects, and will build on the Administration's Empowerment Zone and Ecosystem Management Initiatives. These pilots will integrate the mutually supportive goals of economic development and environmental protection at the community level with  full public participation. 

<LI> <B> Alternative strategies for agencies.</B> EPA will work with other federal agencies that have environmental responsibilities to ensure that their programs achieve environmental results in the most cost-effective manner, while eliminating needless bureaucratic procedures. The initial pilot in this effort will focus on two to four Department of Defense facilities. EPA and DoD will enter into a memorandum of understanding to define performance goals and jointly devise an optimal approach to achieve those goals. The approach will combine pollution prevention, compliance and technology research projects.
<P>

<B><A NAME=new>New Tools for Government and Industry </A></B>

<P>     In addition to sponsoring alternative strategy pilot programs, EPA will place increased emphasis on developing new management tools for government and industry to utilize in
implementing new environmental management systems.

<LI>  <B>Third-party audits for industry compliance.</B> One approach for streamlining compliance oversight is to use independent, certified, private sector firms to audit industry performance. The Environmental Leadership pilot program, with input from environmental groups, industry and states, will evaluate criteria for third-party audits which assure the public that environmental requirements are being met and violations disclosed and promptly corrected.

<LI>  <B>Multi-media permitting.</B> EPA will conduct several demonstrations of multi-media (&quot;one-stop&quot;) permits. These permits will address all releases and use performance based approaches to assure comprehensive environmental protection, encourage pollution prevention, minimize duplication and delay, and. allow facility managers to use lowest-cost solutions.

<LI>  <B>Design for Environment -- green chemistry challenge.</B> EPA proposes that the agency and the chemical industry jointly sponsor national awards for companies that develop pollution prevention processes for chemical production and use. Major targets will be using renewable resources for chemical production, substituting solvents that do not contribute to air pollution, and designing new chemicals and chemical processes that are more safely made and that are safe for the environment.

<OL>
<P><B><LI> Open-market air emission trading</B>

<P>Action: Establish an open trading market that will allow for attainment of the ozone air quality standard at far less cost.

<P>Background: Emissions trading is a way of reducing pollutant emissions to the environment by applying pollution reduction measures at the places where reductions are most cost effective.  A facility can avoid costly compliance measures by reducing
emissions at points where it is most cost effective to do so, and not apply controls where costs are exorbitant, so long as equivalent or greater reductions are made.

<P>The current ozone control program has focused on a combination of technology-based mandatory measures and State plans that historically have discouraged flexible emission trading programs.  In response, EPA has already issued regulations and guidance to
encourage development of economic incentive programs, helped develop an emissions trading market in southern California, and sponsored demonstration projects in the Northeast and elsewhere.

<P>We now believe we have enough experience with trading concepts to provide clear EPA positions that would encourage economic approaches while ensuring equal or better environmental results.  EPA's issuance of a generic trading rule would go a long way
towards persuading states to adopt such measures.  Description: EPA will issue a generic trading rule for ozone-creating pollutants (volatile organic compounds and
nitrogen oxides) that will provide far more flexibility than ever before for companies to trade emission credits without prior state or federal approval.

<P>Any State that adopts an identical rule will receive automatic EPA approval. Once in the state plan, companies may freely engage in trades without prior regulatory agency approval as long as emissions tracking and accountability protocols are followed in
accordance with the rule.

<P>The guidance provided in this generic rule will also serve to facilitate adoption by states of emissions budget or cap-based trading programs.

<P>Federal leadership in crafting model rules and guidance will permit States to exploit the significant opportunities for market-based programs inherent in the 1990 amendments.
<P>
<B><LI> Effluent trading in watersheds</B>

<P>Action: Implement effluent trading on a national scale as a cost-effective approach for reducing water pollution.

<P>Background: Under the Clean Water Act, &quot;point source&quot; dischargers (industrial and municipal facilities that discharge wastewater through pipes into rivers and streams) are required to reduce pollution to meet water quality standards. Dischargers have
traditionally met these standards uniformly at each discharge pipe.

<P>Under an effluent trading program, a discharger that can reduce pollution below the minimum level required to meet water quality standards can sell its excess pollution reductions to other dischargers within the same watershed. This can have several
desirable effects. First, it allows dischargers to take advantage of the economies of scale and the treatment efficiencies that vary from discharger to discharger; thus, it may reduce the total cost of compliance for all dischargers in the watershed. Second,  it creates an economic incentive for dischargers to go beyond minimum pollution reductions and encourages pollution prevention.   Finally, by encouraging more timely action to reduce pollution,  it may prevent future environmental degradation more effectively
than traditional command-and-control approaches.

<P>Trading programs can also be established for other sources of water pollution, including &quot;nonpoint sources&quot; (e.g., run-off from arms) and &quot;indirect&quot; dischargers (companies whose wastewater is reated by a municipal sewage treatment plant).

<P>Depending upon the type of effluent trading implemented, the cost savings can be considerable. EPA has estimated potential cost savings for three types of effluent trading:

<P>     -  
&#036;611 million to 
&#036;5.6 billion for point source/nonpoint source trading
     -   
&#036;8.4 million to 
&#036;1.9 billion for point source/point source trading
     -   
&#036;658 million to 
&#036;7.5 billion for trading among indirect dischargers

<P>Description: EPA will encourage effluent trading by:

<P>     Establishing a framework promoting different types of effluent trading 

<P>Issuing policy guidance to permit writers confirming EPA support for effluent trading for pollution reduction above technology-based minimum levels Providing technical assistance in preparing analyses of the total amount of permissible pollution in a watershed (the technical cornerstone for water quality analysis and watershed trading)



<P>
<LI> <B>Refocus hazardous waste regulation on high-risk wastes</B>

<P>Action: Better target private industry and government resources toward higher-risk environmental problems related to hazardous waste management.

<P>Background: EPA's hazardous waste regulations have been effective in assuring that hazardous waste is safely treated, stored and disposed of. However, some of these regulations require all hazardous wastes to meet the same management standards and do not tailor standards to the nature or degree of risk posed by particular wastes.

<P>Description: EPA plans to make the following major changes to better focus its hazardous waste regulations on high-risk wastes and reduce impediments to recycling:

<P>Hazardous waste identification rule -- To better align hazardous waste regulatory requirements with the risks being controlled, the Agency will propose a rule this year to allow low-risk listed hazardous wastes to exit the hazardous waste regulatory scheme. This rule has been developed through a multi-stakeholder, consensus-based process.

<P>  Contaminated soil, ground water and surface water -- EPA will allow states greater flexibility in determining the appropriate way to regulate soil, ground water and surface water which is contaminated with relatively small quantities of hazardous waste.
The expense and difficulty of managing high-volume, low-risk wastes as hazardous wastes can impede cleanup.

<P>  &quot;Universal wastes&quot; -- Many discarded batteries, thermostats and pesticides are now regulated as hazardous wastes. Retail outlets and other businesses are reluctant to collect these items for recycling because of the expense and complexity of the regulatory
requirements. EPA will promulgate a rule this year which will significantly reduce regulatory requirements (including paperwork) for retail outlets and other entities that collect these materials for recycling. In the future, EPA and States may include other appropriate hazardous wastes in this special collection scheme.

<P>  &quot;Common-sense&quot; definition of solid waste -- EPA will modify its regulations defining when hazardous materials which are recycled, recovered or reused are &quot;wastes&quot; and thus subject to EPA hazardous waste regulations. The Agency's goal is to reduce
impediments to environmentally sound recycling and to simplify and clarify its regulations. Developed with extensive participation by interested parties, this rule will establish a
simplified regulatory framework for all industries, as well as tailored approaches for selected key industries.

<P>  By April 15, EPA will convene a multi-stakeholder process to identify a legislative package of &quot;rifle shot&quot; reforms to fix provisions of RCRA that result in high costs and marginal environmental benefit. If the group is unable to reach a consensus, the Administration will consider the views of all participants and deliver a reform package to Congress by July 15.               

<P>
<LI> <B> Focus drinking water treatment requirements on highest risks</B>

<P>Action: Focus the EPA drinking water program on the highest risks and cut costs and increase flexibility for states and water suppliers.

<P>Background: The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) required EPA to issue national standards for 83 contaminants in 1989 and 25 additional contaminants every three years thereafter. This regulatory &quot;treadmill&quot; is now widely
recognized as diverting resources from high priority risks to lower priorities. These regulations have had the effect of requiring expensive monitoring, especially for small systems that provide water to the public, and have imposed high oversight
costs on States.

<P>Description: During the SDWA reauthorization effort, the Administration emphasized:

<P>     Targeting regulations on substantial health risks

<P>     Retaining State management of drinking water programs

<P>     Providing funding and technical assistance for small systems that provide drinking 
     water to the public

<P>     Reducing monitoring burdens

<P>     Preventing pollution by effectively protecting drinking water sources

<P>EPA will improve the performance of the drinking water regulatory program -- without the need for legislative changes -- in three areas:

<P>     Establishing priorities for rulemaking based on health  risks. EPA is seeking a delay for all court schedules for drinking water and, based on a reassessment of health risks
posed by contaminants in drinking water and consultation with all stakeholders on regulatory priorities and approaches, EPA will set new priorities and schedules for
drinking water rulemaking.

<P>     Encouraging voluntary treatment. EPA is working with water suppliers and States to develop a voluntary program to improve the treatment of drinking water so as to reduce the occurrence of bacterial and other microbiological pathogens.

<P>     Simplifying monitoring requirements. EPA will streamline monitoring requirements for chemical contaminants in drinking water and allow further &quot;tailoring&quot; of monitoring
based on the existing quality of the drinking water source.

<P>
<LI> <B>Expand use of risk assessment in local communities</B>

<P>Action: Promote risk-based decision making in communities and States by providing training and easy-to-use risk assessment tools.

<P>Background: EPA uses risk assessment in most of its decisions -- from setting standards to clean-up of contamination. However, while some States and communities are proficient in risk assessment, most are not. The general public is not familiar with how risks are assessed, what assumptions are being made, and how they affect the outcome. Simplification of risk assessment methods and development of tools that non-specialists can understand and apply is needed so that risk assessment can be used more broadly as one tool to inform local decisionmaking.

<P>Description: EPA will work with communities and states to identify available tools that meet specific community needs. This project will initially focus on four activities:

<P>     Computer programs -- EPA will make available computer software, including the &quot;Risk Assistant&quot; program, that allows communities to perform simple risk assessments.

<P>     Data bases -- There are a number of data bases, such as the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), that contain information about specific chemicals and that are used in
preparing risk assessments. The combined use of these data bases, community-specific exposure information, and simple risk assessment programs will enable communities to conduct risk assessments. EPA will develop a simple, consolidated user friendly data base (on a CD ROM) that can be supplied to communities at cost.

<P>     Training and information materials -- While the computer program and the data bases will allow risk assessments to be done in a much easier fashion, training and background
 information on risk assessment are also needed. EPA will prepare a set of background documents on risk assessment and a training course on the application of risk assessment
tools.  Ultimately, EPA plans to develop a self teaching course using video and other electronic means.

<P>     Comparative risk techniques -- The comparison of risks involves combining technical aspects of risk assessment with social values. EPA will continue to develop comparative risk approaches, through state and local demonstration projects.

<LI> <B>Flexible funding for states and tribes</B>

<P>Action: Award grants to states and tribes that combine funds from
several EPA grant programs -- to allow flexibility, so that
limited resources can be directed to the most significant
problems.

<P>Background: EPA provides several grants to states and tribes to
assist them in administering environmental protection programs.
In FY 1995 approximately 
&#036;600 million will be awarded to states
and tribes for program implementation of the Clean Air Act
Amendments, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, and other statutes. Funds awarded
in each of these categorical grants are for a specified program
or activity and are subject to specific limits on eligible
activities.

<P>The states and tribes have difficulty integrating programs in a
common sense way, or targeting funds to highest priority
environmental problems. Recognizing this problem, the Agency has
been awarding grants to Indian tribes to conduct planning and to
develop and establish multimedia programs. In FY 1995, EPA is
conducting demonstration projects with four states to enable them
to better coordinate certain activities such as watershed
protection and facility inspections, which are currently
conducted under separate EPA grants. These demonstrations are
being run using existing authority -- which is limited and cannot
be expanded to cover the full range of state and tribal
environmental protection needs.

<P>Description: The Administration will seek legislative authority
for FY 1996 to award Performance Partnership Grants to states and
federally-recognized Indian tribes. If the Agency receives this
authority, Performance Partnership Grants will enable eligible
states and tribes to combine funds which would otherwise be
awarded as categorical grants.

<P>The major benefit of Performance Partnership Grants will be to
improve the ability of states and tribes to integrate programs.
They will afford states and tribes flexibility to focus resources
on the most serious environmental problems. Performance
Partnership Grants will encourage broad intergovernmental
dialogue, and encourage public participation in environmental
decision making.


<LI> <B>Sustainable development challenge grants</B>

<P>Action: Encourage community, business, and government to work
cooperatively to develop flexible, locally-oriented approaches
that link place-based environmental management with sustainable
development and revitalization.

<P>Background: Significant accomplishments to improve the
environment have occurred over the past 20 years. To ensure
continued progress in environmental protection, EPA wants to help
localities develop comprehensive, placed-based management
strategies that relate sustainable economic development with
sound environmental practices. The concept of this pilot grants
program is to challenge communities to produce their own
coordinated programs within legislatively-set national
objectives.

<P>The intent is to spark innovative and sustainable economic
development which is linked to comprehensive ecosystem management
and environmental performance. These grants will provide seed
funding to catalyze formation of a coalition of stakeholders who
will develop and implement a program to comprehensively address
local environmental problems.

<P>Description: Patterned after the Empowerment Zone/Empowerment
Community Initiative, this sustainable development challenge
grant will be a nationwide competition, with awards based on the
proposed project's level of stakeholder involvement, project
funding requirements and the proposal's demonstration of
availability of other sources of funds.

<P>The process will be open to states, regions, or localities. The
application process would include demonstrating the relationship
of the project to a comprehensive, cross-media, environmental
needs assessment of the area, the preparation of which would
necessitate local stakeholder participation and involvement.
Challenge grant recipients must leverage direct private sector
investment in place-based environmental protection. Any variance
from the approved needs assessment would be reviewed at the
regional level. Eligibility for all subsequent challenge grants
will take into account the demonstrated effectiveness of prior
challenge grants.


<P>
<LI><B> Regulatory negotiation and consensus-based rulemaking</B>

<P>Action: Increase the use of regulatory negotiation and other
consensus-based decision processes.

<P>Background: EPA has been a pioneer in the use of consensus-based
decisionmaking to develop regulations. In the most formal of
these consensus-based approaches --regulatory negotiation (&quot;reg
neg&quot;) -- EPA and representatives of all major groups affected by
a particular regulation try to reach agreement on regulatory
requirements. This process not only improves the quality of
rules, but increases public acceptance and minimizes litigation.
Even when full agreement cannot be reached, regulatory
negotiation can help identify issues and options, educate
interested parties and narrow areas of dispute.

<P>Although regulatory negotiation is the most well known
consensus-based procedure for developing rules, EPA has
experimented with other less formal methods to consult with
affected parties, promote useful information exchange, and find
common ground on controversial issues. These range from
continuous policy dialogue to ad hoc discussion forums to Public
meetings and focus groups.

<P>Description: After a number of years of successful
experimentation with regulatory negotiation and other consensus-
based rulemaking tools, EPA will now routinely evaluate the
appropriateness of using consensus-based rulemaking every time it
issues or revises a regulation. By June 1, 1995, EPA will examine
all regulations currently under development and identify
candidates for regulatory negotiation and other forms of
consensus-based decision-making.

<P>The Agency will also seek to expand its use of informal
negotiation in other settings, such as the current practice of
negotiating test rules to determine unknown risks of existing
chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act.


<LI><B>25% reduction in paperwork</B>

<P>Action: By June 1, 1995, identify obsolete, duplicative and
unnecessary monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements
-- with a goal of ultimately reducing existing paperwork burdens
by at least 25%.

<P>Background: Virtually all EPA programs require regulated entities
to undertake environmental monitoring, to maintain records and to
periodically report information to EPA. The information generated
by these requirements is used to determine what pollution
controls are necessary, to ensure compliance with pollution
control requirements, and to obtain information on the impact of
pollution and pollution controls on the environment.

<P>Most of EPA's information collection requirements have been
developed at separate times over many years to meet the needs of
individual environmental programs (e.g., the hazardous waste
program, the water pollution program). As a result, some of the
requirements are not well-coordinated within or across programs
and are duplicative or inconsistent. Some requirements are also
not well-integrated with State programs for collecting
environmental information. Finally, some requirements have not
been reviewed recently to ensure that they are still necessary
and that they reflect the latest developments in monitoring
techniques, environmental management and information collection
technology.

<P>Description: By June 1, 1995, EPA will review all of its
monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting regulations to identify
requirements which are obsolete, duplicative or unnecessary, and
which can be corrected quickly through administrative or
regulatory actions. When this initial review is completed, EPA
will commence rulemaking to make appropriate changes. Throughout
calendar year 1995, EPA will work extensively with States, local
governments, industry and environmental groups to determine other
requirements that should be revised or eliminated and what types
of revisions are necessary. At the end of the year, EPA will
announce a broader program of paperwork reforms that will entail
numerous rule-by-rule revisions.

<P>EPA's ultimate goal is to reduce existing monitoring,
recordkeeping and reporting burdens by at least 25%, giving
special emphasis to requirements imposed on States, localities,
and small business. To attain this goal, EPA plans to fully
examine not only the need for requirements, but also how
essential information can be collected and provided at lowest
cost. Among other things, the Agency will test the use of
&quot;one-stop&quot; reporting (see High Priority Action 9) and explore how
technology (such as electronic data interchange) can be used to
reduce paperwork burdens and improve the timeliness and
usefulness of information received.

<P>
<LI> <B>One-stop emission reports</B>

<P>Action: Consolidate environmental reports and provide &quot;one-stop&quot;
reporting for the regulated community.

<P>Background: Environmental data is collected by EPA and its state
partners under a variety of statutory and regulatory authorities.
This approach is potentially duplicative and burdensome to
industry, and also makes the use of data by the public (and even
by EPA and the states) difficult. New approaches and information
systems are needed that can reduce reporting and paperwork
burdens for industry, foster multimedia and geographic approaches
to solving environmental problems, and provide the public with
meaningful, real-time access to environmental data.

<P>Description: To replace the multitude of reporting forms
currently required for all the different types of pollution
discharged from a single facility, EPA will create a &quot;one-stop&quot;
reporting system for the collection of routine emissions data.
EPA will also provide easy public access to this environmental
information.

<P>Achieving this goal will require a fundamental re-engineering of
how EPA, the states and the regulated community manage
information. Given the magnitude of this change, this initiative
will be developed in stages. Eventually, this new system will
create a common set of basic information for all programs,
starting with unified facility identification information and a
common chemical nomenclature. Pilot projects with the states and
industry will be used to evaluate and refine the &quot;one-stop&quot;
program.

<P>Of course, information such as discharge monitoring and emergency
release reports that are essential components of the compliance
program would continue to be submitted.

<P>The easy public access and consolidated reporting provided by the
one-stop system will improve environmental information management
and save industry, states, municipalities and the federal
government time and money.


<P>
<LI> <B>Consolidated federal air rules</B>

<P>Action: For any single industry, such as the chemical industry,
all Federal air rules will be incorporated into a single rule
with one set of emission limitations, monitoring, recordkeeping
and reporting requirements.

<P>Background: Over the past 25 years, EPA has issued a series of
national air regulations, many of which affect the same facility.
Some facilities are now subject to five or six national rules,
often affecting the same emission points. Each rule has emission
control requirements as well as monitoring, recordkeeping and
reporting requirements.

<P>These requirements may be duplicative, overlapping, or worse --
contradictory. It is often difficult for plant managers to
determine compliance strategies to satisfy all requirements and
for State and local permitting agencies to determine the
applicability of different requirements for permitting purposes.
Resources are often wasted by both industry and states and
localities in &quot;sorting out&quot; and complying with the panoply of
multiple requirements. Moreover, as the Agency continues to issue
new air toxics rules, as mandated by the CAA, the problem is
compounded.

<P>Description: Whenever one of the new air toxics rule is written,
all existing Federal rules applicable to the industry sector will
be reviewed to determine whether their provisions either need to
be eliminated or incorporated into the new rule. Affected
industries will be consulted to identify duplicative and
conflicting provisions and to provide assistance in drafting the
single rule.

<P>The chemical industry has agreed to work with EPA's air programs
to explore this approach. If the approach is successful with the
chemical industry, it will be expanded to air rules for other
industry sectors. EPA will then consider extending this program
to water and waste requirements.

<P><LI><B> Risk-based enforcement</B>

<P>Action: Target enforcement, through a series of coordinated
actions, to violations that present the most serious threats to
human health and the environment.

<P>Background: Enforcement actions are most valuable when they deter
violations that could cause serious harm to the environment or
public health. Directing enforcement actions according to risks
and patterns of noncompliance will make the most effective use of
limited resources. Additionally, reducing inspections of
facilities with good compliance records will free up resources
for the most serious noncompliance and risk problems.

<P>Providing greater access to data about compliance history and
environmental performance will help State programs set
priorities. Additionally, making this information available to
the public will allow communities to track progress and compare
similar facilities. It may also lead to development of objective
environmental performance ratings by private sector
organizations.

<P>Description: To guide EPA enforcement actions by the significance
of the environmental and health risk, EPA will: 

<P>     Require enforcement personnel to calculate the environmental
     benefits of each enforcement case -- beginning this year

<P>     Reduce inspections of wastewater discharges and hazardous
     waste facilities that have outstanding compliance records

<P>     Provide the public with data on compliance history and
     environmental performance for facilities within at least
     five industrial sectors -- by the end of 1995

<P>     Evaluate six risk assessment methodologies, and by
     September, 1995, identify one or more that may be used to
     assess the relative risk of specific facilities based on
     emissions to all environmental media. These methodologies
     will then be submitted for scientific peer review.

<P>
<LI> <B>Compliance Incentives for small businesses and communities</B>

<P>Action: Allow small businesses, which are minor sources of
pollution and which receive compliance assistance, a six-month
grace period to correct violations.

<P>Background: Even small businesses that are minor sources of
pollution may collectively have a substantial impact on the
environment. In order for states to achieve local air and water
quality standards, new ways need to be found to bring these
sources into compliance.

<P>Many small businesses want to be good citizens in their
communities, but need information about how to comply with
environmental requirements. Some are unlikely to ask for help
because they fear possible enforcement action. Many states view
as futile enforcement against small companies that often lack the
ability to pay any significant penalty. States are more
interested in using inspection staff to provide compliance
assistance.

<P>Description: EPA will provide small businesses which are minor
sources of pollution a grace period of up to six months to
correct violations identified by federal or state compliance
assistance programs. No penalties or enforcement actions will be
assessed for any violations discovered through participation in
these programs, and corrected during the grace period. EPA will
exercise its discretion to extend the grace period for facilities
that are making a good faith effort to comply, but need
additional time. A similar approach will be used for small
communities.

<P>A grace period will encourage companies to request help and to
achieve compliance. The program includes appropriate safeguards
to protect public health and the environment. For example, the
grace period will not be available to shield criminal conduct or
delay action to correct violations that present a serious threat
to public health and the environment.

<P>EPA has experimented with this approach under the Clean Air Act.
EPA is now extending the approach to violations of other
statutes.


<P>Action: Establish national compliance service centers for metal
finishers, printshops, auto service stations and other small
business sectors that face substantial federal regulation.

<P>Background: Certain small business sectors face substantial
compliance costs under more than one of EPA's programs.
Noncompliance rates are high in these industries. In order to
achieve compliance, small businesses in these industries need
requirements explained in plain English, cost-effective waste
prevention opportunities identified, and paperwork held to a
minimum.

<P>States and trade associations sometimes provide technical
assistance to these sectors, but efforts tend to be ad hoc or
fragmented. In this initiative, the federal government will serve
as &quot;wholesaler&quot; of information, to support state programs and
trade associations that provide &quot;retail&quot; services to small
business customers.

<P>Description: EPA will establish national compliance assistance
centers that will:

<P>     Assist state and local agencies and trade associations to
     develop &quot;plain English&quot; guides to regulations

<P>     Identify low-cost strategies to achieve compliance

<P>     Develop ways to consolidate reporting and cut paperwork for
     client industries

<P>EPA and the Department of Commerce will jointly announce the
establishment of a national compliance assistance center for
metal finishing this spring, and new centers for auto service
stations and the printing industry later this year.

<P>The long term plan is to establish one national compliance center
for each small business sector, which would work with the trade
association and state programs providing technical assistance for
that particular industry.

<P>
<LI> <B>Incentives for auditing disclosure and correction</B>

<P>Action: Establish a new compliance incentive policy for regulated
entities that audit their own operations, and agree to
voluntarily correct and publicly disclose violations.

<P>Background: EPA's enforcement policies should encourage
compliance with the law and voluntary disclosure and correction
of violations. Such policies promote cooperation, rather than
confrontations in enforcement.

<P>Description: EPA will institute a compliance-incentive policy for
regulated entities with a record of compliance with environmental
laws. Under this policy, regulated entities will face penalties
no greater than the economic benefit gained from any violations.
In addition, EPA will effectively waive penalties for minor
violations, as well as more punitive &quot;gravity based&quot; penalties.
EPA will not conduct criminal investigations of companies that
voluntarily disclose and promptly correct violations.

<P>This policy takes effect on April 18, 1995. The Agency will
develop more detailed guidelines based on a consultative process
with state, industry, and public interest groups.

<P>EPA will continue to recover the economic benefit that companies
may have gained from violations, to preserve the level playing
field for those who make an early investment in compliance. The
policy also includes safeguards to prevent abuse. For example,
penalty reductions would not be available for criminal conduct,
violations that result in serious environmental harm, repeat
violations, or involuntary disclosures. EPA also reserves the
right to investigate any individual or employee for criminal
misconduct, even when not proceeding against a corporation.

<P>EPA's proposal offers a positive alternative to across-the-board
privileges and immunities that could be used to shield criminal
misconduct, drive up litigation costs, and create an atmosphere
of distrust between regulators, industry, and local communities.


<P><LI> <B>Self certification</B>

<P>Action: Eliminate unnecessary paperwork and review associated
with permitting and registration -- beginning with pesticide
registration and expanding to other program areas.

<P>Background: Self certification means that regulated parties may
notify EPA that they are in compliance with EPA's requirements,
and EPA then accepts that certification rather than reviewing the
company's performance. Self certification may offer substantial
savings for the regulated businesses and for regulatory agencies.
Pesticide registration, for example, is one area where
significant time and cost savings are likely:

<P>     Self certification for low-risk amendments to product  
registrations will reduce EPA's work load and greatly  accelerate
approval of many amendments. Approximately 20% of      the 6,500
amendments received annually may qualify for self      
certification, which would result in a time savings for each
     action of three to four months.

<P>     Self certification of acute toxicity studies will speed
     applications for new products by eliminating the need for
     EPA to exhaustively review data. Many of the 600
     applications with data received each year would benefit from
     these changes.

<P>     A computer program which determines the proper precautionary
     (&quot;warning&quot;) labeling for a product will enable registrants
     to submit correct labeling and help EPA staff to assure that
     labeling is acceptable. This computer program could reduce
     review time by five to six months and help minimize the
     number of applications which are rejected for incorrect
     labeling.

<P>Description: EPA will pilot a program to test standards for
self-certification of compliance with specific companies. Self
certification, if publicly credible, can offer an alternative to
traditional government inspections. In addition, EPA will
substantially streamline the pesticide product registration
process -- using self certification.

<P>In broader application, self certification could reduce reporting
of activities which do not involve environmental measurements or
significant risk. For example, self certification could extend to
certain requirements of the Clean Water Act for certain types of
used chemicals and the Clean Air Act under parts of the Enhanced
Monitoring Rules.


<P><LI> <B>Public electronic access</B>

<P>Action: Make information from all EPA programs available through
the Internet and other electronic means that Americans and local
organizations can access in their homes, schools and libraries.

<P>Background: EPA's public access program will enable the public,
as well as State, tribal, and local governments, to be full
partners in the Agency's comprehensive approach to environmental
protection. An informed public is better able to recognize and
protect itself from environmental risks and to ensure that
environmental issues are addressed equitably.

<P>Description: EPA will immediately upgrade the electronic
communication of environmental information by:

<P>     Significantly expanding the type and amount of information
     EPA puts on Internet, such as regulations, scientific
     documents and educational materials

<P>     Automating EPA rulemaking dockets and loading them onto
     Internet to encourage increased public participation in the
     rulemaking process

<P>     Making EPA's EARTH1 Internet server more user friendly, and
     expanding its capacity to host online dialogue with the
     public

<P>     Implementing and enhancing the EPA Government Information
     Locator Service, so that people can more easily and quickly
     track down specific documents and information

<P>     Providing easy access to data on major facilities and their
     pollutant discharges through EPA's Evirofacts database and
     the user friendly Gateway systems software on Internet. This
     will allow citizens to obtain information about
     environmental issues in their communities

<P>As EPA expands its electronic information systems, it will assure
that all members of the public have access to these systems
regardless of social, economic, and academic status. EPA will
work to build strategic partnerships with State, tribal and local
governments, as well as non-governmental and commercial
organizations that provide environmental information, to ensure
that all environmental information is widely available. The
Agency will also establish &quot;one stop&quot; information centers for the
public; projects include instituting a &quot;1-800-EPA-INFO&quot; telephone
number and upgrading Headquarters and Regional public information
centers.


<P><LI> <B>EPA center for environmental information and statistics</B>

<P>Action: Establish an EPA center to harmonize EPA information
collection and management, and provide for public access to
quality assured environmental statistics and information.

<P>Background: Environmental information will become increasingly
important as EPA expands its performance and market-based
management approaches. Additionally, as environmental protection
is decentralized -- to states, tribes and communities -- reliable
information about the condition of the environment will be needed
to ensure that programs are achieving desired results. EPA will
establish a customer-oriented center that will provide
information and statistics on national, regional and local
environmental conditions and trends that are integrated across
environmental programs. The center's main function will not be to
collect primary data -- it will instead focus on the integration
of data collected by others. Through the center, EPA will be
better able to address fundamental cross-media questions such as:
What pollution sources are causing the most damage? How do
geographic regions compare? How effectively are we dealing with
environmental problems?

<P>Description: EPA will establish, through a cooperative effort
with all EPA programs, regions and laboratories, a new center
that will be responsible for:

<P>     Coordinating with federal, state and local environmental
     agencies that produce and use environmental data and   
	information

<P>     Harmonizing EPA environmental data

<P>     Conducting cross-media assessments of data needs directed at
     reducing duplication and reporting burdens

<P>     Assisting EPA programs in the development of statistically
     valid survey designs and the use of statistical sampling of
     information

<P>     Providing statistical methods for integrating data from
     different federal agencies, states and localities

<P>     Assisting in design of studies to assess effectiveness of
     environmental programs and strategies (e.g., pollution
     prevention), and in presentation of environmental
     information in ways that promote a multimedia perspective

<P>     Improving public access to environmental statistics and data
     through the establishment of statistical data bases and
     systems which allow user access to all levels of data --
     from the raw data to highly processed information.
 


<P><LI><B> Project XL</B>

<P>Action: Support initiatives by facility managers to demonstrate
excellence and leadership by reducing costs of environmental
management and achieving environmental performance beyond that
required in existing regulations.

<P>Background: Numerous firms and facility managers have determined
that routine application of national environmental requirements
is not always the best solution to their environmental problems.
In particular, those with a record of environmental leadership
have found that substantial cost savings can sometimes be
realized, and environmental quality enhanced, through more
flexible approaches involving pollution prevention.  For example,
a company may find that upgrading its wastewater treatment system
to meet Clean Water Act technology-based requirements would have
a negligible impact on water quality, and that it could achieve
greater overall environmental protection by redirecting its
pollution control efforts toward programs to minimize hazardous
emissions from unregulated sources, to recycle hazardous wastes
and to reduce the use of toxic chemicals in the manufacturing
process.

<P>Description: On a demonstration project basis, EPA will support
company projects to replace existing regulatory requirements with
alternative environmental management strategies where the company
can demonstrate that such strategies will achieve better
environmental results than expected to be achieved under existing
law. In deciding whether to approve a particular strategy, EPA
will consult extensively with the affected State and the local
community. The final strategy will be embodied in an enforceable
document and contain provisions that will allow EPA, the State
and the community to monitor progress toward achieving results.
This initiative is intended to provide more flexibility for those
&quot;good actors&quot; and environmental leaders that have developed
creative, common sense ways of achieving superior environmental
protection at their facilities. Because it raises a number of
complex issues (e.g., how to measure environmental results, how
to establish an environmental baseline) which need to be worked
out in the implementation process, EPA is proposing to test it on
a pilot basis. Facilities of companies participating in the
Common Sense Initiative, as well as other facilities selected by
EPA, will be eligible to participate in this program. Potential
benefits of this initiative include:
<UL>
<LI>     Increased flexibility to adopt innovative solutions to
     environmental problems

<LI>  Increased (and more cost-effective) environmental protection

<LI>     Improved compliance and increased use of innovative    
	technologies

<LI>     Expanded use of waste minimization and pollution prevention
     strategies

<LI>   A more cooperative relationship between regulators, the
     facility, and the community

</UL>
<P><LI><B> Alternative strategies for sectors</B>

<P>Action: Support and evaluate the use of EPA-industry agreements
to reduce cost and achieve full protection of human health and
the environment through flexible, comprehensive management
approaches.

<P>Background: Regulators generally do not have an overview of the
entire set of requirements affecting an industry sector. Often,
environmental regulations cover a wide variety of industry
sectors and take a relatively uniform approach in terms of the
requirements imposed on those sectors. In other cases,
regulations are developed with specific individual sectors in
mind, but typically cover only one or a few of many pollution
source categories within the sector. The result is that companies
are not generally able to plan environmental compliance
investments in a comprehensive, strategic manner. This limits
opportunities for pollution prevention and raises the total cost
of compliance.

<P>An alternative approach is to design requirements that respond to
the conditions in an industry sector. Based on such designs, EPA
and industry groups would voluntarily negotiate agreements
incorporating these requirements. EPA-industry agreements would
be supplemented by company-level agreements that translate the
industry-wide commitments into obligations for specific companies
and facilities.

<P>Description: The six industries participating in the Common Sense
Initiative (CSI) will be the initial candidates from which 2-4
industries will be selected. Selection will be based both on
industry willingness and on the interest of other CSI
stakeholders in applying the agreement approach to a specific
sector. Once an industry has been selected, CSI stakeholders will
try to agree on the environmental improvement goals to be met by
the sector as a whole, and the best means of translating the
sector-wide goal into a company-specific improvement target.

<P>An explicit goal of this project will be to identify the
feasibility of using industry agreements as a complement to, or
as a replacement for, the current system of establishing industry
and facility environmental requirements. Industry agreements will
operate on a substantially larger scale than facility-specific
agreements. This may mean greater opportunities to identify
cost-effective means of achieving environmental quality goals, as
well as economies of scale for monitoring, employee education and
public participation. It may also be a way for small businesses
within an industrial sector to participate where it would not be
possible at the facility-specific scale.


<P><LI> <B>Alternative strategies for communities</B>

<P>Action: EPA will support the development and implementation of
community-driven strategies to integrate environmental quality
and economic development goals at the local level.

<P>Background: Continued progress in achieving environmental quality
and economic development will depend on greater involvement of
communities in designing local solutions to local problems. In
the current regulatory structure, local communities are seen as
implementors of Federal or State programs rather than as
designers of effective environmental strategies.

<P>Community-based environmental management includes local
assessment and ranking of environmental problems, community
education about these problems, and locally-developed strategies
to address them. These strategies can be reinforced by leveraging
regional and strategic planning; through technical assistance and
information tools; and, by facilitating intergovernmental and
public-private partnerships.

<P>Community-based environmental strategies must be integrated with,
and supportive of, community economic development goals.

<P>Description: In this limited pilot program, EPA, working with
other federal agencies as appropriate, will build upon the
experience gained in the Administration's Empowerment Zone and
Ecosystem Management Initiatives. The agency will assist a
limited number of communities (towns and townships, counties,
cities, metropolitan areas) in developing and implementing
alternative strategies to achieve environmental quality and
economic development goals. Two kinds of communities will be
considered:
<ol>
<LI>     Communities which propose alternative environmental
     management strategies that make more sense in a particular
     community or geographic area and that will exceed existing
     environmental requirements. These strategies could benefit
     from a wide range of innovative planning and financing
     approaches, but would be expected to meet existing legal
     deadlines.

<LI>     Communities which lack the financial or technical resources
     to meet existing requirements, but are willing to enter into
     enforceable agreements to make progress toward meeting
     environmental standards. These agreements would often extend
     across more than one environmental program area and would
     recognize the need for flexibility in approach or timing.
</OL>
<P>Both approaches will involve setting and achieving verifiable
environmental results, as well as citizen or community
participation in setting goals and monitoring results.

<P>
<LI><B> Alternative strategies for agencies </B>

<P>Action: Demonstrate alternative environmental management
strategies -- that lower cost and produce greater environmental
quality -- at selected Department of Defense installations.

<P>Background: Government installations face challenges similar to
industrial facilities and communities in complying with
environmental regulations at lowest cost. Government agencies are
interested in testing management alternatives that can replace
EPA's traditional ways of doing business. EPA will establish a
government sector project, beginning with Department of Defense,
that will identify ways of achieving greater environmental
results than are possible under existing regulatory requirements
-- at less cost to the taxpayer.

<P>The common theme of this pilot program is to make government
agencies more accountable for achieving environmental results
while granting them greater flexibility in how those results are
achieved. EPA will seek to involve state and local environmental
officials in the design, selection, implementation and review of
pilot projects and the program as a whole. It will also seek to
empower citizens in surrounding communities in the environmental
management process.

<P>Description: EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD) have
established a partnership to test alternative environmental
management strategies at selected DOD facilities. Under this
initiative, DoD base commanders, in cooperation with EPA and with
relevant state agencies, will develop and implement strategies
that produce greater environmental protection than would be
achieved under existing regulations.

<P>A major focus of these actions will be near-term investment in
pollution prevention approaches that reduce compliance and
remediation costs in the long run.

<P>To ensure full citizen involvement in this process, DOD will
produce high quality and understandable environmental information
that allows citizens in the communities surrounding DOD
installations to fully participate in the decisions.

<P>EPA will provide technical support for all EPA program areas
(i.e., water, air, waste). Strategies developed under these
projects will be enforceable and results will be independently
verified.


<P>
<LI> <B>Piloting third-party audits for industry compliance</B>

<P>Action: Test standards for third-party auditing through
Environmental Leadership pilot projects with specific companies.

<P>Background: Many companies conduct periodic audits of their
operations to determine whether they are in compliance with
environmental requirements. While most of these audits are
conducted by company employees, some are conducted by
environmental consulting firms or other independent environmental
experts.

<P>If thorough and reliable, these private &quot;third-party&quot; audits can
help provide independent verification of a company's
environmental performance and compliance without the direct
expenditure of government resources. Thus, third-party auditing
can help EPA better focus its inspection resources on
non-complying facilities.

<P>Description: EPA will work with industry, States and
environmental groups to test standards for third-party auditing.
These standards will include:
<UL>
<LI>     Procedures that auditors must follow to detect violations
     and prevent non-compliance 
<LI>     A requirement for periodic EPA inspections to verify the
     accuracy of audit reports 
<LI>     Mentoring projects to help small businesses achieve
     compliance 
<LI>     Requirements concerning the public availability of audit    
     results.
</UL>
<P>EPA's project will build on existing private sector standards.

<P>On April 1, EPA will announce pilot projects to test third-party
auditing with twelve partners from the public and private
sectors. The Agency expects to complete these projects within one
year.


<P>
<LI> <B>Multi-media permitting</B>

<P>Action: Pilot test &quot;one-stop&quot; permitting to reduce paperwork and
procedural burdens, avoid duplication and inconsistencies, and
assure more comprehensive environmental protection.

<P>Background: Many facilities must obtain multiple environmental
permits in order to operate, addressing releases of pollution to
several environmental media (e.g., air, water, soil). In many
cases, these permits are issued at different times and by
different permit authorities.

<P>The absence of a single, coordinated permitting process has
created problems for both permittees and regulators. Permittees
frequently find themselves preparing multiple applications and
going through multiple permit proceedings to obtain all the
necessary permits for a single facility. Multiple permits may not
adequately address all environmental problems (as some problems
may &quot;fall through the cracks&quot;). Further, because they do not
address environmental problems holistically, multiple permits may
result in the undesirable crossmedia transfer of pollutants.
Finally, these permits may contain overlapping, poorly
coordinated and contradictory requirements.

<P>Description: EPA will pilot test the feasibility of issuing a
single environmental permit for facilities which currently
require multiple permits. Permittees at pilot facilities would
submit a single application for a single permit setting forth all
the pollution control and clean-up requirements for that
facility. EPA will work with the permittee, the affected State
and local communities to assure that all releases from a facility
are addressed, that permitting requirements for all media are
well-integrated, and that duplication and inconsistencies are
avoided. This approach will promote &quot;common sense&quot; solutions to
multimedia pollution problems and encourage the use of pollution
prevention.

<P>In addition, EPA will establish multimedia Regional permitting
teams to better coordinate the issuance of multiple permits to
individual facilities. This will be a useful &quot;first step&quot; in
testing the feasibility of the multimedia pilot program described
above.


<P>
<LI> <B>Design for the Environment -- &quot;Green Chemistry Challenge&quot;</B>

<P>Action: Promote pollution prevention and industrial ecology
through a new EPA Design for the Environment partnership with the
chemical industry.

<P>Background: Design for the Environment partnerships with the
chemical industry can encourage changes that both promote
economic development and benefit the industry by helping find
cost-effective ways to prevent pollution. Publicity associated
with the awards program, coupled with financial prizes provided
by the chemical industry, can provide a strong incentive for
broad industry cooperation.

<P>Description: The program would set up financial incentives and an
EPA award system for companies that address the following
pollution prevention goals:
 <UL>
<LI>     Making more chemicals from renewable resources. By
     increasing the use of renewable resources in the development
     of chemicals, the amount of toxic inputs would be reduced.

<LI>    Substituting new, safer solvents that do not contribute to
     air pollution. Since the use of traditional solvents
     contributes to a wide range of air pollution problems --
     including stratospheric ozone depletion and smog --
     companies will be asked to find processes where new, safer
     solvents can be used.

<LI>     Designing chemicals that are manufactured more safely and
     that are safer for the environment.
</UL>
<P>The challenge is for industry to find cleaner, cheaper and
smarter ways to produce the materials we depend on. EPA will work
cooperatively with industry to establish this program, provide
technical assistance in designing safer processes, and track the
reductions achieved in the use, manufacture, and release of
harmful chemicals.
</OL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME=other>APPENDIX B <BR>
OTHER SIGNIFICANT  ACTIONS</A></H2>

<P><H3>Performance and market-based regulations</H3>
<OL>
<LI>    Facility-wide air emissions. EPA will conduct several
     demonstrations of facility-wide limits for air emissions
     that allow companies increased management flexibility and to
     use least-cost control options. This approach will
     significantly reduce the amount of time industry must devote
     to permitting activities and save millions of dollars in
     permitting costs.

<LI>   Flexibility in meeting effluent discharge deadlines. EPA
     will propose targeted Clean Water Act revisions to extend
     compliance schedules for industrial wastewater treatment
     standards, for companies that apply innovative treatment
     approaches that prevent pollution. This will create
     incentives for pollution prevention.

<P><B>Setting priorities based on sound science</B>

<LI>   Eliminate millions of storm water permit applications. EPA
     will set up a formal process with all stakeholders to limit
     storm water control requirements to only those facilities
     where a water quality problem exists. This would exempt
     millions of sites (small municipalities, and light industry
     and commercial sites -- nearly 80% of the universe now
     subject to regulation) without any significant impacts on
     water quality.

<LI>    Exempt low-risk pesticides and toxic chemicals from
     regulation. EPA is proposing to exempt 31 low-risk active
     ingredients and 160 inert ingredients from pesticide
     regulation (resulting in substantial economic benefits to
     manufacturers). A similar exemption will be proposed for
     low-risk chemicals under TSCA, for which manufacturers must
     now submit premanufacturing notices. This action could yield
     a 25% reduction in this notification.

<LI>   Environmental forecasting to anticipate future environmental
     problems. EPA will establish a program to help identify and
     study emerging environmental problems. This anticipatory
     effort will attempt to lessen the need for rapid future
     decisions made using a weak science base, and should enable
     the United States to avoid expensive environmental control
     and clean-up programs. This activity will be guided by a new
     report by the EPA Science Advisory Board (Beyond the
     Horizon: Using Foresight to Protect the Environmental
     Future, 1995).


<P>Building Partnerships

<P>6    State and tribal flexibility for municipal landfill permits.
     EPA will encourage states and tribes to implement a
     flexible, performance-standard approach for permitting
     municipal landfills. EPA will propose criteria for approving
     state and tribal programs that regulate municipal landfills.
     This action will enable tribes and states to implement a
     flexible, performance-based approach.

<P><B>Cutting red tape</B>

<LI>    Save billions on PCB disposal. EPA will revise the PCB
     disposal regulations -- by reducing the number of permits
     required, by eliminating duplicative state and Federal
     controls, and by (most importantly) giving states and the
     regulated community the flexibility to choose less expensive
     disposal methods to achieve health standards. The estimated
     savings from this action is two to six billion dollars per
     year, for as much as thirty years.

<LI>  Simplify air permit revision requirements. EPA will develop
     a streamlined process for revising air quality permits. This
     will enable a state to build on its existing programs and
     avoid creating unnecessary and prescriptive regulations.
     This may save thousands of review hours and millions of
     dollars.

<LI>    Simplify review of new air pollution sources. This first
     major reform in 15 years will provide greater flexibility,
     significantly reduce the number of industry activities that
     are subject to major new source review, reduce time delays
     in permit issuance, and create incentives for use of
     innovative technologies. The project will reduce regulatory
     burdens for many facilities and should result in at least 25
     percent fewer permit reviews.

<LI>   Simplify water permit paperwork. EPA will reduce the
     paperwork burdens for municipalities and businesses by
     simplifying the permit application forms for water
     discharges.

<LI>  Streamlining RCRA corrective action procedures. EPA will
     promote &quot;faster, better&quot; cleanups under RCRA. The Agency
     will propose a rule that responds to a number of promising
     ideas that were identified through discussions with outside
     stakeholders, such as reducing government oversight and
     expediting use of interim protective measures. This rule
     could save two billion dollars annually.


<P><B>Better accountability, compliance and enforcement</B>

<LI> Flexible compliance agreements for specific industries.
     Working with industries, EPA will develop experimental
     EPA/Industry Compliance Agreements to allow companies to
     disclose violations and correct them in a timely manner. In
     exchange for these voluntary disclosures, EPA would agree to
     reduce the size of the penalties. The agreements will
     provide a specified time period during which industry may
     come to EPA and sign the agreement.

<P><B>The power of information</B>

<LI>  Independent study on collecting and using information more
     effectively. EPA will commission an independent study that
     will provide recommendations to improve data collection and
     management at EPA. These recommendations will be used to
     design a center for environmental information and
     statistics.

<LI>  Electronic data transfer. EPA will establish a system to
     allow facilities to report monitoring results
     electronically. This will help reduce monitoring burdens
     while enhancing enforceability or accountability.

THE CLINTON/GORE RECORD:
TWO YEARS OF PROGRESS</A></H2>

<P><H3>PERFORMANCE AND MARKET-BASED REGULATION</H3>

<P>Slashed Toxic Air Pollution from Chemical Plants with a Flexible
New Regulation: EPA issued an air pollution regulation of
unprecedented scope that will reduce emissions of over a hundred
hazardous organic pollutants by nearly 90% by early 1997,
protecting the health of Americans who live near chemical
facilities in 35 states. This regulation clearly signified EPA's
objective to move from a one-size fits all regulation to an
approach based on flexibility, innovation and common sense. This
regulation provides flexibility by allowing businesses to continue to emit from pollution sources that are not cost-effective to control if extra reductions are achieved at other vents in the same plant. Businesses can implement cost effective, common-sense control measures and do not need to install the same stringent level of technology on each source of pollution in their plant, as had been traditionally required. This approach will result in both cleaner and cheaper results and firms that take advantage of this flexibility to reduce costs will be asked to make an extra 10% reduction in their overall emissions. Among the benefits of this regulation are greater protections for public health, increased crop yields, less destruction of animal habitat, and a reduction in smog equivalent to taking 38 million cars off American roads.

<P>Marshalled the Government's Buying Power to Promote Recycled
Products and Environmentally Safer Products: The Clinton
Administration recognized that the biggest barrier to the recycling of municipal solid waste is the lack of a mature market for recycled products, and set out to help change that by issuing an Executive Order requiring the federal government to buy recycled goods and thereby build demand. EPA has led efforts to implement that order and proposed last April a major guideline designating 21 additional items Federal agencies should buy with recycled content, including commonly used items such as plastic trash bags, concrete and carpeting. EPA also drafted separate guidance for Federal procurement officials to help them determine which other products are environmentally preferable.

<P>Issued A National Plan to Prevent and Recycle Hazardous Waste: To
implement the Clinton Administration's priority emphasis on
pollution prevention and recycling of hazardous waste, EPA released last fall a national blueprint to reduce toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative constituents in hazardous waste by 25% by the year 2000 and by 50% by 2005. The blueprint enlists an array of regulatory and especially non-regulatory measures and maps out a consultative process with state governments, industry
and other stakeholders to ensure that the strategies employed will be based on consensus and tailored to local needs. The plan allows companies that have already made strides in this area to take credit for their actions and foresees flexible reduction levels across facilities that will add up to the aggregate goals of the plan.

<P>Rewarded Early Performance in Cutting Air Pollution with
Flexibility: EPA launched an Early Reductions Program that provides facilities that emit hazardous air pollutant sources with a six-year extension to a Clean Air Act compliance deadline if they achieve over 90 percent of their pollution reductions ahead of schedule. EPA also offered a new and more flexible framework than the customary one for demonstrating these reductions so that businesses would find it more cost-effective to choose this alternative.

<P>Gave Businesses Choice to Opt-In to the Acid Rain Permit Trading
System: EPA established a voluntary program allowing businesses
with combustion facilities such as boilers and turbines to join the Acid Rain trading system and receive allowance permits for their annual sulfur dioxide emissions. These businesses can then trade their permits or sell them for a profit if they can reduce emissions below their customary level. This innovative market approach provides new choices and incentives to businesses that are not required to observe particular regulatory limits. The benefits of this approach include reduced emissions which contribute to acid rain and greater health protection. Public health benefits of reducing acid rain include greater prevention of respiratory willnesses, with a monetary savings estimated at 
&#036;69 billion through the year 2010 due to decreased mortality, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits. Environmental benefits include protecting aquatic life in streams and lakes and preventing the decline of forests. Other economic benefits include reduced costs of compliance for the electric utilities that are required to be in the Acid Rain trading system; for example, businesses that choose to join can reduce their emissions and then sell their left over emission entitlement to utilities facing higher control costs (and which therefore prefer to purchase allowances that allow them to continue to emit).

<P>Promoted Market-Based Programs for Reducing Air Pollution: EPA
issued Economic Incentive Program rules that provide a framework
for the development and use of emissions trading, emission fees and other market-based approaches for controlling stationary and mobile sources of air pollution. These market-based approaches provide economic incentives for technology vendors and industry to develop new pollution control technologies that are both cleaner and cheaper than those that would otherwise be required. A growing number of states throughout the country -- including California, Texas, Illinois, Connecticut and Massachusetts -- are implementing or actively developing market-based programs under these new rules.
<P>
<H3>SETTING PRIORITIES BASED ON A SOUND SCIENCE</H3>

<P>Promoted Redevelopment of Contaminated City Properties, or
&quot;Brownfields&quot;: To reduce the incidence of Superfund cleanup
requirements deterring redevelopment of inner city sites, EPA last month removed approximately 25,000 sites from the Superfund
Inventory where it was determined that there was no need for
further federal action. Taking them off the list has removed a
major impediment to investment and redevelopment. EPA will issue
guidance this year calling for quicker decisions as to which sites need further study and which may be ripe for redevelopment without extensive cleanup. Over the next two years, EPA will increase from eight to fifty the number of grants to cities for promoting economic redevelopment of these sites. EPA will issue guidance to expand the circumstances in which EPA can forge agreements with prospective land purchasers not to impose liability if the land in question was contaminated prior to purchase. Another imminent EPA guidance will clarify EPA's policy of freeing lenders of cleanup liability if they are not directly managing a contaminated facility.

<P>Strengthened the Quality and Credibility of EPA Science: EPA
instituted an expanded peer review policy in June 1994 to require
all major EPA science products to undergo external peer review
prior to use in regulatory or policy decisions. EPA has committed
to allocating 50% of research dollars to long-term research to
develop better understanding of environmental problems and to get
early warning of tomorrow's problems; the remaining 50% will be
used to vigorously support the applied research needs of EPA's
program and regional offices. EPA revised its research program to
use risk assessment and risk management as the principal
priority-setting criteria. A high priority is being placed on
research to reduce the significant uncertainties that remain
associated with risk assessment methodologies. EPA will shortly
publish a new risk characterization policy requiring impartial
presentation of risk assessments, scientific assumptions, and
description of major uncertainties and data gaps. A special effort was undertaken by EPA to evaluate its laboratories, which resulted in a new organizational structure that will improve risk assessment; this new organization streamlines headquarters operations by 50 percent. EPA also doubled funding for investigator-initiated research grants in order to expand the
number of first-rate, outside scientists conducting research
related to EPA's mission. EPA initiated a new graduate fellowship
program to support students conducting environmentally related
research, thereby investing in the next generation of environmental scientists and engineers. Lastly, EPA updated its guidelines so that analyses of the impact of its regulations will reflect the latest economic and scientific methodology, thereby enhancing understanding of the costs and benefits of regulation.


<P>Reduced Dioxin Risk to Americans by Cutting Municipal and Medical
Waste Incinerator Emissions: Municipal and medical waste
incinerators have been identified as two of the largest known
sources of dioxin, a chemical that persists in the environment for a long time and can cause cancer and reproductive and developmental defects. Incinerators also release thousands of tons of other dangerous pollutants, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium that can cause cancer, neurological disorders, and respiratory disease.  EPA's proposed standards will cut medical and municipal incinerator emissions by tens of thousands of tons, and dioxin emissions will be cut by more than 99 percent.

<P>Protected Americans from Lead Poisoning through Coordinated
Inter-Agency Action: Experts have called lead poisoning the number one environmental threat to children's health in the United States.  Severe lead exposure can cause coma, convulsions and death. Lower levels can cause adverse health effects on the central nervous system and kidneys, raise adult blood pressure and permanently impair the intelligence of children. Though blood lead levels in American children have declined over the past two decades largely due to the EPA-led phaseout of leaded gasoline, the Clinton Administration is aggressively responding to recent scientific knowledge showing that damage can be done at a much lower concentration than previously thought. Consistent with its emphasis on environmental justice, the Administration is seeking to reduce disproportionate lead exposure in inner-city children. Reflecting the Administration's strong emphasis on inter-agency collaboration, EPA co-proposed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development a regulation requiring disclosure of lead-based paint hazards whenever property is sold. EPA last fall proposed a rule specifying the requirements for training and certification of professionals who specialize in abatement of lead hazards. Last summer, EPA published public guidance on identifying hazardous levels of lead in paint, soil, and dust. Last spring, EPA proposed a rule requiring lead hazard education in relation to building renovations. EPA proposed to eliminate the remaining uses of lead in gasoline for highway use and another one to cut emissions of lead and other air toxics from secondary lead smelters by 2,400 tons each year, without affecting the price of lead to consumers.  This summer, EPA will propose to restrict significant new uses of lead so that new pathways of exposure will not be created.

<P>Collaborated with Small Businesses in Evaluating and Designing
Environmentally Safer Products and Processes: EPA's &quot;Design for the Environment&quot; (DfE) Program is a voluntary program through which EPA works with businesses on a sector-by-sector basis to promote pollution prevention and to assist in developing environmentally safer chemicals, materials, and processes. The DfE program evaluates the relative environmental benefits and risks of alternative production processes, a complex analytical task that is often difficult for small businesses to do by themselves. The DfE program focuses primarily on small business-dominated sectors and is working, for example, with the dry cleaning industry to evaluate alternatives to the use of perchloroethylene (perc) in terms of their costs, effectiveness and environmental effects. Other DfE projects are underway with the printing, printed wiring boards, computer and metal plating industries, as well as with the scientific community in green chemistry. Through DfE, EPA leverages its expertise and serves as a catalyst for the broader diffusion of both information and safer technology.

<P>Set Priorities for Protecting Americans from Radioactive
Contamination Based on Risks of Exposure: EPA issued a final
regulation to prevent contamination of groundwater in the vicinity of inactive uranium processing sites, and to set priorities for clean-up based on relative risks of human exposure. Contaminants include both toxic and radioactive substances that can cause cancer and genetic damage. Department of Energy (DOE) studies indicate that at least 4.7 billion gallons of ground water have become contaminated as a result of these uranium contaminants. The recent issuance of this EPA standard clears the way for DOE to complete the clean-up of contaminated groundwater and provides flexibility to prioritize cleanup based on the populations affected, a far more cost-effective approach than the prevailing standard in place since 1983.

<P>
<P><H3>BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS</H3>

<P>Launched &quot;Common Sense Initiative&quot; to Tailor Environmental
Protection Policies to Specific Industries: To protect public
health and the environment more effectively and less expensively,
EPA launched a major initiative that looks at pollution on an
industry-by-industry basis rather than using the pollutant-by-pollutant approaches of the past. The initiative involves everyone from manufacturers to community organizations in fashioning new strategies and approaches that emphasize pollution prevention while providing cleaner, cheaper and smarter protection for everyone. All aspects of environmental policy -- from emissions reporting requirements to needed changes in environmental laws -- are being examined. The Initiative has started by focusing on six pilot industries: iron and steel; electronics and computers; metal plating and finishing; automobile assembly; printing; and oil refining. Together they represent nearly 11 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, account for one-eight of all toxic emissions reported to EPA, and employ four million people. Some are high-tech, other industrial; some are small business, others are large companies. The teams are: reviewing regulations to get better environmental results at less cost through increased coordination; seeking opportunities to give industry the incentives and flexibility to develop innovative technologies that meet and exceed environmental standards while cutting costs; looking at ways to change the permitting system; encouraging innovation; and creating opportunities for public participation; and improving environmental reporting requirements.

<P>
Launched a New Era of Improved EPA/State Relations: For the first
time ever, the Clinton Administration has involved States and
tribes in EPA's internal planning process. In July, 1994, EPA
Administrator Carol M. Browner signed a Joint Policy Statement with representatives of the State environmental commissioners, outlining a new set of partnership principles including reform of the oversight process; increasing the flexibility of funding; improving communications and data sharing; and improving technical assistance and training for the states. In 1995, EPA initiated grant flexibility pilot projects in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and North Dakota. EPA also established new processes for state and local involvement in the regulatory development process.

<P>Provided Assistance to Build Environmental Capacity of Local
Governments and Small Towns: EPA established a new Local Government Advisory Committee to make recommendations on how to better address local government needs and a new Small Town Task Force with representatives from small towns across America to focus on the unique environmental and economic issues facing these communities. EPA charged its ten regional offices to establish a local government liaison function and doubled the number of EPA-supported Environmental Finance Centers to provide analysis and technical assistance to communities across the nation on financing environmental programs. EPA is conducting Regional Geographic Initiatives and Comparative Risk Projects to assist numerous communities and 27 states to help them set their own environmental priorities. EPA has also issued several user-friendly reports directed at helping local decision-makers design an effective environmental protection system.

<P>Launched and Expanded Voluntary, Results-Oriented Partnerships with the Private Sector: The Clinton Administration has initiated or expanded a number of voluntary, results-oriented programs to assist businesses in identifying previously unrecognized losses associated with waste. The programs are projected to save over 
&#036;60 billion in energy costs by the year 2000, while creating jobs in efficiency and other emerging industries. EPA's most prominent examples of voluntary partnerships are contained in President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan, which has reduced air pollution that threatens global warming and local air quality and implements a commitment to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Plan encompasses a set of comprehensive and mostly voluntary actions that will produce cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the residential, commercial, agricultural, and transportation sectors. Some of the highlights include:

<P>Climate Wise, encourages and recognizes voluntary reductions 
across all sectors of the economy. Already, businesses
representing 3 percent of U.S industrial energy use have
pledged to reduce annual emissions by 10 million tons of
greenhouse gases by the year 2000. DuPont projects that it will save &#036;31 million per year as a result of actions it will take to meet its Climate Wise pledge.

<P>Motor Challenge, helps companies install high efficiency 	motor systems, has recruited over 100 partners, established national technical assistance hotline and is soliciting sites for 25 showcase technology demonstrations that will 	help encourage rapid adoption of high-efficiency motor systems by U.S. businesses.

<P>Waste Wi
&#036;e, encourages voluntary prevention and recycling of
business waste and has attracted over 350 businesses.

<P>Natural Gas Star, encourages natural gas producers to adopt
practices that can profitably reduce methane losses from
gas transmission lines and coal mines. The program has
expanded to include over 35 corporate partners, representing
over 55% of the transmission company pipeline miles, 25% of
distribution company pipeline miles, and 35% of all service
connections.

<P>Green Lights, a program to encourage business and 	industries, local governments and other agencies and	institutions to use energy-efficient lighting, has added 503 new participants since October 1993, for a total of more than 1,650. These participants have reduced lighting electricity consumption by an average of 47 percent, saving approximately 
&#036;60 million each year.

<P>State and Local Outreach Program has awarded grants to eighteen states to complete greenhouse gas inventories or develop comprehensive mitigation strategies essential for laying the foundation for actual reduction efforts.    
twenty-four states have participated in the program, 	including seven in the &quot;Green Fleets&quot; initiative (to encourage procurement of energy efficient vehicles) and 25 cities in the &quot;Cities for Climate Protection&quot; program that 	helps cities save money and energy.

<P>Chose Voluntary Agreement Over Regulation to Cut Sludge Disposal
Risks: Instead of imposing a new regulation, EPA signed a voluntary agreement with the American Forest and Paper Association to reduce the risks associated with land disposal of pulp and paper mill sludge. It includes limits on the levels of dioxin in sludge that is disposed on land; and limits on subsequent use of that land. The affected companies were able to avoid a prescriptive regulation, and EPA accomplished its environmental goals with the agreement's provision for site management practices, a testing program, a program for distributing and marketing sludge products, and record
keeping and reporting requirements.


<P>Implemented Executive Order to Promote Environmental Justice: In
the year since President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 on
Environmental Justice, EPA has convened a new Interagency Federal
Working Group to establish criteria for identifying
disproportionate impacts on minority and low-income populations,
and coordinate research and projects with other federal agencies.
EPA also formed a Federal Advisory Committee -- the National
Environmental Justice Advisory Council -- to bring a cross-section of local and national perspectives to bear on preparing EPA's environmental justice strategic plan, which will be issued this spring. Among the concrete field projects underway is a pilot project at the Del Amo, California, Superfund site, where EPA awarded a grant to establish a health services facility to provide environmental health education and medical testing for residents. EPA also established a partnership with Morgan State University to train teachers to serve as community resources for information on hazardous waste issues and government decisionmaking. EPA also provided critical guidance for the Administration's Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program, which boosts sustainable development efforts in disadvantaged communities. 

<P>Enhanced Community Participation in Superfund Cleanups: Through its Brownfields Action Agenda, EPA is working in partnership with state and local governments, communities, industries and small business to clean up contaminated sites in cities across the country to bring them back to life and create jobs. EPA has encouraged the establishment of community advisory groups to increase community participation in cleanup decisions at Superfund sites. EPA is also expanding the use of Technical Assistance Grants, which are given to citizen groups around Superfund sites.

<P>Expanded Public Participation in Hazardous Waste Permitting: For
the first time in the 15-year history of the Federal hazardous
waste program, EPA has proposed a rule that will permit applicants to make information available to local communities about the facility and meet with local citizens prior to submitting a permit application. The permitting agency, whether EPA or the state government, will be required to notify the surrounding community once the permit application is received and will be given flexibility to tailor the level of public input to community interest leading up to the permit decision.

<P>Worked with States to Manage Petroleum-Related Wastes Rather than
Imposing New Federal Regulations: EPA pursued an innovative
alternative by granting seed money to an organization of oil and
gas producing states to work together with industry, environmental groups and communities to develop guidelines for state programs to manage these wastes. After the guidelines were developed, EPA funding and technical assistance were also provided for teams of state officials to peer review each state program for adequacy and weaknesses. The process created both support for the guidelines and an incentive to upgrade state programs without imposing rigid federal requirements.

<P>Initiated New State-Local-Tribal Partnerships to Design More
Efficient Waste Management Plans: EPA provided assistance to the
Cherokee Tribe to build a pilot partnership with neighboring
Jackson and Swain counties in North Carolina to develop a regional solution to solid waste management problems. The initiative prompted exploration of joint partnerships for recycling and equipment purchases. EPA views the success of this project as a demonstration to state, local and especially tribal governments, that have often been at odds, of the genuine environmental and human health results that can be gained through partnerships that do not threaten sovereignty. EPA is promoting this concept nationwide. 

<P>Promoted Streamlining of State Waste Management Regulation: As a
pilot project, EPA's Seattle office recently authorized the State
of Washington to carry out the hazardous waste corrective action
program under the state's Superfund authority. Most states have
Superfund programs, whereas only a few states have requested
authorization to manage their own Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action programs. Under the
Washington arrangement, the overlapping Superfund and RCRA programs have been coordinated to eliminate the need for the state to develop an entirely separate and duplicative cleanup bureaucracy.  EPA is working to expand this approach around the country, while encouraging more states to undertake their own corrective action programs instead of continuing to cede Federal control.

<P>Launched Project to Set National Environmental Goals: EPA has
launched a major initiative to develop ambitious long-range goals
for America's environment and measurable 10-year benchmarks to mark success toward those goals. EPA conducted nine major public
roundtables throughout the country with a cross-section of
Americans, including business leaders, environmental advocates,
government officials and labor representatives. By enhancing the
national consensus concerning measurable outcomes, the Goals
Project has created a new opportunity to shift government policy
away from prescriptive dictates to flexible, performance-based
approaches.

<P>Developed Historic Water Management Plan for California, Protecting Farmers, Urban Drinking Water and Endangered Fish: After two years of intensive consultation with affected constituencies, EPA published final water quality standards for the San Francisco Bay/Delta. As the West Coast's largest estuary, the Bay/Delta supplies habitat for over 120 fish species and large populations of waterfowl as well as irrigation water for 45 percent of the Nation's fruit and vegetables. The innovative protection plan encompassing EPA's water quality standards was jointly developed by federal government agencies, the State of California, businesses, urban and agricultural water agencies and suppliers, and environmental advocates. The plan takes a comprehensive, ecosystem approach rather than a single-pollutant, individual source approach, and will provide many benefits to the millions of
Americans depending on the Bay/Delta. It will help arrest the
severe and continuing decline of Bay/Delta fish and wildlife
resources, like the winter-run salmon. It provides a three-year
window of opportunity to do more sensible long-term planning and
management. The Clinton Administration managed this critical
challenge by producing an adaptive management scheme that protects endangered species while assuring reliability in state and Federal water projects allocations to support farmers and urban water users.

<P>Increased the Use of Regulatory Negotiations to Give Affected
Parties a Greater Voice in EPA Decision-making: EPA is a recognized leader in the federal government in pioneering successful Regulatory Negotiations (Reg-Neg) process that convenes representatives of various interest groups, businesses and federal or other government agencies and has been able to reach consensus on an important and wide-ranging set of rule proposals over the last two years. Four examples from a larger set follow:
<UL>
<LI>Reg-Neg #l/Negotiated Safer Drinking Water: To assure that public
health is adequately protected, EPA negotiated with representatives from public water systems; state and local health agencies; environmental organizations; consumer groups; and federal, state and local governments for a cluster rule that would: (1) reduce exposure to chlorinated disinfection byproducts by 20%-30%; (2) reduce exposure to other non-chlorinated byproducts; (3) eliminate hundreds of thousands of cases of disease due to microbial contamination each year; and (4) control such potentially deadly parasites as Cryptosporidium in large water systems.

<P>Launched Interim Voluntary Action to Protect Americans from Threats like the Bacterial Water Illness in Milwaukee: Given the
significant risks to human health in the interim before
implementation of the above cluster rule, EPA is working with the
water suppliers on a voluntary treatment optimization program to
maximize the effectiveness of existing treatment in removing
microbial threats.
<P>
<LI>Reg-Neg #2/Reduced Toxic Air Pollution from Wood Manufacturing: EPA met with state agencies, large and small wood furniture
manufacturers, coatings manufacturers, and environmental groups and proposed a negotiated regulation to reduce toxic air pollution from Wood Furniture Manufacturing Operations. The proposed rule affects 750 manufacturing facilities and will reduce emissions of toxic pollution by 30,000 metric tons per year.

<P>
<LI>Reg-Neg #3/Reduced Toxic Air Pollution from Steel Manufacturing:
EPA issued a regulation to cut toxic air pollution from Steel Plant Coke Ovens in October 1993 that broke a 20-year deadlock on the issue and will cut 1500 tons of pollution annually. The regulatory negotiation included participation by industry, environmental groups, and State and local agencies and the resulting rule offers flexibility to the steel and coke oven industry by providing a choice of two compliance methods.

<P>
<LI>Reg-Neg #4/Reduced Threat to Water Quality from &quot;Combined Sewer&quot;
Run-off: To stem the threat to Americans' water supplies, EPA
launched an enforceable national protection framework through the
nation's basic water pollution permitting program resulting from a negotiated agreement among key stakeholders, and provides
municipalities with flexibility to develop site-specific,
cost-effective solutions to this problem rather than complying with a one-size-fits-all dictate.
</UL>
<P>Protected the Great Lakes from Toxic Pollution and Used
Consensus-Building Process: EPA, working in partnership with eight Great Lakes States, produced a common-sense, comprehensive plan to restore the health and the economy of the Great Lakes. Through a consensus-building process, the program will remove toxic chemicals from the Great Lakes basin that contains about 95 percent of the United States' freshwater and is home to one-fifth of all Americans and one-quarter of industry. The final plan provides the Great Lakes states and tribes with community-based flexibility to tailor solutions to local conditions and to set sound health and environmental protection goals, while developing cost-effective solutions.

<P>Negotiated Environmental Side Agreement to NAFTA and Established
Commission to Coordinate Enforcement of Environmental Laws: The
North American Free Trade Agreement and its side agreements
represent the most comprehensive attempt in history to integrate
trade and environmental concerns within the context of a regional
trade agreement and has heightened enforcement in Mexico and has
already stimulated greater U.S. exports of environmental
technology. In addition, two financing organizations were
established, the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank) to help assist in financing badly needed environmental facilities in the U.S.-Mexico border area, such as wastewater treatment plants and drinking water systems.

<P>
<P>C<H3>UTTING RED TAPE</H3>

<P>Implemented Executive Order to Streamline the Regulatory
Development Process: Since President Clinton issued Executive Order #12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review on September 30, 1993, EPA has implemented a number of regulatory streamlining efforts. In June 1994, EPA redesigned its rulemaking process to be more flexible, less encumbered by procedural delays, and more responsive to both industry and EPA needs. The new regulatory development process allows EPA to more clearly identify both its regulatory priorities and those actions that are designated as &quot;significant&quot; under the Executive Order. EPA's process requires actions to be
&quot;tiered&quot; according to priorities set by the Administration and the regulation's anticipated impact on industry and other stakeholders. This has streamlined the regulatory development process and reduced delay in promulgating EPA's less complex and more routine actions. EPA has also undertaken new initiatives to solicit and incorporate the early input of State, local, and tribal governments in the development of regulations.

<P><H3>Launched Major Initiative to Reduce Permitting Burdens on Industry:</H3>

<P>EPA assembled a results-oriented team with representation from
federal, state and local government to streamline environmental
permitting so that Americans can focus on being economically
productive and can protect our shared environment without needless paperwork. The Permit Improvement Team recommended revisions to regulations to allow alternatives to traditional individual permits, to encourage greater pollution prevention and innovative technology, and to provide special incentives for good performance such as expedited processing and alternative compliance strategies and schedules. The team also developed methods for enlisting earlier and more meaningful public participation in the permitting process, and met with a cross-section of stakeholders to develop action plans. The team has launched pilot projects that will develop models for future implementation on a nationwide scale.

<P>Launched Consensus-Building Effort with States to Simplify the
Tracking of Interstate Movement of Hazardous Waste: Many businesses have expressed frustration that the form for reporting their movement of hazardous waste varies from state to state. EPA has reviewed this problem in collaboration with states, businesses and other stakeholders, and this summer will propose consensus changes to bring uniformity to the paperwork.

<P>Reduced Regulatory Barriers to Innovative Technologies: The EPA-led Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI), launched by President Clinton in his first State of the Union address is improving American competitiveness in the growing market for new environmental technologies. ETI reduces the cost of compliance, provides new tools for cleaning up the environment, and mobilizes American entrepreneurs to compete in the market place. The top
priority of the ETI is to reduce barriers to innovation. This
includes assisting entrepreneurs with obtaining permits and sites
to test and demonstrate their new technologies for potential
purchasers, helping small businesses identify the most cost-effective prevention or control technologies, and disseminating information and technical assistance to undergird a more efficient market. Three examples of recent changes instituted to help technology developers follow:
<UL>
<LI>Eased Restrictions on Testing Hazardous Waste Technology:
EPA issued a rule in early 1994 which eased the restrictions on
testing hazardous waste technologies by increasing the quantity of contaminated soil that can be used without a permit in testing the new technology. Previous limits were set too low to allow for realistic tests of new technologies, and unnecessarily inhibited the development of new technologies.

<LI>Easing the conditions of these tests helps not just    
developers, but also decision-makers who need to evaluate new
technology claims before deciding on a clean-up strategy.

<LI>Approved New Hazardous Waste Testing and Monitoring    
Technologies: In January, EPA amended its hazardous waste   
regulations to approve new and more cost-effective hazardous
waste monitoring and testing technologies for inclusion in its
nationally used manual. Manufacturers of environmental
technology, commercial labs, and private labs that do  
environmental monitoring will benefit from this increased   choice of innovative methods. Several of the newly approved   methods promote pollution prevention by reducing the use of    solvents.
</UL>
<P>Accommodated Innovative Technology Under the Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution Regulation: Last July 5, EPA issued a new policy
that allows states to give businesses extra time to comply
with Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) regulations for nitrogen oxide pollution. This new policy will facilitate the development and installation of cost-effective innovative controls. The option is only available where a source is actively pursuing an innovative control technology that would not be available by May 31, 1995, the regulation deadline for RACT compliance. 

<P>Proposed to Reduce Barriers to Financing by Businesses with
Underground Storage Tanks: Liability concerns of banks and other
lenders have made it difficult for gas stations, farmers,
convenience stores, local retailers and other facilities with
underground storage tanks to obtain financing. EPA proposed a rule last year to reduce lenders' concerns, which will substantially increase the capital available to these businesses for expansion and environmental compliance activities and thereby reduce the risks of contamination for those in the community.

<P>Reduced Permitting Requirements for Closing Hazardous Waste
Management Facilities: Last November, EPA proposed a rule that
expands and improves the options available to businesses closing
hazardous waste disposal facilities. The rule, when final, will
allow EPA to use administrative orders instead of permits to
expedite the closure of these facilities and the initiation of
their cleanup.


<P>Reducing Air Permitting Burdens for Plant Expansion or Construction: EPA will next month announce changes to itspre-construction review permit program under the Clean Air Act. The changes will increase flexibility and reduce burdens on industry, the first such overhaul in over 15 years. These permits are required when an industry or another major source wants to
construct or make significant modifications to a facility,
traditionally a cumbersome and time-consuming process known as New Source Review (NSR). EPA launched a consultative effort with
industry, states and environmental groups to simplify the NSR
process and produced a series of reforms. One such reform allows
plants to operate under a plant-wide emission cap, which means a
facility manager can make physical modifications at any time
without being subject to customary NSR permitting restrictions if
they make off-setting emissions reductions elsewhere in the plant.  This allows for flexibility and cost effective management in achieving the goals of the Clean Air Act. Businesses can then respond more quickly to changing market conditions without waiting for a permit. This EPA announcement will deregulate clean emissions units and pollution control and pollution prevention projects so that red tape will no longer delay common sense, cost-effective changes that are environmentally sound.

<P>Amended Toxics Release Inventory Reporting Requirements to Reduce
Burden on Industry for Lower-level Releases: The Toxics Release
Inventory (TRI) is a database that enables Americans to learn about pollution in their communities and participate in decisions that affect them. TRI requires facilities that manufacture or use listed toxic chemicals to report their annual releases to the environment. Last November, EPA amended TRI reporting requirements by reducing the amount of information that must be submitted by facilities that release or transfer less than 500 pounds of a listed chemical. EPA estimates that this streamlining effort will reduce the national burden on industry by 400,000 hours or &#036;20 million per year, while maintaining important public health protections. In a separate action this summer, EPA will propose guidance to clarify what information must be reported by industry under the TRI, which will enable the public to better use the data reported and increase data consistency between facilities and industries. EPA will also redesign a key inventory reporting form to incorporate the latest pollution prevention principles and reduce some of the industry burden associated with its completion. 

<P>Streamlining New Chemical Review Approvals and Risk Reviews: The
Toxic Substances Control Act requires that chemical manufacturers
notify EPA of risks posed by new chemicals prior to their
manufacture. EPA has recently streamlined this program by expanding exemptions from filing requirements for certain low-risk or low-volume chemicals and for those with very limited human exposure. These changes will result in a 30 percent reduction in the number of notices required under this program, lowering
administrative costs to EPA and providing regulatory relief to many small businesses that develop and manufacture new chemicals. EPA is also developing a program to permit electronic data submission. EPA also proposed changes to the form used to report risk information on chemicals that will decrease the types of information that must be included in cases where they are already being submitted to EPA and the states under other EPA-administered statutes. EPA has also undertaken a study to identify types of health and environmental effects information being submitted that have limited practical utility.

<P>Cut Red Tape To Enable Safer Biological Pesticides to Be Used:
Ninety percent of biological and microbial pesticides pose little
or no threat to human health because people are not exposed to
them. Accordingly, EPA issued a final rule that eliminates the
customary requirement for an Experimental Use Permit for these
pesticides. Experimental Use Permits are normally granted for
testing the product on a limited acreage plot for a specified time period in order to determine its effectiveness and safety. Eliminating this requirement for this category of safer pesticide products will allow them to enter the market more quickly and cheaply, thus promoting their development and use as a safer
alternative.

<P>Reduced Reporting Requirements for Lower-Volume Releases: The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (CERCLA) establishes EPA authority to respond to releases, or
threats of releases of specified hazardous substances. Under this
law, EPA establishes &quot;reportable quantity&quot; levels that trigger
reporting of the release to the government. The government then
determines whether an action responding to the release is needed.
In an effort to reduce reporting burdens on industry, EPA has
identified specific rules where it can adjust upward the threshold at which reporting becomes necessary. This has the effect of deregulating releases at a level lower than the specified threshold, saving both industry and governmental time and resources. These threshold adjustments also enable EPA to focus its attention on the most serious hazardous substance releases. For example, EPA will this spring propose to raise the threshold for five broad categories of hazardous air pollutants. For example, one of these pollutants, ethlyene glycol, is used for deicing airplanes and also as an antifreeze. Consumers have been required to report leaks in their radiators to federal and state officials and airlines have needed to report every time they de-ice a plane. This rule will reduce such reporting requirements. The final rule is expected to result in annual net cost savings of &#036;500,000.

<P><H3>BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY, COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT</H3>

<P>Increased Incentives to Use Small Business Assistance Programs
Designed to Aid Compliance with the Clean Air Act: Small businesses often have technical difficulty understanding their obligations under EPA laws. To assist small businesses in complying with air pollution regulations, the Clean Air Act required states to adopt small business compliance assistance programs. When it was found that small businesses were hesitating to use the programs, EPA issued a new policy last August to address their concerns. Under this policy, states have been granted flexibility to offer a small business a window of opportunity to correct a violation discovered through their participation in the assistance program without penalty. Alternatively, a state may keep information on violations detected through such a program confidential from its enforcement division. These incentives are expected to increase use of this innovative program, thereby increasing compliance and reducing
pollution. High Priority Action #14 in the main portion of this
report takes this clean air program as a starting point and calls
for its expansion to other EPA-administered laws.

<P>Made the Federal Government Accountable for Its Own Pollution By
Requiring Public Reporting and Reduction of Toxic Releases:
President Clinton signed an Executive Order directing federal
agencies to comply with the reporting requirements imposed on the
private sector for toxic pollution releases, and to voluntarily
reduce by 50 percent their releases or off-site transfers of those chemicals by 1999. EPA has played a key role in implementing the order, by preparing guidance documents outlining Federal agency pollution prevention strategies and facility-level plans. EPA also drafted a &quot;Code of Environmental Principles&quot; to implement the Order's &quot;Federal Government Environmental Challenge Program.&quot; Sixteen Federal agencies have prepared draft strategies for meeting the requirements of the Order.

<P>Streamlined Compliance Inspections: EPA launched an effort to
evaluate different approaches to multi-media compliance inspections so that businesses will not have to suffer through multiple visits from compartmentalized government bureaucrats interested only in individual media such as air pollution or water pollution or solid waste. EPA will develop a sector-specific compliance checklist to streamline inspections, initially for the printing industry and subsequently for other small business-dominated sectors, including dry cleaning.

<P>Creating a Model Regulatory Assistance Service Center for Metal
Finishing Industry: As part of the Common Sense Initiative
(described above under &quot;Building Partnerships&quot;), EPA is
establishing a Metal Finishing Service Center with the Commerce
Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology to
provide businesses in this sector with easy access to comprehensive information on polluting prevention opportunities, regulatory
compliance requirements in plain English, and technologies and
techniques for reducing pollution in the most competitive manner.
The Center will make its services available to state and local
technical assistance programs. Similar centers will be established for other sectors in the future.

<P>
<P><H3>THE POWER OF INFORMATION</H3>

<P>Developed Systematic Database for Tailoring Compliance Strategies
to Specific Industries: Recognizing that government must fully
understand the businesses and operations which it regulates, EPA
organized a new compliance assurance office on an industry-by-
industry basis instead of the customary air, water, solid waste and pesticide compartments. To establish a firm informational basis for the new office's activities, EPA has compiled comprehensive profiles of eighteen industries, mostly small-business-dominated ones. These notebooks contain detailed descriptions of industrial processes, regulatory requirements, historical compliance data, and opportunities for pollution prevention. This information will promote businesses' self-evaluation and enhance the inspection process.

<P>Clarified Government Guidance to Reduce Rejections of Pesticide
Applications: EPA substantially re-engineered the process by which it reviews data submitted on the safety of pesticides and makes decisions to reject or approve their use. By systematically identifying the factors underlying rejections and working with industry to clarify scientific guidance so that they no longer recur, EPA has succeeded in expediting the process and has recently been completing a record number of pesticide reviews. Overall rejection rates are much reduced. This has reduced the cost to industry of obtaining pesticide approvals, since they are undertaking fewer studies that have preventable flaws. In response to the project, pesticide companies have also strengthened their quality control procedures and are producing better data. This promising new cooperation between EPA and the regulated community has reduced the cost and time required to bring new, safer pesticides to market, while cutting EPA's administrative expenditures.

<P>Authorized State to Manage a Hazardous Chemical Rather than
Imposing a Regulation: Dichloroethane is a probable human
carcinogen. It is also a high-volume chemical with substantial air and water releases, as reported in the Toxics Release Inventory.  EPA's Existing Chemicals Program conducted an analysis which found that the majority of the risk was from one facility in the State of Indiana. Rather than using a command-and-control approach, EPA provided the information to the State of Indiana whose action resulted in the company implementing significant pollution
prevention steps. These actions led to an immediate reduction in
Diochloroethane emissions to virtually zero. This case also helped EPA initiate a dialogue with the Chemical Manufacturers Association on product stewardship, including the responsibilities of companies to assist their customers in the proper use of chemical products.

<P>Used Education Rather than Regulation to Reduce Health Risks from
the Cultural Use of Mercury: EPA faced a special challenge in
addressing the risks of mercury poisoning stemming from cultural
and ritual uses of metallic mercury, such as the sprinkling of
mercury in homes or vehicles, adding mercury to floor washes,
burning mercury in candles, carrying mercury as a charm, and
ingesting mercury as a folk medicinal remedy. Many such practices
originated in Caribbean and Latin American cultures, and came with Spanish and Haitian Creole-speaking immigrants to the United
States. Concerned that regulatory action to restrict the use or
sale of mercury could infringe on First Amendment religious
freedoms and drive the practices themselves underground, EPA
consulted with national Hispanic organizations and embarked instead on a public education campaign to warn people of mercury hazards and encourage them to use less hazardous substances. EPA contracted with the Hispanic Radio Network for a series of Spanish language radio broadcasts discussing mercury dangers, broadcasted last September, and prepared multi-lingual fact sheets on risks. Because of the affected community's distrust of government authority, EPA is also working with the U.S. Catholic Conference to encourage their distribution of mercury warning materials. This effort reflects EPA's commitment to working flexibly with specially vulnerable communities to devise appropriate solutions.

<H2 align=center>THE NEW SBA REINVENTING SERVICE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY</H2>



<P>
<H3><A NAME=new>A New Strategy</A></H3>
<P>The Clinton/Gore Administration has pursued an
economic strategy that promotes economic growth,
reduces the deficit, expands trade, invests in
people, and reforms the Government to make it cost
less and perform better.  The results are clear. 
The combined rate of unemployment and inflation is
at a 25-year low.  The deficit has been reduced by
&#036;600 billion.  The Federal Government is being cut
down to size -- and it is on its way to
becoming the smallest it has been since President
Kennedy was in office.   

<P>We have begun not only to shrink the size of
Government, but to change the way Government
operates and the way it regulates the private
sector.  Government must be a partner with business,
and small businesses in particular, in creating jobs
and expanding economic growth.  

<P>America's small business owners foster our Nation's
economic growth and prosperity.  They expect and
deserve a Federal Government that lends a helping
hand when it is needed and uses an even hand in
applying its regulatory powers.  With these goals in
mind, President Clinton asked the Small Business
Administration (&quot;SBA&quot;) to work with small businesses
to better understand their needs and to serve them
more effectively.  This outreach is working.  SBA
has expanded its loan programs, reduced its own
paperwork and regulations, and championed a
government-wide effort to streamline regulations.  
It will accomplish even more in the months to come. 

<P>This report contains a description of SBA's recent
successes and proposed initiatives as it works to
reinvent its own operations and to lessen small
business regulatory burdens.

<P>
<H3> <A NAME=new>A New SBA</A></H3>

<P>The Clinton/Gore Administration is committed to our
Nation's small business community.  It has fulfilled
that commitment in part by maintaining a vibrant SBA
that is expanding its assistance to small businesses
and reducing taxpayer costs. 

<P>The number of small businesses is growing rapidly --
during the last decade, more than 600,000 new firms
have been created annually.  Just last year, more
small businesses were created than at any time in
our country's history.  Throughout this period,
small businesses created most of the Nation's new
jobs.  Today, they employ nearly 60 percent of the
country's private work force.  To help maintain and
promote this growth, SBA has taken several important
steps during the last two years and has plans to
institute many more reforms.  In doing so, the
agency has worked closely with its customers to
ensure that it is providing the right products for
the small business marketplace.    

<P>In order to promote access to credit, SBA provides
loan guarantees to participating lenders under a
variety of programs.   In fiscal year 1995, nearly
&#036;11.5 billion in long-term credit and other
financial assistance will be provided to more than
67,000 small businesses through SBA's network of
participating banks, non-bank lenders, certified
development companies, and SBA-licensed companies.  

<P>SBA has made significant reforms to expand its loan
guarantee and capital formation assistance.  For
example, the new &quot;LowDoc&quot; program features an easy,
one-page application and a rapid response, usually
within two or three days, for Section 7(a) loan
guarantees up to &#036;100,000.  In fiscal year 1993, the
year before the program was implemented, 30 percent
of SBA's guaranteed loans were under &#036;100,000.  Thus
far in fiscal year 1995, the figure is 63 percent. 

<P>SBA has proposed legislation that would dramatically
reduce the government's cost of the Agency's
financing programs while expanding the number of
small businesses served. If these proposals are
adopted, SBA will provide financing to more than
92,000 small firms in fiscal year 1996 and reduce to
zero the government's subsidy cost of providing
small business loans under both the 7(a) and 504
programs.  

<P>  SBA provides much-needed business education and
training to small business owners. In 1994 the
Agency provided counseling and training to more than
800,000 of its small business clients through
resource partners such as Small Business Development
Centers (SBDCs) and the Service Corps of Retired
Executives (SCORE).  SBA is also leading efforts to
create a &quot;one-stop&quot; electronic point of contact for
all government business, economic and regulatory
information that small businesses need to make
informed decisions.  This &quot;U.S. Business Advisor&quot;
will soon be available to help make small businesses
more efficient, productive and competitive in the
global economy.  

<P>SBA acts as a strong advocate throughout the
government on behalf of small businesses.  It does
so through specific programs, including the
government contracting assistance programs and the
Small Business Innovative Research program.  But
true advocacy must go beyond SBA's own programs to
include the broad scope of federal government
involvement with small businesses. 

<P>Accordingly, SBA has helped lead this
Administration's efforts to reduce regulatory
burdens on small business.  In 1994, it co-sponsored
an unprecedented interagency Small Business Forum on
Regulatory Reform.  Reflecting the serious work of
150 small business representatives and 80 government
employees, the Forum produced a detailed list of
findings and recommendations, many of which have
already been implemented by the participating
agencies.  On March 16, 1995, President Clinton
announced reform measures to give effect to the most
important of those recommendations:  a reduction in
the paperwork burden on small businesses and a
waiver of punitive actions against first-time
violators of certain regulations.  And, as part of a
general review of regulations recently completed at
the President's direction, SBA has committed to
revise all of its regulations by the end of calendar
year 1995, reducing their length by more than 50
percent.    

<P>SBA's disaster loans are the primary form of Federal
assistance for non-farm, private sector disaster
losses.  This program is the only SBA assistance not
limited to small businesses.  During the program's
41 years of existence, SBA has approved more than
1.25 million disaster loans, comprising &#036;22 billion
in assistance, for victims of physical disasters.
During the last two years, SBA has taken several
steps to simplify and expand access to its disaster
loan program.  Victims of disasters now find it
easier than ever before to reach out
to SBA for a helping hand. 

<P>President Clinton is determined to create a strong,
efficient, cost-effective SBA that works with our
Nation's small business community to expand access
to credit and capital, provide needed training and
assistance, and serve as an advocate and watchdog
for small business owners.   His efforts have shown
significant and tangible results -- demand for SBA
programs is up, paperwork and regulation are down;
service and customer satisfaction is at an all-time
high.  The new SBA knows that even more can and
should be done in the future; it will not cease its
efforts to do more for the small business community
in the months and years to come.    

<P>
<H3><A NAME=portfolio">Ten Principles for Reinventing Small Business Regulation </A></H3>
SBA is committed to ten key principles:
<OL>
<LI> Promoting better access to capital for small
business owners.  

<LI> Providing valuable small business education and
training services. 

<LI> Using government resources in an efficient and
cost-effective manner.

<LI> Working closely with the private sector to better
support and assist the small business community.  

<LI> Reducing paperwork burdens on small businesses
and streamlining regulations as much as possible.    
 
<LI> Serving as an advocate for reform of government
regulations so that they state clearly the rights
and responsibilities of small business owners and
the federal government. 

<LI> Working to assure that affected small businesses
are included at every important step in the
regulatory development process.

<LI> Striving to improve communications between the
federal government and affected small businesses to
ensure that regulations are understood and followed. 

<LI> Promoting voluntary small business compliance
with regulations through flexible enforcement
procedures.  

<LI> Assuring access to government business, economic
and regulatory information by using state-of-the-art
information technology.   
</OL>
<H3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND NEW INITIATIVES IN SBA'S &quot;PORTFOLIOS&quot;</H3>
 
During the past two years, SBA has made a concerted
effort to serve its constituency better. It has
eliminated requirements that no longer made sense,
reduced paperwork and forms that interfered with use
of its credit programs, and streamlined internal
procedures.  Although SBA regulations are primarily
designed to implement program delivery, rather than
to regulate small business conduct, SBA's efforts
have directly affected small business owners in
vital areas, such as improved access to credit and
business training.  In its overall role as an
advocate for small business interests, SBA has
championed a government-wide regulatory reform
effort.  The accomplishments and continuing
initiatives arising from these efforts are listed
below under the four &quot;portfolios&quot; -- access to
credit, business education and training, advocacy,
and disaster loan assistance --  that describe SBA's
programs.   

<H3><A NAME=access">Access to Credit</A></H3>

<P>SBA expands access to capital by providing credit,
through thousands of financial intermediaries, to
small businesses unable to obtain loans to start-up
or expand.  Traditionally, small firms have faced
serious problems obtaining long-term loans in the
private credit marketplace.  SBA has taken
substantial steps in the last two years to ensure
that its loan guarantee programs help the maximum
number of small businesses at minimum cost.  
<OL>
<LI> Low Documentation (LowDoc) Loan Program.  The
paperwork and red tape associated with small
SBA-guaranteed loans used to be an embarrassment. 
     
Today the LowDoc program features an easy, one-page
SBA application and a rapid response, usually within
two or three days, for loans up to &#036;100,000.  In
fiscal year 1993, the year before Low Doc was
implemented, 30 percent of SBA's guaranteed loans
were under &#036;100,000.  As of May 1995, the fiscal
year 1995 figure is 63 percent.  Overall, the 7(a)
program has grown from 27,000 loans (&#036;5.9 billion)
in fiscal year 1992 to 56,000 loans (&#036;7.8 billion)
projected for fiscal year 1995.  Early reports show
that loans made under the program are performing at
a better rate than those made during the same period
under the regular 7(a) program.  

<LI> The FA&#036;TRAK Program.  On February 27 of this
year, SBA launched a two year pilot program called
FA&#036;TRAK that   permits selected lenders (who share
risks with SBA on a 50/50 basis) to approve and
service loans up to &#036;100,000, while using their own
forms, documentation and procedures.       

<LI> Repeal of the Opinion Molder Rule.   Adopted in
1953, the media policy or &quot;opinion molder&quot; rule
prevented small media concerns such as booksellers,
radio stations and television production companies
from receiving SBA loan assistance.  Rather than try
to patch up the rule, SBA eliminated it entirely,    
thereby extending loan eligibility to approximately
75,000 media-related small business concerns it
could not previously serve.  

<LI> Reinvention of the 504 Business Development
Program. SBA's 504 program, which provide
sasset-based financing for growing small businesses,
historically has required cumbersome,
resource-intensive review procedures. 
<BR>
The new SBA has embarked upon a complete
streamlining of the 504 process from authorization
to closing.  On April 24, SBA instituted the first
phase, an expedited closing process in which SBA
will rely upon its resource partners, Certified
Development Companies, and their private counsel for
document preparation and review.  The time required
for SBA counsel's involvement in the closing process
will be trimmed by 80 percent.  Furthermore, final
rules were published in the Federal Register on
April 26, 1995, to establish an Accredited Lenders
Program and Premier Certified Lenders Program for
development companies.  Accredited lenders will
receive expedited review of loan applications, and
premier certified lenders will be allowed to
authorize, close and service loans.  Additional
procedural changes designed to  streamline overall
management of the program are scheduled to be in
place by August 1995.  

<LI> Women's Pre-Qualification.  The Women's
Pre-Qualification Loan Pilot Program was launched in
June 1994 to help increase the number of loans made
to women business owners by assisting them to
pre-qualify for SBA guarantees.  The program simplifies
the loan process for women business owners and makes
it more user-friendly.  Selected nonprofit loan packagers 
pre-screen and  present credit requests from women
entrepreneurs to SBA.  If SBA finds the borrower qualified,
it issues a pre-qualification letter which the loan applicant
can take to a commercial lender.  At the time the
pilot was launched, women, who own about 38 percent
of all small businesses, were receiving about 14
percent of SBA loan guarantees.  A year later, the
percentage is 24 percent, with further progress
anticipated.

<LI> Export Working Capital Program.  In October 1994,
the SBA reorganized its trade loan effort as the
Export Working Capital Program (EWCP) to help small
businesses obtain export financing.  Most commercial
lenders consider small trade loans too risky and
time-consuming, particularly for transactions under
&#036;1,000,000.  In conjunction with the Export-Import
Bank, SBA's EWCP offers streamlined application
procedures, a simplified application, a higher
guarantee and two kinds of loans, both well-suited
for export financing.

<LI> Small Business Investment Companies.  The Small
Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is a
unique partnership of public and private funds, in
which SBA supplements the capital of private venture
capital firms.  During the past two years, SBA has
worked with the private venture capital industry to  
completely revise SBIC regulations, virtually
rebuilding the SBIC program, strengthening
oversight, management screening and credit review,
and creating a new class of larger, better
capitalized SBICs that will provide a profit
participation to the government.  In 1994, the SBIC
program attracted more private capital (&#036;520
million) than in the previous 10 years combined.  

<LI> CAPlines. All of SBA's short-term and revolving
lines of credit operate under the new CAPlines
umbrella.  Under the various CAPlines components,
the SBA provides financing for asset-based,
seasonal, contract and builders' lines of      
credit.  Recently, the SBA took steps to make its
asset-based lending program more customer-friendly
by introducing a new, less complicated, and less
costly program to handle asset-based revolving lines
of credit in amounts up to &#036;200,000.

<LI> Computer-Generated SBA Loan Forms.   SBA has
proposed rules that would allow lenders
participating in the business and development
company loan programs to utilize computer-generated
facsimile copies of SBA application and closing
forms in making SBA guaranteed loans.  With advances
in technology, SBA recognizes that its forms may be
reproduced as exact copies by computers. The use of
these reproductions may in many cases help expedite
the processing of SBA guaranteed loans.
     
<LI> Proposed Loan Program Reforms.  SBA has proposed
legislative changes that would dramatically reduce
the government's cost of the Agency's financing
programs, while expanding the number of small
businesses served.  Current demand for the Agency's
Section 7(a) and 504 loan programs far exceeds fund
availability.  Through the institution of adjusted
guarantee percentages and marginal fee increases,
SBA can eliminate all federal subsidy costs, thereby
assisting more small businesses while decreasing
taxpayer costs.  If SBA's proposals are adopted, SBA
expects to provide financing to more than 92,000
small firms in fiscal year 1996.  
</OL>




<P>
<H3><A NAME=business>Business Education and Training</A></H3>

SBA provides business and education training to
small business owners through resource partners such
as the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)
and the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE). 
These programs, in addition to SBA's Business
Information Centers, training seminars and
publications, often make the difference between
success and failure for small businesses. 

<P>SBA is at the center of the government-wide effort
to create a &quot;one-stop&quot; electronic point of contact
and access for all the business, economic and
regulatory information that small businesses need to
make informed decisions.  An electronic information
and service delivery system for businesses in the
United States -- the &quot;U.S. Business Advisor&quot; -- will
soon offer initial solutions to make small
businesses more efficient, productive and
competitive in the global economy.  Initially, the
U.S. Business Advisor will access selected sources
of important government information, including
health, safety and environmental regulations, the
Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations, the National
Trade Data Bank and EPA and OSHA regulatory,
guidance and compliance assistance.  When fully
developed in the regulatory area, it will allow easy
access to a broad range of regulatory guidance and
compliance assistance.  

<P>SBA's Business Information Centers (BICs) offer the
latest in high-technology hardware, software and
telecommunications to assist small business.  In
addition, at BICs small business owners receive
one-on-one counseling with seasoned business people
through the Service Corps of Retired Executives
(SCORE).   SBA is working to expand its network of
BICs.  With the recent openings of BICs in Fairmont,
West Virginia, El Paso and Charleston, SBA now has
16 BICs in operation.  

<P>SBA's Cosponsorship program provides training and
counseling for small businesses through joint
activities with the private sector.  SBA's standard
operating procedures (SOP) for the program were
complex and inhibiting, micromanaging the process
from the central office and imposing considerable
paperwork burdens upon cosponsors.  SBA has
thoroughly streamlined the SOP, reducing it from 76
pages to 26, increasing field office flexibility and
responsibility, removing financial and paperwork
constraints from private sector partners and
slashing internal paperwork requirements by more
than 75 percent. 

<P>The Small Business Development Center program is a
cooperative effort of the private sector, the
educational community and federal, state and local
governments to enhance economic development by
providing management and technical assistance to
small businesses.  Since the enactment of the
program in 1980, it has been operating under direct
statutory authority, without regulations. 
Responding to industry requests for the promulgation
of regulations, SBA published proposed regulations
on October 28, 1994. Praised by the private sector
as a clear, concise and understandable codification
of program procedures, the final regulations will be
published in the Federal Register this week.  In
addition, SBA's reinvention legislative proposal
would streamline the administration of the
SBDCs, reduce costs, and consolidate the women's and
minority training assistance programs under the SBDC
program. 

<H3><A NAME=advocacy>Advocacy</A></H3>

<P>SBA has championed Administration efforts to reduce
regulations on small businesses as part of its
government-wide advocacy role.  The President's
recent regulatory reform announcements reflected
recommendations from the unprecedented interagency
forum that SBA helped launch last year.  Many other 
regulatory reform recommendations identified through
SBA regulatory reform efforts are now being announced
 and implemented by other agencies as part
of the National Performance Review's second phase.   


<H3><A NAME=regulatory>Regulatory Reform Successes</A></H3>

<P>The President recently directed each Federal agency
to review all of its regulations for effectiveness
and clarity of language.  He also issued two
specific directives aimed at simplifying the
regulatory process.  
<OL>
<LI> General Regulatory Review. On March 4, 1995,
President Clinton issued a directive to all Federal
agencies to examine regulations for effectiveness
and clarity of language.  In response, SBA brought
together attorneys, program officials and front-line
regulators from across the country.  They met with
the regulated community -- bankers, small business
owners, government contractors -- to discuss ways to
improve SBA regulations in all program areas.  These
efforts have resulted in plans to clarify and
streamline existing SBA regulations, reducing them
in length by more than half.  Implementation of the
suggested changes has already begun and should be
completed by the end of the year.                                          
             
<LI> Waiver of Fines and Right to Cure.   On April 21,
President Clinton issued a Memorandum on Regulatory
Reform directing agencies to waive up to 100 percent
of any punitive fine on a small business if the
small business corrects the violations within an
appropriate time period.  The government also will
offer small businesses an opportunity to avoid
punitive action by applying any fine actually levied
towards correcting the violations leading to the
fine.  These policies apply to first-time violations
and those that do not threaten safety and
health or involve criminal wrongdoing.  

<LI> Reduced Paperwork Requirements.   In that same
April 21 Memorandum, President Clinton directed that
many regularly scheduled reports to the Federal
Government now be required only half as often
(quarterly reports will be semi-annual, semi-annual
reports will be annual, etc.).  This will help small
business owners significantly.  
 </OL>

<H3><A NAME=continued>Continued Reform Efforts</A></H3>

<P>SBA will continue to work with EPA, OSHA and other
agencies to address small business concerns as part
of the President's reinventing government
initiative: 
<OL>
<LI> Regulatory Development.   A regulating agency
should attempt to identify the affected community
very early in the regulatory process.  Mechanisms
and procedures should be established for effective
two-way communication and interaction with affected
small businesses at every important step in the
development process.  Such businesses are and should
be encouraged to provide comments, data and other
information for use in the underlying regulatory
studies, evaluations, and analyses.  If potential
adverse impacts and unintended consequences can be
identified and mitigated, future compliance problems
and litigation can be reduced.  

<LI>Communications.  To help improve communications
between agencies and small businesses, SBA is
working with those agencies to develop strategies
for disseminating regulatory information to affected
industries on a regular basis. The electronic &quot;U.S.
Business Advisor&quot; should play a valuable role in
this regard.

<LI> Compliance and Enforcement.  Voluntary small
business compliance with regulations is important
for protecting health and safety.  SBA is working
closely with agencies to implement procedures, such
as those already proposed by President Clinton, that
emphasis cooperation and teamwork, rather than the
use of intimidation and punitive enforcement to
improve regulatory compliance. By working together,
everyone benefits.

<H3><A NAME=disaster>Disaster Loan Assistance</A></H3>

<P>SBA's disaster loans are the primary form of Federal
assistance for nonfarm, private sector disaster
losses.  SBA provides long-term, low interest loans
to cover those losses not compensated for by private
insurance.  The disaster loan program is the only
form of SBA assistance not limited to small
businesses.  SBA's disaster loans are available to
homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and
nonprofit organizations. Given the rising Federal
costs resulting from the tremendous level of 
disasters experienced over the last six years, SBA
is participating in a Government-wide effort to
reform the way it responds to disasters.   During 
the last two years, SBA has taken steps to
reinvent the program by simplifying the loan
application process and increasing its loan limits. 
Its recent legislative proposal to Congress would
greatly reduce the subsidy rate for disaster
assistance, making more loans available at a lower
cost to taxpayers.

<H2> BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF SBA'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND INITIATIVES</H2>

<H3>Access to Credit</H3>

<P><H3>The Low Documentation Loan Program (LowDoc) </H3>

<P>Action:   Introduce an easy, one-page SBA
application and a rapid response, usually within two
or three days, for loans up to &#036;100,000.

<P>Background:  The need for a program like LowDoc
became evident at a series of town hall meetings
held around the country during the Spring of 1993. 
One complaint was heard time after time -- small
businesses were unable to find lenders able or
willing to provide loans in amounts under &#036;100,000.  

<P>Description:   LowDoc is one of the best examples of
the recent innovative changes SBA has made in the
7(a) lending program.   The program was designed to
increase the access that businesses have to smaller
loans by reducing the paperwork burden imposed on
lenders for these loans.  The SBA LowDoc application
is only one page.  This single sheet is both the
applicant's SBA loan application and the lender's
request for an SBA guarantee.  This
application is a distillation of all the information
previously required from applicants on a series of
forms and required attachments.  The lender still
requests whatever additional information it requires
to make an appropriate credit decision.  

<P>The LowDoc program was piloted in Texas beginning in
December of 1993 and was expanded nationally last
summer.  During the expansion phase each SBA
district office selected lenders within its market
area to participate in LowDoc.  Because the LowDoc
application evaluation requires a high degree of
experience and judgment on the part of the
participant lender, lender selections were based on
past and/or projected levels of activity, the degree
of success achieved in the lender's SBA loan
portfolio, and the lender's cooperativeness and
dedication to meeting the financing need of small
business.  Expansion of the program nationally was
accomplished over time with SBA certifying its
personnel as competent to process LowDoc
applications only after they had taken an intensive
two-day training course.  

<P>The program has been extremely well received by both
SBA's borrowers and participating lenders.  During
fiscal year 1994, the SBA approved nearly 6,000
LowDoc loans totalling approximately &#036;316 million. 
As of April 10, 1995, the SBA had approved 18,296
LowDoc loans totalling approximately &#036;1 billion. 
SBA anticipates that approximately 35,000 LowDoc
loans will be approved during fiscal year 1995.   

<P>Early reports show that loans made under the program
are performing at a better rate than those made
during the same period under the regular 7(a)
program.  Even though these preliminary results on
program performance are good, SBA continues to
monitor the LowDoc program closely.  The results of
examinations of the lenders' credit analyses are
very positive.  Future plans for the program call
for on-going monitoring and sampling to assure that
the same high quality performance by the lenders
continues.   

<P>To improve the procedural efficiency of the LowDoc
program, on May 1, 1995, SBA announced plans to
centralize LowDoc processing at three sites: 
Sacramento, California; Madison, Wisconsin; and
Melville, New York.  The processing centers will
enable the SBA to achieve economies of scale and to
take advantage of the latest in technology.  


<P>They will also help to assure a high degree of
consistency in the loan consideration process. 
These centers will be operational in mid- to late
July, 1995.   

<H3>The FA&#036;TRAK Program</H3>

<P>Action:   Implement a pilot program that allows
selected lenders who agree to share risks on a 50/50
basis to approve and service loans up to &#036;100,000,
while using their own forms, documentation and
procedures. 

<P>Background:   In another effort to streamline the
7(a) program, SBA worked closely last year with some
of its lending partners to develop an exciting new
pilot program called FA&#036;TRAK.  This pilot program is
designed to increase the availability of smaller
loans for SBA customers and to decrease the
paperwork burden imposed on the Agency's lending
partners.

<P>Description:   Under the FA&#036;TRAK pilot, which began
on February 27 of this year and is scheduled to last
two years, 18 selected lenders are authorized to
make, service and liquidate loans in amounts up to
&#036;100,000 using their own application and
disbursement documents and processes.  Lenders
participating in the pilot program are given the
ability to attach an SBA guarantee to an approved
loan without having to submit the loan application
to an SBA field office for a credit analysis or
review.  These loans are sent to a single location
for assignment of an SBA loan number and a
determination of borrower eligibility.  

<P>In exchange for the convenience of using their own
forms and processes, lenders agree to limit the loan
amount to &#036;100,000, accept a maximum guarantee of 50
percent, and waive payment on defaulted loans until
after the lender has completed liquidation and SBA
has reviewed the underlying documentation supporting
the loan.   As of April 28, 1995, SBA had approved
46 FA&#036;TRAK loans totalling &#036;2.0 million.    

<P>
<P><H3>Repeal of the Media Policy (Opinion Molder) Rule</H3>

<P>Action:   Repeal the rule barring loan assistance to
media-related small business concerns.     

<P>Background:   The media policy rule was adopted in
1953 and prevented small media concerns such as
booksellers, radio stations and television
production companies from eligibility for SBA loan
assistance.   The rule remained in effect despite
the fact that small media concerns often have
difficulty raising capital or borrowing money.  

<P>Description:   In October, 1994, SBA repealed the
media policy  rule, thereby extending loan
eligibility to approximately 75,000 small business
concerns it could not previously serve.  This change
in policy enables SBA to promote job growth and
economic development by making financial assistance
available to a larger number of small business
concerns.  

<P>Repeal of this rule has created a very broad list of
newly-eligible enterprises that includes
broadcasters, movie theaters, publishers, producers,
importers, exporters or distributors of all types of
communications (such as newspapers, sheet music,
posters, film, tape, theatrical productions,
greeting cards, and books), plus transportation
concerns limited to the distribution of such
products.  

<P><H3>Reinvention of the 504 Business Development Loan
Program </H3>

<P>Action:   Streamline the 504 loan process from
authorization to closing; establish the Accredited
Lenders Program and the Premier Certified Lender
program.  

<P>Background:   SBA provides asset-based financing to
small businesses through its 504 Certified
Development Company program.  The program makes
loans available for acquiring land, buildings,
machinery and equipment, and for building,
modernizing, renovating or restoring existing
facilities and sites.  

<P>A &quot;certified development company&quot; (CDC) is a
private, public sector non-profit corporation that
is set up to contribute to the economic development
of its community or region.  CDCs can sell 100
percent SBA-guaranteed debentures to private
investors in amounts up to 40 percent of a project
or &#036;750,000, whichever is less.  The CDC program has
in the past required cumbersome, resource-intensive
review procedures.   

<P>Description:   SBA is in the process of a complete
streamlining of the 504 loan process from
authorization to closing, including regulations,
internal operating procedures, forms and agreements. 
On April 24, it implemented the first steps to
expedite the processing of 504 loan closings.  Any
qualified CDC may now apply for approval to use this
expedited procedure, which allows the CDC and its
private counsel to perform document preparation
and review.  Specifically, SBA attorney review time
will be reduced from a current average of four
hours, to a new average of 20 minutes per loan
package.  

<P>While it moves forward in its effort to streamline
the closing process, SBA has taken steps to expedite
the application stage of the program.  On April 26,
1995, a final rule was published establishing an
Accredited Lenders Program (ALP) for Certified
Development Companies that provides for expedited
processing of loan applications and servicing
actions by SBA field offices.   Development
companies with a proven track record in the
submission of documentation needed for making and
servicing of sound loans may qualify as accredited
lenders.  Applications submitted by these lenders
will be processed by SBA within three working days. 
The ALP is intended to build upon the successful
Certified Lenders Program for SBA's General Business
Loan program and the pilot Accredited Lenders
Program for CDCs which has been administered by SBA
since 1991.  The positive experience with the pilot
led to its statutory authorization in The Small
Business Administration Amendments Act of 1994, P.L.
103-403.  The final rule implements the program.

<P>The same law established a Premier Certified Lenders
Program (PCLP) to be administered by SBA on a
three-year pilot basis.  The final rule implementing
the PCLP was published on April 26, 1995.  The
program is modeled after the Preferred Lender
Program for the SBA's General Business Loan Program. 
The PCLP development company will agree to share the
risk of loan making, and in return SBA will delegate
authority to the company for the purpose of
authorizing, closing and servicing loans. The
program responds to the significant increase in
development company loan activity and recognizes the
growing strength and capability of CDCs.    

<P>In addition, SBA is working closely with its CDC
resource partners to improve its overall management
of the 504 program.  Working groups composed of SBA
personnel and CDC representatives from around the
country are in the process of examining the loan
application process, credit analysis, loan closing
and loan servicing.  To streamline delivery of the
program, SBA will clearly define and centralize the
responsibility for data collection and maintenance,
minimize paper flow, make maximum use of
communications and database technology, and assure
that access to database information will be
integrated for ease of use. These changes are
scheduled to be in place no later than August 31,
1995.     
     

<P><H3>Women's Pre-Qualification Pilot Loan Program</H3>

<P>Action:   Implement a pilot program to increase the
number of loans made to women business owners by
assisting them to pre-qualify for SBA loan
guarantees.  

<P>Background:   Last year, SBA examined closely its
record of lending to women-owned businesses and
found that historically only approximately 10 to 12
percent of SBA loans and loan guaranties have gone
to women-owned businesses.  Statistics show that
women-owned businesses constitute more than
one-third of all small businesses and that women are
starting businesses at a faster rate than their male
counterparts.  Therefore, SBA felt that it was
necessary to look at new ways to improve its ability
to meet the borrowing needs of women business
owners.  

<P>Description:   The Women's Pre-Qualification Pilot
program allows SBA to review and pre-qualify loans
for women-owned businesses prior to their submission
to a participating lender.  The SBA
pre-qualification letter assures the lender that SBA
has seen the loan application and has determined
that, if the lender agrees to make the loan, an SBA
guarantee will be available. 

<P>The pilot began June 1, 1994, and there are
presently 16 pilot sites across the country.  SBA
has contracted with the Women's Business Development
Center in Chicago to gather data and help evaluate
the effectiveness of the first six months of the
pilot's operations.  The results of this evaluation
will help  SBA decide whether the program should
continue as is, be changed, expanded, or
discontinued.  

<P><H3>The Export Working Capital Program</H3>

<P>Action:   Help small businesses obtain financing for
export purposes by working with the Export/Import
Bank on a one-year pilot program that streamlines
procedures and offers a
higher guarantee percentage. 
 
Background:   Trade loans are loans to exporters
which cover specific transactions, or export deals. 
They are short term in nature (6 to 12 months in
duration), and, unlike most regular business loans,
collateral is generally the goods involved in the
export deal.  

<P>Many private sector lenders have little or no
experience with trade loans under &#036;1 million. 
Because they are not familiar with these loans,
lenders believe that they are too risky and
time-consuming to be commercially reasonable.  Yet
it is precisely these smaller loans that many small
exporters need. 

<P>Description:   SBA has refined its 7(a) program to
meet this gap in private sector lending for export
purposes.  SBA has carefully designed a program to
provide small business with the working capital
necessary to support their export transactions.  On
October 1, 1994, SBA kicked off the Export Working
Capital Program, which is operating on a one-year
pilot basis.  

<P>In order to make this program operate most
effectively, the Administration requested, and
Congress approved, a harmonization, or blending, of
the SBA export working capital program with the
finance program of the U.S. Export-Import Bank
(Eximbank).  As part of this harmonization, SBA
adopted Eximbank's practice of providing preliminary
commitments to exporters with SBA, not the lender,
reviewing the loan  application first, in a manner
similar to the Women's pre-qualification program.

<P>SBA also revised its fee and interest rate policies
to allow participating lenders a more reasonable
return on their investment by assessing their risk
and charging the appropriate market rate, usually 2
to 3 percentage points over prime.  It  recently
authorized 16 participating lenders to process EWCP
loans under the expedited Preferred Lenders Program. 
SBA worked with Eximbank to develop a simplified,
user friendly, joint application form which now lets
the exporter apply either to SBA or Eximbank
depending on the loan amount requested with the
larger loans going to Eximbank and smaller loans 
going to SBA.  It developed joint lenders' guides
and instructions and, with the support of the Congress,
obtained the legislative changes necessary to allow SBA to
guarantee 90 percent of the EWCP loan and the
authority to guarantee standby letters of credit, an
increasingly common feature of many international
sales contracts. 

<P>SBA is committed to making this program a success. 
It is carefully monitoring the program during the
pilot period and will refine it wherever necessary
to assure that it delivers a product that meets the
needs of the small business exporting community. 
SBA has set a national goal for fiscal year 1995 of
approximately 1,600 international trade-related
loans under the 7(a) business loan program.  Within
that goal, SBA has a sub-target of 300 loans under
the EWCP.  

<P><H3>Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs)</H3>

<P>Action:   Revise Small Business Investment Company
regulations, strengthen oversight, management
screening and credit review, and create a class of
larger, better capitalized SBICs. 

<P>Background:   Small Business Investment Companies
(SBICs) represent a unique public/private sector
partnership for providing risk capital to small
businesses.  SBICs are privately-owned and managed
 investment firms (corporations or partnerships) licensed by 
SBA to  provide equity and long-term subordinated debt
financing to small businesses for their sound
financing and to promote their growth, modernization
or expansion.  SBA supplements an SBIC's private
capital by either guaranteeing their securities
which are funded in the public markets or by
purchasing their securities.  

<P>The program makes funding available to all types of
manufacturing and service industries.  Many
investment companies seek out small businesses with
new products or services because of the strong
growth potential of such firms.  Some SBICs
specialize in the field in which their management
has special knowledge or competency.  Most, however,
consider a wide variety of investment opportunities. 
   
Description:   The Small Business Equity Enhancement
Act of 1992 restructured the SBIC program, making it
more effective in providing risk capital to small
businesses than at any time in its 35-year history. 
In addition, over the last two years SBA has worked
with the private venture capital industry to
completely revise SBIC regulations.  Oversight has
been strengthened, management and credit review have
been enhanced, and a new class of larger, better
capitalized SBICs has been created.  As a result, in
1994, the SBIC program attracted more private
capital (&#036;520 million) than in the previous 10 years
combined.       

<P><H3>CAPlines</H3>

<P>Action:   Implement nationally an enhanced revolving
line of credit program for small businesses.  

<P>Background:   SBA has traditionally offered a
long-term loan guarantee program.  Access to
long-term financing by small businesses has
historically been more difficult than for larger
businesses, which often have other financing
vehicles available to them.  Over the past several
years, it has become more and more common for SBA to
hear small businesses complain that short-term
credit sources have also become difficult to access. 
  
Description:   SBA offers short-term and revolving
lines of credit under the new CAPlines umbrella. 
Under the various CAPlines components, SBA provides
financing for various needs including asset-based,
seasonal, contract and builders' lines of credit. 
These programs help to finance the short-term
cyclical needs of many small business borrowers. 
CAPlines are not subject to the &#036;500,000 maximum
gross loan amount limitation currently in place, but
are limited to an SBA maximum share of the lesser of
75 percent of the loan amount or &#036;750,000.  

<P>The heart of SBA's asset-based lending program is
its ability to support lenders in their efforts to
provide businesses with short-term financing, based
on the business' cash cycle rather than its cash
flow over an established period of time.  Based on
its cash needs, the borrower may take advances from
the line of credit and must repay the line from cash
received, throughout the term of the loan.  This
assures that the loan will truly revolve.  

<P>Recently, SBA took steps to make its asset-based
lending program more customer-friendly.  Responding
to criticism that the monitoring requirements of the
program were too stringent and too expensive for
smaller asset-based revolving loans, SBA introduced
a new, less complicated, and less costly program to
handle asset-based revolving lines of credit in
amounts up to &#036;200,000.  

<P><H3>Computer-Generated SBA Business Loan Forms</H3>

<P>Action:   Propose rules to authorize SBA
participating lenders and development companies to
use computer-generated facsimile copies of SBA forms
in submitting loan applications and closing
documents.  

<P>Background:   SBA has required that its
participating lenders and development companies use
SBA-provided forms in the SBA business and
development company loan programs.  With advances in
technology, SBA recognizes that such forms may be
reproduced as exact copies by computers and that use
of these reproductions may in many cases help
expedite the processing of SBA guaranteed loans.  

<P>Description:   Under the proposed rules for the
business loan and development company programs,
lenders and development companies would be
authorized to use SBA application and closing forms
that they generate on the computer or from software
prepared by third parties.  This is an effort by SBA
to allow participating lenders and development
companies to take advantage of available
technologies to expedite the processing of loans. 
The copies must be exact; lenders and development
companies that use computer-generated forms agree to
accept liability for a substantial SBA loss due to
deficiencies in the forms.  

<P>The proposed rule for business loans was published
in the Federal Register on March 3, 1995.  The
proposed rule for the 504 Development Company Loan
Program was published in the Register on March 24,
1995.  

<P><H3>General Loan Program Reforms</H3>

<P>Action:   Increase customer access to SBA loan
guarantee programs while reducing the cost to
taxpayers.  

<P>Background:   A crucial aspect of SBA's reinvention
effort has been to seek ways to enhance its existing
programs and at the same time reduce costs to the
Federal Government. Presently, Congress must
appropriate an amount that anticipates the subsidy
cost of loan guarantees made by SBA in the upcoming
fiscal year.   Often, a supplemental appropriation
is required because loan demand is greater than
Congress expected.  As a result, lenders and
borrowers experience uncertainty about loan
availability.    

<P>Description:   The Clinton Administration has
submitted legislation that will reduce to zero the
SBA's subsidy rate for the 7(a) and 504 loan
programs.  These changes will allow SBA
to serve more small firms and to provide loans in
slightly larger amounts, while substantially
reducing the program's cost to the taxpayers.

<P>The zero subsidy rate will be achieved through a
series of adjustments to SBA's guarantee
percentages, interest rates, and program fee
structures.  These changes will allow SBA to
increase its maximum guarantee amount to &#036;1 million,
thus allowing small business borrowers with larger
funding needs to receive SBA assistance.  Care was
taken to assure that the fees charged to borrowers
would not make the program too expensive and that
the fees charged to lenders and the reductions in
guarantee percentages would not be so great as to
make use of the programs commercially impractical.  
SBA believes it has struck the proper balance, and
that the proposed changes would allow it to continue
to do more for small business, with less reliance on
taxpayers' funds. 

<P><H3>Business Education and Training </H3>

<P><H3>The U.S. Business Advisor</H3>

<P>Action:   Develop in cooperation with other federal
agencies a &quot;one-stop&quot; electronic point of contact
that small businesses can use to obtain business,
economic and regulatory information.  
 
Background:   Through more effective use of
technology and productive public/private
partnerships, small businesses can increase
productivity and cut costs.  In the new
information-age economy, knowledge and communication
are fundamental sources of wealth.  Current and
emerging technology is revolutionizing the way
business is done -- and is indispensable to managing
change.  In future years, no successful business
will be without access to the Internet, a sprawling
&quot;place&quot; where over a billion electronic-mail
messages go back and forth monthly among 35 million
users.

<P>Description:   SBA is at the center of a
government-wide effort to create a &quot;one-stop&quot;
electronic point of contact and access for all
business, economic and regulatory information that
small businesses need to make informed decisions. 
An electronic information and services delivery
system for businesses in the United States -- the
&quot;U.S. Business Advisor&quot; -- will soon be available to
offer initial solutions to make small businesses
more competitive in the global economy.

<P>Consisting of several divisions, the U.S. Business
Advisor will be accessed through the Internet and
offer government-wide access to financial and
regulatory information and resources, all in one
place.  Responding to the small business community's
need for better access to regulatory information and
compliance assistance, the first division to open
will be the Regulatory Assistance Center (RAC). 
     
Initially, RAC will access selected sources of
important government information, including federal
and state environment, safety and health statutes
and regulations; the Department of Commerce's
National Trade Data Bank, which contains information
on overseas markets, how-to guides for exporters,
general information on foreign countries, and over
60,000 foreign business contacts; a global
electronic commerce system for environmental
technology; EPA and OSHA compliance guides and
assistance; IRS forms; and Customs import
regulations.  As it evolves, RAC will become the
one-stop place to go for everything a business might
require to address its regulatory, reporting and
compliance needs.  It will allow easy access to a
full range of plain-language regulatory guidance and
compliance assistance information to help businesses
understand regulatory requirements, including
self-assessment tools, forms, training modules,
expert systems and best management practices.        
    
Increasingly, small businesses are demanding better,
faster, and more timely service from the Federal
Government.  Creating a customer-driven,
results-oriented Government that offers quality
service is an important goal of the Clinton
Administration.  Through technology and productive
partnerships, SBA and other federal agencies can
become more accessible and more responsive to small
businesses.  &quot;Opening&quot; the U.S. Business Advisor is
an important part of that process.  SBA will seek to
make the U.S. Business Advisor accessible to all
small business owners, regardless of their
technological capabilities.  It will
be made available via computer for those without
access to the Internet.  For those small business
people without a computer, various options are being
explored, including making the U.S. Business Advisor
accessible at SBA's 950 Small Business Development
Centers and sub-centers and its 16 Business
Information Centers.      

<P><H3>Business Information Centers </H3>

<P>Action:   Expand the network of Business Information
Centers (BICs) to provide better access for small
businesses to state-of-the-art technologies and
information sources.  

<P>Background:   During this time of rapid change,
small businesses need access to the latest in
high-technology hardware, software and
telecommunications in order to compete effectively
and grow.

<P>Description:   SBA's Business Information Centers
provide one-stop state-of-the-art assistance and
advice to small business owners plus one-on-one
counseling and training through the Service Corps of
Retired Executives (SCORE).  BICs are now in sixteen
locations across the country:  Seattle, Atlanta,
Houston, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Nashville, Chicago,
Boston, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., San Diego,
Baltimore, Fort Worth, El Paso, Charleston, South
Carolina and Fairmont, West Virginia.
  
BICs use state-of-the-art personal computers,
graphics work stations, CD-ROM technology and
interactive videos, allowing small business owners
access to market research databases, use of 
planning and spreadsheet software, and use of vast
libraries of information to help them start or build
businesses.   The BICs     offer electronic bulletin
boards, computer data bases, on-line information
exchange, periodicals and brochures, counseling,
videotapes, reference materials, texts, start-up
guides, application software, computer tutorials and
interactive media.  

<P>BICs receive major private sector support from
sponsors such as Apple Computer, Dell Computers, Dun
&amp; Bradstreet, Microsoft, U.S. Sprint and others.  In
cooperation with its private sector co-sponsors and
SCORE, SBA has expanded the network of BICs recently
in its continuing effort to ensure that America's
small business people have access to the best
available resources.

<P><H3>Cosponsorships </H3>

<P>Action:   Streamline the operating procedures for
the Cosponsorship program and reduce the paperwork
burden for SBA's private sector partners.  

<P>Background:   SBA extends and expands the limited
resources it has available for small business
training and counseling through the Cosponsorship
program.  Cosponsorship enlists the aid of
non-profit and for-profit entities, as well as
federal, state and local government agencies. 

<P>Typical projects include training seminars and
workshops, publications, conferences, and expos and
fairs involving SBA programs.  Topics include
international trade, minority business
opportunities, women's business ownership
procurement opportunities, finance programs, rural
initiatives, veterans and a wide variety of special
endeavors such as computer training, workplace
literacy, ethics, employee theft and drug-free work
environments.   

<P>Description:   SBA's standard operating procedures
(SOP) for the Cosponsorship program were complex and
inhibiting, micromanaging the process from the
central office and imposing considerable paperwork
burdens upon private sector cosponsors.  SBA has
thoroughly streamlined its SOP, reducing it from 76
pages to 26, increasing field office flexibility and
responsibility, removing financial and paperwork
constraints from private sector partners and
slashing internal paperwork requirements by more
than 75 percent. 

<P><H3>Small Business Development Centers</H3>

<P>Action:   Promulgate regulations for the Small
Business Development Center (SBDC) program and
propose legislation that will streamline
administration of the SBDCs, reduce costs, and
consolidate the women's and minority training
assistance programs under the SBDC program.

<P>Background:   The Small Business Development Center
program is a cooperative effort of the private
sector, educational institutions and federal, state
and local governments to meet
the basic and specialized needs of the small
business community.  The SBDCs' primary objective is
to further economic development by providing
counseling, training, research and specialized
assistance in all aspects of business management. 
More than half of all SBA counseling and two-thirds
of all training efforts are provided by Small
Business Development Centers.    

<P>Description:   In October of last year, SBA
responded to industry requests that regulations be
promulgated to govern administration of the program. 
Since creation of the program in 1980, it had been
operating under direct statutory authority, without
regulations.  The new regulatory framework, which
will be published in the Federal Register this week,
codified and clarified the procedures under which
the program had been operating.  The regulations
have been well received by the industry.  

<P>SBA's reinvention legislative proposal would
streamline the administration of the SBDCs and
reduce taxpayer costs.  Under the proposal, other
grant programs currently providing management and
technical assistance to differing segments of the
small business community would be consolidated under
the SBDC program. The Women's Demonstration Project
and Minority Business Training Program would be
administered by the SBDCs, streamlining the delivery
of services and reducing the overhead of these
programs.  

<P>In order to maximize the services provided by SBDCs
to the small business community, the proposal also
allows SBDCs the flexibility to use various delivery
mechanisms, including, but not limited to,
institutions of higher learning and local non-profit
economic development organizations.  SBDCs would
retain the authority to receive funding from other
Federal and state entities.  The legislative
proposal would keep existing eligibility
requirements for SBDCs and add a requirement that
SBDCs work closely with state governments in
developing relationships with state and local
economic development
organizations to broaden the services provided.      

<P><H3>Advocacy</H3>

<P><H3>General Regulatory Review</H3>

<P>Action:   Clarify and streamline SBA's regulations,
revising or eliminating any duplicative, outdated,
inconsistent or confusing provisions.  As a result
of this process, SBA regulations will be cut by more
than 50 percent by the end of the calendar year.

<P>Background:   SBA has championed Administration
efforts to reduce regulations on small businesses as
part of its government-wide advocacy role.  The
SBA-sponsored Small Business Forum on Regulatory
Reform made numerous recommendations and findings,
including the need to revise or eliminate outmoded,
confusing or duplicative regulations.  On March 4,
1995, President Clinton directed all agencies to
conduct a review of all regulations to determine
what might be revised or eliminated.  

<P>Description:   In response to the President's
directive, SBA has completed a page-by-page and
line-by-line review of each of its  regulations. 
Individual regulations were analyzed to determine if
they imposed any unnecessary burden on small
businesses or if they more appropriately should be
included in internal operating procedures.  SBA has
sought to ensure a less cumbersome and more
efficient process, with an emphasis on enhanced
customer service. 

<P>This three month review process has yielded
impressive results.  Agency teams reviewed the 700
pages of SBA regulations in detail, identifying
specific ways to streamline and simplify.  Overall,
SBA will reinvent 100 percent of its regulations,
resulting in the elimination of 355 pages of
regulatory text -- or 51 percent of its regulations. 
Some of these changes are described elsewhere in
this report in the descriptions of particular
program reforms, but they will also include: 
consolidation of all discrimination regulations;
simplification of size regulations; simplification
of 8(a) program regulations to expedite eligibility
reviews and contracting actions; and the
consolidation and redrafting of all business loan
regulations into one section to facilitate use and
save time.           

<P>
<P><H3>Waiver of Fines and Right to Cure.</H3>

<P>Action:   The President has issued a Memorandum on
Regulatory Reform directing agencies to modify or
waive penalties for small businesses in certain
situations.  

<P>Background:   The SBA-sponsored Small Business Forum
on Regulatory Reform recommended measures to
encourage voluntary compliance with regulations and
develop more flexible enforcement mechanisms. 

<P>Description:   On April 21, 1995, President Clinton
issued a Memorandum on Regulatory Reform, directing
department and agency heads to implement two
important policy initiatives.  Agencies are directed
to use their enforcement discretion to waive the
imposition of all or a portion of a penalty when the
violation is corrected within an appropriate time
period.  For those violations that may take longer
to correct than the period set by the agency,
federal agencies will waive up to 100 percent of the
financial penalties if the amounts waived are used
to cure the violation.   

<P>The Memorandum directs federal agencies to implement
these new policies on or before July 14, 1995.  As
part of their implementation plan, the agencies must
include information on how notification of the new
policies will be given to small businesses.  SBA is
working with EPA and OSHA and other agencies to
assist them in implementing and disseminating
information about the policies.    

<P><H3>Reduced Paperwork Requirements</H3>

<P>Action:   The President issued a Memorandum on
Regulatory Reform that directs agencies to reduce
the paperwork burden on small businesses.  

<P>Background:   Included among the recommendations of
the SBA-sponsored Small Business Forum on Regulatory
Reform was the need to reduce the paperwork burden
on small businesses.  

<P>Description:   On April 21, 1995, President Clinton
issued a Memorandum on Regulatory Reform directing
agencies to reduce by one-half the frequency of the
regularly scheduled reports that the public is
required, by rule or by policy, to provide to the
Government (from quarterly to semiannually, from
semiannually to annually, etc.). 
 
Each agency is required to submit a plan by June 15,
1995 to the Office of Management and Budget
describing the actions it is taking to implement
this paperwork reduction.   

<P><H3>Disaster Loan Assistance</H3>

<P>Action:   Simplify the disaster loan assistance
program by reducing filing requirements. Increase
loan limits and propose legislation to reduce the
subsidy rate for disaster loans, allowing SBA to
quadruple the number of loans it makes with the same
subsidy.

<P>Background:   SBA's disaster loans are the primary
form of Federal assistance for nonfarm, private
sector disaster losses.  SBA provides long-term, low
interest loans to cover those losses not compensated
for by private insurance.  The disaster loan program
is the only form of SBA assistance not limited to
small businesses.  SBA's disaster loans are
available to homeowners, renters, businesses of all
sizes, and nonprofit organizations.  Given the
rising Federal costs resulting from the tremendous
level of disasters experienced over the last six
years, SBA is participating in a Government-wide
effort to reform the way we respond to disasters.   

<P>Description:   SBA has made many changes to simplify
the disaster loan assistance program and make it
more customer friendly.  Specifically, it has:  

<P>(1) Simplified the home loan filing requirements. 
SBA now requires certain information only after a
loan is approved so that disaster victims are not
required to do unnecessary paperwork. 

<P>(2) Simplified the filing process and the
requirements for disaster business loans.  As a
result of its experience in the Midwest floods, SBA
has cut the length of its disaster loan application
in half.   

<P>(3) Increased the disaster home loan limits from
&#036;100,000 to &#036;200,000 for real estate damage, and
from &#036;20,000 to &#036;40,000 for personal property
damage.

<P>(4) Modified the major source of employment criteria
to permit consideration of waiver of the &#036;1.5
million business loan limit in more cases. 
(The law provides a maximum loan limit of &#036;1.5
million for any business in any one disaster.  It
also permits SBA's Administrator to waive that limit
for a &quot;major source of employment&quot;, as defined in
our regulations.  The modification made it easier
for businesses to qualify as major sources of
employment.) 

<P>Furthermore, the reinvention legislative proposal
SBA recently submitted to Congress would reduce the
subsidy rate for disaster loans in fiscal year 1996
from its current level of over 31 percent to 8.46
percent.  This reduction would permit SBA to make
&#036;407 million in disaster loans with its requested
subsidy authority of &#036;34 million as opposed to &#036;110
million in loans with the current subsidy rate.   

<P>

Philip Lader, Deputy Administrator Cassandra Pulley,

<H3><A NAME=introduction>INTRODUCTION</A></H3>

The American food system is justifiably admired around the globe for its ability to provide consumers with an abundant supply of convenient, economical, high quality and safe food products.  This system is built on the enterprise and innovative capacities of those who produce and market food in the United States, and it is driven by the high expectations of American consumers for the foods they purchase for their families.
<P>
Protecting the safety and integrity of the food supply is one of the oldest functions of government, and it is one of the core functions the American people expect their government to perform.  The Federal government's oversight of food safety, wholesomeness and labeling has contributed significantly to the success of the U.S. food system, especially where it has set and successfully enforced sound standards for sanitation and safety and fostered accurate and informative labeling consumers can use to exercise choice in the marketplace.  
<P>
The Federal system of food regulation is, however, nearly a century old.  Regulatory efforts successful in protecting the public over the past century must be reassessed as new food safety and other consumer concerns come increasingly into focus.  Federal food regulations must be revised continually for a number of reasons: so that consumers are provided the safest possible foods and can make more informed choices in the marketplace, so that food companies have the flexibility to innovate and incentives to engage in vigorous competition for consumers' dollars, and so that taxpayers are assured that government resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner possible. 
<P>
Today's food safety and consumer challenges demonstrate that current Federal regulations are in need of reform.  Foodborne illness caused by harmful bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms in meat, poultry, seafood, dairy products, and a host of other foods is a significant public health problem in the United States.  Estimates range from 6 million to 33 million foodborne illnesses per year.  The present system of food regulation has not adequately addressed this problem in large part because it depends heavily on detecting and correcting problems after they occur, rather than preventing them in the first place.  The current system often relies on prescriptive "command and control" regulations that can deter beneficial innovation.
<P>
This is especially true of the current system of meat and poultry inspection.  It relies primarily on extensive command and control oversight of the plants that slaughter animals and process meat and poultry products, and does not target control and reduction of harmful bacteria on raw meat and poultry products.  The result is a system that provides inadequate incentives and flexibility for meat and poultry plants to address the most significant food safety hazards in innovative ways. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration is committed to fundamental reform of food regulation to improve food safety.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA) intend to adopt a common framework and build a common approach to food safety by incorporating into their programs a science-based system of food safety controls, known as HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), the specifics of which are designed and implemented by the food companies themselves. 
<P>
HACCP is designed to reduce reliance on command and control regulations and increase reliance on science-based preventative measures and performance standards to improve food safety.  Under a HACCP system, each company must meet the same, rigorous safety standards, yet each has the flexibility to devise and adopt food safety plans uniquely suited to its  circumstances.  As the common conceptual framework for the future of U.S. food safety programs, a primary strength of HACCP is that its principles can be applied to many food categories and can be tailored to the needs of individual food manufacturing and processing plants, thereby providing flexibility while also improving food safety. 
<P>
In addition to improving the safety of the domestic food supply, HACCP will be a valuable tool in advancing the progress of food safety internationally and a critical element in expanding U.S. food trade.  Many other countries, including the 15 member countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, are also committing to HACCP-based food safety programs. 
<P>
FDA and FSIS are also reviewing and will revise their existing regulations to eliminate unnecessary burdens and requirements.  Regulations being reviewed and revised include regulations directly affecting food safety and food labeling, and regulations regarding certain animal drug and feed applications that also may affect the food supply.  
<P>
As President Clinton has said, regulatory reform must not  roll back protections people expect from their government.  Rather, it must meet people's expectations better by using modern tools of regulation that make better use of both public and private resources.  These goals are shared by all Americans.  The end result of the Clinton Administration's reform of food regulation will be safer food, more consumer choice in the marketplace, more effective use of taxpayers' dollars, and a food system that remains second to none.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=food_background>FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION BACKGROUND</A></H3>

FDA has had a mandate to protect Americans from unsafe foods and drugs since 1906.  FDA is charged with ensuring foods are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled, that drugs, vaccines, and medical devices are safe and effective, and that cosmetics are safe.   FDA also protects consumers from economic fraud and promotes sound nutrition.  
<P>
FDA oversees a vast food industry that includes about 46,000 U.S. food processors and warehouses, and comprises a significant segment of the nation's economy.  FDA regulated products account for about two-thirds of consumer spending on food, with an annual retail value of $430 billion.  Every year, U.S. food processors spend $1.4 billion on research and development and introduce 15,000 new products.  The following is just a partial list of matters of concern to the public that are addressed by FDA's food-related regulations:
<UL>
 	<LI>Pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites)

 	<LI>Chemical contaminants (pesticides, natural toxins, heavy metals, animal drug and antibiotic residues)

 	<LI>Loss of wholesomeness (molds, decomposition)

 	<LI>Mislabeling (false nutrition information or other misleading statements) 

 	<LI>Economic deception (violation of standards, counterfeit foods)

 	<LI>Safety of food and color additives
</UL>

In addition, FDA is responsible for setting standards for safe and sanitary production of food, resolving issues involving imported foods, and advising state and local governments on safety and sanitation standards for supermarkets, restaurants, and other retail food establishments.  
<P>
FDA carries out its food mission with about 2,700 employees, 900 at headquarters and 1,800 people at 160 other sites around the U.S.
<P>
In most instances, FDA regulations permit foods to be marketed without prior approval by the agency.  FDA enforces its regulations primarily through inspections of food processing facilities, examination of imports, collection and testing of food products on the market, and imposition of enforcement measures as required to protect consumers.  
<P>
FDA also regulates animal drugs, medicated feeds, and animal food additives, all of which may affect the human food supply.  FDA protects the public health from harmful veterinary products in several ways.  FDA reviews new animal drug applications, investigational new animal drug applications, abbreviated new animal drug applications, medicated feed applications, and food additive petitions.  FDA also regulates marketed products through review of drug experience reports and compliance programs.  Finally, FDA assesses the environmental impact of product approvals.  Through these efforts, FDA ensures that animal drugs and medicated feeds are safe and effective and that food from treated animals is safe to eat.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=food_safety>FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE BACKGROUND</A></H3>

FSIS is a consumer protection agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that regulates meat and poultry products, primarily by means of inspection activities at the facilities producing those foods, to ensure they are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled.
<P>
FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products account for close to a third of consumer spending for food, with an annual retail value of about $210 billion.  FSIS regulated products include raw beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and turkey, as well as about 250,000 different processed meat and poultry products, including hams, sausage, soups, stews, pizzas, and frozen dinners (any product that contains 2% or more cooked poultry or 3% or more raw meat).  Consumers purchase these products under 500,000 different USDA- approved labels.
<P>
Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act, FSIS inspects all meat and poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce, including imported products.  About 7,400 Federal inspectors carry out inspection laws in some 6,200 plants.
<P>
Inspectors check animals before and after slaughter, visually examining over 6 billion poultry carcasses and 125 million livestock carcasses each year.  They prevent diseased animals from entering the food supply and examine carcasses for visible defects that can affect safety and quality.  FSIS also inspects products during processing, handling, and packaging to ensure that they are safe and truthfully labeled.
<P>
Unfortunately, these activities have been inadequate to prevent illnesses attributable to pathogenic microorganisms found in and on meat and poultry.  The best available data indicate that foodborne microbial pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes contaminating meat and poultry products are associated with as many as 5 million cases of illness and more than 4,000 deaths annually.  There are many factors contributing to such illnesses, however it is clear that there are also many technologies and procedures available for keeping raw meat and poultry products from being contaminated with pathogenic bacteria during processing, and for minimizing the growth of bacteria that nonetheless may be present.  The current system of meat and poultry inspection must be reformed to provide more incentive and flexibility for the use of these technologies and procedures. 
<P>
FSIS is pursuing a broad and long-term science-based strategy to improve the safety of meat and poultry products and to better protect Americans from foodborne pathogens.  FSIS has adopted a farm-to-table approach that includes steps to improve the safety of meat and poultry at each stage in food production, processing, distribution, and marketing.  For example, safe handling labels are now required on all raw products, informing consumers of the crucial role proper handling and cooking play in preventing foodborne illness.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=cooperation>FEDERAL COOPERATION IN FOOD SAFETY</A></H3>

FDA and FSIS routinely work together to coordinate food regulatory policy and ensure the most efficient use of Federal resources in areas of mutual interest.  Matters on which the agencies have coordinated closely include:
<UL>
 <LI>	<B>HACCP</B>--FDA and FSIS are working cooperatively to develop a consistent HACCP-based approach to improve the safety of seafood, meat and poultry products, and other foods.    

<LI> 	<B>Food safety science and data</B>--The agencies work to coordinate and to implement a variety of food safety research and data gathering programs and to resolve microbiological scientific issues that affect food safety through the interagency National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods.  Most recently, the 	agencies have jointly contracted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct in depth surveys in association with state health departments in five locations around the country to better determine the incidence and causes of foodborne diseases.

<LI> 	<B>Transportation and distribution of foods</B>--FSIS and FDA are working together to develop basic standards for maintaining food safety during the transportation and distribution of meat and poultry products and other foods.  

<LI> 	<B>Retail stores and restaurants</B>--FSIS has worked closely with FDA to provide guidance and assistance to local and State authorities that have responsibility for the regulation of 	retail stores and restaurants. 

<LI> 	<B>International standards</B>--FSIS and FDA coordinate efforts to achieve consistency between national regulatory policies and international standards and guidelines through the establishment of objective, science-based, internationally recognized health and safety food standards. 
 
 <LI>	<B>Animal production</B>--FDA and FSIS work together in resolving animal health issues that impact on food safety.  FSIS 	routinely samples animal tissues for chemical adulterants; 	findings are provided to FDA because they may indicate illegal or improper use of drugs and antibiotics in food producing animals and other matters within FDA's 			jurisdiction.   	

 <LI>	<B>Egg products</B>--FDA and FSIS share authority and responsibility for overseeing the safety of egg products.  

 <LI>	<B>Labeling</B>--FDA and FSIS work together to make their regulations governing the labeling of food products as consistent as possible.   Under the Nutrition Labeling and 	Education Act of 1990, FDA issued regulations (fully effective in August of 1994) requiring manufacturers to provide complete nutrition information in an easy-to-use format that enables consumers to choose foods that contribute to a healthy diet.  FSIS issued nearly identical regulations for nutrition labeling of meat and poultry, resulting in a comprehensive, uniform approach to nutrition labeling applicable to all foods.  
</UL>

<HR>
	<H2 align=center><A NAME=reg_reform>REGULATORY REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS</A></H2>
<HR>



FSIS and FDA are proposing a number of reforms that will reinvent how the two agencies regulate.  The reforms described in this report will result in more productive use of FSIS' and FDA's resources, reduce unnecessary burdens on industry, expand consumer choice in the marketplace, and, most importantly, improve food safety.  
<P>
<B><A NAME=fsis_initiatives>FSIS INITIATIVES:</A></B>

The following are more detailed descriptions of these initiatives.

<H3><A NAME=haccp>FOOD SAFETY: HACCP AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS</A></H3> 

Many authorities, including the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the Vice President's National Performance Review have recommended fundamental changes in the existing food safety system.  Those recommendations urge adoption of a preventative system of quality control known as HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points). 
<P>
HACCP consists of several internationally recognized principles, including the identification of safety hazards, the establishment of controls that focus on preventing those hazards at critical control points, and the monitoring of controls during operations, to provide immediate information to processors as to whether their operation is under control.  Under a mandatory system, the results of the monitoring are documented in records to which government inspectors or investigators have access.  In this way, the burden of operating a HACCP system is related to the nature of the hazards presented by a food.  The burden on the processor of a low risk food may be as simple as monitoring and controlling the temperature or pH levels of the product and recording the results.  If there is a deviation that poses a safety risk, the data collected would enable the processor to identify corrective action more easily.  The end result is continual self-monitoring of the food's safety that will prevent problems and facilitate necessary government oversight. 

	<H3><A NAME=implement><I>1. Implementation of HACCP-Based Systems to Ensure Food Safety</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  The Federal government is charged by law with protecting consumers from unsafe, unwholesome and mislabeled foods.  The United States Department of Agriculture's  Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) implements the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act.  Under those laws, FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products.   The Department of Health and Human Service's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all other food products primarily under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  
<P>
Although the two agencies' laws are similar in many respects, each has its own kind of "inspection."  FSIS inspects daily all meat, poultry, and processed egg products, and the establishments producing those products, to ensure the products comply with the law before they are sold in commerce.  FDA, on the other hand, inspects processing establishments less frequently, generally targeting specific establishments.  The relatively small number of FDA inspectors must give priority to  products and establishments known to pose a risk of being in violation of the law.  FDA's food program, faced with an increasing workload, is conducting fewer inspections of food establishments each year.  
 <P>
To carry out its statutory mandate to ensure a safe food supply, FDA operates a comprehensive regulatory program for the foods it regulates.  This program includes:  (1) mandatory, unannounced inspections of the domestic industry; (2) examinations of imports into the U.S.; (3) sample analysis; (4) administration of Federal-State cooperative programs for molluscan shellfish, milk, and retail food; (5) training and technical assistance to states to help them operate their own programs; (6) consumer education; and (7) research.
<P>
Although the nation's food supply overall is safe, outbreaks of foodborne illnesses (from sources such as E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella) do occur.  FDA tries to "catch" potential microbiological hazards and other food safety problems during its infrequent inspections.  This system is neither as effective or efficient as it could be.   FDA must have a better means to ensure that food processors are taking appropriate steps to protect consumers. 
<P>
FSIS has authorities and programs for meat and poultry products under its jurisdiction similar to FDA's.  However, FSIS historically has devoted most of its resources to in-plant inspection activities.  Consequently, the present meat and poultry inspection program is based on intensive command-and-control oversight of plant operations and heavy reliance on detecting  and correcting problems with plants and products after they occur, instead of preventing them in the first place.  The current system does not effectively target control and reduction of the harmful bacteria on raw products that pose the most important food safety hazards for meat and poultry.  The result is a resource-intensive system that provides inadequate incentives and flexibility for meat and poultry plants to address the most significant food safety hazards in innovative ways.  
<P>
<B>Proposals and Justification: </B> FDA and FSIS intend to implement HACCP-type performance standards and flexible science-based systems of preventative controls for, at a minimum, the meat, poultry, and seafood  industries.  In addition, FSIS will eliminate obsolete or counterproductive command and control measures.
<P>
<B>Seafood:</B>  Although NAS concluded that commercial seafood is generally safe, FDA is implementing HACCP in this industry first because of the wide array of hazards that can adversely affect seafood safety.  Because seafood consists of hundreds of species from every part of the globe, is predominantly wild-caught, is the most perishable of all flesh foods, and is consumed raw more than other flesh foods, the regulation of seafood will always present special challenges.  Thus, FDA's seafood program must remain flexible and dynamic and seek ways to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness.  HACCP is the best way to achieve these goals.
<P>
Because over half of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, FDA's regulation requires that all seafood, both domestic and that which is imported into the U.S., be processed under HACCP controls.  In this regard, the U.S. is conforming to a growing trend among our trading partners in requiring HACCP control of seafood.
<P>
At the same time, the Department of Commerce will privatize its voluntary fee-for-service seafood inspection program presently operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The voluntary program promotes domestic and foreign commerce in American seafood by inspecting for the safety, wholesomeness, and acceptability of  products through contracts with processors that purchase their service.  
<P>
<B>Meat and Poultry:</B>  On February 3, 1995, FSIS announced sweeping new food safety proposals in the Federal Register that would "reinvent" federal meat and poultry inspection.  These regulations represent a fundamental shift in the FSIS regulatory approach from heavy reliance on prescriptive command and control regulations and requirements to greater reliance on food safety performance standards that plants must meet to improve food safety.  The proposed new system  would focus on preventing problems before they occur, and provide greater flexibility than the current regulatory scheme, thereby making food inspection more effective and efficient.
<P>
<B>Other Foods:</B>  For the rest of the food industry, which is under FDA's jurisdiction, the FDA has (1) issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to gather input from interested parties on the expansion of the HACCP concept to "land food" and (2) has begun a voluntary pilot program to assess the feasibility of HACCP for products other than seafood.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  The HACCP rulemaking would improve food safety by
<UL>
 <LI>	Building the principle of prevention into food production operations, and into the USDA and FDA regulatory programs;

<LI> 	Stimulating improvement in food safety practices by setting reasonable performance standards that all plants must meet; and

<LI> 	Fostering scientific and technological innovation within the meat and poultry industry by removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles to innovation.
</UL>
Although there will be some initial costs to establishing and implementing a HACCP system, the benefits to public health and industry are many, including a reduction in foodborne illnesses and increased public confidence in the food supply.  Additionally, the American food industry should benefit from harmonization with foreign countries' requirements for a HACCP-type system and from overall improvement in the safety of food.  There also should be greater efficiencies in the conduct of Federal regulatory oversight, permitting more assurance of food safety despite shrinking Federal resources.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline: </B> FDA published its final seafood HACCP regulations on December 18, 1995 (NOAA published a notice regarding the restructuring of its fee-for-service seafood inspection on September 22, 1995).  FSIS is preparing the final HACCP regulations for meat and poultry.  FSIS reopened the comment period for its proposal on August, 1995, to permit additional comments and dialogue with interested parties on issues raised during the initial comment period.  The comment period remained open through November 13, 1995.  FSIS is working to review all comments and complete the rule as quickly as possible.  Timing and structure of a proposed HACCP rule applicable to other segments of the food industry depends on analysis of the comments received in response to FDA's ANPR and on the results from the on-going pilot program.  

<H3><A NAME=comprehensive><I> 2 .  Comprehensive Reform of Meat and Poultry Inspection System to be Consistent with HACCP</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  FSIS's HACCP proposal reflects a fundamental shift in how it regulates to ensure the safety of meat and poultry products: a shift away from the agency's traditional approach of  reliance on command and control regulations and requirements to greater use of performance standards.  The current FSIS regulations, policy notices, and directives contain command and control requirements that are inconsistent with the new approach.  FSIS acknowledges that it cannot simply layer HACCP on top of the current system. 
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FSIS is committed to a comprehensive review and revision of all its existing regulations and related inspection requirements.   
<P>
As part of the Administration's regulatory reform initiative to eliminate unneeded or unnecessarily burdensome regulations and make the regulations easier to use, FSIS conducted a page-by-page review of its regulations.  It identified over 400 pages of specific regulations for possible revision or elimination, and a need to restructure all its regulations to make them simpler and more user friendly. 
<P>
The agency has identified many specific regulations that will need revision to make them consistent with the proposed HACCP regulation before HACCP can be implemented.  For example, FSIS will soon propose to amend current cooking regulations for meat and poultry products to incorporate performance standards, and allow processors the flexibility to develop their own innovative ways to achieve those standards.  FSIS must thoughtfully reconsider all of its regulations that mandate specific actions, techniques, or processing parameters designed to achieve food safety objectives and determine whether they should be repealed or amended to provide the flexibility required to be consistent with HACCP.  FSIS intends to have extensive dialogue with industry and other interested parties as it carries out these reforms.  
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  In order for FSIS to operate an integrated HACCP-based food safety program, it must first revise existing regulations and inspection procedures that conflict with HACCP. 
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline: </B> FSIS plans to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting public comment on its regulation review, and on its plans to revise its existing regulations to make them comport with HACCP prior to implementation of HACCP.  Subsequent Notices of Proposed Rulemaking will address specific performance standards.
<P>

<H3><A NAME=reform><I>3.  Reform of Meat and Poultry Inspection Prior Approval Systems to be Consistent with HACCP</I></A></H3>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The current meat and poultry inspection program is based on intensive command-and-control oversight of plant operations, including prior approval systems for blueprints, facilities, equipment, in-plant chemicals, ingredients, process changes and labels.  FSIS approves virtually everything used during slaughter and processing of meat and poultry that might affect the safety, quality, or wholesomeness of the food.  FSIS also conducts a prior approval program for the labels of federally inspected meat and poultry products and imported products to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.    
<P>
These prior approval systems consume public and private sector resources that could be better used in reducing the public's risk of foodborne disease.  
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification: </B> Consistent with moving to a HACCP-based inspection system, the agency is reviewing its current policies and practices with the intent of simplifying them, while ensuring that important food safety and efficacy issues are considered.  
<P>
FSIS will publish a proposed rule for a number of prior approval requirements: those concerning facility blueprints, equipment and utensils specifications, non-food chemicals used in facilities, and quality control plans.  (The requirement for prior approval of substances added to meat and poultry products is a joint FSIS-FDA responsibility discussed elsewhere in this paper.)   
<P>
FSIS will publish an ANPR initiating its review of all of remaining prior approval requirements and related command and control regulations, most notably the label-by-label review system, and seek public comment on how to eliminate, streamline, or simplify them.
<P>
At the same time, FSIS will proceed with an ongoing rulemaking to expand the categories of labels exempt from prior agency review. 
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  Reform of the prior approval systems is part of the paradigm shift required for FSIS to implement HACCP successfully.
<P>
It will help foster innovation in food safety, reduce unnecessary burdens on industry, and make better use of agency resources.
 <P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline: </B>Early in 1996, FSIS intends to publish Notices of Proposed Rulemaking and an ANPR on its prior approval systems.  Also, FSIS plans to publish a final rule to expand categories of labels exempt from prior approval in the near future.
<P>

<H3><A NAME=regulatory>REGULATORY REFORM FOR SUBSTANCES ADDED TO FOOD</A></H3>
	
One of the missions of FDA and of FSIS is to ensure that foods do not become adulterated by added substances.  FDA has primary jurisdiction over the additives themselves; it provides premarket review and regulations on the safety of substances for specific uses.  FSIS further regulates the use of substances added to meat and poultry to prevent adulteration of products under its jurisdiction. 
<P>
FDA scientists review data packages (petitions) submitted by manufacturers of GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) substances, as well as manufacturers of new food additives, which are by law considered unsafe until shown to be safe for the intended use.  FDA's review process is often protracted; the food industry believes that review takes too long.  FDA acknowledges that it needs to improve its review performance.  FDA's reform proposal aims to achieve reform without jeopardizing food safety or the independence, integrity, and credibility of the review process.
<P>
FSIS has had an additional, largely redundant premarket approval process for ingredients used in meat and poultry products.  FDA and FSIS jointly propose to reform premarket review of food additives for meat and poultry uses so that only one rulemaking is required.
<P>

	<H3><A NAME=additive><I>1.  Reform of FDA's Food-Additive Petition Review</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  Congress charged the FDA with ensuring the safe use of direct (such as new sweeteners) and indirect (such as components of plastic bottles that can get into food) food additives when it passed the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 and the Color Additive Amendments of 1960.  These amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require that such additives undergo premarket evaluation to establish that their intended use will be safe.   
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA's plan for comprehensive reform has the following elements:
<UL>
<LI>	<B>establish and meet</B> deadlines for action on petition reviews (performance goals); 

<LI>	<B>reduce</B> pending-petition inventory; 

<LI> 	<B>test and institute</B> new approaches to review; and 

<LI>	<B>implement</B> management reforms within the food additive review program.
</UL>
In order to meet its petition-review deadlines, FDA must first reduce the petition backlog, improve the review process, and complete planned management reforms.
<P>
<B>Performance Goals:</B>  FDA will establish timeframes and performance goals for the review of direct and indirect food additive petitions.  The timeframes that will be established will ensure expeditious Agency reviews and decisions on petition approvals. 
<P>
<B>Reduce Pending Inventory:</B>  FDA intends to reduce the inventory of 290 pending petitions by (1) assigning additional staff to petition review, with an emphasis on reducing the pending-petition inventory; (2) establishing a mechanism for outside scientific review of a number of pending indirect additive petitions; and 3) establishing contracts for evaluation by third parties of data, such as toxicity studies, from a number of pending direct additive petitions.  For both (2) and (3), FDA will render the final safety decision and notify the petitioner that either the petition is approvable or why the data do not support such a finding.  The goal is to reduce the number of pending petitions so that new petitions may be evaluated more expeditiously.   
<P>
<B>New Approaches to Petition Review:</B>  (1) FDA has begun to implement a "Threshold of Regulation" approach for non-carcinogenic, indirect food additives.  This approach allows FDA to determine that an indirect additive's migration into food is likely to be so trivial that the substance does not need to be listed in a food additive regulation.  Under this approach, such indirect additives would receive expeditious, abbreviated review by FDA, thereby avoiding submission and review of food additive petitions.  More than 100 such "Threshold of Regulation" letters have been issued to date.  (2) FDA has implemented a policy in which firms developing food products through biotechnology consult early with FDA to identify potential safety and regulatory issues for their products.  Such early consultation allows FDA to keep abreast of biotechnological developments, and to identify early the products raising safety issues that need to be resolved.
<P>
<B>Management Reforms:</B>  Management reforms will include (1) increased use of in-house special review teams to expedite review of routine petitions, and for attention to and resolution of complex petitions; and (2) increased use of and consultation with experts from other FDA units, other agencies, and FDA's Food Advisory Committee to resolve complex scientific issues.  In addition, FDA is working with the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) on criteria that the scientific community would agree justify the use of an alternative model to ensure the safety of non-traditional food ingredients, such as fat substitutes.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  The proposed solutions will address several major complaints about food additive review procedures and response times.  The food ingredient industry will benefit from increasingly shorter review times, will be able to market more new and innovative products faster, and will become more competitive in foreign markets.  U.S. consumers will benefit from faster access to the new approved food products and ingredients.  FDA will make better use of its limited resources.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  The reforms have already begun to be implemented.  Management reforms began in late 1992.  New petition-review staff were re-assigned in August 1995 in an effort to reduce the petition inventory.  Timeframes, resource, and process options will be set forth early in 1996 to ensure expeditious agency response to incoming petitions.  Contracts to implement the third-party review components of the petition-review reform proposals will be established by June 1996.  The final rule codifying the agency's new threshold of regulation policy was published in the Federal Register on July 17, 1995.  The current consultation procedure for genetically engineered plant varieties was first used in 1994.
<P>

	<H3><A NAME=premarket><I>2.  FDA's Premarket Notification for GRAS Substances</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  Many substances that are added to foods, such as new sweeteners, are "food additives" under the law, and must be approved for safety by FDA prior to marketing.  Other food ingredients, such as sugar, are not considered to be food additives under the law and need not be preapproved by FDA.  Although food firms can market the latter by independently determining that they are "Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS)," firms often request that FDA "affirm" that the ingredient is GRAS (thus gaining Federal agreement that the ingredient will be considered safe under the law if widely marketed).
<P>
In the early 1970s, FDA established a formal GRAS-affirmation petition process in response, in part, to industry requests.  This system is now viewed by both industry and FDA as too inefficient and time-consuming.  To illustrate:  FDA receives an average of 4 to 8 GRAS affirmation petitions per year and acts on an average of 1 to 2 per year.  In large part because of their low priority--these substances are nearly always affirmed as safe, and are being marketed while FDA reviews the petition--GRAS petitions can take between 6 and 10 years to review, which has led to a backlog of about 80 GRAS petitions.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA proposes to establish a notification procedure by which companies would use a greatly simplified process to notify FDA of their independent GRAS determinations.  FDA would have up to 90 days in which to review each notification submission and to inform the petitioner if a problem with the status of the substance is identified.  After that period, companies could market the new food ingredient with the understanding that FDA is aware of the company's determination of the substance's GRAS status, that FDA does not take issue with that determination, and that FDA is aware of the company's marketing of that substance.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  Industry would realize significant savings through elimination of the time and expense associated with assembling large and complex GRAS-petition packages and through elimination of significant administrative costs.  These savings could range from thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the food ingredient involved.  For the FDA, this reform would result in a net savings of 4 to 5 staff persons per year.  These resources could be allocated to other, higher priority areas.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  FDA intends to propose the necessary changes in its regulations by May 1996.


	<H3><A NAME=fsis><I>3.  Premarket Approval of Substances Used in the 
	Preparation of Meat and Poultry Products (FSIS and FDA)</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  FDA has the responsibility for determining that substances used as food ingredients are safe.  FDA implements this authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires premarket approval, by regulation, of all food and color additives.  FSIS has separate authority under the meat and poultry inspection statutes to regulate those ingredients that are used in meat and poultry products.  As a consequence, FSIS adopted a regulatory procedure that, like FDA's, requires petition and rulemaking on each substance before it may be used in a product under its jurisdiction.  FSIS promulgates such regulations after determining (1) that FDA has already found the requested use of the substance to be safe and (2) use of the substance will not cause inspected products to be found adulterated or misbranded.  This has resulted in a sequential, duplicative rulemaking process for substances used in meat and poultry that generates significant costs and delays over and above those attributable to FDA's premarket approval process.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA and FSIS intend to amend their regulations and enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which the two agencies will work cooperatively so that only one rulemaking--FDA's--is required for substances to be used in meat and poultry products.  FDA intends to change its regulations to require petitioners to state at the time of petitioning for additive approvals whether they are seeking approval of meat or poultry product uses.  FSIS intends to change its regulations to specify that FDA regulations permitting meat or poultry product uses constitute prior approval by FSIS, as well as FDA.  Under the MOU, FDA and FSIS would conduct their  reviews concurrently when any petition to FDA includes a new meat and poultry use of a substance, and will consult to ensure the FDA regulation of the meat and poultry use is appropriate to ensure suitability under FSIS's inspection statutes.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  This initiative should provide for a simpler, quicker, and more coherent Federal approval process for meat and poultry uses of food and color additives.  It clarifies and harmonizes FDA and FSIS responsibilities, and results in more logical, comprehensive Federal regulation of food and color additives.  It also will eliminate unnecessary, burdensome restrictions on the use of GRAS substances in meat and poultry products;  encourage product/process innovations; and reduce costs to the government.  It will result in no diminution of FSIS food safety oversight and consumer protection authority or activity under its inspection laws.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline: </B> Notices of Proposed Rulemaking have been completed for both FDA and FSIS regulations and both proposals should be published in the same issue of the Federal Register in the near future.  The MOU also has been drafted and will be published as an appendix to the FSIS proposed rule.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=standards>FOOD STANDARDS OF IDENTITY</A></H2>

<B>Background: </B> Before current labeling laws, consumers had to base purchasing decisions primarily on the appearance of the product.  Emerging food technology made it increasingly easy for some food manufacturers to produce cheaper traditional-looking products by substituting lower quality, less economically desirable ingredients for higher quality, more valuable ones.  Consequently, Congress authorized FDA and FSIS to establish "standards of identity."  These standards define a food's composition and prescribe minimum levels of valuable ingredients, such as milkfat in dairy products and meat in meat food products, or maximum levels for cheaper ingredients, such as fillers or water.  Food standards are like "time-honored recipes" for hundreds of foods such as mayonnaise, cheeses, breads, fruit juices, corned beef, and hot dogs.  
<P>
FDA has 285 specific food standards of identity that occupy about 270 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Most of these standards of identity were promulgated by formal rulemaking, which can involve often cumbersome evidentiary hearings.  Because of a 1990 change in the law, however, most food standards now can be promulgated by notice and comment rulemaking, without the burden of evidentiary hearings.  Formal rulemaking is still required for the amendment or revocation of existing standards for dairy products.  
<P>
FSIS has about 74 standard of identity regulations.  It has many more informal "standards," or labeling policies, that have evolved as a consequence of the reviews of product labels required for prior approval.
<P>
Although Congress' main concern when food standards were established was to protect consumers from economic deception, many food processors have come to view them as beneficial for commercial reasons, viz., as establishing a level playing field, providing certainty as to the identity of products, and preempting inconsistent State standards.  They also continue to have strong support among consumer organizations.
<P>
The marketplace is and must be dynamic to meet changing consumer demands.  For example, milkfat, once a desirable indicator of quality in dairy products, is no longer as desirable, and new lowfat and nonfat dairy products have become available to meet the demand.  To keep pace with consumers' demands, FDA has recently established a new general standard of identity which would allow manufacturers to modify the composition of traditional standardized food, provided they meet minimum nutritional requirements and bear informative labeling.  Thus, the processors are not prevented from reformulating products to meet such shifting consumer demand.  FSIS will soon propose a similar rule for products under its jurisdiction.  Nonetheless, many manufacturers continue to consider standards of identity to be overly prescriptive regulations that inhibit innovation, and result in less competition and fewer product choices in the marketplace.
<P>
Although standards of identity are intended for use primarily by manufacturers and not consumers, they do specify what a food contains and what the consumer is entitled to receive when a food is purchased by its common or usual name.  In addition to specifying a name, the standards may require additional labeling to provide consumers with additional information about that product.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA and FSIS propose to explore alternatives to the present food standards that will promote innovation and increase efficiency.  The Agencies will seek comments on a broad range of options from eliminating food standards to simplifying many of the detailed requirements of the food standard regulations, including eliminating many of the procedural requirements and test methods that may hinder industry's ability to produce the food efficiently.  Adoption of international standards, discussed elsewhere in this document, is a promising possibility.
<P>
<B>Impact: </B> The impact of this proposal will vary depending on the option chosen.  Eliminating or simplifying food standards would benefit industry by permitting it flexibility to develop products using innovative ingredients to meet consumers' dietary preferences as well as allow the food industry to use more efficient procedures for producing their products.  Complete elimination of all food standards, however, may place a greater burden on industry because, in the absence of Federal standards, states may decide to impose their own individual standards.  Consumer groups may argue that eliminating food standards will invite the same economic deception that led to their creation more than a half century ago.
<P>
As part of FDA's recently promulgated nutrition labeling regulations, in order to give processors the flexibility to develop products with better nutritional profiles, FDA now allows the use of nutrient content claims in conjunction with the names of standardized foods (e.g., "low fat", "no fat", etc).  As long as the product meets the requirements for the nutrient claim, it may, to the extent noted by the claim, deviate from the regulatory requirements for the standardized food.  This change is a major break with the past approach to food standards of identity, when any product appearing to be the standardized product had to comply with the standard.  FSIS soon will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to permit the same use of nutrient content claims in conjunction with the standardized name of meat and poultry products.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B> Early in 1996, each of the two Agencies intends to publish an  ANPR in the Federal Register seeking comment on how to simplify food standards.  In addition, FSIS expects to publish in the near future a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the use of nutrient content claims in conjunction with standardized product names.  In a related rulemaking, FDA proposed the direct elimination of a small number of specific food standards of identity on October 13, 1995.


<H2><A NAME=exports>EXPORTS AND IMPORTS</A></H2>

The U.S. imports and exports tens of billions of dollars worth of food each year.  International trade in the food arena is complex because nations often employ different systems of food safety. Nations have differing standards for the production of safe and wholesome food as well as varying regulatory procedures for inspecting and safeguarding product safety and quality.  Companies seeking premarket approval of food additives and animal drugs, for example, must complete different applications for marketing approval in each country, entailing varying batteries of required tests.  Similarly, most countries have laws like those in the United States that require imports of meat and poultry to have been subjected to inspection requirements equivalent to domestically produced products, and often require some form of certification to demonstrate that these products meet these requirements.  FDA and FSIS try to facilitate international trade in the products they regulate in a manner consistent with their primary missions of food safety and consumer protection, with U.S. regulatory requirements, and, to the extent possible, with foreign requirements.
<P>
	<H3><A NAME=harmonize><I>1.  Harmonization of International Standards (FDA and FSIS)</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  As noted above, nations often employ different regulatory standards relating to food safety.  Because so much of our nation's food supply is either imported or exported, there is a substantial need to harmonize standards while retaining the U.S.'s high level of public health protection.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA will seek common, science-based, international standards.  The Agency will work with other countries, such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union and through international fora, especially the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to harmonize food and animal drug safety standards.  In addition, FDA will encourage the harmonization of registration requirements for animal drugs.
<P>
FSIS will continue to ensure that equivalent inspection systems and standards for meat and poultry products exist in all countries exporting such products to the U.S., especially in light of the better U. S. safety standards expected under HACCP.  
<P>
FDA also will evaluate the food safety systems of other countries, with the purpose of entering into agreements with those countries having food safety systems that offer equivalent levels of public health protection to those of the U.S. or that can provide assurance that their products will be in compliance with FDA requirements.  
<P>
In addition, FDA and FSIS will work together to improve procedures for U. S. evaluation and, where appropriate, acceptance of Codex standards and to facilitate public participation in that process.
<P>
<B>Impact: </B> Increased harmonization offers clear benefits for U.S. public health.  It increases the safety and quality of food imported into the U.S.  It can also improve the safety and quality of foods produced and sold in foreign countries, as more countries participate in the international standard setting process.
<P>
Harmonization benefits industry by replacing many different standards with one international standard that must be met.  In the long run, harmonization provides a level playing field, brings cost savings to industry, opens markets, enhances opportunities for export of U.S. goods and, in some cases, lessens the time needed to bring new products to market.
<P>
Harmonization permits FDA and FSIS to make more efficient use of their resources, as other countries share the workload of developing new standards.  Investing now in harmonization may save future U.S. government resources by fostering cooperation with other countries in the assessment of new products.  
<P>
Bilateral and multilateral agreements improve the safety of food imported into the U.S. from countries with which agencies have such agreements, allowing the agencies focus inspection and laboratory resources in other, more crucial areas, and provide predictable requirements for U.S. exports to such countries.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  FDA and FSIS will build on and expand efforts to achieve international harmonization by:
<UL>
 <LI>Continuing to participate actively and exert leadership in the development of international standards by Codex and other relevant international standard-setting organizations.

<LI> 	Promoting international adoption of U.S. standards whenever appropriate.

<LI> 	Developing routine procedures for the review of international standards, guidelines and recommendations with a view toward accepting them when they provide adequate health protection and for revision or revocation of existing U.S. requirements, as necessary.  (Proposed procedures are expected to be completed within one year.)

<LI> 	Initiating work towards more harmonization with our North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other regional trading partners.  Such efforts should become part of the work plans of existing technical working groups formed under the Canada/U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

<LI> 	Intensifying efforts to enter into agreements with other countries.

<LI> 	Improving procedures for consideration of international standards in FDA and FSIS rulemaking.  

<LI> 	Beginning an initiative to harmonize registration requirements for animal drugs.  The first proposal for harmonized guidelines should be completed within three years.
</UL>

	<H3><A NAME=enhance><I>2.  Enhanced Use of the Private Sector in Monitoring Imported Foods (FDA)</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  FDA oversees the importation each year of about 1.5 million food entries.  While the Agency reviews paper or electronic documentation on almost all imports, it has the resources to examine physically only about 8 percent of the entries, and to perform laboratory analyses on about 2 percent.  While the Agency targets its resources towards those products most likely to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the relatively low inspection rate has been the subject of congressional hearings on the safety of imported foods.  
<P>
FDA would like to make increased and better use of private, state and local laboratories to monitor food imports, both to reduce the length of time importers of foods must wait for results of laboratory analysis, and to increase the percentage of imported foods receiving sample analysis.
<P>
FDA already has several initiatives under way.  For example, the Agency's New York District has just completed a pilot program in which importers of seafood, after receiving approval from FDA, were able to choose between having their products sampled and tested by FDA or by a private laboratory at their own expense.   The private laboratories allowed FDA increased access to their facilities and submitted all of their results directly to the Agency.  The Agency and the import and laboratory communities are now evaluating the program to see if it met the needs and expectations of all parties.
<P>
The Boston District of FDA is presently conducting a similar pilot program.  Additionally, the Agency has entered into or is negotiating partnership agreements with several state governments in which state inspectors collect import food samples for FDA analysis, or for analysis by the states themselves.
<P>
Private laboratories already play a substantial role in testing imported foods that the Agency has detained without physical examination.  (FDA may detain products without physical examination where there is prior evidence of a violation.)  FDA expends substantial resources monitoring the laboratories and reviewing their analytical reports.
<P>
Proposal and Justification:   FDA will work to develop pilot programs that make better use of private and state or local laboratories for analyzing food imports.  The Agency will solicit input from the import, laboratory, and consumer communities by holding public meetings around the country, and by publishing in the Federal Register a notice requesting comments on how best to enhance Agency use of private, state and local laboratories for analyzing food imports.  
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  The development of pilot programs will enable the Agency to learn how best to make further use of non-FDA laboratories for monitoring and analyzing imported foods.  Ultimately, these programs should enable the Agency to institute programs that will make significantly increased and better use of the private sector and state and local governments for monitoring imported foods in order to ensure their safety.  Such enhanced use of non-FDA resources should also reduce the time importers of foods have to wait for results of laboratory analysis, while at the same time increase the percentage of imported foods receiving sample analysis.  
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>   The Agency will hold a series of public meetings, and will publish a Federal Register notice, to solicit information on how best to make increased and better use of private, state and local laboratories to monitor imported foods.  FDA will then begin to initiate pilot programs based on that information.  Additionally, to help develop pilot programs making enhanced Agency use of private laboratories, FDA also will publish, by December 1996, either a guidance document and/or proposed rule to establish acceptable practices for laboratories.

	<H3><A NAME=animal><I>3.  Animal Drug Exports (FDA)</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B>  Current law prohibits the export of U.S.- manufactured animal drug products unless the drug's substance, labeling, and use conform to an approved marketing application in the U.S. or FDA has approved an export application for the animal drug product.  For FDA to approve such an export application, the drug must be subject to an investigational use exemption and the manufacturer must be actively pursuing U.S. marketing approval.  In addition, current law permits export of unapproved products to only 21 developed countries.  This means that, even if an animal drug is approved by the importing country, it often cannot be exported to that country from the U.S.
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA will work to allow the export of animal drugs, whether or not they have been approved for marketing in the U.S., to any country so long as the exported product has been approved for marketing in the receiving country.  This change from current procedures would significantly relax restrictions on exports of animal drugs.
<P>
<B>Impact: </B> First, U.S. manufacturers of animal drugs will have the opportunity to expand their exports.  Because use conditions for animal drugs in other countries can differ dramatically from use conditions in the U.S., foreign countries frequently approve products with different dosages, claims, strengths, animal species, etc. than are considered for use in the U.S.  Legislative changes that permit the export of products in forms or with labeling that have not been approved in the U.S. will therefore expand the market available to U.S. exporters.
<P>
Second, companies may be more likely to locate animal drug manufacturing plants on U.S. territory.  Industry believes that the current statutory language has contributed to animal drug manufacturers locating plants off-shore where domestic laws do not prohibit finished dosage form drugs from being labeled according to the specifications of the foreign purchaser and according to the laws of the country to which it is intended for export.
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  This action requires a statutory change.  The Administration is engaged in discussions with Congress on new legislation.

	<H3><A NAME=abbreviated><I>4.  Abbreviated Application for Veterinary Drug Residues in Imported Foods</I></A></H3>

<B>Background:</B> Currently, FDA establishes legally acceptable levels (tolerance levels) of veterinary drug residues in food only through its drug approval process.  Thus, even for drugs that would not be used domestically (for example, because they are intended to treat diseases or pests that are not problems here), and for which the only domestic health concern would be that the residues in food be safe, the sponsor would submit, and the agency would review, data demonstrating that the drug is effective and safe for use in animals.
<P>
This requirement is burdensome both to the agency and industry, and adds nothing to public health or safety of American consumers.  It also has the following undesirable effects:
<UL>
 	<LI>it discourages manufacturers of drugs used in foreign countries from seeking tolerances for the drug residues in food, so that the United States government is less informed in foods exported to the United States;

 	<LI>it impedes the agency's ability to accept standards set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codes) for residues of veterinary drugs in foods, despite the FDA's commitment to Codes, and the standing given to Codex standards by the Uruguay Round Agreements; and

 	<LI>it shrinks the market abroad for animal drugs (that are or could be manufactured domestically) aimed at treating conditions or species not common in the United States, when food from those animals is intended for export to the United States.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  For animal drugs intended for use abroad, FDA will develop an administrative mechanism, or will seek specific legislative authority, to enable the agency to focus its reviews on the safety of the drug residue in the imported food product.  FDA would rely on the provisions of its new animal drug regulations that spell out the residue studies and toxicological data required to determine whether such a drug residue is safe, such that a tolerance level would be appropriate for humans who consume the food.  Such tolerances could be granted based on outside petitions or on the agency's own initiative, for example after reviewing a Codex decision to adopt a veterinary drug residue tolerance.  The agency would eliminate or reduce the requirements for its review of whether the drug is safe and effective for use in animals in foreign countries.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  This change would eliminate entirely, or make less burdensome, an unnecessary approval requirement and would be a step in the direction of international harmonization of regulatory requirements, as encouraged by the Uruguay Round Agreements. 
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  FDA is pursuing administrative solutions and concurrently seeking this specific legislative authority.


<H2><A NAME=other>OTHER REFORMS</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME=assessments><I>1.  Environmental Assessments for Animal Drugs, Animal Feed Additives, Food Additives, and Color Additives (FDA)</I></A></H3>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires all federal agencies, including the FDA, to assess the environmental impact of actions that may significantly affect the human environment.  Therefore, an animal drug, animal feed, food additive, or color additive, the approval of which may significantly affect the environment, cannot be approved unless the manufacturer has submitted an acceptable environmental assessment (EA).  Preparation of an EA can be quite expensive.  On the basis of FDA analysis of the EA, the Agency can either issue a "finding of no significant impact" (FONSI), or decide that a full environmental impact statement (EIS) must be prepared.  In almost every case, FDA issues a FONSI. 
<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is primarily responsible for the approval of animal drugs and animal feed additives.  The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is responsible for the approval of packaging for human food and substances added to human food.  Each of these Centers has developed categorical exclusions under which categories of industry submissions and Agency-initiated actions are excluded from the EA requirement.  The Centers have determined that their actions concerning those submissions will not have a significant effect on the human environment.  
<P>
However, there remain actions for which the food, food packaging, animal drug, and animal feed industries submit a hundred or more EAs to the Agency each year.  Based on its experience to date, CVM and CFSAN have identified additional categories of actions that individually and cumulatively have been determined not to affect the environment significantly.   
<P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA proposes to increase the number of categorical exclusions from the EA and EIS requirements.
<P>
FDA proposes to reduce the number of EAs required to be submitted by industry and, consequently, the number of FONSIs prepared by the Agency under NEPA, by increasing the number of categorical exclusions which are based upon little or no impact on the environment of the approval of the animal drug, animal feed, food additive, or color additive.  Based upon its experience to date in reviewing EAs, FDA believes that many animal drug and animal feed applications and food additive and color additive petitions will qualify for categorical exclusion.  For example, approvals of animal drugs for administration to companion animals would result in only minute releases of the animal drug into the environment as a result of use and such releases would not be environmentally significant.  FDA procedures will provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a usually excluded action may have a significant environmental impact -- circumstances that would require at least an EA. 
<P>
FDA will not categorically exclude from the EA requirement those approvals of products whose use may significantly affect the human environment.  Examples include, but are not limited to, drugs and feed additives administered for extended periods of time to food animals (e.g, cattle, poultry, farmed fish); drugs and feed additives administered to a large number of animals; and food-packaging materials that may affect solid waste management.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  These changes will benefit industry and will improve regulatory efficiency without having any adverse impact on public health or the environment. Industry and FDA could redirect thousands of dollars in development costs and human resources in preparing and reviewing EAs.   
Implementation and Timeline:  These changes will be implemented by amending FDA regulations, in consultation with the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), to increase the number of categorically excluded actions for which an EA or EIS is not required.  New regulations, proposed in consultation with CEQ, are expected to publish  by June, 1996.
<P>

	<H3><A NAME=elimination><I>2.  Elimination of Medicated Feed Applications (MFAs) (FDA)</I></A></H3>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> In order to manufacture a medicated feed containing a new  animal drug that requires a withdrawal period (i.e., a period of time prior to slaughter during which an animal may not be fed the medicated feed), a manufacturer must submit a medicated feed application (MFA).   Currently some 2,500 MFAs are submitted each year, and because of resource limitations, FDA contracts out the processing of these applications.  Among other information, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that MFAs contain a full statement of the composition of the feed, and a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing and packing of the animal feed.  Under the Act, facilities manufacturing medicated feed must manufacture these products  in compliance with FDA's current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations.  Inspections for compliance with CGMPs are conducted biennially.
  <P>
<B>Proposal and Justification:</B>  FDA has concluded that MFAs represent a sizable paperwork burden to industry, but provide no additional public protection to that provided by the Agency's product approval processes and by manufacturers' compliance with CGMP regulations.  The Administration supports legislative change that would eliminate MFAs and institute a system to license medicated feed manufacturing facilities that comply with CGMP regulations.  Any animal feed containing an approved new animal drug could be manufactured at a licensed facility; facilities would be subject to CGMP inspections biennially, as they are now; and licensing would be phased in over a 2-year period.  Licenses could be suspended or revoked for CGMP violations, as well as for an imminent hazard to the health of animals for which the feed is intended or an imminent hazard to humans consuming edible products derived from animals that consume medicated feeds.
<P>
<B>Impact:</B>  Elimination of MFAs would result in an estimated savings to industry in excess of $1 million per year, and a savings to FDA of $200,000 yearly that is currently allocated for the processing of MFAs by a contractor.  Each of the almost 1,800 existing facilities would need to apply for a license, and new license applications are projected annually for some 50 new or renovated facilities.  FDA would not charge fees for licenses. 
<P>
<B>Implementation and Timeline:</B>  This action requires a statutory change.  The Administration intends soon to initiate discussions with Congress on new legislation.
