<P>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT)<BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 20<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 20:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Transportation (DOT) is aggressively implementing<BR>

<P>its 23 NPR recommendations.  To date, DOT has fully implemented 1<BR>

<P>recommendation, partially implemented 9, and taken some type of<BR>

<P>action on the remaining 13.  However, Congress took action to prevent<BR>

<P>one recommendation from being implemented (DOT18).  Because the<BR>

<P>accompanying report identifying the steps needed to accomplish each<BR>

<P>recommendation had not been published as of September 7, 1994, it was<BR>

<P>not clear what actions were expected to implement some of the<BR>

<P>recommendations.  Furthermore, although DOT has begun to implement<BR>

<P>all 23 recommendations, some are highly controversial and their<BR>

<P>future disposition is uncertain.  Such recommendations include<BR>

<P>proposals to establish an Air Traffic Control Corporation (DOT04) and<BR>

<P>reform the U.S.  maritime industry (DOT16).  In addition, the savings<BR>

<P>obtained from rescissions of funding for highway demonstration<BR>

<P>projects (DOT17), the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts and<BR>

<P>Bus Program (DOT19), and two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)<BR>

<P>higher education programs (DOT21) represented only a fraction of the<BR>

<P>funds available for rescission. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOT has also formed seven reinvention teams that have developed about<BR>

<P>350 additional recommendations.  Some of the recommendations can be<BR>

<P>accomplished by an operating administration within DOT, while others<BR>

<P>need further study and involve the entire Department and in some<BR>

<P>cases, Congress, states, and transportation groups. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Overall, NPR's recommendations are consistent with the thrust of<BR>

<P>recommendations in our testimonies and reports.  But as we noted in<BR>

<P>our December 1992 transition series report entitled Transportation<BR>

<P>Issues (GAO/OGC-93-14TR), the challenge lies in implementing these<BR>

<P>recommendations.  Furthermore, DOT faces several additional<BR>

<P>challenges that NPR's recommendations did not address, such as<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- ensuring that the nation's air travelers receive the benefits of<BR>

<P>     deregulation from a highly competitive and financially healthy<BR>

<P>     airline industry;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- addressing the future of passenger rail in the United States,<BR>

<P>     including Amtrak's financial viability and operating efficiency<BR>

<P>     as well as the benefits and costs of high-speed rail in selected<BR>

<P>     corridors;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- strengthening FAA's and the Federal Railroad Administration's<BR>

<P>     inspection programs;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- improving FAA's acquisition systems;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- allocating FAA's limited funds under the Airport Improvement<BR>

<P>     Program to projects that best achieve the national goals of<BR>

<P>     reducing flight delays and increasing airport capacity while<BR>

<P>     preserving environmental quality; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- developing performance expectations and measures in conjunction<BR>

<P>     with the major goals of the National Highway System. <BR>

<P>
<P>      DOT01:  MEASURE<BR>

<P>      TRANSPORTATION SAFETY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends the development of common, governmentwide measures of<BR>

<P>transportation safety. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  This recommendation has merit, but the development<BR>

<P>of such measures will likely be difficult and take several years to<BR>

<P>implement.  Additionally, common governmentwide safety indicators<BR>

<P>should supplement, but not replace, predictors of safety problems<BR>

<P>that are specific to the individual modes of transportation.  Over<BR>

<P>the last several years, all modes have been working on developing<BR>

<P>mode-specific safety performance measures and predictors of safety<BR>

<P>problems.  It is important that these efforts be brought to fruition. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As we recommended in our management review of DOT and in numerous<BR>

<P>reports and testimonies, the individual modes should establish<BR>

<P>precursors of safety risk--that is, conditions or circumstances that,<BR>

<P>if left uncorrected, lead to accidents.  The ultimate goal of DOT's<BR>

<P>safety programs is to prevent accidents and their consequences: <BR>

<P>death, injury, and property damage.  We previously reported that in<BR>

<P>most instances, accident rates, especially in the rail and aviation<BR>

<P>areas, do not provide the most reliable basis on which to target<BR>

<P>inspection resources.  There are two major reasons:  (1) once the<BR>

<P>accident has occurred, it is too late to prevent it and (2) accidents<BR>

<P>occur too infrequently to be good indicators of all safety problems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Efforts by the individual modes to develop precursors of safety risk<BR>

<P>would better position the Department to delineate common measures of<BR>

<P>safety because doing so requires that the elements of a<BR>

<P>transportation system common to all modes be identified.  For<BR>

<P>example, every accident has associated dollar costs, and the use of<BR>

<P>any mode can be expressed in terms of output (e.g., cost per<BR>

<P>passenger mile or per ton mile) or per unit of exposure (e.g., cost<BR>

<P>per hour or per trip).  Greater standardization makes it easier to<BR>

<P>compare the benefits of added expenditures on safety across modes. <BR>

<P>In February 1994, we testified that current measures for assessing<BR>

<P>safety risk have limited use for cross-modal comparisons and that the<BR>

<P>Bureau of Transportation Statistics had made limited progress in<BR>

<P>developing performance indicators.  We also noted that it is unlikely<BR>

<P>any one safety measure can be applied across all modes because the<BR>

<P>data needed--extent of injuries and property damage--are often not<BR>

<P>reported, are incomplete, or are unreliable.  We suggested that the<BR>

<P>Bureau of Transportation Statistics could help ensure that safety<BR>

<P>becomes an integral component of DOT's overall performance indicators<BR>

<P>by remedying data limitations; determining the potential impacts of<BR>

<P>collecting these data on the modes, on state and local governments,<BR>

<P>and on the industries these governments regulate; and assessing the<BR>

<P>benefits of implementing one or a series of safety measures relative<BR>

<P>to their impacts. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOT has not developed governmentwide<BR>

<P>measures of transportation safety.  However, in December 1993, DOT<BR>

<P>established a working group, consisting of representatives of the<BR>

<P>Department's various operating administrations, to develop safety<BR>

<P>measures.  In May 1994, in response to a recommendation by this<BR>

<P>group, DOT established a common definition of transportation-related<BR>

<P>fatalities, which is one of several safety measures being assessed,<BR>

<P>to be used by the operating administrations within DOT for<BR>

<P>statistical reporting purposes.  Other safety measures being<BR>

<P>considered include the severity of injuries and the dollar value of<BR>

<P>property damage.  DOT expanded the working group to include<BR>

<P>representatives of other federal departments and agencies to<BR>

<P>determine the data needed for developing common transportation safety<BR>

<P>measures. <BR>

<P>      DOT02:  STREAMLINE THE<BR>

<P>      ENFORCEMENT PROCESS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends pilot programs in the U.S.  Coast Guard, the Federal<BR>

<P>Aviation Administration, and the Federal Highway Administration<BR>

<P>(FHWA), designed to offer greater flexibility in enforcement methods. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Because DOT has not started all of the<BR>

<P>pilot programs included under this recommendation, we do not have<BR>

<P>complete information on the type of flexibility envisioned.  However,<BR>

<P>before more flexibility is permanently added, DOT must ensure that<BR>

<P>the integrity of the underlying program for each mode is strong.  We<BR>

<P>have found that several modes could greatly improve their inspection<BR>

<P>and enforcement programs.  For example, we reported in 1991 that the<BR>

<P>Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) could enhance its enforcement<BR>

<P>program by seeking options to more expeditiously settle civil penalty<BR>

<P>cases.  At that time, FHWA was testing a system under which regional<BR>

<P>directors could send civil penalty letters directly to motor<BR>

<P>carriers.  We suggested that FRA could similarly have its regional<BR>

<P>offices formally notify railroads of violations and penalty<BR>

<P>assessments.  In 1994, we reported that FAA had not effectively<BR>

<P>managed its enforcement work load; as a result, foreign governments<BR>

<P>and FAA had not acted on all referred safety violations. <BR>

<P>Furthermore, neither FAA nor the State Department had established<BR>

<P>controls for tracking referrals.  We recommended that FAA determine<BR>

<P>the final disposition of enforcement cases referred to foreign<BR>

<P>governments; that FAA inform foreign governments of the disposition<BR>

<P>of enforcement cases that they refer to FAA; and that the Secretaries<BR>

<P>of Transportation and State work together to reach agreement on the<BR>

<P>best way to facilitate FAA's efforts to address regulatory violations<BR>

<P>by foreign carriers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Coast Guard and FHWA have implemented<BR>

<P>6-month pilot enforcement programs.  In April 1994, the Coast Guard<BR>

<P>published an Interim Final Rule establishing a pilot ticket program<BR>

<P>for violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and federal<BR>

<P>pollution prevention regulations.  That same month, the Coast Guard<BR>

<P>began the program at three port locations--Charleston, South<BR>

<P>Carolina; Galveston, Texas; and Los Angeles/Long Beach, California. <BR>

<P>In early 1994, FHWA began a pilot effort within one of its regions to<BR>

<P>reduce the time required for its investigators to prepare an<BR>

<P>enforcement report against carriers/shippers that violate motor<BR>

<P>carrier and/or hazardous materials regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FAA is in the process of implementing its pilot program.  In August<BR>

<P>1994, it issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation establishing a<BR>

<P>pilot program that streamlines the enforcement process for alleged<BR>

<P>security violations involving a proposed penalty of less than $5,000. <BR>

<P>FAA expects to begin testing this enforcement program at three<BR>

<P>airports after internal guidance implementing the program is<BR>

<P>approved. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Consistent with our previous recommendations, we support<BR>

<P>applying a cross-modal problem-solving approach to transportation<BR>

<P>planning, development, and decisionmaking at the federal and state<BR>

<P>level.  We understand that DOT has already initiated several efforts<BR>

<P>that use a consensus-building approach to expedite transportation and<BR>

<P>environmental decisionmaking at the federal level.  We support these<BR>

<P>actions and suggest that DOT not restrict pilot programs for such<BR>

<P>activities to these efforts alone.  Furthermore, we have recommended<BR>

<P>that the Secretary of Transportation assist states and localities by<BR>

<P>developing a framework for comparing highway and mass transit<BR>

<P>projects that considers mobility, environmental quality, safety,<BR>

<P>cost-effectiveness, and social and economic objectives.  Such a<BR>

<P>framework would aid efficient and effective transportation investment<BR>

<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  On May 3, 1994, the administration<BR>

<P>proposed to establish a government-owned corporation to operate,<BR>

<P>maintain, and modernize the nation's air traffic control (ATC)<BR>

<P>system.  This proposal links problems in FAA's modernization program,<BR>

<P>such as schedule delays and cost increases, to FAA's structure as a<BR>

<P>
<P>At a May 12, 1994, hearing on the administration's proposal, we<BR>

<P>testified that our work over the past decade does not show that<BR>

<P>exemption from procurement regulations would necessarily accelerate<BR>

<P>the installation of equipment in the field.  We found that delays in<BR>

<P>modernization were caused by other factors, such as underestimating<BR>

<P>the technical complexity of developing advanced systems.  We also<BR>

<P>noted that the creation of a corporation would change the financing<BR>

<P>and safety oversight of the ATC system in fundamental ways.  In the<BR>

<P>absence of implementing legislation detailing the proposal, we have<BR>

<P>questions about the actions proposed to accelerate investments, the<BR>

<P>assumptions made about revenues and expenditures, and the extent of<BR>

<P>the government's potential liability for the corporation's losses and<BR>

<P>debt.  We also noted that building an effective safety oversight<BR>

<P>function is an extremely formidable task, as evidenced by the<BR>

<P>difficulty that FAA has had in overseeing the airline industry.  We<BR>

<P>suggested that an effective oversight function should be in place<BR>

<P>before a corporation is established. <BR>

<P>report entitled Air Traffic Control:  Corporation Study, which<BR>

<P>recommended the creation of a wholly owned government<BR>

<P>corporation--U.S.  Air Traffic Services Corporation.  The proposed<BR>

<P>corporation would be a self-sufficient entity managed by a board of<BR>

<P>directors and would be exempt from many procurement and personnel<BR>

<P>rules.  FAA would oversee the safety of its operations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On May 12, 1994, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee<BR>

<P>on Transportation and Related Agencies, held a hearing on the<BR>

<P>proposed corporation.  The Secretary of Transportation, former DOT<BR>

<P>Secretaries, organized labor, general aviation, and GAO testified. <BR>

<P>Support for the proposal was mixed.  After the hearing, the<BR>

<P>administration began drafting legislation and continued discussing<BR>

<P>the proposal with Congress, user groups, and the public. <BR>

<P>DOT may not have general authority to permit states to capitalize<BR>

<P>(leverage) the flow of funds for transportation projects or programs,<BR>

<P>it has more limited legislative authority that allows the Secretary<BR>

<P>of Transportation to engage in research projects on highway<BR>

<P>financing.  DOT plans to use this authority to select several highway<BR>

<P>not pay any fee when passing through our nation's airspace.  The<BR>

<P>situation is much different overseas.  For example, U.S.  carriers<BR>

<P>flying through European airspace pay user fees that many airlines,<BR>

<P>both American and European, believe are excessive.  If the current<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  As we have previously noted in our reports and testimonies,<BR>

<P>we support establishing a strategic planning process as a first step<BR>

<P>towards ensuring a total systems approach to selecting among<BR>

<P>transportation alternatives.  For example, we have recommended that<BR>

<P>DOT develop common measures to compare different transportation<BR>

<P>alternatives.  Such measures would help states and localities<BR>

<P>identify the mix of projects--regardless of mode--needed to address<BR>

<P>their transportation priorities and problems.  Furthermore, models of<BR>

<P>the demand for travel could be improved to better analyze, among<BR>

<P>other things, the impacts of transportation projects on air quality. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>However, a planning process alone may not be sufficient.  DOT may<BR>

<P>need to consider organizational changes that coordinate the planning<BR>

<P>and financing arms of the separate modal administrations.  One such<BR>

<P>change, suggested by the National Academy of Public Administration<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support such an effort.  On the basis of our<BR>

<P>recommendations on the intelligent vehicle highway systems, Congress<BR>

<P>enacted into law a requirement that DOT develop a program of<BR>

<P>operational field tests in accordance with a strategic research plan. <BR>

<P>DOT needs to develop such a plan because it would be a necessary step<BR>

<P>towards enabling this family of technologies to fulfill its promise. <BR>

<P>Regarding FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development Program, we<BR>

<P>have reported that FAA's success in meeting current and future<BR>

<P>challenges will depend on several factors.  These factors include<BR>

<P>integrating research goals into other program areas, leveraging<BR>

<P>research conducted by other federal agencies, and integrating various<BR>

<P>technologies to meet specific safety and capacity problems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, in 1994 we reported that DOT did not have complete or<BR>

<P>accurate information on all research grant awards made to<BR>

<P>universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education<BR>

<P>and did not have an integrated plan to manage its diverse university<BR>

<P>research activities.  We recommended that DOT complete the<BR>

<P>development of a database to track the purpose and costs of each<BR>

<P>university research award and reinstitute a process to ensure that<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  At the heart of this issue are fundamental<BR>

<P>questions about the role the maritime industry is expected to play<BR>

<P>during both times of peace and times of conflict.  Maritime reform<BR>

<P>has been proposed repeatedly over the years by both the executive and<BR>

<P>legislative branches without resolution.  For example, during the<BR>

<P>closing months of the Bush administration, the Secretary of<BR>

<P>Transportation proposed major maritime reforms that were not adopted. <BR>

<P>If an independent commission, as suggested by NPR, would facilitate<BR>

<P>resolution of the issues surrounding the current vague and uncertain<BR>

<P>U.S.  maritime policy, it would be welcome. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.16.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Other.  An independent commission to review the maritime industry has<BR>

<P>not been established, and no actions toward this end appear to have<BR>

<P>been taken.  However, the need for such a commission could have<BR>

<P>diminished if an administration-proposed maritime reform bill had<BR>

<P>passed.  According to a Maritime Administration official responsible<BR>

<P>for tracking this recommendation, the driving force behind the<BR>

<P>recommendation was a need to develop new legislation to revitalize<BR>

<P>the maritime industry and halt the decline of the U.S.  merchant<BR>

<P>fleet.  If such legislation had passed, a commission would no longer<BR>

<P>be needed, this official believed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In March 1994, the administration presented its maritime reform<BR>

<P>proposal (contained in H.R.  4003 and S.  1945) to Congress, where it<BR>

<P>remains under review.  The proposal contained many provisions to help<BR>

<P>ensure that the United States will continue to have a fleet of<BR>

<P>merchant ships owned, controlled, and staffed by American citizens. <BR>

<P>For example, assistance would be provided for eligible ships to help<BR>

<P>owners compete in the global marketplace and be available to meet<BR>

<P>national security needs.  The total cost of the new assistance plan,<BR>

<P>however, would be less than under the current policy, according to<BR>

<P>the Maritime Administration official.  In August 1994, the House<BR>

<P>passed a version of H.R.  4003 containing maritime reform provisions. <BR>

<P>The Senate failed to pass any comparable legislation. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.17.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  As stated in our report and testimony<BR>

<P>(GAO/RCED-91-146 and GAO/T-RCED-93-29), highway demonstration<BR>

<P>projects frequently face impediments, such as citizen opposition or<BR>

<P>failure to satisfy key state transportation priorities, that can<BR>

<P>cause projects to languish in the early development stages or never<BR>

<P>get started at all.  We support rescinding unobligated balances for<BR>

<P>those projects that are clearly inactive as well as for those<BR>

<P>projects that are complete but still carry an unobligated balance. <BR>

<P>Criteria for defining inactive projects should provide a basis for<BR>

<P>the rescissions.  One option would be to require that funds be<BR>

<P>obligated within 4 years of their allocation.  This approach is in<BR>

<P>keeping with the rules that govern most other federal-aid highway<BR>

<P>program categories.  At the 4-year point, the funds could be<BR>

<P>rescinded, redistributed to other projects within the affected state,<BR>

<P>or distributed under other arrangements Congress directs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While we agree that most highway projects should compete at the state<BR>

<P>level for limited resources, it should be noted that in limited<BR>

<P>instances, targeting federal funds for a special project may be<BR>

<P>appropriate.  Projects that demonstrate new technology that is widely<BR>

<P>applicable could be one such instance.  To help ensure that such<BR>

<P>demonstration projects are sound investments, both the House<BR>

<P>appropriating and authorizing committees have recently developed<BR>

<P>screening mechanisms for considering the merits of individual<BR>

<P>projects. <BR>

<P>sum is only a small part of the billions of dollars in funding for<BR>

<P>existing highway demonstration projects.  The administration's fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1995 budget request for FHWA assumed that almost all highway<BR>

<P>demonstration project funding would be rescinded.  However, the<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.18.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Although some early actions were<BR>

<P>taken to implement this recommendation, Congress recently passed<BR>

<P>legislation to prevent its implementation.  As originally introduced<BR>

<P>in October 1993, section 11001 of the Government Reform and Savings<BR>

<P>Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400) would have implemented the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendation.  The Secretary of Transportation would have been<BR>

<P>required to establish a system of tuition and fees for individuals<BR>

<P>attending the Academy that, in total, would equal up to one-half of<BR>

<P>its operating cost.  However, the House Committee on Merchant Marine<BR>

<P>and Fisheries eliminated the tuition provisions from the act.  The<BR>

<P>Committee reported that charging tuition would be a major policy<BR>

<P>change and said that it planned to hold hearings before recommending<BR>

<P>changes.  Strong congressional opposition developed, and several<BR>

<P>bills were introduced in the House and Senate that included<BR>

<P>provisions to prohibit charging tuition.  A conference committee's<BR>

<P>version of S.  2182, which authorized appropriations for military<BR>

<P>activities for fiscal year 1995, contained provisions that prohibited<BR>

<P>charging for tuition at the U.S.  Merchant Marine Academy as well as<BR>

<P>at certain military academies.  This version of the bill was enacted<BR>

<P>on October 5, 1994 (P.L.  103-337). <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.19.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree with the recommendation to rescind<BR>

<P>unobligated balances but only for inactive or completed projects<BR>

<P>funded by FTA.  We urge caution in blanket rescissions because there<BR>

<P>may be acceptable reasons for a project's inability to obligate funds<BR>

<P>over time.  Criteria to define inactive projects need to be<BR>

<P>developed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.19.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Unobligated funds typically occur when<BR>

<P>earmarks are made prematurely.  To address this problem, the fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1993 Department of Transportation appropriations act provided<BR>

<P>that funds not obligated by September 30, 1995, be made available for<BR>

<P>other transit projects.  A similar legislative provision has been<BR>

<P>continued in subsequent appropriations acts.  For earlier years,<BR>

<P>however, some of the funds earmarked for transit projects remained<BR>

<P>unobligated.  FTA determined that, as of September 30, 1993, about<BR>

<P>$50.5 million in transit funds remained unobligated and proposed them<BR>

<P>for rescission.  However, the actual rescission was reduced to only a<BR>

<P>portion of this, $808,935, by the Emergency Supplemental<BR>

<P>Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L.  103-211, Chapter 10).  FTA expects<BR>

<P>the balance of approximately $49.7 million in transit funds to be<BR>

<P>obligated in fiscal year 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.20.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  The Essential Air Service (EAS) Program currently<BR>

<P>affects roughly 300 smaller communities in the United States.  This<BR>

<P>program is relatively small, accounting for less than $40 million in<BR>

<P>1992.  The EAS Program is often described by critics as uneconomical<BR>

<P>and as an unwarranted subsidy to small communities.  However, when<BR>

<P>the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, Congress guaranteed<BR>

<P>that small communities would continue to be connected to the nation's<BR>

<P>air system through direct service to a medium or large airport for a<BR>

<P>period of 10 years.  Congress later extended the program for an<BR>

<P>additional 10 years and has made other adjustments to this policy<BR>

<P>over the years.  The communities that benefit maintain that they<BR>

<P>would be adversely affected if the assistance were terminated and<BR>

<P>direct access to the nation's air transport network were lost. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In March 1994, we responded to a congressional request for<BR>

<P>information on the availability of air travel between small airports<BR>

<P>in the Midwest and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport under the<BR>

<P>EAS Program.  We found that, on average, the number of flights<BR>

<P>available between the 41 midwestern EAS communities and O'Hare had<BR>

<P>declined since the start of the program.  Of the 41 communities, 17<BR>

<P>have actually gained service, while 24 have lost service or receive<BR>

<P>the same service.  We also found that commuter slot holdings have<BR>

<P>become increasingly concentrated among a few airlines, but average<BR>

<P>yields (revenues per passenger mile) for operating between the small<BR>

<P>airports and O'Hare are roughly in the middle of the distribution of<BR>

<P>yields at other major airports.  Airport operators and airline<BR>

<P>representatives told us that O'Hare could accommodate more traffic by<BR>

<P>allocating slots more efficiently.  In addition, improvements<BR>

<P>undertaken as part of the O'Hare Airport Redevelopment Plan have<BR>

<P>increased the airport's overall capacity. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.20.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  DOT's fiscal year 1994 appropriation reduced EAS<BR>

<P>airport subsidies from $38.6 million to $33.4 million, a reduction of<BR>

<P>$5.2 million, which eliminated subsidies to commuter air carriers<BR>

<P>serving four communities through more restrictive criteria.  No<BR>

<P>subsidy was permitted for a small airport located less than 70<BR>

<P>highway miles from a medium or large hub airport; for a small airport<BR>

<P>located less than 210 miles from a hub airport, the per-passenger<BR>

<P>subsidy was limited to $200 or less.  The administration's fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1995 budget request calls for reducing EAS subsidies by an<BR>

<P>additional $7.8 million, to $25.6 million.  Although the House<BR>

<P>version of the DOT appropriation bill adopted this reduction, the<BR>

<P>Senate version restored the funding to $33.4 million.  The DOT<BR>

<P>appropriation act, Public Law 103-331 (September 30, 1994), sets the<BR>

<P>EAS appropriation at the Senate level of $33.4 million. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have not evaluated either the<BR>

<P>Collegiate Training Initiative Program or the Airways Science<BR>

<P>Curriculum and Grant Program, but we do have several observations to<BR>

<P>make on the basis of the body of work we have performed concerning<BR>

<P>FAA's work force.  We have testified that the Office of Personnel<BR>

<P>Management's register includes over 25,000 people qualified to seek<BR>

<P>employment as air traffic controllers.  This large backlog, and the<BR>

<P>administration's decision to allow controllers fired during the<BR>

<P>strike to compete for employment, should be considered in determining<BR>

<P>whether the Collegiate Training Initiative Program for air traffic<BR>

<P>controllers should be retained.  If Congress decides to terminate<BR>

<P>this program, it should consider using a phased approach to minimize<BR>

<P>the impact on the students involved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The stated purpose of the Airways Science Curriculum and Grant<BR>

<P>Program is to develop a base of aviation technicians and managers for<BR>

<P>FAA and for the aviation industry.  While a recent report by DOT's<BR>

<P>Inspector General found that the program offered little benefit to<BR>

<P>FAA, we have not conducted a review to determine whether there is a<BR>

<P>continuing need for this program or how the program affects the<BR>

<P>aviation industry. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 20:2.21.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  FAA has no immediate plans to<BR>

<P>terminate its two higher education programs.  It will, however,<BR>

<P>consider whether to continue the Collegiate Training Initiative<BR>

<P>Program at the end of 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In November 1993, FAA proposed the rescission of $40.3 million in<BR>

<P>grant funds for the Airways Science Curriculum and Grant Program, but<BR>

<P>Congress rescinded only $5.1 million.  Subsequently, FAA obligated<BR>

<P>the remaining $35.2 million.  FAA must continue to administer this<BR>

<P>program until every grant is closed.  FAA is planning to shift some<BR>

<P>of its responsibilities for identifying and developing curricula for<BR>

<P>this program to industry and academia, beginning in January 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Congress has not added funds for either of these two programs to<BR>

<P>FAA's fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill, as it has done to<BR>

<P>appropriations bills in prior years. <BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 8:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and other parts of the<BR>

<P>Executive Office of the President (EOP) have taken some action to<BR>

<P>implement all 12 of the recommendations in this section.  One<BR>

<P>recommendation has been fully implemented, and 6 more have been<BR>

<P>partially implemented.  In response to EOP01, OMB is attempting,<BR>

<P>within its authority, to streamline developing and clearing surveys<BR>

<P>as well as encouraging agencies to seek authority to review their<BR>

<P>information collection efforts.  For EOP02, OMB has begun a process<BR>

<P>for reviewing the OMB circulars and the process for modifying<BR>

<P>circulars.  Regarding EOP04, while OMB removed &quot;anti pass the hat&quot;<BR>

<P>language from the budget, the legislation signed into law retained<BR>

<P>this language preventing interagency funding for interagency<BR>

<P>organizations without prior statutory approval.  OMB has redirected<BR>

<P>resources to provide better management information by implementing a<BR>

<P>major reorganization integrating its management and budget functions<BR>

<P>(EOP05).  However, it is too soon to determine the effects of this<BR>

<P>reorganization on the quality of management information and the<BR>

<P>execution of OMB's management mission.  OMB has begun implementing<BR>

<P>EOP06 via actions such as attempting to increase consultation with<BR>

<P>executive agencies in developing the budget. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has<BR>

<P>partially implemented recommendations EOP03, EOP07, and EOP08. <BR>

<P>Coordination with state and local governments has improved through<BR>

<P>USTR's Office of Intergovernmental and Public Liaison.  To improve<BR>

<P>trade policy coordination, agencies have been added to the Trade<BR>

<P>Policy Review Group (TPRG), the interagency committee that<BR>

<P>coordinates the making of U.S.  trade policy.  To improve trade<BR>

<P>negotiating skills, a training class was created for USTR staff. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A Customer Service Bureau has been established within the Executive<BR>

<P>Office of the President (fully implementing EOP09), the Executive<BR>

<P>Office is continuing work on EOP10, internal review of critical<BR>

<P>administrative processes, and EOP12, improving administrative<BR>

<P>processes.  Regarding EOP11, the Office has taken action to provide<BR>

<P>guidelines for the presidential transition process, but taken no<BR>

<P>action to amend the Presidential Transition Act. <BR>

<P>      RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 8:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These recommendations outline improvements to streamline the<BR>

<P>government's paperwork review process and reduce unnecessary burdens<BR>

<P>on agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that OMB could delegate some routine<BR>

<P>paperwork reviews to agencies so that its limited resources could be<BR>

<P>used more effectively.  Reducing OMB's paperwork burden could improve<BR>

<P>its ability to provide broad management support to agencies. <BR>

<P>However, we need more specific information concerning the standards<BR>

<P>and guidelines envisioned for this delegation in order to determine<BR>

<P>its overall effect on OMB and the agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Executive Order 12862 requires agencies to<BR>

<P>establish outreach efforts to obtain comments from the customers<BR>

<P>served by federal agencies.  In October 1993, OMB published a<BR>

<P>Resource Manual for Customer Surveys.  This manual included<BR>

<P>information on techniques for developing customer satisfaction<BR>

<P>surveys and provisions for a &quot;generic&quot; clearance process to expedite<BR>

<P>approval of voluntary surveys under the Paperwork Reduction Act. <BR>

<P>Following the process detailed in the Resource Manual on Customer<BR>

<P>Surveys, OMB has approved several generic customer survey clearances,<BR>

<P>reducing the clearance time for the generic approvals from 12 weeks<BR>

<P>to 2 weeks. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that OMB review and approve most<BR>

<P>information collection requests and surveys of federal agencies so<BR>

<P>that the burden of these requests on citizens is minimized.  The act<BR>

<P>contains a provision that allows OMB to delegate review and approval<BR>

<P>authority for information collections to agencies that develop an<BR>

<P>independent review unit meeting OMB approval.  As part of OMB's<BR>

<P>effort to simplify and speed the process of approving agency<BR>

<P>information collection requests, on November 5, 1993, the Director of<BR>

<P>OMB sent a memorandum to the agencies clarifying OMB's ability to<BR>

<P>delegate paperwork review to agencies and describing the requirements<BR>

<P>agencies must meet to be granted that delegation.  Prior to the NPR<BR>

<P>initiative, only one agency, the Federal Reserve Board, had received<BR>

<P>the delegation of authority.  In response to OMB's memorandum on<BR>

<P>delegation, several additional agencies have initiated efforts to<BR>

<P>obtain delegations of authority for information collection clearance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Additionally, OMB is taking steps to simplify and improve the<BR>

<P>clearance process by encouraging agencies to collect information<BR>

<P>electronically and to use information technology to communicate with<BR>

<P>OMB. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While GAO has in the past commented on<BR>

<P>specific OMB circulars, we have not reviewed the process for<BR>

<P>developing the circulars and thus cannot comment on this<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OMB has taken initial steps to begin<BR>

<P>initiated a review of OMB circulars, and in August 1994 a list of<BR>

<P>circulars selected for intense review was prepared.  However, little<BR>

<P>progress has been made to improve the process for revising circulars<BR>

<P>as yet. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree with the need for the USTR to work with state and<BR>

<P>local trade officials regarding trade policy interests and priorities<BR>

<P>in order to identify the most important areas to pursue in reducing<BR>

<P>foreign barriers to U.S.  exports. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  A USTR official told us that the agency has<BR>

<P>acted to improve coordination with state and local governments, but<BR>

<P>not in response to the NPR recommendation.  In January of 1993, 8<BR>

<P>months prior to the issuance of the NPR report, USTR created an<BR>

<P>Office of the Assistant USTR for Intergovernmental and Public<BR>

<P>Liaison.  This office, headed by a political appointee, is intended<BR>

<P>to provide state and local governments greater access to USTR.  In<BR>

<P>December 1993, legislation implementing the North American Free Trade<BR>

<P>Agreement (NAFTA) was passed.  The law requires the President to<BR>

<P>consult with the states in order to achieve conformity of state laws<BR>

<P>with NAFTA and create a consultation process to address issues<BR>

<P>relating to NAFTA that directly affect the states.  This office is<BR>

<P>responsible for these actions.  Proposed legislation to implement the<BR>

<P>Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)<BR>

<P>would require establishment of a similar process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State and local government organizations we talked to generally<BR>

<P>agreed that USTR is accessible and does a good job of informing them<BR>

<P>of trade policy issues that affect them.  As part of the Uruguay<BR>

<P>Round negotiations, USTR consulted with state governments regarding<BR>

<P>efforts to expand the GATT government procurement code obligations to<BR>

<P>the sub-federal level.  Thirty-seven governors agreed to follow code<BR>

<P>procedures and open their procurement to foreign suppliers.  However,<BR>

<P>several organizations said that some recent USTR trade policy<BR>

<P>decisions with significant consequences for states were made without<BR>

<P>adequate consultation.  Also, some of these organizations are<BR>

<P>concerned that the three-person liaison office is not adequately<BR>

<P>staffed to meet current responsibilities and may be unable to meet<BR>

<P>any increased workload resulting from the new GATT regime. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We generally agree that legislative<BR>

<P>barriers should be removed whenever appropriate to facilitate<BR>

<P>cross-organizational cooperation.  However, elimination of &quot;anti pass<BR>

<P>the hat&quot; language would have consequences in addition to the<BR>

<P>elimination of barriers to cooperation.  Removal of this type of<BR>

<P>prohibition would significantly alter Congress' ability to control<BR>

<P>the use of appropriated funds.  Before removing statutory barriers to<BR>

<P>cross-organizational cooperation, their intended purposes should be<BR>

<P>weighed against any other consequences. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have long advocated OMB's increased attention to<BR>

<P>its management role.  OMB's leadership is important for dealing with<BR>

<P>difficult issues both within and across the federal sector.  In our<BR>

<P>1990 testimony, we concluded that having the management and budget<BR>

<P>staff work together and establishing a systematic process to evaluate<BR>

<P>key management issues could help OMB reach its management leadership<BR>

<P>potential.  Information on the actions NPR proposes is not yet<BR>

<P>available and so we are not able to comment on them. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On March 1, 1994, OMB initiated a major<BR>

<P>reorganization of its staff, redirecting how its resources are<BR>

<P>focused on agency and cross-cutting issues.  However, it is too soon<BR>

<P>to determine whether these changes will enable OMB to provide better<BR>

<P>management information for presidential decisionmaking.  OMB needs to<BR>

<P>establish clear goals and specific performance measures in order to<BR>

<P>ensure that the reorganization is having the desired effects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB's reorganization incorporated both former management and budget<BR>

<P>staff into new Resource Management Offices.  It has instituted a new<BR>

<P>&quot;program examiner&quot; position, replacing separate budget examiner and<BR>

<P>management staff positions.  Program examiners are responsible for<BR>

<P>all matters pertaining to a specific area, including budget,<BR>

<P>legislative, management, financial management, procurement, and<BR>

<P>regulatory policymaking issues.  OMB intends to broaden the scope of<BR>

<P>agency reviews to include management issues as well as governmentwide<BR>

<P>initiatives, such as the Government Performance and Results Act and<BR>

<P>the Chief Financial Officers Act.  A memorandum from the Director of<BR>

<P>OMB stated that the reorganization was intended to improve OMB's<BR>

<P>ability to oversee agency programs and policies to ensure their<BR>

<P>efficiency and effectiveness. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We clearly agree with this recommendation that OMB<BR>

<P>work with agencies to identify the most important management issues<BR>

<P>and the policies needed to address them.  Our general management<BR>

<P>review of OMB found that the agencies appear to operate best when a<BR>

<P>consultative, cooperative approach has been used in addressing<BR>

<P>management issues.  It is also important for OMB to work effectively<BR>

<P>with the states in overseeing the implementation of policies and<BR>

<P>programs and assessing their effectiveness and efficiency. <BR>

<P>actions to improve its relationship with other agencies and states,<BR>

<P>it is too early to determine whether these actions result in building<BR>

<P>more effective working relationships. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On May 31, 1994, OMB's Director and Deputy Director distributed<BR>

<P>guidance encouraging OMB staff to establish a dialog between OMB and<BR>

<P>the agencies about important issues and policies, share information<BR>

<P>and analyses, and work with agencies on management and other<BR>

<P>long-range issues.  On August 11, 1994, OMB held a meeting with<BR>

<P>agency officials to review budget and management issues that would be<BR>

<P>addressed in the fall's budget formulation process.  According to an<BR>

<P>OMB official, this kind of discussion was unprecedented. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB's March 1, 1994, reorganization, integrating management and<BR>

<P>budget functions, may enhance OMB's ability to examine the impact of<BR>

<P>policy initiatives on state and local governments.  OMB's Office of<BR>

<P>Information and Regulatory Affairs has also taken steps to hold<BR>

<P>periodic meetings with state and local government officials to<BR>

<P>discuss regulatory issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support improved coordination of trade<BR>

<P>policymaking among federal international trade agencies.  However, we<BR>

<P>have not done work to identify which changes to the interagency trade<BR>

<P>policymaking process would be most effective in improving this<BR>

<P>coordination.  In a 1990 report on tobacco export policy, we<BR>

<P>suggested that, if Congress intends health issues to receive<BR>

<P>consideration in trade negotiations, Congress could specifically<BR>

<P>require that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<BR>

<P>actively participate in the interagency trade policymaking process. <BR>

<P>In a 1993 report, we recommended that the administration evaluate the<BR>

<P>usefulness of, and assess the need for, a particular interagency<BR>

<P>trade policymaking body, the National Advisory Council on<BR>

<P>International Monetary and Financial Policies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The administration began to take steps to<BR>

<P>improve interagency coordination of trade policymaking before the NPR<BR>

<P>report was issued.  In November 1993, the Environmental Protection<BR>

<P>Agency and HHS were formally added to the Trade Policy Review Group<BR>

<P>(TPRG), the interagency committee that coordinates the formulation of<BR>

<P>U.S.  trade policy.  Also, the White House's National Economic<BR>

<P>Council (NEC), from its inception, has played a role in coordinating<BR>

<P>the interagency trade policymaking process.  Since issuance of the<BR>

<P>NPR report, little additional implementation has occurred. <BR>

<P>Additional means by which to implement this recommendation remain<BR>

<P>under discussion within the EOP.  One area that may require attention<BR>

<P>is clarification of the NEC's role in the trade policymaking process. <BR>

<P>There appears to be some duplication of effort between the NEC and<BR>

<P>the TPRG.  Also, agencies have complained that the NEC's operating<BR>

<P>procedures are unclear. <BR>

<P>

<P>staff.  The 5-day course is designed for all USTR staff who are<BR>

<P>negotiators or who expect to become negotiators, and consists of<BR>

<P>training in negotiating skills, a mock negotiations exercise, and<BR>

<P>discussions of &quot;lessons learned&quot; in past USTR negotiations.  USTR's<BR>

<P>goal is to put every eligible staff member through the course by the<BR>

<P>end of 1994.  So far about 50 USTR staff have taken the class.  Since<BR>

<P>June 1994, the course has been open to officials in other federal<BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 8:2.9.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  On the basis of the recommendations of a working<BR>

<P>group, the EOP established a Customer Service Bureau in late 1993 in<BR>

<P>the Office of Administration to serve EOP agencies.  Two permanent<BR>

<P>positions for the bureau were approved in June 1994.  The bureau<BR>

<P>provides services for EOP agencies in project management, direct<BR>

<P>administrative support, and training. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>During staff orientation, employees are instructed about the Customer<BR>

<P>Service Bureau.  A workshop series presented a seminar on the<BR>

<P>Customer Service Bureau in March 1994.  Further, the Assistant<BR>

<P>Director in the Office of Administration conducted meetings for staff<BR>

<P>to discuss issues related to customer services.  In addition, the<BR>

<P>Office produced a tabbed telephone book highlighting customer service<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We agree with the need for continual<BR>

<P>cost.  However, we have not addressed this issue specifically in the<BR>

<P>EOP. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 8:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The EOP entered into a new initiative<BR>

<P>to review the Office of Administration's Directives.  The EOP<BR>

<P>directors submitted recommended changes to the directives during the<BR>

<P>spring of 1994.  As of September 1994, the Office of General Counsel<BR>

<P>had not conducted its review of the directives to determine the<BR>

<P>revisions that can be made. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The EOP also routinely conducts two series of reviews to monitor<BR>

<P>financial operations.  The Financial Management Division periodically<BR>

<P>assesses high-risk areas to prevent occurrence of material weaknesses<BR>

<P>in agencies for whom the EOP provides financial services.  Annually,<BR>

<P>the EOP performs independent reviews and prepares reports under the<BR>

<P>Financial Integrity Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, the Office of Administration has established special<BR>

<P>programs to develop staff capabilities to enhance customer services<BR>

<P>operations.  On the basis of a working group's recommendations to<BR>

<P>improve customer services, the EOP instituted a series of seminars,<BR>

<P>workshops, and meetings during fiscal year 1994 to improve staff<BR>

<P>communication and teamwork. <BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have not looked at this process since 1988.  Our<BR>

<P>past reviews of presidential transitions have recommended that<BR>

<P>Congress may wish to consider amendments to the Presidential<BR>

<P>assessed the need for improvements in mail processing, paperwork<BR>

<P>flow, and supply management at the EOP.  However, our recent work at<BR>

<P>the White House indicates that improvements in personnel and<BR>

<P>procurement processes warranted attention to ensure that appropriate<BR>

<P>procurement practices are followed in a timely manner, and that<BR>

<P>personnel actions are processed accurately and promptly to avoid<BR>

<P>unnecessary retroactive corrections. <BR>

<P>no fixed completion date.  The Office has upgraded technical<BR>

<P>operations in the supply system, the publishing branch, the financial<BR>

<P>management system, and the library system.  These systems will<BR>

<P>require some assessment annually as part of the 5-year planning<BR>

<P>process for information technology under OMB Circular A-130. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, the Administrative Operations group formed a quality<BR>

<P>management team to develop improvements in processes.  The Office<BR>

<P>reports that the team has refined staff scheduling and reduced<BR>

<P>overtime.  This team gives staff the opportunity to continue to<BR>

<P>generate better methods for performing their work. <BR>

<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 7:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Of the 11 NPR recommendations addressed to EPA, the agency has fully<BR>

<P>implemented 1, partially implemented 3 others, and taken some action<BR>

<P>but not implemented 7 others.  EPA had begun to reorganize the Office<BR>

<P>of Enforcement before the NPR issued its report, and the agency had<BR>

<P>fully implemented this recommendation by October 1993 (EPA11). <BR>

<P>Similarly, EPA has been carrying out activities for several years to<BR>

<P>implement the three partially implemented recommendations--to<BR>

<P>increase flexibility for local governments (EPA01), consider<BR>

<P>environmental justice (EPA09), and promote quality science (EPA10). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA has initiated some activity to implement the remaining seven<BR>

<P>recommendations, even though it has not finished responding to the<BR>

<P>specific action items associated with these recommendations.  It is<BR>

<P>important to note, however, that while many of these action items<BR>

<P>call for new activities, EPA initiated efforts in past years that<BR>

<P>further the goals of several of the seven recommendations, including<BR>

<P>the recommendations to place more emphasis on preventing pollution<BR>

<P>(EPA03), establish measurable environmental goals (EPA07), and reform<BR>

<P>the agency's contract management process (EPA08). <BR>

<P>      GOVERNMENTS<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 7:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA should amend the regulations it determines are most troublesome<BR>

<P>for local governments pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of<BR>

<P>1980.  The goal is to provide alternative, flexible approaches to<BR>

<P>meeting environmental mandates. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  EPA should amend the regulations pursuant to the Regulatory<BR>

<P>Flexibility Act of 1980 determined to be most troublesome for local<BR>

<P>government to provide alternative and flexible approaches to meeting<BR>

<P>environmental mandates. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  EPA should convene a series of town meetings across the United<BR>

<P>States with environmental and other citizen groups and local<BR>

<P>officials to ensure that outside input is considered before<BR>

<P>regulatory reform recommendations are finalized. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  EPA should establish a pilot project that will assist one<BR>

<P>community to assess its environmental and community health risks in<BR>

<P>directing resources to priority problems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our work has documented the regulatory burdens many<BR>

<P>localities face in meeting environmental requirements.  Accordingly,<BR>

<P>we support the goal of providing alternative, flexible approaches to<BR>

<P>meeting environmental mandates, including nonregulatory approaches<BR>

<P>such as market-based incentives and pollution prevention strategies. <BR>

<P>However, in our view it might be more appropriate to provide such<BR>

<P>flexibility by amending the pertinent environmental statutes rather<BR>

<P>than by providing it through the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <BR>

<P>Furthermore, in providing local governments with regulatory relief,<BR>

<P>care must be taken to ensure that human health and the environment<BR>

<P>are adequately protected and to avoid creating environmental<BR>

<P>inequities between localities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  EPA is taking steps to reduce regulatory<BR>

<P>burdens on small communities by soliciting their comments on the<BR>

<P>regulations that they find most burdensome.  For example, the agency<BR>

<P>recently changed a rule to give small communities separate<BR>

<P>consideration on the basis of the amount of solid waste they produce. <BR>

<P>EPA is now gathering information at the state and local levels to<BR>

<P>identify possible alternatives to current regulations.  It has formed<BR>

<P>a Local Government Advisory Committee and a Small Town Task Force<BR>

<P>Advisory Committee to advise the EPA Administrator and recommend ways<BR>

<P>to increase flexibility for local governments.  EPA is also<BR>

<P>encouraging states to more fully utilize the flexibilities in current<BR>

<P>regulations.  For example, the Office of Water has asked EPA regional<BR>

<P>offices and states to increase their use of monitoring flexibilities<BR>

<P>already built into chemical regulations under the agency's drinking<BR>

<P>water program.  In particular, the Office has strongly encouraged<BR>

<P>states to develop, and regions to approve, monitoring waiver<BR>

<P>programs.  These waiver programs would allow drinking water systems,<BR>

<P>under certain conditions, to forgo expensive testing for water<BR>

<P>contaminants if these contaminants were extremely unlikely to be<BR>

<P>found in the systems' water supplies.  Also, the President's Clean<BR>

<P>Water Initiative, announced in February 1994, proposed changes to the<BR>

<P>Clean Water Act that would allow market-based incentives and would<BR>

<P>increase flexibility for local governments.  The reauthorization bill<BR>

<P>incorporating these proposed changes was not passed during the 103rd<BR>

<P>Congress (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA has convened town meetings to obtain public comment on proposed<BR>

<P>changes in the agency's regulations.  For example, the Office of<BR>

<P>Solid Waste and Emergency Response has scheduled town meetings with<BR>

<P>local government officials and citizen groups to solicit their views<BR>

<P>on regulatory reforms (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA established a pilot project in Columbus, Ohio, to assess health<BR>

<P>risks in the community.  The project has reviewed the community's<BR>

<P>environmental risks and is developing priorities through a consensus<BR>

<P>process to target resources to the most pressing environmental needs. <BR>

<P>In addition, EPA's Region 8 is pilot testing a block grant program<BR>

<P>with the states of Montana and North Dakota that would give these<BR>

<P>states the flexibility to move resources from one program or medium<BR>

<P>to another to meet environmental program goals and optimize<BR>

<P>environmental results.  The agency is also planning several<BR>

<P>cross-media and media-specific pilot programs at the local and state<BR>

<P>levels to test whether increasing flexibility will improve the<BR>

<P>performance of environmental protection programs (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  EPA should establish a permit clearinghouse by July 1995 to serve<BR>

<P>governments to obtain information about national and regional<BR>

<P>regulations and permitting requirements. <BR>

<P>authority and permit fee systems in place to take full responsibility<BR>

<P>for permit programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  EPA should identify, by June 1994, statutes that prevent<BR>

<P>follow-up action. <BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Although the concept of streamlining the<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  EPA is in the initial phase of<BR>

<P>addressing this recommendation.  The agency chartered a Permit<BR>

<P>Streamlining Task Force in July 1994 to improve environmental<BR>

<P>permitting processes.  The task force was charged with developing an<BR>

<P>implementation plan by September 30, 1994, that would establish<BR>

<P>priorities for action and detailed plans and time frames for<BR>

<P>implementing the permitting improvements embodied in all four of the<BR>

<P>recommendation's action items.  EPA has developed an interim action<BR>

<P>plan and expects to complete the final plan by December 15, 1994. <BR>

<P>      CONTROL<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 7:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA needs to emphasize pollution prevention by implementing an<BR>

<P>effective pollution prevention strategy that includes amending<BR>

<P>regulations and motivating the private sector to invest in cleaner,<BR>

<P>less polluting technologies and practices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The preamble to each major rule proposed by EPA should include a<BR>

<P>summary of the total multimedia releases and resultant risks to the<BR>

<P>environment from the activities that are the subject of the rule. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  EPA should use its flexibility as it already has for the pulp and<BR>

<P>paper industry to adjust regulatory timetables so that major rules<BR>

<P>are proposed on the same date. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  EPA should change existing reporting requirements that create<BR>

<P>disincentives to multimedia inspections and enforcement actions at<BR>

<P>both the federal and state level. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  EPA should move toward a consolidated grant approach providing<BR>

<P>states with maximum flexibility in the use of federal funds in<BR>

<P>carrying out responsibilities that have been delegated to the states<BR>

<P>by EPA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  EPA should provide states with incentives to invest funds in<BR>

<P>water conservation and pollution prevention programs that reduce<BR>

<P>pollutant loadings of concern. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  EPA should invite a specific industry sector to jointly undertake<BR>

<P>several projects to evaluate the feasibility of developing multimedia<BR>

<P>pollution prevention strategies for that particular industry. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  EPA should help focus existing private sector labeling and<BR>

<P>standards programs by identifying the product categories of greatest<BR>

<P>concern.  In addition, the agency should work with the American<BR>

<P>National Standards Institute in developing a coherent U.S.  position<BR>

<P>on eco-labeling and life-cycle analysis. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  EPA should work cooperatively with the Department of Agriculture<BR>

<P>(USDA), the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies to<BR>

<P>develop a national strategy to promote more efficient use of<BR>

<P>pesticides and fertilizers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>9.  EPA should develop a plan for implementing the two pending<BR>

<P>executive orders on pollution prevention and recycling, so that it<BR>

<P>can carry out its role and work jointly with other federal agencies,<BR>

<P>as outlined in the executive orders. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>10.  EPA should create an integrated database that provides<BR>

<P>information useful for measuring performance by industry, sector, and<BR>

<P>facility, and for devising long-term multimedia pollution prevention<BR>

<P>strategies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>11.  EPA should earmark funds for environmental technology for<BR>

<P>prevention. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>12.  A significant portion of funds for the Environmental Technology<BR>

<P>Initiative should be targeted for technical assistance, including<BR>

<P>information access. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support pollution prevention strategies.  A central theme<BR>

<P>running through much of our work over the past several years has been<BR>

<P>that it is far less expensive (and more environmentally beneficial)<BR>

<P>to reduce or eliminate pollution at its source rather than treat it<BR>

<P>at the &quot;end of the pipe.&quot; Although EPA has taken steps towards<BR>

<P>promoting pollution prevention, our work has stressed the need for<BR>

<P>EPA to place greater emphasis on these efforts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  EPA's Pollution Prevention Policy<BR>

<P>Statement broadly addresses this recommendation.  The agency has<BR>

<P>taken numerous steps to build pollution prevention into each of its<BR>

<P>media areas.  The implementation of this recommendation is driven by<BR>

<P>two executive orders and is reflected in institutional changes at<BR>

<P>EPA.  On August 3, 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order<BR>

<P>12856, which requires the volume of toxic pollutants released into<BR>

<P>the environment from federal facilities to be cut in half by 1999. <BR>

<P>The order also requires all federal agencies to comply with the<BR>

<P>Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, which<BR>

<P>authorized programs to provide information on hazardous and toxic<BR>

<P>chemicals and established emergency planning and notification<BR>

<P>requirements.  On October 20, 1993, President Clinton signed<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12873, which requires the federal government to<BR>

<P>procure recycled paper and other products, such as rerefined oil and<BR>

<P>retread tires. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Responsibility for addressing the first and second action items rests<BR>

<P>with the Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation's Regulatory<BR>

<P>Policy Council.  According to a Council member, EPA is not responding<BR>

<P>across the board to the requirement for a summary of the total<BR>

<P>multimedia releases and resultant risks to the environment because<BR>

<P>the technology for responding to this requirement does not exist<BR>

<P>(action item 1).  The Council has tried to adjust and schedule<BR>

<P>regulatory timetables for particular industries.  Specifically, it<BR>

<P>has decided to adjust the regulatory timetables for the six<BR>

<P>industries included in EPA's Common Sense Initiative--the automobile<BR>

<P>assembly, computer and electronics, iron and steel, metal plating and<BR>

<P>finishing, petroleum refining, and printing industries (action item<BR>

<P>2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The recent reorganization of EPA's enforcement office changed<BR>

<P>reporting requirements, establishing the Office of Enforcement and<BR>

<P>Compliance Assurance (OECA), which is organized primarily around<BR>

<P>economic sectors and is designed to support industries' efforts to<BR>

<P>meet environmental requirements by preventing pollution (action item<BR>

<P>3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Steps have been taken to give states greater flexibility in using<BR>

<P>federal funds to carry out responsibilities delegated to them by EPA. <BR>

<P>For example, the legislation proposed to reauthorize the Federal<BR>

<P>Water Pollution Control Act (H.R.  3948) would give maximum<BR>

<P>flexibility in using grant funds to states adopting a watershed<BR>

<P>approach (action item 4).  This legislative proposal would also give<BR>

<P>states incentives to invest in water conservation and pollution<BR>

<P>prevention programs.  EPA helped to develop the language in the<BR>

<P>proposal establishing such incentives for states (action item 5). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA will invite industry to participate in developing multimedia<BR>

<P>pollution prevention strategies for specific industrial sectors<BR>

<P>through the Common Sense Initiative.  This initiative will bring<BR>

<P>together federal, state, and local representatives; environmental<BR>

<P>leaders; and industry executives to examine the full range of<BR>

<P>environmental requirements affecting six selected industries--the<BR>

<P>automobile assembly, computer and electronics, iron and steel, metal<BR>

<P>plating and finishing, petroleum refining, and printing industries<BR>

<P>(action item 6). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA is developing guidance that will assist agencies in identifying<BR>

<P>environmentally preferable products for purchase (action item 7), and<BR>

<P>it is working with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and the Food<BR>

<P>and Drug Administration to develop a comprehensive food<BR>

<P>safety/pesticide strategy (action item 8). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA has taken steps to implement two executive orders on pollution<BR>

<P>prevention and recycling.  Specifically, EPA's Office of Pollution<BR>

<P>Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) has developed a plan to implement<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12856 to reduce toxics released into the environment. <BR>

<P>Also, in April 1994, EPA proposed procurement guidelines for federal<BR>

<P>agencies and departments to use in implementing Executive Order 12873<BR>

<P>on recycling.  An interagency task force met in May 1994 to develop a<BR>

<P>plan to implement Executive Order 12856 and draft interim final<BR>

<P>guidance (action item 9). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPPT is creating a database for pollution prevention strategies<BR>

<P>(action item 10) and is developing an implementation plan to earmark<BR>

<P>funds for environmental protection technology (action item 11).  In<BR>

<P>addition, EPA has targeted fiscal year 1995 Environmental Technology<BR>

<P>Initiative funds for technical assistance and is soliciting project<BR>

<P>proposals, pending congressional approval (action item 12). <BR>

<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  EPA should develop an action plan with specific milestones, by<BR>

<P>mid-1994, for improving the regulatory and statutory climate for<BR>

<P>innovative technologies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  EPA, in partnership with other federal agencies, should establish<BR>

<P>options available in the marketplace by helping businesses obtain<BR>

<P>financing for new technologies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  EPA should develop and promote a series of monographs to assist<BR>

<P>industry in identifying pollution prevention opportunities and making<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  EPA should establish five partnerships similar to the McClellan<BR>

<P>Air Force Base model to expand available sites where developers and<BR>

<P>vendors can test and evaluate their technologies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  EPA should establish an environmental technology performance<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support improving the climate for innovative technologies. <BR>

<P>Several of our reviews in the Superfund and drinking water/wastewater<BR>

<P>areas have identified barriers hindering the wider use of innovative<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In January 1994, the EPA<BR>

<P>Administrator announced the U.S.  EPA Environmental Technology<BR>

<P>Initiative:  FY 1994 Program Plan and the Technology Innovation<BR>

<P>Strategy as a combined action plan for developing public-private<BR>

<P>partnerships to accelerate the development of environmental<BR>

<P>technologies.  The strategy contains several specific objectives<BR>

<P>designed to reduce regulatory and policy barriers that inhibit<BR>

<P>innovation in technology.  Of the $36 million that EPA has invested<BR>

<P>in 73 projects in fiscal year 1994 to develop and commercialize<BR>

<P>technology, about $2 million is being allocated for 12 projects that<BR>

<P>address specific regulatory and policy issues.  Work on many of these<BR>

<P>projects has just begun, and completion is planned by the middle of<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1995.  Milestones are being set within each project's<BR>

<P>schedule (action item 1).  EPA has provided financing for small<BR>

<P>businesses to commercialize new technologies through the agency's<BR>

<P>Small Business Innovation Research program (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To assist industry in identifying pollution prevention opportunities<BR>

<P>and making informed, responsible design choices, EPA has developed<BR>

<P>two case study reports--A Summary of Pollution Prevention Case<BR>

<P>Studies with Economic Data and Abstracts of Pollution Prevention Case<BR>

<P>Study Sources (action item 3).  The agency is also selecting five<BR>

<P>partnerships for industry to test and evaluate environmental<BR>

<P>technologies under the Environmental Technology Initiative, subject<BR>

<P>to the proposed projects' selection for funding through the<BR>

<P>initiative in fiscal year 1995 (action item 4). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA is funding a feasibility study to develop options for an<BR>

<P>environmental technology performance verification program.  One of<BR>

<P>the focus areas for funding in the fiscal year 1995 Environmental<BR>

<P>Technology Initiative is Innovation Capacity.  This area will address<BR>

<P>environmental technology performance verification (action item 5). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Under a program called Design for the Environment, EPA has<BR>

<P>established two partnerships with the printing and dry cleaning<BR>

<P>industries to reengineer products and processes to prevent pollution<BR>

<P>through the use of safer chemicals.  Three additional partnerships<BR>

<P>are being negotiated with the aerospace, metal plating, and wiring<BR>

<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  EPA should work with Congress in developing legislation that<BR>

<P>would stop the United States from exporting banned pesticides by June<BR>

<P>1994. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We understand that there are strongly held,<BR>

<P>different views on this matter.  We agree that exporting substances<BR>

<P>banned in this country is troubling and deserves further examination. <BR>

<P>Our report entitled Pesticides:  Limited Testing Finds Few Exported<BR>

<P>Unregistered Pesticide Violations on Imported Food (1) identified<BR>

<P>unregistered pesticides produced in the United States for export and<BR>

<P>(2) determined, on the basis of the results of testing by FDA and<BR>

<P>USDA, whether these pesticides are returning to the United States as<BR>

<P>residues on imported goods.  While we found that FDA's monitoring for<BR>

<P>such residues indicated that these problems are rare, we did discover<BR>

<P>that FDA lacked sufficient information to provide complete assurance<BR>

<P>that the problems were not occurring. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  EPA has worked with Congress to<BR>

<P>develop legislation to stop the export of banned pesticides; however,<BR>

<P>this proposal was not passed during the 103rd Congress.  Although the<BR>

<P>agency has taken action on all three action items, the export of<BR>

<P>banned pesticides has not ended.  EPA regulates the sale and use of<BR>

<P>pesticides under two statutes--the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and<BR>

<P>Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. <BR>

<P>On September 21, 1993, the administration announced a plan for<BR>

<P>reforming FIFRA that included a provision to ban the export of<BR>

<P>pesticides whose registrations for domestic use had been canceled or<BR>

<P>denied for health or safety reasons.  Legislative proposals to amend<BR>

<P>FIFRA (H.R.  4329 and S.  2050) also contained provisions to prohibit<BR>

<P>the export of certain pesticides (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA is working with other countries and appropriate organizations on<BR>

<P>the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) system, a procedure through which<BR>

<P>participating importing countries receive information about<BR>

<P>pesticides whose use has been banned or severly restricted because of<BR>

<P>concerns about the pesticides' effects on health and/or the<BR>

<P>environment.  The importing nation can then allow or prohibit a<BR>

<P>pesticide's import.  Under FIFRA, EPA does not have the authority to<BR>

<P>prohibit the export of banned pesticides as long as certain labeling<BR>

<P>and notification requirements have been met (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA works with other agencies to respond to requests from developing<BR>

<P>countries for technical assistance, but no agency funds are set aside<BR>

<P>specifically for this purpose.  The legislative proposals to amend<BR>

<P>FIFRA (H.R.  4329 and S.  2050) direct EPA to provide technical<BR>

<P>assistance to developing countries and authorize funding for this<BR>

<P>purpose (action item 3); however, these proposals were not passed<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We concur with the need for measurable environmental goals. <BR>

<P>A central theme of our work over the past several years has been the<BR>

<P>need for EPA to establish strategic plans and develop measurable<BR>

<P>environmental goals and indicators.  These goals, strategies, and<BR>

<P>indicators are critical for EPA to ensure that (1) the most pressing<BR>

<P>environmental needs are addressed in an era of limited resources and<BR>

<P>(2) progress in these efforts can be tracked and assessed. <BR>

<P>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  EPA has drafted a 5-year strategic<BR>

<P>plan that is intended to define the agency's role and direction into<BR>

<P>the next century.  Although the plan includes guiding principles for<BR>

<P>the agency, it states that EPA is still developing measurable<BR>

<P>environmental goals (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On the national level, EPA appears to be on schedule in establishing<BR>

<P>measurable goals by Earth Day (Apr.  22, 1995) for the range of<BR>

<P>environmental problems the United States faces.  As a first step, EPA<BR>

<P>launched the National Environmental Goals Project in November 1993. <BR>

<P>To date, this project has developed a preliminary list of broad<BR>

<P>environmental goal areas for which measurable goals need to be set. <BR>

<P>EPA is holding public meetings across the country during 1994 to<BR>

<P>discuss the draft goal areas and obtain public input.  After<BR>

<P>obtaining input, EPA will develop the goal statements, which the<BR>

<P>public will review during a second round of meetings, and EPA will<BR>

<P>finalize and release the statements.  EPA plans to link its future<BR>

<P>strategic plans to this complete set of measurable goals (action item<BR>

<P>2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>EPA's implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of<BR>

<P>1993 (GPRA) began in fiscal year 1994 when the Office of Management<BR>

<P>and Budget (OMB) selected EPA's Leaking Underground Storage Tank<BR>

<P>(LUST) program as a GPRA pilot program.  EPA plans to expand its<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that EPA should reform its contract<BR>

<P>management process.  However, our work has identified other, more<BR>

<P>serious problems than the need to implement performance standards and<BR>

<P>maximize competition in the contracting process.  Specifically, we<BR>

<P>have found that EPA and other agencies (1) rely extensively on<BR>

<P>contractors to carry out agency missions, (2) administer contracts<BR>

<P>ineffectively, (3) insufficiently oversee contract auditing, and (4)<BR>

<P>lack high-level management attention to and accountability for<BR>

<P>contract management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  EPA has a number of initiatives under<BR>

<P>way to reform its contract management process.  To implement<BR>

<P>performance standards for contract management, EPA has incorporated<BR>

<P>standards in employees' position descriptions and in job vacancy<BR>

<P>announcements (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and an EPA standing<BR>

<P>committee developed 40 recommendations to reform EPA's contract<BR>

<P>management process.  EPA has implemented 26 of the 40 recommendations<BR>

<P>and says that its effort will fully address the NPR's call for reform<BR>

<P>in contract management (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To maximize competition in the contracting process, EPA has initiated<BR>

<P>a pilot project to award a major contract for federal information<BR>

<P>processing support services electronically via the Internet, a<BR>

<P>worldwide computer network.  According to an agency document, this<BR>

<P>approach will make procurement information accessible to a wide<BR>

<P>audience of potential bidders, reduce procurement lead-times,<BR>

<P>increase competition, and achieve substantial savings.  Also to<BR>

<P>maximize competition, EPA is planning to break up some large<BR>

<P>multifunction contracts with broad statements of work into smaller,<BR>

<P>more manageable contracts.  Finally, EPA is scheduled to participate<BR>

<P>in an OMB pilot project to ensure that contracts deliver the results<BR>

<P>intended (action item 3).  To improve the balance between extramural<BR>

<P>and intramural resources, EPA is converting 900 contractor positions<BR>

<P>to full-time equivalent positions.  This conversion is considered a<BR>

<P>major component of the agency's contract reform program (action item<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 7:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In our view, there is merit in incorporating<BR>

<P>that African Americans made up the majority of the population in<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 7:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support the need to promote quality science and have<BR>

<P>highlighted the problems associated with poor or questionable science<BR>

<P>and quality assurance procedures in several of our reports.  Most<BR>

<P>recently, we concluded in our report entitled Peer Review:  EPA Needs<BR>

<P>Implementation Procedures and Additional Controls that EPA's January<BR>

<P>1993 peer review policy statement does not define technically based<BR>

<P>products and does not specify the implementation procedures or steps<BR>

<P>needed to perform peer review. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 7:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  EPA has established a &quot;career-paths&quot; task<BR>

<P>force to review the agency's staff development programs for<BR>

<P>scientific and technical personnel and to institute guidelines for<BR>

<P>these employees' professional development (action item 1).  To expand<BR>

<P>the agency's use of peer review, the EPA Administrator issued a<BR>

<P>policy statement reaffirming the role of peer review and charging<BR>

<P>EPA's Science Policy Council with instituting an expanded peer review<BR>

<P>program in all EPA offices (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An assessment of EPA's scientific and technical laboratories and<BR>

<P>facilities was completed in May 1994.  This assessment, conducted by<BR>

<P>the MITRE Corporation, identified a number of options for<BR>

<P>consolidating EPA's laboratories along physical, organizational, or<BR>

<P>functional lines.  On the basis of the assessment's findings and<BR>

<P>observations, the EPA Administrator reported to Congress that the<BR>

<P>agency was implementing an integrated set of actions to restructure<BR>

<P>its research laboratories and facilities (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Science Policy Council is in the initial phase of addressing<BR>

<P>scientific communications.  The Council's primary focus will be on<BR>

<P>============================================================ Section 9<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FEMA has not fully implemented any of the four NPR recommendations<BR>

<P>but has made substantial progress toward these goals.  To shift its<BR>

<P>emphasis to preparing for and responding to the consequences of all<BR>

<P>disasters, the agency is reorganizing its resources into an<BR>

<P>all-hazards functional structure (FEMA01).  It is developing a more<BR>

<P>anticipatory and customer-driven response to catastrophic disasters<BR>

<P>by improving its ability to deploy resources to disaster areas<BR>

<P>(FEMA02).  To help reduce the total cost of disasters and minimize<BR>

<P>the federal costs of disaster assistance, FEMA is developing a<BR>

<P>National Mitigation Strategy and is working with Congress on<BR>

<P>legislative initiatives designed to reduce these costs.  FEMA has<BR>

<P>also agreed to give the states greater flexibility and discretion in<BR>

<P>using the funds that FEMA makes available to them.  This flexibility<BR>

<P>should allow states to focus funding to meet their highest-risk<BR>

<P>requirements (FEMA03).  Finally, the current FEMA Director has taken<BR>

<P>steps to develop a skilled management team by reorganizing the agency<BR>

<P>and appointing a higher percentage of executive leaders with direct<BR>

<P>emergency management experience (FEMA04). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Through our work on federal disaster assistance, we have identified<BR>

<P>several issues that the NPR recommendations did not address.  For<BR>

<P>example, federally backed flood insurance policies are still being<BR>

<P>underwritten for some properties located on coastal barriers even<BR>

<P>though this practice is contrary to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act<BR>

<P>of 1982, which was enacted to discourage development on selected<BR>

<P>coastal barriers.  In addition, the federal crop insurance and<BR>

<P>disaster assistance programs have not been integrated.  We have<BR>

<P>recommended that, for substantial savings, these programs be<BR>

<P>considered together as risk-reduction alternatives subject to the<BR>

<P>same decision-making process as the budget.  Finally, FEMA has not<BR>

<P>clarified its regulations to specify how much and under what<BR>

<P>conditions it will pay to restore historic structures.  In 1992, we<BR>

<P>noted that differences in interpretations of FEMA's regulations on<BR>

<P>restoring historic structures had contributed to disputes during the<BR>

<P>recovery from the Loma Prieta earthquake, which occurred in October<BR>

<P>1989. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      FEMA01:  SHIFT EMPHASIS TO<BR>

<P>      PREPARING FOR AND RESPONDING<BR>

<P>      TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL<BR>

<P>      DISASTERS<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FEMA's early focus was on preparedness for nuclear war.  The current<BR>

<P>world situation and recent natural disasters highlight the need for<BR>

<P>FEMA to continue to shift its resources to respond to all hazards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  FEMA should continue to shift emphasis to preparation for and<BR>

<P>response to the consequences of all disasters. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Director of FEMA should review the agency's classified<BR>

<P>responsibilities and ensure that they do not detract from its<BR>

<P>unclassified mission of general disaster preparedness.  As part of<BR>

<P>that review, the Director should ensure the maintenance of a single<BR>

<P>point of contact to manage the scaled-down enduring constitutional<BR>

<P>government programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  FEMA should sharply reduce the number of security clearances. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support a shift in FEMA's program emphasis to a more<BR>

<P>all-hazards approach.  For example, many of the assets and<BR>

<P>capabilities previously held for military contingencies in FEMA's<BR>

<P>former National Preparedness Directorate have been found to be very<BR>

<P>useful in other hazards, such as natural disasters.  Similarly,<BR>

<P>affording state and local governments greater flexibility in the use<BR>

<P>of resources provided under authority of the Civil Defense Act can<BR>

<P>also enhance states' and localities' overall ability to respond to<BR>

<P>different types of emergencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  FEMA has implemented the first two of the<BR>

<P>three action items under this recommendation.  Specifically, the<BR>

<P>agency has been reorganized so that all directorates now have an<BR>

<P>all-hazards mission that includes mitigation, preparedness, and<BR>

<P>response and recovery (action item 1).  In addition, National<BR>

<P>Security assets are now available for use in all types of disasters. <BR>

<P>FEMA also completed a study of its national security emergency<BR>

<P>mobilization programs and reassigned staff on the basis of the<BR>

<P>study's findings.  In addition, FEMA established a National Security<BR>

<P>Steering Group to coordinate intra-agency and interagency national<BR>

<P>security functions, and it named a National Security Coordinator to<BR>

<P>serve as a single point of contact to manage the integration of the<BR>

<P>agency's national security programs (action item 2).  Finally, FEMA<BR>

<P>is reviewing all of its positions to determine the need for security<BR>

<P>clearances but has not yet reduced the number of such clearances. <BR>

<P>      CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These recommendations should make FEMA respond faster and more<BR>

<P>effectively to catastrophic disasters. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Where cost-effective, FEMA should establish rapid-response teams<BR>

<P>to monitor catastrophes, assess damage, and advise governors and the<BR>

<P>President. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Where cost-effective, FEMA should mobilize and preposition people<BR>

<P>and supplies in anticipation of catastrophes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  FEMA should reexamine its field structure in relation to the<BR>

<P>Agency's mission. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  FEMA should establish regional centers of excellence. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support a quicker and more proactive federal response to<BR>

<P>meet the health and safety needs of victims when disasters are of<BR>

<P>such magnitude that the local infrastructure clearly cannot meet all<BR>

<P>the needs.  While FEMA and the federal government have a role in the<BR>

<P>initial response to many presidentially declared disasters, the<BR>

<P>victims' immediate needs can generally be met with state, local, and<BR>

<P>volunteer resources.  Unlike the bulk of disasters, catastrophic<BR>

<P>disasters overwhelm the ability of state, local, and voluntary<BR>

<P>agencies to adequately provide victims with essential services within<BR>

<P>12 to 24 hours.  FEMA needs a disaster unit whose primary mission is<BR>

<P>planning for and responding to catastrophic disasters.  Among other<BR>

<P>things, the units should estimate the extent of damage and relief<BR>

<P>needs immediately following a disaster, then advise state and local<BR>

<P>officials of federal resources available to address these needs as<BR>

<P>well as the extent to which DOD resources will be needed to<BR>

<P>supplement Red Cross resources in meeting needs for mass care.  FEMA<BR>

<P>should also enhance the capacity of state and local governments to<BR>

<P>respond to such disasters by upgrading training and exercises in<BR>

<P>anticipation of catastrophic disaster and monitoring the states' and<BR>

<P>localities' preparedness. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  FEMA has taken action regarding all<BR>

<P>the action items, but none has been implemented.  For example, FEMA<BR>

<P>is developing a situation assessment capability to facilitate its<BR>

<P>response to disasters.  This capability includes aerial<BR>

<P>reconnaissance assets, predictive modeling assets, and field<BR>

<P>assessment teams (action item 1).  FEMA has also identified initial<BR>

<P>response resources, consisting of three national Emergency Response<BR>

<P>Teams, that the agency can deploy before a disaster occurs if advance<BR>

<P>warning is available.  FEMA has developed the first element of, and<BR>

<P>is currently designing the remainder of, a deployable, on-site<BR>

<P>Disaster Field Office training team, which the agency plans to use to<BR>

<P>train FEMA employees as needed when disasters strike (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As requested by Congress, FEMA is studying its regional structure to<BR>

<P>ensure that its operations are risk-based and efficient.  A report of<BR>

<P>this study is scheduled to be issued in the future (action item 3). <BR>

<P>Finally, FEMA believes regional centers of excellence may be<BR>

<P>established as an outcome of this study (action item 4). <BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Midwest floods, Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew, and the Loma Prieta<BR>

<P>These recommendations will move toward reducing those costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  FEMA should develop objective criteria for declaring emergencies<BR>

<P>and major disasters. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  FEMA should enforce existing flood insurance requirements<BR>

<P>applicable to people living in high-risk areas. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The administration and Congress should explore incentives to<BR>

<P>expand insurance coverage against natural hazards and increase<BR>

<P>mitigation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Grants for mitigation and preparedness should fund preparedness<BR>

<P>for the greatest risks. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  FEMA should propose comprehensive federal policies that reduce<BR>

<P>the total cost of disasters and minimize federal costs of disaster<BR>

<P>assistance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Creating results-oriented incentives to<BR>

<P>reduce the costs of disasters should be explored.  The cost of<BR>

<P>federal disaster response and recovery assistance has increased<BR>

<P>dramatically in recent years.  However, there are many possible<BR>

<P>causes for this increase, as well as many possible solutions.  We<BR>

<P>have not reviewed these issues in sufficient depth to take a formal<BR>

<P>position. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  FEMA has taken some action to<BR>

<P>implement this recommendation.  An agency task force has considered<BR>

<P>statutory revisions designed to improve and establish objective<BR>

<P>criteria for declaring disasters and adjusting cost-shares (action<BR>

<P>item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FEMA is designing a program to increase the number of flood insurance<BR>

<P>policies by 20 percent by October 1, 1996.  The agency supports the<BR>

<P>lender compliance provisions of national flood insurance reform<BR>

<P>legislation, such as S.  1275, entitled the Community Development,<BR>

<P>Banking, and Financial Institutions Act of 1993 (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FEMA supports legislative initiatives that are designed to reduce the<BR>

<P>costs of disasters (S.  1350 and H.R.  2873, both entitled the<BR>

<P>Natural Disaster Protection Act of 1993).  This proposed legislation<BR>

<P>is also designed to expand insurance coverage and increase mitigation<BR>

<P>(action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Beginning in fiscal year 1995, FEMA plans to give the states greater<BR>

<P>flexibility and discretion in using the funds available to them<BR>

<P>through the Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement.  According to FEMA,<BR>

<P>this increased flexibility will allow the states to focus funding to<BR>

<P>meet their highest-risk requirements (action item 4). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FEMA has also begun to develop a National Mitigation Strategy to help<BR>

<P>reduce the total cost of disasters and minimize the federal costs of<BR>

<P>disaster assistance (action item 5). <BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 9:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Leadership has been the weak link in FEMA's mission as the federal<BR>

<P>government's emergency management coordinator.  These recommendations<BR>

<P>strive to improve FEMA's leadership to successfully implement its new<BR>

<P>all-hazards mission. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Through organizational restructuring and reordering of<BR>

<P>priorities, all agency directorates should be responsible to the<BR>

<P>Director for fulfilling the primary agency mission of disaster<BR>

<P>response. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Director of FEMA should select and develop capable and<BR>

<P>cohesive executive leaders for the agency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Director of FEMA should institute a staff career development<BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  FEMA has a large number of political appointees<BR>

<P>relative to its size.  FEMA's mission of disaster relief demands a<BR>

<P>uniquely strong management team with considerable professional<BR>

<P>experience to deal effectively with other federal agencies, state and<BR>

<P>local emergency managers, and volunteer organizations.  Given the<BR>

<P>need for a high level of professionalism and experience, a reduction<BR>

<P>in the number of political appointees in key positions could be an<BR>

<P>important element in developing an effective management team. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 9:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  All FEMA directorates now report to the FEMA<BR>

<P>Director, following an overall agency reorganization (action item 1). <BR>

<P>The current Director has made an effort to appoint executive leaders<BR>

<P>with emergency management skills.  For example, the Director<BR>

<P>appointed experienced FEMA employees to head two of the directorates<BR>

<P>and fill the Chief of Staff position.  As a result, the percentage of<BR>

<P>political appointees/noncareer senior executive service employees<BR>

<P>with direct emergency management experience is higher now than in<BR>

<P>previous years (action item 2).  The Director has also identified a<BR>

<P>need to develop a management training program for all managers and<BR>

<P>has requested a 200-percent increase in fiscal year 1995 funds for<BR>

<P>employee development (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 37:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Actions have been taken or are under way on all six NPR action items<BR>

<P>under the one GSA recommendation.  However, these actions have not<BR>

<P>been completed and the recommendation has not been implemented. <BR>

<P>Also, several of NPR's recommendations in the Reinventing Support<BR>

<P>Services section, which have been either partially implemented or<BR>

<P>acted upon but not implemented, relate directly to this GSA section;<BR>

<P>especially SUP03, SUP04, SUP08, SUP09, and SUP10.  In addition, NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendations in the Reinventing Federal Procurement, Transforming<BR>

<P>Organizational Structures, Mission-Driven Results- Oriented<BR>

<P>Budgeting, and Improving Financial Management sections also relate to<BR>

<P>this GSA section. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA has committed itself to and developed plans for ending its<BR>

<P>longstanding support services monopolies, separating its policymaking<BR>

<P>and oversight responsibilities from service delivery, revising its<BR>

<P>organizational structure and improving how it interfaces with<BR>

<P>customer agencies, and using private sector practices as benchmarks<BR>

<P>to reengineer the way it does business.  Also, GSA's &quot;Time Out and<BR>

<P>Review&quot; of nearly 200 approved major building construction,<BR>

<P>modernization, or leasing projects identified potential cost savings<BR>

<P>opportunities of at least $1.2 billion. <BR>

<P>
<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 37:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      GSA01:  SEPARATE<BR>

<P>      POLICYMAKING FROM SERVICE<BR>

<P>      DELIVERY AND MAKE THE<BR>

<P>      GENERAL SERVICES<BR>

<P>      ADMINISTRATION (GSA) A FULLY<BR>

<P>      COMPETITIVE, REVENUE-BASED<BR>

<P>      ORGANIZATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 37:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fund GSA service delivery from customer revenues, transfer activities<BR>

<P>not related to GSA's central mission to other agencies, and allow<BR>

<P>agencies to choose whether to purchase GSA services. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 37:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Separate policymaking and oversight from service delivery and<BR>

<P>fund policymaking from direct appropriations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Allow agencies to choose whether to purchase GSA services, and<BR>

<P>fund GSA service delivery from customer revenues. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Transfer activities not related to GSA's central mission to other<BR>

<P>agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Suspend acquisition of net new office space and courthouses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Reduce procurement spending. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  Improve GSA service delivery. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 37:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  GAO supports these recommended reforms.  To compete with<BR>

<P>private industry for federal agencies' business, however, GSA must be<BR>

<P>able to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs and market<BR>

<P>conditions.  In this regard, Congress and the administration need to<BR>

<P>reexamine and resolve constraints and barriers, such as funding<BR>

<P>limitations and the real estate prospectus authorization processes,<BR>

<P>that would adversely affect GSA's ability to compete. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 37:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Actions have been taken and<BR>

<P>implementation is under way on all six NPR action items under this<BR>

<P>recommendation, but these actions have not been completed and the<BR>

<P>recommendation has not been implemented.  GSA has developed plans to<BR>

<P>separate governmentwide policymaking and oversight of public<BR>

<P>buildings and federal supply activities from service delivery.  GSA<BR>

<P>also plans to fund policy activities from direct appropriations; this<BR>

<P>proposal was included in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General<BR>

<P>Government Appropriations Act of 1995 (P.L.  103-329).  In addition,<BR>

<P>GSA (1) has proposed eliminating mandatory service requirements in<BR>

<P>the public buildings, information technology, and federal supply<BR>

<P>areas so that agencies can choose where to acquire these services;<BR>

<P>(2) is trying to transfer the Indian Trust Fund, a function not<BR>

<P>related to its central mission, to the Interior or Justice<BR>

<P>Departments; (3) is streamlining its organizational structure and<BR>

<P>eliminating unneeded overhead positions; and (4) is studying ways to<BR>

<P>decrease procurement spending and improve its relations with customer<BR>

<P>agencies and service delivery.  For example, GSA has established 14<BR>

<P>reinvention laboratories aimed at reengineering organizational<BR>

<P>processes, eliminating unnecessary rules and regulations, and<BR>

<P>empowering employees to improve the services it provides to customer<BR>

<P>agencies.  According to GSA officials, the administration drafted<BR>

<P>legislation to eliminate GSA's transportation audit function, another<BR>

<P>activity not related to its central mission, in August 1994, but the<BR>

<P>legislation was never introduced in Congress. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As early as July 1993, GSA committed itself to a &quot;Time Out and<BR>

<P>Review&quot; study of approved major building construction, modernization,<BR>

<P>and leasing projects to determine if the federal housing option<BR>

<P>selected was the most appropriate, cost-effective alternative<BR>

<P>available.  GSA took about 6 months to review nearly 200 projects. <BR>

<P>GSA reported in March 1994 that it had identified potential savings<BR>

<P>opportunities of about $1.2 billion, including $230 million in new<BR>

<P>federal courthouse projects.  GSA expects to realize some of these<BR>

<P>identified savings by eliminating or cutting back on some projects,<BR>

<P>using value engineering to reduce costs, and reducing the size of<BR>

<P>some leases.  GSA is still working to reengineer existing design,<BR>

<P>construction, and leasing projects and to renegotiate existing<BR>

<P>leases.  Also, GSA has developed a baseline of office space inventory<BR>

<P>levels and plans to soon issue new space guidelines and policies to<BR>

<P>federal agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 10:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Action has been taken on 12 of the 14 recommendations related to the<BR>

<P>Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but none of these<BR>

<P>recommendations has been fully or partially implemented.  Legislation<BR>

<P>was introduced and is pending for eight of these.  No action was<BR>

<P>taken on the remaining two recommendations to (1) develop a national,<BR>

<P>uniform inspection system to ensure a safe food supply and (2)<BR>

<P>restructure the management of railroad industry benefit programs.  An<BR>

<P>NPR spokesperson said that the administration has not placed a high<BR>

<P>priority on these two recommendations at this point in time as agency<BR>

<P>actions or actions pending on other recommendations may indirectly<BR>

<P>address them. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      HHS01:  PROMOTE EFFECTIVE,<BR>

<P>      INTEGRATED SERVICE DELIVERY<BR>

<P>      FOR CUSTOMERS BY INCREASING<BR>

<P>      COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These recommendations outline a number of steps needed to better<BR>

<P>integrate and deliver social services to communities and families. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have conducted several evaluations which have pointed out<BR>

<P>the need to promote effective, integrated service delivery.  For<BR>

<P>example, our work at the Administration on Aging (AOA) identified<BR>

<P>that more could be done to improve the long-standing problem of<BR>

<P>fragmented services for the elderly.  Further, during our work on<BR>

<P>transportation for the elderly at AOA and the Department of<BR>

<P>Transportation (DOT), we found a persistent need to improve service<BR>

<P>coordination and collaboration between HHS and DOT.  In both of these<BR>

<P>reviews, we recommended actions that would promote better service<BR>

<P>integration, reduce service fragmentation, and increase the<BR>

<P>dissemination of information.  HHS has acted on all of these<BR>

<P>recommendations, but needs to remain vigilant in ensuring that their<BR>

<P>efforts in these areas continue. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, in examining school-linked human services, we found that<BR>

<P>these services appear to be a promising short-term strategy for<BR>

<P>aiding children with problems that distract them from their studies<BR>

<P>and put them at risk of dropping out of school.  Such services also<BR>

<P>appear to have the potential to support at-risk children after they<BR>

<P>complete preschool programs such as Head Start.  We found a dearth of<BR>

<P>short-term impact evaluations of these services, however, as well as<BR>

<P>a lack of evaluation of long-term impact.  This makes it very<BR>

<P>difficult to compare such services to alternatives.  We recommended<BR>

<P>that the Secretaries of HHS and Education develop an approach for<BR>

<P>evaluating short and long-term impacts of several school-linked<BR>

<P>programs to provide states and localities with better information<BR>

<P>about the impact of school-linked services. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  HHS has established a work group on<BR>

<P>Customer Service and Service Integration.  The agency announced<BR>

<P>customer service standards for direct customers, such as Medicare<BR>

<P>recipients and Indian Health Service recipients, in September 1994. <BR>

<P>Standards were also developed for HHS's indirect customers or<BR>

<P>grantees such as states, local governments, and private agencies. <BR>

<P>HHS has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy to promote service<BR>

<P>integration.  The work group has developed some draft plans and pilot<BR>

<P>projects for service integration.  This work is farther along in<BR>

<P>programs for children and families than in programs for the elderly<BR>

<P>and disabled.  Forecast completion is December 31, 1999. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, legislation was passed addressing this recommendation. <BR>

<P>Public Law 103-227, &quot;Goals 2000:  Educate America Act,&quot; requires<BR>

<P>several actions to improve the coordination of Department of<BR>

<P>Education and Department of Health and Human Services programs at the<BR>

<P>federal and local levels.  Title VII, the Safe Schools Act of 1994,<BR>

<P>requires that Education programs and activities under Title XII be<BR>

<P>coordinated with health, social services, juvenile justice, and other<BR>

<P>services.  Title IX, the Educational Research and Improvement Act of<BR>

<P>1994, requires promotion of coordination on research and development<BR>

<P>issues between the Department of Education and HHS' Administration<BR>

<P>for Children and Families, the National Institutes of Health, and<BR>

<P>other agencies.  As part of national education dissemination, Title<BR>

<P>IX also establishes programs to promote the development of an<BR>

<P>integrated system of service delivery to children from birth through<BR>

<P>age 18 and their families by facilitating linkages and cooperation<BR>

<P>among a variety of services, including health and social services,<BR>

<P>child care, Head Start, and other early childhood agencies that<BR>

<P>receive HHS funds. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Further legislation has been proposed.  H.R.  820, &quot;National<BR>

<P>Competitiveness Act of 1994,&quot; Title XI, the Local Empowerment and<BR>

<P>Flexibility Act of 1994, would specify that local governments and<BR>

<P>private, nonprofit agencies be enabled to integrate programs and<BR>

<P>program funds across existing federal assistance categories to better<BR>

<P>meet local social service needs.  &quot;Local flexibility plans&quot; would be<BR>

<P>approved by a federal &quot;Community Enterprise Board&quot; composed of the<BR>

<P>Vice President and various federal agency representatives, including<BR>

<P>HHS.  The local flexibility plans would allow for greater local<BR>

<P>flexibility to accomplish social service objectives rather than<BR>

<P>exclusively emphasizing the measurement of resources used and process<BR>

<P>to determine a program's effectiveness.  Title VI, the Information<BR>

<P>Technology Applications Act of 1994, would also require federal<BR>

<P>efforts to identify and develop high-speed computer networking to<BR>

<P>&quot;improve the provision of health care, including furnishing health<BR>

<P>care providers and their patients with better, more accurate, and<BR>

<P>more timely informati<BR>

<P>efforts to deploy these technologies in cooperation with the private<BR>

<P>sector as part of an advanced national information infrastructure.&quot;<BR>

<P>      REGULATIONS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>HHS should improve the timeliness and quality of regulations issued<BR>

<P>and should involve stakeholders in the development of regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  On the basis of our work at the Food and Drug Administration<BR>

<P>(FDA), we agree that HHS needs to improve the timeliness of<BR>

<P>regulations.  We recommended the development of a single FDA tracking<BR>

<P>system to improve management oversight of the process.  FDA agreed<BR>

<P>and is currently implementing that recommendation.  Our work,<BR>

<P>however, did not analyze the quality of regulations or the degree of<BR>

<P>participation of affected interests. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We discussed problems in the regulatory process in our management<BR>

<P>review work at the Social Security Administration (SSA) in 1987 and<BR>

<P>in followup work in 1989.  SSA took a variety of actions to address<BR>

<P>problems caused by its procedures.  We have done no further work to<BR>

<P>evaluate the effectiveness of changes made by SSA.  In addition,<BR>

<P>other problems in the regulatory process over which SSA has limited<BR>

<P>control--complexity of issues and short effective dates in the<BR>

<P>law--remain a problem in regulatory development. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The HHS Continuous Improvement<BR>

<P>Workgroup is developing an implementation plan involving designating<BR>

<P>a regulatory czar, setting a regulatory agenda and a streamlined<BR>

<P>process, experimenting with negotiated rulemaking through a<BR>

<P>reinvention laboratory at the Health Care Financing Administration<BR>

<P>(HCFA), and obtaining input from states and other interested parties<BR>

<P>on ways to increase consultation.  The plan is expected to be<BR>

<P>finalized by December 31, 1994.  The Chief of Staff has been<BR>

<P>appointed Regulations Officer for the department.  HHS has requested<BR>

<P>an OMB analyst be assigned as a liaison for HHS regulatory review and<BR>

<P>is waiting for an OMB decision.  OMB has delegated some of its<BR>

<P>rulemaking authority to HHS. <BR>

<P>Agree.  In May 1994, we testified that an independent federal food<BR>

<P>recognized that many problems are associated with setting up such an<BR>

<P>of the numerous federal agencies (e.g., USDA, EPA, and HHS) currently<BR>

<P>involved in food inspections, HHS felt that the decision on how to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our evaluations have not shown that the grant<BR>

<P>Public Health Service Act had a significant effect on the supply,<BR>

<P>distribution, or minority representation of health professions.  If<BR>

<P>Congress chooses to use Title VII and VIII programs to improve<BR>

<P>supply, distribution, and minority representation of health<BR>

<P>professionals, it needs to better assure that the programs are<BR>

<P>properly structured and that funds are used for these purposes. <BR>

<P>Congress will need to ensure that there are specific program goals,<BR>

<P>common outcome measures and reporting requirements for each goal,<BR>

<P>restrictions limiting the use of funds to activities whose results<BR>

<P>in its fiscal year 1995 budget requests to consolidate multiple<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  On the basis of our work in the area of railroad<BR>

<P>retirement benefits, we believe this recommendation has some merit. <BR>

<P>We believe that the social security equivalent portion of railroad<BR>

<P>retirement benefits should be transferred.  Such a transfer would<BR>

<P>result in uniformity in the benefits being provided (presently<BR>

<P>benefits are not paid to dependent children under the rail program). <BR>

<P>Further, the private rail portion of railroad retirement benefits is<BR>

<P>not funded as are other private industry pensions and is not under<BR>

<P>the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1994, and rail workers<BR>

<P>are at risk because of a large unfunded actuarial liability that has<BR>

<P>resulted in federal &quot;bailouts&quot; during past periods of financial<BR>

<P>crisis.  Finally, the rail unemployment insurance program has<BR>

<P>experienced financial problems in the past.  This program is more<BR>

<P>liberal and subject to abuse than state programs, and it results in a<BR>

<P>duplication of an existing unemployment apparatus. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  In our view, the administration of SSA's disability programs<BR>

<P>has reached a crisis stage.  Service is poor and billions of dollars<BR>

<P>in payments to ineligible individuals will be wasted if mandated<BR>

<P>continuing disability reviews are not resumed.  SSA's short-term<BR>

<P>efforts to reduce the number of pending claims have been largely<BR>

<P>unsuccessful.  Further, long-range SSA plans are uncertain about when<BR>

<P>and to what extent service will improve.  However, SSA has begun a<BR>

<P>major reengineering effort to improve disability claims processing<BR>

<P>and staff productivity. <BR>

<P>Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400) and the Government<BR>

<P>Downsizing, Performance, and Accountability Act of 1994 (S. <BR>

<P>1843)--were considered that would have improved the continuing<BR>

<P>disability review process by establishing minimum funding levels for<BR>

<P>such reviews.  While H.R.  3400 passed the House in November 1993, no<BR>

<P>action has been taken on S.  1843. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On March 31, 1994, SSA disseminated a reengineering proposal for<BR>

<P>improving its disability programs.  On June 30, a revised proposal<BR>

<P>was sent to the Commissioner of SSA for a decision and the proposal<BR>

<P>was approved in September 1994.  In addition, SSA is developing a<BR>

<P>legislative proposal to establish a trust fund self-financing account<BR>

<P>to pay for continuing disability reviews.  SSA is also continuing to<BR>

<P>develop its modernized disability claims processing system. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly advocate these types of actions.  Over the past<BR>

<P>several years, we have issued reports and testimonies discussing<BR>

<P>Medicare's declining investment in program safeguard efforts and<BR>

<P>concluded that funding declines contributed to hundreds of millions<BR>

<P>of dollars in program losses.  We recommended that Congress consider<BR>

<P>modifying budget procedures so that Medicare safeguard funding could<BR>

<P>be increased without having to cut spending elsewhere.  Under the<BR>

<P>Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, Congress provided for increasing<BR>

<P>appropriations for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) compliance<BR>

<P>activities without necessitating spending cuts elsewhere.  We believe<BR>

<P>using IRS' method of funding compliance activities as a model for<BR>

<P>Medicare would better enable Congress to appropriate the funding<BR>

<P>needed for Medicare's safeguard activities.  Congress enacted our<BR>

<P>recommendation in 1992, but the bill was vetoed by the President for<BR>

<P>other reasons. <BR>

<P>pertaining to SSA's disability claims processing (HHS06) provides<BR>

<P>further discussion on SSA payment safeguards.  According to HHS<BR>

<P>officials, OMB believes fiscal year 1995 funding for Medicare program<BR>

<P>as well as a recipient of death reports from the states, the Health<BR>

<P>Care Financing Administration, the State Department, and funeral<BR>

<P>tools have been denied to SSA in the past because Congress was<BR>

<P>concerned about aggressively collecting overpayments from the aged<BR>

<P>and disabled.  We believe that collection agencies can routinely<BR>

<P>provide addresses of debtors to SSA and that SSA could apply interest<BR>

<P>and penalties to debtors in those situations where repayment will not<BR>

<P>be a financial hardship on the debtors.  This would increase the<BR>

<P>reserves to the trust funds, create a more equitable situation in<BR>

<P>relation to those beneficiaries who do repay their debts, and provide<BR>

<P>an incentive for some debtors to repay their debts who currently do<BR>

<P>not. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have found numerous shortcomings in FDA approval<BR>

<P>and inspection procedures with regard to pharmaceuticals,<BR>

<P>over-the-counter drugs, and medical devices.  To some extent, these<BR>

<P>are linked to resource problems.  However, we have also found that<BR>

<P>FDA does not always have a sound basis for requesting and assigning<BR>

<P>new resources.  As long as user fees supplement existing<BR>

<P>appropriations in the context of a strategic plan, they could provide<BR>

<P>needed help. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have recommended that SSA produce a service delivery plan<BR>

<P>that spells out SSA's preferred methods of future service delivery,<BR>

<P>including the facilities it will need, where they should be located,<BR>

<P>and the human resources and automation that will be required to staff<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  SSA is following the strategic<BR>

<P>management approach recommended by GAO to ensure that its planning<BR>

<P>activities are tied to its customer needs and mission goals.  The<BR>

<P>customer service plan, which has been developed to comply with<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12862 (September 11, 1993), is to be used to update<BR>

<P>the agency strategic plan.  As part of updating the agency strategic<BR>

<P>plan, SSA plans to define its future business and service delivery<BR>

<P>requirements.  The supporting plans for facilities, information<BR>

<P>systems, and human resources are expected to be developed or modified<BR>

<P>based on the direction of the agency strategic plan. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SSA has under consideration several options for balancing its field<BR>

<P>office workloads by issuing monthly benefit checks on multiple days<BR>

<P>throughout the month rather than on just one day of the month. <BR>

<P>Customer and stakeholder input was obtained on the options and will<BR>

<P>be considered in determining how to proceed.  The systems changes<BR>

<P>required to implement the option chosen will require several years of<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.12.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that the Department needs to strengthen its<BR>

<P>departmentwide management.  In our management review of HHS, we made<BR>

<P>a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening departmental<BR>

<P>management, including recommending the establishment of<BR>

<P>departmentwide strategic and workforce planning processes that<BR>

<P>considered the centralization and decentralization of departmental<BR>

<P>functions.  Such processes logically should examine the balance<BR>

<P>
<P>Agree.  A series of our reports related to SSA noted that staffing<BR>

<P>imbalances existed at its field offices, and SSA needed to conduct a<BR>

<P>needs assessment and create work standards for its employees.  Also,<BR>

<P>one ongoing assignment reviewing a key social service program has<BR>

<P>found that there is no process for obtaining firm, upfront commitment<BR>

<P>of regional resources and the headquarters office has no direct<BR>

<P>control of regional resources.  Finally, we recommended in our<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.14.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have reported that HCFA's current contracting<BR>

<P>authority, if properly used, allows for effective program management<BR>

<P>and provides sufficient opportunities to achieve administrative<BR>

<P>efficiencies.  For a variety of reasons over the past decade, HCFA<BR>

<P>has made many changes to its contractor network.  However, its<BR>

<P>experience with these changes has been mixed.  The changes have<BR>

<P>frequently led to disruptions in service to beneficiaries and<BR>

<P>providers, as well as increases in payment error rates that exceeded<BR>

<P>administrative savings.  We have consistently pointed out the<BR>

<P>importance of effective claims payment and safeguard activities<BR>

<P>because benefit payments represent 98 percent of Medicare<BR>

<P>expenditures.  On the other hand, payments to contractors represent<BR>

<P>only a little more than 1 percent of Medicare costs.  Thus, it is<BR>

<P>important to consider the effects a change in contracting methods<BR>

<P>would have on benefit costs, not just on administrative costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 10:2.14.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  HCFA has developed a long-standing<BR>

<P>practice of contracting with the same entities--typically insurance<BR>

<P>companies.  While HCFA officials are working to improve their<BR>

<P>contracting practices, they perceive many obstacles to changing this<BR>

<P>practice.  It may be necessary for Congress to authorize HCFA to<BR>

<P>evaluate new approaches for a more competitive environment for<BR>

<P>Medicare contractors who process Medicare claims.  H.R.  3400<BR>

<P>required that HHS study the issue of flexibility in contracting for<BR>

<P>Medicare claims processing; H.R.  3400 passed the House in November<BR>

<P>1993.  The provision was deleted from the bill in the Senate (S. <BR>

<P>2170).  Subsequently, S.  2170 was enacted as Public Law 103-356 on<BR>

<P>October 13, 1994, and did not contain the provision in question. <BR>

<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 12:1<BR>

<P>
<P>The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) is responsible for<BR>

<P>implementing the NPR recommendations directed to the intelligence<BR>

<P>community and providing substantive information on the implementation<BR>

<P>status of those recommendations.  In a letter dated May 25, 1994, we<BR>

<P>formally notified the DCI that House and Senate Committees had<BR>

<P>requested information on the implementation of the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations.  We asked to meet with DCI staff to (1) be briefed<BR>

<P>on the current status of implementation of the recommendations and<BR>

<P>(2) examine the underlying documentation supporting the DCI's<BR>

<P>assessment of implementation progress.  Since early June, we have<BR>

<P>contacted DCI congressional liaison staff each week in an attempt to<BR>

<P>determine the status of our request.  When it became apparent that<BR>

<P>DCI staff were not being responsive to our request, we sought the<BR>

<P>assistance of NPR staff who were responsible for tracking the<BR>

<P>intelligence community recommendations.  NPR staff contacted the DCI<BR>

<P>staff on our behalf. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>However, despite our efforts and the efforts of NPR staff, the DCI<BR>

<P>has not responded, either formally or informally, to our request for<BR>

<P>information about the intelligence community recommendations. <BR>

<P>Therefore, we are unable to comment on the extent to which most of<BR>

<P>the recommendations have been implemented.  One recommendation--to<BR>

<P>merge the President's Intelligence Oversight Board and the<BR>

<P>President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board--was implemented by<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12863. <BR>

<P>      INTEGRATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The end of the Cold War and the constrained fiscal environment in the<BR>

<P>United States create an imperative for the 13 components of the<BR>

<P>Intelligence Community to act more effectively and more efficiently<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Deputy<BR>

<P>Secretary of Defense should hold a visioning conference to determine<BR>

<P>the Intelligence Community's (IC) mission in the post-Cold War world. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense should strengthen the<BR>

<P>IC Executive Committee by holding periodic principals-only meetings<BR>

<P>to address fundamental policy issues and strategic direction. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The DCI should review the contribution of Intelligence Centers to<BR>

<P>the goal of better Community integration and execution processes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The DCI should direct the development of a public affairs<BR>

<P>strategy that includes educating the public on the intelligence<BR>

<P>profession. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>
----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While we are not in a position to comment<BR>

<P>on this recommendation, we have begun a review of DOD's<BR>

<P>reorganization of military intelligence which will assess DOD's<BR>

<P>progress in having the several defense intelligence agencies work<BR>

<P>more closely together. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  As noted in the overall summary, the<BR>

<P>Director of Central Intelligence has not responded to our requests<BR>

<P>for information regarding the status of this recommendation. <BR>

<P>Therefore, we cannot independently determine whether any progress has<BR>

<P>been made toward its implementation. <BR>

<P>      RESPONSIVENESS TO CUSTOMERS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A 40-year emphasis on the Soviet Union allowed the Intelligence<BR>

<P>Community to develop a repertoire which was not dependent on a close<BR>

<P>relationship with its customers.  That is no longer the case today,<BR>

<P>and NPR makes recommendations for improvements in this area. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The DCI should appoint a customer advocate, or ombudsman. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The DCI should establish a process that continuously tracks the<BR>

<P>needs of the IC customer. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Community Management Staff should explore the feasibility of<BR>

<P>IC integrated service teams for larger customers with growing<BR>

<P>intelligence needs and provide the teams with electronic connectivity<BR>

<P>to IC producers and their databases. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Community Public Affairs Office should jointly develop<BR>

<P>programs to inform the general public about the value of the services<BR>

<P>provided by the IC. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The DCI should establish an integrated Community congressional<BR>

<P>liaison office.  The newly established office should develop a<BR>

<P>Community-wide congressional strategy by January 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  The new Intelligence Community Intelligence Systems Board should<BR>

<P>create a multimedia information handling architecture for the IC and<BR>

<P>its customers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  The National Intelligence Producers Board should establish, by<BR>

<P>the end of fiscal year 1994, a single, unified, tailored IC series of<BR>

<P>products for high-level customers of national intelligence. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  Production managers should encourage the use of the lowest<BR>

<P>practical level of classification for IC products. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  While we have not done work specific to the subject<BR>

<P>of this recommendation, the overall body of work we have done lends<BR>

<P>credence to the problem NPR described. <BR>

<P>      CHALLENGES<BR>
------------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The analytical issues the Intelligence Community faces are far more<BR>

<P>diverse and complex today, requiring new focus and new techniques to<BR>

<P>meet the intelligence needs of policymakers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Foreign Broadcast Information Service and the Open Source<BR>

<P>Coordination Office should reexamine the mission of the Foreign<BR>

<P>Broadcast Information Service. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The human intelligence program manager, in coordination with the<BR>

<P>National Intelligence Collection Board, should diversify human<BR>

<P>intelligence collection to cover new issues and areas where technical<BR>

<P>collection is becoming less productive. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The new Intelligence Community Systems Board should create a<BR>

<P>multimedia information handling architecture for the IC to facilitate<BR>

<P>real-time communications between analysts and collectors here and<BR>

<P>abroad in the interest of pinpointing collection gaps and weaknesses. <BR>

<P>
<P>4.  The IC Executive Committee should act on recommendations of<BR>

<P>ongoing reviews of classification policies and source identification. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The National Intelligence Council should take the lead to<BR>

<P>integrate political, economic, and military analysis. <BR>

<P>Cross-fertilization should be increased by bringing IC analysts<BR>

<P>together to work on a particular issue more frequently, as is done on<BR>

<P>National Intelligence Estimates. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  The National Intelligence Council should strengthen its role in<BR>

<P>conceptualizing analytic issues facing the Community, encouraging the<BR>

<P>development of alternative analyses, and improving the perception of<BR>

<P>it as a Community body rather than CIA. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have performed both classified and unclassified reviews of<BR>

<P>specific intelligence systems and portions of the intelligence force<BR>

<P>structure.  Our work has shown that DOD has made mixed progress in<BR>

<P>adjusting its information collection systems, and opportunities exist<BR>
for further adjustments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense<BR>

<P>should replace the Department of Defense's Intelligence Systems<BR>

<P>Council with an IC organization chaired by the Executive Director for<BR>

<P>Intelligence Community Affairs and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of<BR>

<P>Defense. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The new Community Intelligence Systems Board (ISB) should impose<BR>

<P>an immediate moratorium on all new Community information management<BR>

<P>initiatives or upgrades to current systems until a transition plan is<BR>

<P>developed and basic standards agreed upon.  Waivers may be granted by<BR>

<P>the DCI/Deputy Secretary of Defense based on valid justification. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The new Community ISB should establish a Dissemination Working<BR>

<P>Group to act as the focal point for the receipt, review, and<BR>

<P>validation of all Intelligence Community dissemination needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The new Community ISB should establish a way to identify, track,<BR>

<P>and evaluate management information within the National Foreign<BR>

<P>Intelligence Program and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities<BR>

<P>budget framework, so that appropriate Community and congressional<BR>

<P>oversight of these costs is easy to accomplish. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  On the basis of several GAO reports on specific<BR>

<P>intelligence programs that improve support to ground troops during<BR>

<P>combat operations, and DOD's lessons learned from Operation Desert<BR>

<P>Storm, we agree with NPR's goal of improving intelligence support to<BR>

<P>combat operations.  However, we have no knowledge of the particular<BR>

<P>&quot;reinvention lab effort&quot; proposed by NPR. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 12:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  As noted in the overall summary, the<BR>

<P>Director of Central Intelligence has not responded to our requests<BR>

<P>for information regarding the status of this recommendation. <BR>

<P>Therefore, we cannot independently determine whether any progress has<BR>

<P>been made toward its implementation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 15:1<BR>

<P>
<P>Some type of action has been initiated on 19 of the 21<BR>

<P>recommendations involving Department of Labor (DOL) programs and<BR>

<P>operations.  The recommendation to reduce Federal Employees'<BR>

<P>Compensation Act fraud has been fully implemented.  Also, legislation<BR>

<P>has been enacted or proposed to assist in implementing 8 of the 21<BR>

<P>recommendations.  However, much remains to be done before the other<BR>

<P>recommendations can be fully implemented.  This is primarily because<BR>

<P>DOL either is conducting pilot tests concerning the proposed changes<BR>

<P>or written policies and/or regulations will need to be developed and<BR>

<P>issued.  Furthermore, of the 21 recommendations, 12 will require<BR>

<P>legislative action before part or all of the recommendations can be<BR>

<P>implemented. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      DOL01:  ENHANCE REEMPLOYMENT<BR>

<P>      PROGRAMS FOR OCCUPATIONALLY<BR>

<P>      DISABLED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>These recommendations would help occupationally disabled federal<BR>

<P>employees return to productive careers by expanding DOL's<BR>

<P>return-to-work program.  This saves money by reducing long-term<BR>

<P>benefit costs to the government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Authorization for the Periodic Roll Management Project should be<BR>

<P>expanded for all 12 Federal Employee Corporation Act field offices in<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1994 and the 4-year Assisted Reemployment Demonstration<BR>

<P>Project should be extended. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that considerable improvement is possible in<BR>

<P>returning workers' compensation beneficiaries to work by increasing<BR>

<P>reemployment assistance to injured federal workers.  However, we have<BR>

<P>not evaluated the potential savings. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Periodic Roll Management Project to<BR>

<P>review disability cases was started in 1992 in four DOL field<BR>

<P>offices.  Funds to expand the project to the remaining eight Labor<BR>

<P>district offices that process workers' compensation claims were<BR>

<P>included in Labor's fiscal year 1995 budget request.  The 1995<BR>

<P>Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and<BR>

<P>Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L.  103-333) includes $4<BR>

<P>million to expand the Periodic Roll Management Project.  According to<BR>

<P>a Labor official, the $4 million would fund about half of the<BR>

<P>positions that Labor requested.  Labor has not yet decided how to<BR>

<P>allocate these positions among the district offices that still need<BR>

<P>to implement this project. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The assisted reemployment program is a demonstration program<BR>

<P>authorized in the Department of Labor's fiscal years 1992, 1993,<BR>
1994, and 1995 appropriations acts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOL should develop a single, integrated worker adjustment assistance<BR>

<P>program for those workers who are jobless or are expected to<BR>

<P>permanently lose their jobs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We believe that a new worker adjustment strategy is needed to<BR>

<P>help dislocated workers.  The current categorical approach is<BR>

<P>inequitable, slow, limited in the mix of services provided, and<BR>

<P>unaccountable for results.  We have suggested consideration of a<BR>

<P>simplified approach that helps dislocated workers regardless of the<BR>

<P>reason for the dislocation. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The Reemployment Act of 1994 was<BR>

<P>introduced in both houses of Congress.  The purpose of this act was<BR>

<P>to establish a comprehensive system of reemployment services,<BR>

<P>training, and income support for permanently laid off workers.  The<BR>

<P>act proposed replacing specified existing dislocated worker programs<BR>

<P>and offering a wide range of employment services to dislocated<BR>

<P>workers.  However, this legislation has not been enacted. <BR>

<P>      REGULATIONS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.3<BR>

<P>through negotiated rulemaking and a streamlined team approach to the<BR>

<P>rules development process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOL should expand the use of negotiated rulemaking. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  DOL should employ a team concept in the development of rules. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Our work on Occupational Safety and Health<BR>

<P>Administration (OSHA) indicates that an improvement in the rulemaking<BR>

<P>process is needed.  Negotiated rulemaking would be one option to<BR>

<P>consider.  However, we have not studied whether negotiated rulemaking<BR>

<P>would expedite OSHA's rulemaking process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>
----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOL has established a negotiated<BR>

<P>rulemaking committee to develop a steel erection standard.  The<BR>

<P>committee will use a team approach, including consensus, to develop<BR>

<P>the standard.  However, results from this preliminary action are not<BR>

<P>yet available.  DOL has not taken action beyond this effort to<BR>

<P>implement the recommendation. <BR>

<P>      ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE<BR>

<P>      RESOLUTION BY THE DEPARTMENT<BR>

<P>      OF LABOR<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The increased use of alternative dispute resolution could reduce<BR>

<P>litigation and produce significant long-term savings. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOL should expand the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our work at Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<BR>

<P>has shown that alternative dispute resolution could streamline the<BR>

<P>handling of cases, but we have not studied this issue in the context<BR>

<P>of DOL cases. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOL has conducted a pilot of<BR>

<P>alternate dispute resolution (ADR) in its Philadelphia Region, and is<BR>

<P>now encouraging ADR expansion throughout the agency.  However, we are<BR>

<P>not aware of any broad-scale expansion of ADR at DOL. <BR>

<P>Automating the filing and processing of annual financial reports<BR>

<P>required of pension and benefit plan administrators (Employee<BR>

<P>and delays. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  ERISA should be amended to change the employer's filing deadline<BR>

<P>from 210 days after the close of a reporting period to 90 days. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  DOL and the IRS should work to develop an automated processing<BR>

<P>system for Form 5500-series data and incentives to file data<BR>

<P>electronically. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  IRS should revise its regulations to facilitate electronic filing<BR>

<P>of Form 5500-series data. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We view electronic filing of the Form 5500 as a<BR>

<P>desirable method of reducing the cost of processing (shared by DOL<BR>

<P>and IRS) and reducing the nearly 3 years it takes to obtain usable<BR>

<P>data from an annual filing.  However, we are reviewing the Form 5500<BR>

<P>processing system and expect to issue a report early next year<BR>

<P>related to this issue. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  IRS has established the capability to<BR>

<P>electronically receive Form 5500 filings.  Other than developing this<BR>

<P>system, we are not aware of other actions taken to address this<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>The filing of Summary Plan Descriptions (SPD) by employee benefit<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  ERISA should be amended to eliminate the requirement for filing<BR>

<P>all SPDs with DOL. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  ERISA should be amended to authorize the Pension and Welfare<BR>

<P>Benefits Administration to notify plan administrators to send SPDs<BR>

<P>directly to requesters, and to obtain documents from plan<BR>

<P>administrators and forward them to requesters. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  DOL could reduce costs by reducing or eliminating<BR>

<P>storage of SPD hard copies while continuing to provide electronic<BR>

<P>access to SPDs.  The SPD is a very important and valuable document<BR>

<P>for beneficiaries of pension and welfare benefit plans which DOL will<BR>

<P>obtain copies of for any requester.  It is supposed to explain, in<BR>

<P>plain English, the provisions of the plan and is to be made available<BR>

<P>to each participant. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  H.R.  3400, the Government Reform and<BR>

<P>Savings Act of 1993, would have amended ERISA to eliminate the<BR>

<P>requirement for filing all Summary Plan Descriptions with DOL and<BR>

<P>authorize DOL to obtain copies of SPDs from plan administrators and<BR>

<P>provide them to requesters.  H.R.  3400 was passed by the House in<BR>

<P>November 1993, but this provision has not been acted upon by the<BR>

<P>Senate. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the need to streamline the<BR>

<P>employment training system, and one-stop centers could be a step in<BR>

<P>that direction.  However, we do not believe that one-stop centers<BR>

<P>should be the ultimate goal.  We believe the consolidation of similar<BR>

<P>programs serving the same general target populations would go further<BR>
to simplify the system. <BR>

<P>
<P>Disagree.  We do not believe the establishment of coordinating<BR>

<P>number of federal employment training programs should be consolidated<BR>

<P>to eliminate the costly duplication of services and the special<BR>

<P>arrangements to coordinate services that also add to the<BR>

<P>      RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING<BR>

<P>      WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 15:2.10<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation proposes to shift responsibility for workplace<BR>

<P>safety and health to employers by issuing regulations requiring<BR>

<P>self-inspections and implementing a sliding scale of incentives and<BR>

<P>penalties to ensure safety standards are met. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.10.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Secretary of Labor should issue regulations requiring<BR>

<P>employers to develop worksite safety and health programs and to<BR>

<P>conduct inspections for safety and health. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Establish a sliding scale of incentives and penalties for<BR>

<P>ensuring workplace safety and health. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have recommended that OSHA require<BR>

<P>employers in certain industries to institute worksite safety and<BR>

<P>health programs.  We have also explored the advantages and<BR>

<P>disadvantages of permitting private sector consultations to<BR>

<P>substitute for certain programmed OSHA inspections.  However, we have<BR>

<P>not examined explicit proposals mandating employer self-inspections<BR>
and modifying existing OSHA penalty schedules. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Proposed legislation introduced in<BR>

<P>both the House and the Senate, known as the Comprehensive<BR>

<P>Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) included<BR>

<P>provisions on worksite safety and health programs as well as<BR>

<P>conducting inspections for worksite safety and health.  DOL is<BR>

<P>drafting standards on worksite safety and health programs in<BR>

<P>anticipation of the enactment of COSHRA.  The draft standards are<BR>

<P>currently in-house documents and are not available to GAO. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOL is studying the establishment of a sliding scale of incentives<BR>

<P>and penalties for ensuring workplace safety and health.  OSHA<BR>

<P>officials have discussed this issue with representatives from the<BR>

<P>business community, labor unions, and several professional<BR>

<P>organizations and will include their ideas and opinions as OSHA<BR>

<P>proceeds to implement this recommendation. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Our work has shown that public centers<BR>

<P>incur higher costs because they generally provide higher skill<BR>

<P>training.  However, the public centers have higher placement rates<BR>

<P>and wages.  We have no basis to judge whether open competition for<BR>

<P>contracts to operate those centers at specified training levels would<BR>

<P>result in savings. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 15:2.21.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In May 1989, we found that Labor's unemployment<BR>

<P>insurance performance indicators were weak and did not constitute an<BR>

<P>effective quality monitoring system.  Therefore, we believe this<BR>

<P>recommendation is a step in the direction of improving unemployment<BR>

<P>insurance performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>This report responds to your requests that we monitor the<BR>

<P>implementation of the recommendations contained in the National<BR>

<P>Performance Review's (NPR) September 7, 1993, report.\1 NPR, under<BR>

<P>the direction of the Vice President, is a major management reform<BR>

<P>initiative by the administration and is intended to identify ways to<BR>

<P>make the government work better and cost less.  The NPR report<BR>

<P>contained 384 major recommendations covering 27 federal agencies and<BR>

<P>14 government systems, such as procurement, human resource<BR>

<P>management, and budgeting.  In this report, we categorize and<BR>

<P>describe our findings regarding the implementation of each of these<BR>

<P>recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In our initial comments on the NPR recommendations in December 1993,<BR>

<P>we generally agreed with most of the proposed changes.\2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>However, we had insufficient information to judge nearly one-third of<BR>

<P>the recommendations, primarily because the intent of the<BR>

<P>recommendations was not clearly explained in the NPR report or<BR>

<P>because we had not done work related to the recommendations.  At the<BR>

<P>time our report was issued, none of the NPR accompanying reports<BR>

<P>describing the recommendations in more detail had been released.  By<BR>

<P>September 7, 1994, NPR had released 29 such reports, each of which<BR>

<P>describes the recommendations in greater detail and lists specific<BR>

<P>actions that NPR believes should be taken to implement the<BR>

<P>recommendations.\3 We have also completed a number of reviews on<BR>

<P>NPR-related topics since December 1993.  Because of the additional<BR>

<P>information now available, this report also reassesses our comments<BR>

<P>regarding the NPR recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>   RESULTS IN BRIEF<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Some progress has been made in implementing many of the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations since September 1993, but few have been fully<BR>

<P>implemented.  A number of the recommendations will take years to<BR>

<P>fully implement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We generally agree with the thrust of most of the recommendations and<BR>

<P>support their continued implementation.  However, a number of actions<BR>

<P>are needed to achieve budgetary savings and improve government<BR>

<P>management.  We still believe that NPR's success depends on a<BR>

<P>legislative-executive partnership for action, attention to agencies'<BR>

<P>capacities, and sustained political and career leadership. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also believe that government &quot;reinvention&quot; requires the executive<BR>

<P>branch and Congress to shift the focus of government management and<BR>

<P>accountability from an emphasis on inputs, outputs, and processes to<BR>

<P>an emphasis on outcomes and results--consistent with the Government<BR>

<P>Performance and Results Act of 1993. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OBSERVATIONS ABOUT NPR<BR>
   IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The recommendations NPR made in its September 1993 report address an<BR>

<P>amalgam of issues and propose a range of solutions.  Some of the<BR>

<P>recommendations could be implemented relatively easily (e.g., &quot;create<BR>

<P>an interagency regulatory coordinating group&quot;); others will take<BR>

<P>years to put in place (e.g., &quot;fully integrate budget, financial, and<BR>

<P>program information&quot;).  Some of the recommendations were very broad<BR>

<P>(e.g., &quot;redefine and restructure OPM's functional responsibilities&quot;);<BR>

<P>others were more specific (e.g., &quot;establish a hardrock mine<BR>

<P>reclamation fund&quot;).  Some recommendations cut to the core of how<BR>

<P>government operates (e.g., &quot;improve legislative-executive branch<BR>

<P>relationship&quot;); others, while important, were on relatively<BR>

<P>tangential topics (e.g., &quot;establish federal firearms license user<BR>

<P>fees to cover costs&quot;).  Because of these differences, we assessed<BR>

<P>NPR's progress recommendation by recommendation.  Although we present<BR>

<P>some summary statistics, the diverse scope of the recommendations<BR>

<P>should be kept in mind in interpreting NPR's overall<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      MOST RECOMMENDATIONS ACTED<BR>

<P>      UPON, BUT FEW FULLY<BR>

<P>      IMPLEMENTED<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>At least some action had been taken to implement 355 (93 percent) of<BR>

<P>the 384 NPR recommendations when we completed our analysis.  Of<BR>

<P>these,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- 15 (4 percent) had been fully implemented;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- 143 (37 percent) had been partially implemented;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- 193 (50 percent) were acted upon in some manner (e.g.,<BR>

<P>     legislation was introduced or the agency was in the process of<BR>

<P>     making suggested changes), but the action had not proceeded to<BR>

<P>     the point that we considered any of the recommendations' goals<BR>

<P>     to have been achieved; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- 6 (2 percent) were acted upon in a manner generally consistent<BR>

<P>     with the recommendations' purposes, although not in the manner<BR>

<P>     NPR suggested. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Of the remaining 27 recommendations, no action had been taken to<BR>

<P>implement 18 (5 percent), and we had insufficient information to<BR>

<P>judge the status of 9 recommendations (2 percent). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      MODE OF RECOMMENDATION<BR>

<P>      IMPLEMENTATION VARIED<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A variety of types of actions have been taken to attempt to implement<BR>

<P>the NPR recommendations.  The most common type was action by a<BR>

<P>particular agency or set of agencies; of the 384 recommendations, at<BR>

<P>least 292 were acted upon in this manner.\4 The second most common<BR>

<P>mode of action was legislative activity; bills were introduced<BR>

<P>regarding at least 169 recommendations and legislation was enacted<BR>

<P>regarding at least 83 recommendations.  At least 86 recommendations<BR>

<P>were acted on via executive orders, presidential<BR>

<P>memoranda/directives, or other types of presidential action. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>--------------------<BR>

<P>\4 The number of implementation actions listed in this section totals<BR>

<P>more than the number of recommendations because a single<BR>

<P>recommendation may have been acted upon in more than one fashion<BR>

<P>(e.g., both legislation and agency action). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      SOME IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS<BR>
      BEGAN PRIOR TO THE NPR<BR>

<P>      REPORT<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Actions were already under way to implement a number of the<BR>

<P>recommendations before the recommendations were made in the September<BR>

<P>1993 NPR report.  For example, one of the actions NPR recommended to<BR>

<P>improve federal regulatory systems stated that regulatory agencies<BR>

<P>should &quot;rank the seriousness of environmental, health, or safety<BR>

<P>risks.&quot; However, as the NPR accompanying report noted, the<BR>

<P>Environmental Protection Agency published a rank-order listing of<BR>

<P>environmental risks in 1987.  In some cases, the NPR recommendations<BR>

<P>themselves recognized that such actions were already under way.  For<BR>

<P>example, the Department of the Treasury recommendation to &quot;increase<BR>

<P>IRS collections through better compliance efforts&quot; said NPR &quot;supports<BR>

<P>the current efforts of the IRS .  .  .  to improve voluntary<BR>

<P>compliance and other efforts to collect taxes already owed to the<BR>

<P>federal government.&quot; Thus, NPR cannot claim total credit for the<BR>

<P>implementation of some of the recommendations.  However, in some<BR>

<P>cases the designation of an issue as an NPR recommendation did seem<BR>

<P>to stimulate action in areas that had been relatively dormant.  For<BR>

<P>example, the repeal of the wine and flavors tax credit had been<BR>

<P>recommended in the past, but since NPR made its recommendation,<BR>

<P>legislation has been drafted to repeal the credit. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   GAO GENERALLY AGREES WITH MOST<BR>

<P>   NPR RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In our December 1993 report on NPR, we said that NPR emphasized many<BR>

<P>of the basic themes that we have stressed for years and that we<BR>

<P>generally agreed with most of its recommendations.  Our reassessment<BR>

<P>of NPR's recommendations in light of the release of accompanying<BR>

<P>reports for most of the NPR issue areas and the completion of<BR>

<P>additional GAO work has generally confirmed that level of agreement. <BR>

<P>We now &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;generally agree&quot; with more than three-fourths<BR>

<P>(295) of the 384 NPR recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>However, in a few cases our reconsideration resulted in our<BR>

<P>disagreeing with recommendations.  Whereas we disagreed with only one<BR>

<P>NPR recommendation in our December 1993 report, we now disagree with<BR>

<P>three recommendations:  (1) that to allow power marketing<BR>

<P>administrations to recover more operating costs would &quot;increase<BR>

<P>electrical power revenues&quot; at the Department of Energy (DOE04), (2)<BR>

<P>to &quot;create a boundary-spanning workforce development council&quot; at the<BR>

<P>Department of Labor (DOL09), and (3) to allow the Small Business<BR>

<P>Administration to &quot;guarantee loans made by banks to nonprofit<BR>

<P>intermediaries&quot; (SBA05).  We still have insufficient information to<BR>

<P>comment on another 86 recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   MANY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH<BR>

<P>   POTENTIAL SAVINGS HAVE NOT BEEN<BR>

<P>   IMPLEMENTED<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A number of the recommendations that NPR said would yield substantial<BR>

<P>budget savings between fiscal years 1995 and 1999 have not been<BR>

<P>implemented.  These recommendations, and the savings NPR said would<BR>

<P>accrue during this period, include those to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- improve Social Security Administration disability claims<BR>

<P>     processing (HHS06)--$4.01 billion,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- redirect Department of Energy laboratories to post-Cold War<BR>

<P>     priorities (DOE06)--$2.15 billion,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- institute and collect user fees on the Food and Drug<BR>

<P>     Administration's inspection and approval processes<BR>

<P>     (HHS10)--$1.44 billion, and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- administer the employment and training requirements for food<BR>

<P>     stamp recipients more effectively and efficiently<BR>

<P>     (USDA05)--$1.04 billion. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We agree or generally agree with all of these recommendations, but<BR>

<P>none of them has been even partially implemented.  The Congressional<BR>

<P>Budget Office has not independently assessed the potential budget<BR>

<P>savings associated with these recommendations, so it is not clear<BR>

<P>whether NPR's savings estimates are accurate.  Consensus is needed<BR>

<P>regarding which NPR recommendations hold the greatest promise for<BR>

<P>significant budget savings.  Prompt action should then be taken to<BR>

<P>consider those recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   MANY MANAGEMENT ISSUES NOT<BR>

<P>   ADDRESSED BY NPR<BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The 384 NPR recommendations touch upon a wide range of issues in need<BR>

<P>of improved management.  However, many critical management issues<BR>

<P>were not discussed in NPR's report.  For example, although the NPR<BR>
recommendations were related to 13 of the 18 GAO-designated high-risk<BR>

<P>areas and 34 of the 84 OMB-designated high-risk areas,\5 the<BR>

<P>
<P>The NPR recommendations also did not address nearly three-fourths of<BR>

<P>what we consider the most important management problems in 23 federal<BR>

<P>discussed previously, problem areas not considered by NPR include<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>lack of effective controls over Department of Defense disbursements,<BR>

<P>

<P>effort and our belief that the vast majority of the recommendations<BR>

<P>should be implemented as quickly as possible.  We highlight these<BR>

<P>other issues to demonstrate that full implementation of the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations is not all that is needed to improve government<BR>

<P>management.  The issues not covered by the NPR recommendations also<BR>

<P>represent significant additional opportunities to make the government<BR>

<P>   EXECUTIVE-CONGRESSIONAL<BR>

<P>   PARTNERSHIP, STRONG LEADERSHIP,<BR>

<P>   AND ATTENTION TO AGENCIES'<BR>

<P>   CAPACITIES STILL NEEDED<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In our December 1993 report, we emphasized three themes that we<BR>

<P>believed were crucial to the long-range success of the NPR effort: <BR>

<P>(1) the administration must work in partnership with Congress, (2)<BR>

<P>attention should be paid to agencies' capacities to take on the<BR>

<P>additional responsibilities NPR envisions, and (3) sustained<BR>

<P>attention is needed from top political and career leadership.  Events<BR>

<P>during the past year have confirmed the importance of these issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to NPR staff, 173 of the 384 recommendations require<BR>

<P>legislative action in order to be fully implemented.  However, at<BR>

<P>least tacit approval by Congress is necessary to implement virtually<BR>

<P>all of the recommendations.  Executive-congressional cooperation has<BR>

<P>been evident regarding certain issues, such as procurement reform,<BR>

<P>expansion of financial management initiatives throughout the<BR>

<P>government, and authorization for employee buyouts to allow agencies<BR>

<P>to downsize.  However, more efforts toward executive-congressional<BR>

<P>cooperation are needed.  At least 106 of the 173 recommendations NPR<BR>

<P>said required legislative action have not been implemented. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Even in those areas in which the executive and legislative branches<BR>

<P>worked together, they sometimes disagreed over goals or approaches. <BR>

<P>For example, while Congress authorized buyouts as a means of<BR>

<P>downsizing the federal workforce, it also limited staff reductions in<BR>

<P>certain agencies and occupational categories--actions that officials<BR>

<P>at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said make it more<BR>

<P>difficult to achieve the overall downsizing goals.  We believe that,<BR>

<P>to implement some of the more contentious and difficult changes NPR<BR>

<P>recommended, Congress and the administration must develop mutually<BR>

<P>agreed on goals and implementation strategies.  The administration<BR>

<P>and Congress need to do more joint problem solving if NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations are to continue to be implemented. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also remain concerned about whether agencies have the processes,<BR>

<P>systems, and qualified staff needed to perform their current<BR>

<P>missions, let alone take on the additional responsibilities NPR<BR>

<P>envisions in a downsized, decentralized, and deregulated environment. <BR>

<P>The downsizing of the federal workforce that NPR envisioned has<BR> 

<P>begun.  OMB estimates that 71,000 full- time equivalent positions<BR>

<P>were eliminated by the end of fiscal year 1994.  Further reductions<BR>

<P>over the next 4 years are expected to bring the federal workforce to<BR>

<P>its lowest level since the mid- 1960s.  However,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NPR's original goal of cutting more than 250,000 positions from<BR>

<P>     the federal workforce was not the result of careful workforce<BR>

<P>     planning;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- agencies' workforce reductions, in many cases, have not been<BR>

<P>     preceded by the implementation of changes in work processes that<BR>

<P>     NPR said would enable the cuts to occur;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- 11 of 30 agencies we surveyed earlier this year said that they<BR>

<P>     had not targeted the buyouts they used to encourage downsizing<BR>

<P>     on the &quot;management control&quot; positions NPR said should be<BR>

<P>     reduced;\6 and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- some agencies have not ensured that critical skills needed for<BR>

<P>     program performance and the prevention of mismanagement are not<BR>

<P>     lost in their downsizing efforts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We support efforts to move to a smaller, more efficient government. <BR>

<P>However, we believe that any staff reductions should be done<BR>

<P>strategically, with outcome-based strategic goals and sound workforce<BR>

<P>plans being the cornerstones of agencies' downsizing strategies.  We<BR>

<P>also believe that agencies must reengineer outdated systems and<BR>

<P>structures and enhance the quality of the remaining staff to ensure<BR>

<P>that downsizing does not diminish program performance and increase<BR>

<P>the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse.  Without such changes, it<BR>

<P>will not be possible to achieve many NPR objectives or correct other<BR>

<P>federal management problems.  Reductions in staff without careful<BR>

<P>workforce planning and without making the changes in existing work<BR>

<P>processes that can permit those reductions to occur may even<BR>

<P>exacerbate existing problems and place the overall NPR effort in<BR>

<P>jeopardy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Finally, it is clear that, as the Vice President said, full<BR>

<P>implementation of many of the NPR recommendations will take years. <BR>

<P>Therefore, agencies' political and career leaders must take a strong<BR>

<P>role in creating and guiding these long-term management improvement<BR>

<P>efforts.  The performance agreements signed by eight departmental<BR>

<P>secretaries are examples of the type of leadership needed and are<BR>

<P>good first steps in this endeavor.  Agreements that concentrate on<BR>

<P>the agencies' desired outcomes can serve as guides for performance<BR>

<P>improvement.  However, twice that number of other departmental and<BR>

<P>agency executives were supposed to have signed such agreements but<BR>

<P>have not yet done so.  Also, most of the agreements signed thus far<BR>

<P>lack the specificity needed to ensure effective guidance for agency<BR>

<P>downsizing initiatives.  Commitment and leadership by senior career<BR>

<P>executives are also critical to the success of the NPR effort,<BR>

<P>especially when one considers that the median tenure of senior<BR>

<P>political appointees is about 2 years.  Career managers can provide<BR>

<P>the long-term focus needed to institutionalize NPR's reforms that<BR>

<P>political executives' more limited tenure does not permit.

<P>   A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT FOCUS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR report's recommendations were organized around four general<BR>

<P>principles:  cutting red tape, putting customers first, empowering<BR>

<P>employees to get results, and cutting back to basics.  Some progress<BR>

<P>has been made toward each of these principles.  For example, recent<BR>

<P>changes in the federal procurement system will reduce some of the red<BR>

<P>tape involved in federal agencies' acquisition systems.  A number of<BR>

<P>federal agencies have made public commitments to improve customer<BR>

<P>service, and OMB has streamlined the clearance process for agencies'<BR>

<P>voluntary customer surveys.  The Department of Housing and Urban<BR>

<P>Development has eliminated its regional offices in an effort to<BR>

<P>improve accountability between headquarters and field office staff. <BR>

<P>However, it is not always clear whether the red tape that is to be<BR>
eliminated also serves a useful purpose, who agencies' customers are,<BR>

<P>whether accountability and internal controls will remain when<BR>

<P>employees are empowered, and what nonbasic programs should be<BR>

<P>eliminated. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR performed a service in highlighting many problems that needed to<BR>

<P>be addressed and recommending solutions to these problems.  However,<BR>

<P>to be successful in the long run, NPR will need to sharpen its focus<BR>

<P>and bind the recommendations together into a more coherent framework<BR>

<P>that can better permit the government reform movement to take root<BR>

<P>and flourish. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The needed framework is one that will produce a basic change in the<BR>

<P>way government agencies and programs are managed by the executive<BR>

<P>branch and overseen by Congress.  Today, government management<BR>

<P>primarily focuses on efficient use of inputs (e.g., the number of<BR>

<P>dollars or staff allotted to an agency), adherence to legislative or<BR>

<P>agency-developed rules, and the accomplishment of outputs (e.g., the<BR>
number of inspections completed or the number of claims processed). <BR>

<P>Good managers are viewed as those who wisely manage their resources,<BR>

<P>follow agency procedures, and perform the requisite number of<BR>

<P>output-based tasks.  A reinvented government, while not ignoring<BR>

<P>input and process measures, should focus more on the accomplishment<BR>

<P>of programmatic results.  For example, in addition to being concerned<BR>

<P>about the number of staff assigned to an issue or the number of<BR>

<P>enforcement actions taken, those interested in effective government<BR>

<P>management should also focus on whether the agency's mission (e.g.,<BR>

<P>safer streets, effective collection of taxes, reduced infant<BR>

<P>mortality) is being accomplished. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A number of NPR recommendations were intended to achieve more<BR>

<P>results-oriented management.  For example, NPR recommended that the<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Agency for International Development reengineer management of<BR>

<P>     its projects and programs to emphasize program results (AID06);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Federal Emergency Management Agency create results-oriented<BR>

<P>     incentives to reduce the costs of a disaster (FEMA03);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Department of Labor shift the focus of the unemployment<BR>

<P>     insurance benefits quality control program from error<BR>
     measurement to a constructive use of results (DOL21);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- National Aeronautics and Space Administration's measurement of<BR>

<P>     technology transfer focus on results, not just levels of<BR>

<P>     activity (NASA02); and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Environmental Protection Agency establish measurable goals,<BR>

<P>     performance standards, and strategic planning (EPA07). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although these recommendations were results oriented, the NPR report<BR>

<P>did not clearly emphasize that these types of changes should be the<BR>

<P>centerpiece of management reform.  As the Brookings Institution's<BR>

<P>study of reinventing government said, the long-term success of NPR<BR>

<P>requires &quot;a force at the center of government .  .  .  to focus<BR>

<P>government on results and avoid having the reform spin off into<BR>

<P>scores of different, unconnected directions.&quot;\7<BR>

<P>
<P>      SEVERAL FACTORS NEEDED TO<BR>

<P>      CHANGE MANAGEMENT FOCUS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Our work indicates that several factors are necessary to make the<BR>

<P>transition to a reinvented, results-oriented government.  First,<BR>

<P>agencies' goals must be clearly stated in outcome-based terms and<BR>

<P>means developed to measure progress toward those goals.  Second,<BR>

<P>decisionmakers must have information--programmatic, financial, and<BR>

<P>operational--to allow them to know whether agencies' goals are being<BR>

<P>achieved and systems to bring that information to decisionmakers in a<BR>

<P>timely manner.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, structures and<BR>

<P>processes need to be established and used to reinforce the focus on<BR>

<P>outcome-based management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The legal imperatives needed to bring about a great deal of<BR>

<P>government reinvention are already in place.  The Government<BR>

<P>Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires federal agencies<BR>

<P>to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>develop strategic plans by fiscal year 1998;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>prepare annual plans setting performance goals beginning with fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1999; and<BR>

<P>
<P>report annually on actual performance toward achieving those goals,<BR>

<P>with the first report due in March 2000. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As a result of these requirements, greater emphasis should be placed<BR>

<P>on the results or outcomes of government programs.  The intent of<BR>

<P>GPRA is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal<BR>

<P>programs and services by requiring that managers set program<BR>

<P>performance goals and measure results.  Federal managers may also<BR>

<P>propose waivers of certain administrative requirements that hinder<BR>

<P>their ability to achieve these goals in return for increased<BR>

<P>accountability for results.  As will be discussed later, Congress<BR>

<P>should be involved in the process of setting agencies' goals and<BR>

<P>developing appropriate performance measures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Another source of the information needed about government performance<BR>

<P>should be the annual audited financial statement required under the<BR>

<P>Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act.  Without this information,<BR>

<P>legislative and executive branch leaders have been crippled in their<BR>

<P>ability to control costs, evaluate performance, or implement<BR>

<P>performance management improvements such as those envisioned in GPRA. <BR>

<P>The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 recently expanded the<BR>

<P>CFO Act's requirements to cover the entire operations of all 24 CFO<BR>

<P>Act agencies and to require a consolidated financial statement of<BR>

<P>executive branch agencies beginning in fiscal year 1997.  We strongly<BR>

<P>support these changes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As noted previously, outcome-based management and reinvented<BR>

<P>government also require the development of and investment in<BR>

<P>information systems to collect and transmit programmatic and<BR>

<P>financial information to decisionmakers.  The federal government's<BR>

<P>record of successfully implementing critical information systems to<BR>

<P>support cost reduction and service improvements is poor.  For years,<BR>

<P>agencies have experienced unacceptable rates of project failure,<BR>

<P>delay, and overspending and shown little evidence of returns on the<BR>

<P>public's large investment in this area.  Only with major shifts in<BR>

<P>the strategic processes through which information and technology<BR>

<P>assets are managed will the possibilities offered by modern<BR>

<P>information technology be realized.  The best practices used by<BR>

<P>leaders in the field of information technology can provide valuable<BR>

<P>lessons to government in this regard.\8<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Outcome-based goals, accurate performance data, and state-of-the- art<BR>

<P>information systems are of little value unless they are used by<BR>

<P>decisionmakers.  Therefore, leaders in both the executive and<BR>

<P>legislative branches of government must also focus on achieving<BR>

<P>results.  OMB and Congress, like agency managers, have historically<BR>

<P>focused on inputs, processes, and outputs.  However, changes<BR>

<P>currently under way at OMB have the potential to alter that focus in<BR>

<P>the executive branch.  The reorganization of the agency under the<BR>

<P>banner of &quot;OMB 2000&quot; and the associated melding of the management and<BR>

<P>budget roles of the agency represent an opportunity for OMB to focus<BR>

<P>on management and programmatic results during the budget process.  If<BR>

<P>this change is accomplished, agencies may be expected to state, in<BR>

<P>outcome-based terms, what can be expected given certain budgetary<BR>

<P>levels.  Agencies could then be held accountable for producing<BR>

<P>specific results from their programs.  How implementation of OMB 2000<BR>

<P>occurs may have a great impact on the success or failure of<BR>

<P>results-oriented management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Similar changes are needed in the authorization, appropriation, and<BR>

<P>oversight activities of Congress.  For example, some agencies'<BR>

<P>missions are legislatively defined in multiple and sometimes<BR>

<P>conflicting ways.  As a case in point, the Agency for International<BR>

<P>Development (AID) currently has nearly 40 legislative missions, from<BR>

<P>agricultural development to furthering human rights.  These varied<BR>

<P>missions create confusion as to what Congress intends AID to<BR>

<P>accomplish and make it difficult to hold the agency accountable for<BR>

<P>accomplishing its objectives.  For AID to clearly state and<BR>

<P>accomplish its mission, Congress needs to clarify its legislative<BR>

<P>underpinnings. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Also, although some congressional oversight has focused on agencies'<BR>

<P>performance, a great deal of Congress' attention has been devoted to<BR>

<P>the process of management rather than on the results of management. <BR>

<P>NPR clearly envisioned changes in that focus when it recommended that<BR>

<P>Congress<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- reduce &quot;overitemization&quot; in appropriation accounts and align<BR>

<P>     those accounts with programs (BGT03),<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- eliminate employment ceilings and floors by allowing agencies to<BR>

<P>     manage within their budgets (BGT04),<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- reduce procedural restrictions such as those on the Department<BR>

<P>     of Housing and Urban Development's sale of multifamily<BR>

<P>     properties (HUD02), and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- reduce the number of congressionally mandated reports (SMC06). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>One reason for Congress' focus on agency processes has been the<BR>
general absence of reliable performance data.  The implementation of<BR>

<P>GPRA and the expansion of the CFO Act should help alleviate this<BR>

<P>problem and can serve as the means by which Congress can better focus<BR>

<P>on results.  However, the development of performance data and their<BR>

<P>use by Congress are mutually reinforcing.  The long-term success of<BR>

<P>GPRA and the movement to a new mode of government management and<BR>

<P>accountability depends on Congress having the requisite data and<BR>

<P>moving from a focus on inputs, outputs, and procedural issues to an<BR>

<P>emphasis on establishing clear agency missions and goals and focusing<BR>

<P>on outcomes and results. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The experiences of various states and foreign countries that are<BR>

<P>among the leaders in management reform suggest that a movement to<BR>

<P>results-oriented management will not be easy or quickly accomplished. <BR>

<P>We also realize that outcome-based measures of government performance<BR>

<P>are more appropriate and are more easily set in some areas than in<BR>

<P>others.  While the challenges are difficult, we believe that the<BR>

<P>potential benefits from a change in government management are great<BR>

<P>and we are encouraged by the initial progress that has been made. <BR>

<P>   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND<BR>

<P>   METHODOLOGY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Our primary objectives in this assignment were to (1) assess the<BR>

<P>implementation of the NPR recommendations 1 year after their<BR>

<P>publication and (2) to reassess our December 1993 comments regarding<BR>

<P>those recommendations in light of the publication of NPR accompanying<BR>

<P>reports and our additional audit work.  To accomplish the first<BR>

<P>objective, we used our completed and ongoing work to place each of<BR>

<P>the 384 NPR recommendations into 1 of the following 6 implementation<BR>

<P>categories: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(1) Fully Implemented.  The entire recommendation and/or all action<BR>

<P>items in a related accompanying report have been fulfilled. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) Partially Implemented.  The recommendation and/or associated<BR>

<P>action items have been implemented in part but not in total. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) Not Implemented--Action Taken.  No part of the recommendation or<BR>

<P>associated action items has been implemented, but some action has<BR>

<P>been taken to implement the recommendation and/or the action items. <BR>

<P>For example, if legislation has been introduced that would address<BR>

<P>the recommendation but has not been enacted into law, we categorized<BR>

<P>the recommendation as &quot;not implemented--action taken.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4) Not Implemented--No Action Taken.  No part of the recommendation<BR>

<P>or associated action items has been implemented, and no action has<BR>

<P>occurred toward the implementation of the recommendation or the<BR>

<P>action items. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(5) Insufficient Information.  Insufficient or conflicting evidence<BR>

<P>prevented us from determining the status of implementation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(6) Other.  Implementation action has occurred that, while not<BR>

<P>responsive to the letter of the recommendation, is generally<BR>

<P>consistent with its purpose. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We contacted agency officials identified by NPR as responsible for<BR>

<P>each recommendation and determined what had been done to implement<BR>

<P>the recommendations.  Where appropriate, we also obtained any<BR>

<P>available documentation of action to implement the recommendations. <BR>

<P>Unless otherwise noted, the data on implementation of the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations were gathered as of September 7, 1994--the 1-year<BR>

<P>anniversary of the NPR report. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We could assess the implementation status of only one of the<BR>

<P>recommendations directed toward the intelligence community because<BR>

<P>the Director of Central Intelligence would not provide the necessary<BR>

<P>information.  The implementation status of some recommendations in<BR>

<P>other areas were difficult to assess because they called for changes<BR>

<P>in areas that had not been previously measured or for which measures<BR>

<P>do not exist.  For example, one of the recommendations called for<BR>

<P>enhanced public awareness and participation in the rulemaking<BR>

<P>process.  Without generally agreed upon measures of public awareness<BR>

<P>or participation and ways to measure changes before and after the<BR>

<P>recommendation was made, accurate assessment of the recommendation's<BR>

<P>implementation is impossible.  In these cases, we noted the basis for<BR>

<P>our conclusions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To accomplish our second objective, we used our completed and ongoing<BR>

<P>work to place each NPR recommendation in one of four comment<BR>

<P>categories.  Those categories and their definitions are as follows: <BR>

<P>
<P>(1) Agree.  We agree with the recommendation both in general and in<BR>

<P>all the particulars. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(2) Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the recommendation but<BR>

<P>have some qualifying views or reservations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(3) Disagree.  We disagree with the recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(4) Insufficient Information.  We have no basis for taking a position<BR>

<P>on the recommendation because we have not done work in the specific<BR>

<P>area addressed by the recommendation or the recommendation was too<BR>

<P>vague for us to comment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The report is organized in the same manner as the NPR report's<BR>

<P>recommendations.  The first 22 sections of the report focus on NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations that were directed toward federal agencies, and the<BR>

<P>last 16 sections focus on recommendations regarding crosscutting<BR>

<P>government systems.  Within each section there is an overall summary,<BR>

<P>a GAO contact for all the recommendations in that section, and a<BR>

<P>discussion of each recommendation.  That discussion includes (1) the<BR>

<P>recommendation and any associated action items, (2) our comments<BR>

<P>regarding the recommendation, (3) our view of the recommendation's<BR>
implementation, and (4) a listing of related GAO products.  No action<BR>

<P>items are listed in sections for which an NPR accompanying report had<BR>

<P>not been issued by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We did not review the NPR's estimated savings from implementing its<BR>

<P>recommendations.  The Congressional Budget Office already has<BR>

<P>analyzed some of the NPR recommendations from that perspective.  We<BR>

<P>also did not review the status of approximately 130 &quot;reinvention<BR>

<P>labs&quot; that have been developed in federal agencies.  We plan to<BR>

<P>discuss these labs in a forthcoming report.  Neither did we examine<BR>

<P>other activities that NPR said was occurring that were not related to<BR>

<P>their September 1993 recommendations.  Our comments regarding each<BR>

<P>recommendation are based on the wording of the recommendation and any<BR>

<P>associated action items, not on how the recommendation is being<BR>

<P>implemented. <BR>

<P>   AGENCY COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since this report is primarily based on our issued reports and<BR>

<P>testimonies, we did not obtain comments from the Office of the Vice<BR>

<P>President and federal agencies.  In many cases, comments from<BR>

<P>agencies and our evaluations of those comments are contained in the<BR>

<P>reports cited.  We did, however, discuss this report's contents with<BR>

<P>senior NPR officials, who suggested some changes that we took into<BR>

<P>consideration.  Overall, they agreed with our findings. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We are sending copies of this report to other congressional<BR>

<P>committees; the Vice President; and the Director, Office of<BR>

<P>Management and Budget.  Copies will be made available to other<BR>

<P>interested parties upon request. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 16<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 16:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommended that NASA make more than 50 improvements in five<BR>

<P>areas:  contracting, technology development and transfer,<BR>

<P>coordination and cooperation with industry, management of programs<BR>

<P>and projects, and the Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) program.  NASA<BR>

<P>has made, or is currently making, almost all of the improvements in<BR>

<P>each of these areas.  Progress has been most apparent in the<BR>

<P>contracting area, where a number of improvement initiatives were<BR>

<P>already under way before the NPR recommendations were made.  NASA has<BR>

<P>also taken several steps to facilitate technology development and<BR>

<P>transfer and to improve coordination and cooperation with industry. <BR>

<P>For example, NASA is encouraging increased industry participation in<BR>

<P>aeronautical research and development and is working on a variety of<BR>

<P>ways to expand its technology transfer efforts through employee<BR>

<P>training, partnering relationships, and aggressive outreach. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA's efforts to improve its program and project management have<BR>

<P>primarily been through the establishment of a Program Management<BR>

<P>Council to oversee the planning, implementation, and management of<BR>

<P>all major programs and projects.  In addition, NASA has reshaped the<BR>

<P>management of its space station program and is working to identify<BR>

<P>and eliminate duplication of effort, reduce contracting for support<BR>

<P>services, and shrink its workforce by at least 13 percent, or about<BR>

<P>3,200 employees, by the end of this decade.  Finally, NASA continues<BR>

<P>to refine its Earth Observing System--the principal component of the<BR>

<P>MTPE program--by coordinating its developmental requirements with the<BR>

<P>user community and other existing or planned remote sensing projects<BR>

<P>in order to maximize its usefulness while attempting to control its<BR>

<P>cost. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      NASA01:  IMPROVE NASA<BR>

<P>      CONTRACTING PRACTICES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation outlines several steps NASA can take to improve<BR>

<P>its contracting procedures, including greater use of performance<BR>

<P>standards, contracting out for data instead of hardware whenever<BR>

<P>appropriate, and using cooperative research agreements to more<BR>

<P>quickly exploit high performance computing techniques. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  NASA regulations should be modified to provide for greater<BR>

<P>emphasis on the selection of appropriate contract type, to make<BR>

<P>better use of positive and negative incentives to contractors through<BR>

<P>award fee contracts, and to consider increasing contractor liability<BR>

<P>for correction of defects in materials and workmanship or other<BR>

<P>failures to conform to contract requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  NASA and other government agencies should consider contracting<BR>

<P>out for data instead of hardware. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NASA should extend the use of its Cooperative Research Agreement<BR>

<P>solicitation instrument to for-profit, as well as nonprofit and<BR>

<P>educational, organizations to exploit new high-performance computing<BR>

<P>technology more quickly. <BR>

<P>Agree.  As early as 1987, NASA acknowledged that its procurement and<BR>

<P>contract management were vulnerable to waste and mismanagement, based<BR>

<P>on its own internal management reviews and those of the NASA<BR>

<P>Inspector General.  Since then, the results of additional reviews,<BR>

<P>including numerous GAO reports, as well as partial or total failure<BR>

<P>of expensive space hardware, have further evidenced the need for NASA<BR>

<P>to improve its contracting practices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NASA has made considerable progress in<BR>

<P>addressing this recommendation, primarily because a number of NASA's<BR>

<P>procurement improvement efforts were already under way before the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations were made. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In early 1992, NASA began formulating a new award fee policy,<BR>

<P>emphasizing the selection of contract type and the use of positive<BR>

<P>and negative performance incentives.  This policy was implemented<BR>

<P>during fiscal year 1994.  Also, by early 1993, NASA was formulating a<BR>

<P>policy to increase contractor liability for repairing or replacing<BR>

<P>space systems which do not meet requirements.  This policy is under<BR>

<P>final review within NASA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On June 30, 1994, NASA began requiring that statements of work in<BR>

<P>contracts describe the work in terms of required output, where<BR>

<P>feasible.  The statements of work are to be broad in scope and<BR>

<P>general in nature to give contractors the freedom to innovate and<BR>

<P>economize while, at the same time, making them fully responsible for<BR>

<P>quality performance and more accountable for the end results. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In February 1994, NASA prepared a sample cooperative agreement for<BR>

<P>use with for-profit firms.  NASA has previously had such agreements<BR>

<P>only with universities and nonprofit organizations.  The new strategy<BR>

<P>is intended to increase technology transfer to industry.  The new<BR>

<P>cooperative agreement policy is not yet officially approved but NASA<BR>

<P>organizations are already implementing it.  For example, a<BR>

<P>cooperative agreement notice has been issued under the Aerospace<BR>

<P>Industry Technology Program for industry-led research and development<BR>

<P>efforts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  NASA should enhance its protection of commercially sensitive<BR>

<P>information on joint NASA-industry technology projects by allowing<BR>

<P>temporary protection from Freedom of Information Act disclosure. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The State Department should publish a notice in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register to establish its goals for expediting the processing of<BR>

<P>export license applications. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NASA's technology transfer activities should be expanded through<BR>

<P>implementation of a variety of measures, incliuding the following: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NASA's Research and Technology Objectives and Plans should be<BR>

<P>     modified to include a statement requesting that NASA centers<BR>

<P>     give strong consideration to partnership arrangements with the<BR>

<P>     commercial sector in conducting the NASA R&amp;D program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NASA should grant its centers and center directors and/or<BR>

<P>     project managers more flexibility in funding technology transfer<BR>

<P>     opportunities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- All NASA contracts should require clearly defined technology<BR>

<P>     transfer plans for the commercial application of technologies<BR>

<P>     developed for NASA missions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NASA programs offered through the Announcement of Opportunity<BR>

<P>     process should state that mission objectives also include<BR>

<P>     technology advancement and infusion into the private sector and<BR>

<P>     that grant proposals should be evaluated on the basis of how<BR>

<P>     such objectives would be achieved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NASA should significantly increase its efforts to secure<BR>

<P>     alliances with state and local governments and provide small<BR>

<P>     businesses with opportunities to spur technology transfer. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- NASA's Vision-Mission-Values document should be amended to state<BR>

<P>     that technology transfer is a major mission objective of the<BR>

<P>     agency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  NASA should implement its New Technology Investments Program<BR>

<P>through the use of industry-led efforts that will create and apply<BR>

<P>new technology to NASA programs as well as to the commercial<BR>

<P>marketplace. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  The specific actions recommended by NPR include<BR>

<P>efforts across NASA to more directly support activities for<BR>

<P>identifying and transferring useful technology to the private sector<BR>

<P>in a timely manner.  Such efforts would include employee training,<BR>

<P>partnering arrangements, and aggressive outreach to promote more<BR>

<P>effective technology transfer.  In general, these are appropriate<BR>

<P>mechanisms for increasing the focus on identifying and implementing<BR>

<P>technology transfer opportunities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NASA's progress in addressing these action<BR>

<P>items ranges from no action to completed action.  NASA has not acted<BR>

<P>on the first action item; however, the agency is planning to<BR>

<P>establish a working group to determine the kinds of information that<BR>

<P>can appropriately be temporarily exempted from FOIA disclosure.  NASA<BR>

<P>has contacted State Department officials about the second action<BR>

<P>item, but no progress has been reported to NASA by the State<BR>

<P>Department. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Regarding the third action item, NASA has drafted a new &quot;NASA<BR>

<P>Commercial Technology Policy&quot; that provides, among other things, for<BR>

<P>(1) committing 10 to 20 percent of the NASA budget to research and<BR>

<P>development efforts with industry, (2) providing technology transfer<BR>

<P>training in all mid-level development programs, (3) requiring<BR>

<P>technology transfer plans in all appropriate contracts, (4)<BR>

<P>increasing alliances with state and local governments, (5) providing<BR>

<P>center directors with more flexibility to fund technology transfer,<BR>

<P>and (6) making technology transfer a major mission objective.  In<BR>

<P>June 1994, NASA's Commercial Technology Team, which was created in<BR>

<P>late 1993 to develop and implement an agencywide plan for commercial<BR>

<P>technology activities, prepared an &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; to make<BR>

<P>commercial technology a primary NASA mission, comparable in<BR>

<P>importance to aeronautics and space. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On the last action item, NASA has held two forums to discuss with<BR>

<P>industry representatives the submission of proposals under the<BR>

<P>Aerospace Industry Technology Program, the core element of NASA's New<BR>

<P>Technology Investments Program.  The evaluation of proposals and<BR>

<P>source selection are scheduled for early 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA should develop a closer relationship with the U.S.  civil<BR>

<P>aviation industry and government partners to ensure that industry<BR>

<P>needs are addressed early and throughout the technology development<BR>

<P>process and to maximize investment through fast and efficient<BR>

<P>should: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- ensure that promising technologies are fully developed, through<BR>

<P>     validation where necessary, to reduce the risk to industry of<BR>

<P>     commercialization efforts;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- increase industry participation and involvement in all phases of<BR>

<P>     the research and development process, from planning to<BR>

<P>     implementation as well as in the evaluation of results; and<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  The specific areas of emphasis addressed under this<BR>

<P>recommendation are consistent with our concerns about providing<BR>

<P>better service and support to the aviation industry.  In particular,<BR>

<P>they focus on the need for NASA to change the type of aeronautics<BR>

<P>research support it offers and to generally improve its coordination<BR>

<P>and communication with industry. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NASA has initiated or completed action in<BR>

<P>each of the recommendation's three areas of emphasis.  NASA is<BR>

<P>working with the Office of Science and Technology Policy/National<BR>

<P>Economic Council and other federal agencies to help develop a<BR>

<P>coordinated science and technology policy and federal research and<BR>

<P>development strategy before adapting them to agency-specific use. <BR>

<P>Meanwhile, NASA is concentrating its efforts on its top three<BR>

<P>technology priorities--high speed research, subsonic research, and<BR>

<P>aeronautics test facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA is increasing industry participation in all phases of the<BR>

<P>research and development process in a variety of ways.  For example,<BR>

<P>NASA held a workshop in April 1993 that solicited assistance from<BR>

<P>industry and academia in redefining the focus of parts of its High<BR>

<P>Performance Computing and Communications Program.  NASA is also<BR>

<P>augmenting its Advanced Composites Technology program with a team of<BR>

<P>airframe manufacturers, materials suppliers, and university<BR>

<P>researchers and has established the Environmental Research and Sensor<BR>

<P>Technology program alliance with industry to accelerate the<BR>

<P>development of high altitude/long endurance automated vehicles. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In response to the last area of emphasis, NASA has established a link<BR>

<P>between its field centers and industry through Internet to enable<BR>

<P>industry to access NASA databases.  In addition, NASA's aeronautics<BR>

<P>centers have instituted an exit survey of the users of their<BR>

<P>facilities to ascertain customer satisfaction.  Finally, since the<BR>

<P>Technology Transfer Act of 1986 makes laboratory researchers<BR>

<P>responsible for technology transfer, NASA is amending the position<BR>

<P>descriptions of each laboratory science and engineering professional<BR>

<P>to hold them accountable for identifying and responding to technology<BR>

<P>transfer opportunities. <BR>

<P>      RESTRUCTURE NASA MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA program management should be aggressively overhauled.  This<BR>

<P>recommendation outlines a number of steps the agency should take,<BR>

<P>both in overall management and in the management of the space station<BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  NASA should aggressively complete its overhaul of the space<BR>

<P>station program management, reducing the number of total contractor<BR>

<P>and civil service staff by approximately 30 percent and reducing the<BR>

<P>number of government employees working on the space station program<BR>

<P>to approximately 1,000 (a reduction of 1,300 employees over the<BR>

<P>current program). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  NASA should implement the management principles developed for the<BR>

<P>redesigned space station program across the agency in all areas of<BR>

<P>program and institutional management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NASA should aggressively reposition its staff to meet the<BR>

<P>agency's new challenges. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  NASA should restructure its internal management processes for<BR>

<P>program formulation and implementation by formally instituting its<BR>

<P>Program Management Council to be chaired by the deputy administrator. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  NASA should work aggressively with its interagency counterparts<BR>

<P>to complete a summary report to the administration, by June 1994,<BR>

<P>identifying federal aerospace facility shortfalls, new facility<BR>

<P>requirements, consolidation opportunities, and recommendations for<BR>

<P>closing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Many of the specific actions recommended by<BR>

<P>NPR--such as efforts to better focus NASA's work, clearly assign<BR>

<P>accountability for that work, improve the efficiency of NASA's<BR>

<P>operations, and better control the management of major programs and<BR>

<P>projects--are clearly intended to improve NASA's performance.  There<BR>

<P>are, however, also actions that generally or specifically call for<BR>

<P>reductions in both NASA and contractor personnel.  For several years,<BR>

<P>we have expressed concern about NASA's ability to adequately oversee<BR>

<P>its contractors' technical and business operations.  Whether NASA can<BR>

<P>achieve the level of operating economies and efficiencies it will<BR>

<P>need to enable the agency to recapture control while simultaneously<BR>

<P>reducing its size remains to be seen. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NASA has completed the new program management<BR>

<P>structure for the space station.  This involved consolidating the<BR>

<P>work formerly performed at four NASA sites under four different<BR>

<P>contracts into one contract at one location--Johnson Space Center. <BR>

<P>NASA cut its workforce in half and eliminated an entire layer of<BR>

<P>management.  Through reassignments and the use of job fairs at<BR>

<P>headquarters and some centers, the reorganization was accomplished<BR>

<P>with minor adverse effect on the workforce, according to NASA<BR>

<P>officials. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA is implementing a series of actions in response to the second<BR>

<P>action item.  For example, NASA has developed and is implementing a<BR>

<P>new support service contract policy.  A review panel is enforcing the<BR>

<P>new policy and identifying service contracts to be eliminated. <BR>

<P>Through June 1994, the panel reviewed over 60 service contracts at<BR>

<P>headquarters and determined that approximately 50 percent can be<BR>

<P>phased out.  Similar reviews are to be performed at other NASA<BR>

<P>locations.  Also, NASA is currently developing an organizational<BR>

<P>handbook that will reduce the volume of internal regulations by half<BR>

<P>and institute a new policy that, among other things, stresses fewer<BR>

<P>management layers and establishes clear lines of authority and<BR>

<P>responsibility. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Relating to both the second and the third action items, NASA has<BR>

<P>determined that significant reductions in headquarters staff,<BR>

<P>supervisory positions, and administrative functional specialists<BR>

<P>positions can be made, and the agency is making progress on<BR>

<P>downsizing its workforce by at least 13 percent, or about 3,200<BR>

<P>full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, between fiscal years 1992 and<BR>

<P>1999.  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 allowed NASA<BR>

<P>to offer voluntary separation incentives to its employees.  The<BR>

<P>incentives enabled NASA to reduce its workforce by over 1,200 FTEs<BR>

<P>and to achieve its fiscal year 1995 target employment level of just<BR>

<P>over 23,000 a year earlier than planned.  The remaining 1,200 to<BR>

<P>1,300 FTE reduction for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 will be<BR>

<P>achieved through attrition and by limiting new hires. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NASA also conducted a roles and missions review at headquarters to<BR>

<P>determine appropriate staffing levels for each organizational entity<BR>

<P>and to identify fragmentation or duplication of work.  Similar<BR>

<P>reviews will be done at each field center. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Regarding the fourth action item, NASA established the Program<BR>

<P>Management Council to oversee the planning, implementation, and<BR>

<P>management of all major programs or projects.  The Council is<BR>

<P>specifically responsible for ensuring the programs' and projects'<BR>

<P>appropriateness, reasonableness, readiness, and affordability when<BR>

<P>they are started and for performing a variety of progress reviews<BR>

<P>throughout their lives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Lastly, NASA and the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, and<BR>

<P>Transportation issued a summary report in April 1994 identifying<BR>

<P>federal aerospace facility shortfalls, new requirements,<BR>

<P>consolidation opportunities, and recommendations for closing. <BR>

<P>      PLANET EARTH PROGRAM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation suggests a number of steps needed to improve the<BR>

<P>management and performance of the Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE)<BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  NASA should use innovative management and streamlined procurement<BR>

<P>mechanisms to ensure that MTPE development costs are contained within<BR>

<P>existing estimates and that life-cycle costs are minimized. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  NASA should ensure that the development of MTPE is consistent<BR>

<P>with high-priority national and international science objectives<BR>

<P>relating to global change research. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NASA should give emphasis to policymakers in the implementation<BR>

<P>of MTPE. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  NASA should employ innovative development approaches to the Earth<BR>

<P>Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) program which<BR>

<P>emphasize evolutionary growth, technology infusion, and direct<BR>

<P>customer participation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  NASA should encourage the educational benefits of the EOSDIS. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  NASA should assist in ongoing efforts to converge U.S. <BR>

<P>operational weather satellites, given the benefits of streamlining<BR>

<P>the collection of weather data across the government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  The specific actions intended under this recommendation are<BR>

<P>principally focused on achieving the overall program's science<BR>

<P>objectives and meeting user requirements within cost parameters.  The<BR>

<P>Earth Observing System (EOS) is the most critical component of the<BR>

<P>Mission to Planet Earth.  Our work addressing the EOS structure and<BR>

<P>database development activities indicate the need for these types of<BR>

<P>actions to help ensure the operational effectiveness of the data<BR>

<P>collection and dissemination effort. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 16:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NASA's new Program Management Council will<BR>

<P>help the agency comply with the first action item.  The Council<BR>

<P>reviews, approves, and oversees the MTPE program, including its cost<BR>

<P>control.  NASA responded to the second action item by coordinating<BR>

<P>with the U.S.  Global Change Research Program officials and the<BR>

<P>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to ensure that the<BR>

<P>development of the MTPE program is consistent with national and<BR>

<P>international science objectives relating to global change research. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On the third action item, NASA issued a cooperative agreement notice<BR>

<P>in January 1994 soliciting state-level participation in MTPE data<BR>

<P>applications.  NASA has also made historic data sets related to EOS<BR>

<P>available to interested science and educational community users at<BR>

<P>several of NASA's eight distributed active archive centers and<BR>

<P>coordinated with the intelligence community to make certain<BR>

<P>nontraditional data sets available.  To date, NASA reports strong<BR>

<P>interest in the data.  NASA also encourages the educational benefits<BR>

<P>of EOSDIS by making data available at its archive centers, thus<BR>

<P>addressing the fifth action item. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On the fourth action item, NASA officials indicated that they are<BR>

<P>employing a variety of innovative development approaches for EOSDIS,<BR>

<P>including an open-system concept that is independent of any specific<BR>

<P>vendor and permits upgrading of components, thus enabling advanced<BR>

<P>technology integration. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Lastly, NASA is a member of a multiagency team studying the<BR>

<P>convergence of all U.S.  polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. <BR>

<P>Under the convergence implementation plan developed by the team, an<BR>

<P>integrated program office would be responsible for acquiring,<BR>

<P>operating, and managing the converged system.  The program office<BR>

<P>would prepare a single budget, but funding would actually be<BR>

<P>requested separately by each agency from several different<BR>

<P>authorizations and appropriations committees.  The team is currently<BR>

<P>drafting an integrated requirements document to satisfy the needs of<BR>

<P>each agency. <BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 17:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Action has been taken to implement each of NPR's three<BR>

<P>recommendations.  The recommendation to strengthen the coordination<BR>

<P>of science policy has been fully implemented through the<BR>

<P>establishment of the new National Science and Technology Council<BR>

<P>(NSF01).  The recommendation to continue automating NSF's research<BR>

<P>support functions has been partially implemented; this effort was<BR>

<P>initiated in 1994 and is scheduled for completion by the end of<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1996 (NSF03).  Finally, the recommendation to use the<BR>

<P>Federal Demonstration Project to increase research productivity has<BR>

<P>not been implemented, but a draft plan for implementation is under<BR>

<P>review (NSF02). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      NSF01:  STRENGTHEN<BR>

<P>      COORDINATION OF SCIENCE<BR>

<P>      POLICY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends modifying the current structure of the Federal<BR>

<P>Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology<BR>

<P>(FCCSET) to strengthen its role in science policy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Modify the current FCCSET structure and reconstitute the<BR>

<P>organization as the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to<BR>

<P>coordinate the development and implementation of science and<BR>

<P>technology policy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The proposed policy council should be created immediately by<BR>

<P>presidential directive. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not done any work focused<BR>

<P>specifically on this issue, FCCSET has been generally viewed as<BR>

<P>lacking the authority and clout to play a significant role in<BR>

<P>directing science policy and in establishing priorities for science<BR>

<P>and technology within the federal government.  With the growing link<BR>

<P>this administration envisions between initiatives in science and<BR>

<P>technology and the nation's economic well-being, a stronger process<BR>

<P>for formulating policy and setting priorities seems vital.  In<BR>

<P>addition, we have reported on the need for better coordination of<BR>

<P>research activities among federal agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  The issuance of two executive orders--the<BR>

<P>Establishment of the National Science and Technology Council (E.O. <BR>

<P>12881) and the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and<BR>

<P>Technology (E.O.  12882)--on November 23, 1993, fully implemented<BR>

<P>both of the NPR's action items under this recommendation. <BR>

<P>      PRODUCTIVITY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends using a demonstration project structured between<BR>

<P>several universities and five federal agencies as a model for a<BR>

<P>program to reduce administrative overhead on research grants. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Federal Demonstration Project, in cooperation with OMB, should<BR>

<P>define a systematic means to select participants and to introduce<BR>

<P>those procedures that are shown to be effective into federal<BR>

<P>regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support any effort to reduce unnecessary overhead costs. <BR>

<P>We have issued a number of reports on this issue.  More specifically,<BR>

<P>regarding federally funded research at universities, we recommended<BR>

<P>in an August 1992 report entitled Federal Research:  System for<BR>

<P>Reimbursing Universities' Indirect Costs Should Be Reevaluated that<BR>

<P>OMB consider involving a cross section of the university community in<BR>

<P>the work of the task force it formed to evaluate alternative methods<BR>

<P>for reimbursing universities for overhead costs related to federally<BR>

<P>sponsored research. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  A subgroup of the Federal<BR>

<P>Demonstration Project's (FDP) steering committee has developed a<BR>

<P>draft implementation plan for this NPR recommendation.  Entitled &quot;The<BR>

<P>Federal Demonstration Project:  A Proposal for Implementing<BR>

<P>Recommendations of the NPR,&quot; the plan was developed in consultation<BR>

<P>with the Chair, Interagency Assessment Committee, and with OMB.  In<BR>

<P>July 1994, it was conveyed to OMB for review and is awaiting OMB's<BR>

<P>approval.  This plan, which builds on previous FDP initiatives, would<BR>

<P>implement the NPR proposal to formalize a process and criteria for<BR>

<P>(1) selecting institutions to participate in the FDP and (2)<BR>

<P>introducing procedures that are shown to be effective into federal<BR>

<P>regulations.  The plan establishes the terms and conditions for the<BR>

<P>administration of federal research grant awards to the institutions<BR>

<P>participating in the FDP. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  NSF should continue its efforts to implement advanced information<BR>

<P>technology in the proposal submission, review, award, and information<BR>

<P>dissemination process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  A formal means for NSF to share developments with other research<BR>

<P>agencies should be defined. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NSF should be able to compete for funds to accelerate automation<BR>

<P>of grants processing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  While we have not examined the status of automation<BR>

<P>at NSF, we generally support efforts to use advanced information<BR>

<P>technologies effectively in carrying out agencies' missions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 17:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  NSF has initiated Project Fastlane to<BR>

<P>implement advanced information technology.  This project involves<BR>

<P>placing about 20 basic processes for managing proposals and other<BR>

<P>interactions with the research community in an information technology<BR>

<P>repository.  Other agencies--including the Department of Defense, the<BR>

<P>Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and the<BR>

<P>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)--are working<BR>

<P>with NSF on this initiative.  As the lead agency, NSF has developed a<BR>

<P>detailed plan to implement this new technology.  Contracts to develop<BR>

<P>6 of the 20 basic processes in Project Fastlane were signed in August<BR>

<P>1994; the other 14 projects will be implemented in fiscal years 1995<BR>

<P>and 1996 (action item 1).  As a step toward defining a formal means<BR>

<P>for NSF to share developments with other research agencies, NSF has<BR>

<P>selected a manager and is developing an approach.  NSF has also<BR>

<P>recommendation that it should be able to compete for funds to<BR>

<P>accelerate the automation of grants processing because it believes<BR>

<P>that the recommendation requires the creation of a governmentwide<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 38:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM has completed a number of actions and has others under way to<BR>

<P>implement the NPR recommendations calling for OPM to change its role<BR>

<P>and functions in order to become a more effective leader of federal<BR>

<P>human resource management.  Consistent with the recommendations, OPM<BR>

<P>announced that it has changed its role from that of a watchdog over<BR>

<P>other agencies to that of a consultant, with a strong focus on<BR>

<P>customer service.  It is developing a plan for redesigning and<BR>

<P>restructuring the agency.  Through a program of separation<BR>

<P>incentives, early retirements, and involuntary separations, OPM has<BR>

<P>already reduced its employment level by nearly 20 percent.  It has<BR>

<P>delegated some operational work to the agencies, but believes<BR>

<P>delegation of many of its functions can be accomplished only through<BR>

<P>the legislative process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM has developed a &quot;good government framework&quot; under which agencies<BR>

<P>themselves will be responsible for ensuring that their human resource<BR>

<P>management practices and monitoring systems are consistent with merit<BR>

<P>principles.  While OPM says it plans to monitor agencies' internal<BR>

<P>accountability practices, the manner in which this will be done and<BR>

<P>how effective it will be are unknown. <BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      OPM01:  STRENGTHEN THE<BR>

<P>      OFFICE OF PERSONNEL<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT'S (OPM)<BR>

<P>      LEADERSHIP ROLE IN<BR>

<P>      TRANSFORMING FEDERAL HUMAN<BR>

<P>      RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Clearly define OPM's policy, service, and leadership role in<BR>

<P>addressing human resource problems and delegate operational work to<BR>

<P>the agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Clearly define and publicize OPM's policy, service, and<BR>

<P>leadership role in addressing critical human resource problems and<BR>

<P>transforming human resource administrative systems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Delegate operational work to the agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Supplement agency accountability for policy and program<BR>

<P>implementation with a reinvented program of oversight and assessment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our reports show the need for greater OPM<BR>

<P>leadership on federal human resource issues.  While we agree that<BR>

<P>operational matters should be delegated to the agencies when<BR>

<P>appropriate, we have found that many agencies' personnel management<BR>

<P>evaluation programs are not sufficient to ensure that their personnel<BR>

<P>programs operate effectively and in compliance with merit system<BR>

<P>principles.  OPM needs to exert greater leadership in strengthening<BR>

<P>agency evaluation programs if they are to be relied upon to oversee<BR>

<P>agency accountability for program management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OPM issued a &quot;Mission, Vision, and<BR>

<P>Values&quot; statement in January 1994 outlining its new direction for<BR>

<P>federal human resource management.  OPM characterized the statement<BR>

<P>as establishing OPM as the leading choice on all human resource<BR>

<P>management systems in the federal government.  OPM said its role has<BR>

<P>changed from that of a watchdog over other agencies to that of a<BR>

<P>consultant, with a strong focus on customer service.  While<BR>

<P>addressing the first action item, we do not believe this statement<BR>

<P>defines OPM's complete role in federal human resource management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In December 1993, OPM delegated to agencies the responsibility for<BR>

<P>deciding who is entitled to coverage under the special retirement<BR>

<P>provisions for law enforcement officers and firefighters under the<BR>

<P>Civil Service Retirement System.  In May 1994, OPM discontinued its<BR>

<P>central registers for entry-level professional and administrative<BR>

<P>positions; agencies, with OPM assistance, now rate and rank<BR>

<P>candidates for their own vacancies in those positions.  OPM could<BR>

<P>cite no other operational work it has delegated to the agencies since<BR>

<P>the NPR report was issued.  It believes delegation of many of OPM's<BR>

<P>functions can be accomplished only through the legislative process. <BR>

<P>However, no such legislation has been introduced. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In June 1994, OPM introduced a new &quot;Good Government Framework For<BR>

<P>Merit System Accountability&quot; that it said is intended to help<BR>

<P>agencies ensure that their human resource management accountability<BR>

<P>and monitoring systems are consistent with merit system principles. <BR>

<P>According to OPM, the framework provides agencies the flexibility to<BR>

<P>use any means they see fit to ensure effective accountability,<BR>

<P>including internal controls, systems assessments, and inspector<BR>

<P>general reviews.  OPM is continuing to consult with agencies on the<BR>

<P>oversight issue, and is focusing on developing new measures of<BR>

<P>accountability.  OPM said it will monitor agency success in using the<BR>

<P>framework to improve internal accountability. <BR>

<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Neither the NPR report nor the<BR>

<P>accompanying report gave a clear indication of the kind of<BR>

<P>restructuring and rightsizing this recommendation envisions.  Thus,<BR>

<P>we cannot evaluate the recommendation.  However, on the basis of a<BR>

<P>long history of GAO work, we agree that this issue needs attention;<BR>

<P>OPM needs to work with the agencies in preparing the government to<BR>

<P>meet future challenges, attack performance improvement issues with<BR>

<P>more vigor, and ensure more effective oversight of the government's<BR>

<P>key personnel areas. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OPM formed an Employee Task Force on<BR>

<P>Agency Redesign to develop a plan for redesigning and restructuring<BR>

<P>the agency.  The task force reported its recommendations to the OPM<BR>

<P>Director on September 1, 1994, but as of September 7, 1994, he had<BR>

<P>not acted on them.  OPM plans to reflect its new structure in its<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1996 budget submission.  Until the OPM restructuring is<BR>

<P>in place, no judgment can be made on whether OPM has met this<BR>

<P>recommendation or will be better able to serve its customers' needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM also gave itself early-out retirement authority and authorized<BR>

<P>buyouts for employees GS-13 and above who resigned or retired between<BR>

<P>March 25, 1994, and March 31, 1994.  OPM reduced the number of<BR>

<P>investigators and training personnel it employed by separating 656<BR>

<P>employees through reduction-in-force procedures in fiscal year 1994. <BR>

<P>Overall, since March 1994, OPM's staff has been reduced from 6,943 to<BR>

<P>5,663.  However, the majority of these reductions were not made in<BR>

<P>response to this recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We believe it is reasonable to expect OPM<BR>

<P>to involve all stakeholders in determining how to better serve its<BR>

<P>customers.  However, since we have done no work to identify how this<BR>

<P>could best be accomplished, we cannot comment further on this<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 38:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OPM began labor-management<BR>

<P>partnership training for its staff in the fall of 1993, and has<BR>

<P>signed partnership agreements with its two union locals.  The<BR>

<P>Director initiated sessions with employees and union representatives<BR>

<P>to afford them the opportunity to provide input on the agency's<BR>

<P>operations.  OPM said it developed a 2-day training course entitled<BR>

<P>&quot;Partners in Change&quot; which will be used to share partnership<BR>

<P>experiences and offer assistance to agencies in setting up<BR>

<P>partnership programs.  OPM, unions, and an interagency group worked<BR>

<P>to sunset the Federal Personnel Manual.  In addition, OPM says a<BR>

<P>major marketing effort is under way to inform potential customers<BR>

<P>that OPM is the &quot;One Stop Shop for Human Resources Management.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to OPM, the need to find other positions for employees<BR>

<P>displaced in OPM's downsizing efforts has limited its ability to<BR>

<P>broaden personnel specialists' customer focus through rotational<BR>

<P>assignments.  OPM plans to use negotiated rulemaking to amend its<BR>

<P>training regulations to reflect the changes required by the Federal<BR>

<P>Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Thus, although some action has taken place, it has not been enough to<BR>

<P>complete implementation of this recommendation. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 25<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 25:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>All of the recommendations in this section have been acted upon<BR>

<P>except the recommendation that the President request authority to<BR>

<P>reorganize executive agencies.  The President's Management Council<BR>

<P>(PMC) has fully implemented one recommendation by sponsoring several<BR>

<P>initiatives that cut across individual agencies and departments.  The<BR>

<P>PMC also has taken action on another recommendation by forming a<BR>

<P>working group on field office structure that is compiling a list of<BR>

<P>agency field offices recommended for closure.  The PMC is expected to<BR>

<P>review the closure recommendations and then forward a list of<BR>

<P>recommended closures to Congress. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The two recommendations that address targeting the federal workforce<BR>

<P>downsizing efforts have been partially implemented.  Legislation was<BR>

<P>enacted in March 1994 calling for the executive branch to be reduced<BR>

<P>by 272,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions during fiscal years<BR>

<P>1994 through 1999 and authorizing separation incentive payments of up<BR>

<P>to $25,000 to employees who resign or retire.  While the NPR<BR>

<P>recommended that the number of management control positions be cut by<BR>

<P>half in agency downsizings, the statute did not limit the separation<BR>

<P>incentives to employees in management control positions.  However,<BR>

<P>OMB asked that agencies' plans for complying with the FTE reductions<BR>

<P>include streamlining actions such as doubling the managerial span of<BR>

<P>control, eliminating organizational and oversight layers, and<BR>

<P>reducing unnecessary controls and micromanagement.  The plans are now<BR>

<P>being reviewed by OMB.  Implementation of this NPR recommendation<BR>

<P>depends on the extent to which the plans ultimately approved by OMB<BR>

<P>include elimination of management control positions.  Thus, it is too<BR>

<P>soon to determine whether the costs and the number of positions<BR>

<P>associated with these management functions will be reduced by half by<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1999. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A small amount of progress has been achieved in the use of<BR>

<P>performance agreements to guide downsizing.  Three executive agency<BR>

<P>heads have signed performance agreements that refer to downsizing in<BR>

<P>a way that could serve as guide for agency downsizing, either by<BR>

<P>specifying specific downsizing goals or by committing to comply with<BR>

<P>goals as specified in the President's memorandum on streamlining the<BR>

<P>bureaucracy. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      ORG01:  REDUCE THE COSTS AND<BR>

<P>      NUMBERS OF POSITIONS<BR>

<P>      ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>      CONTROL STRUCTURES BY HALF<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Cut management control positions over the next 5 years.  Reinvest<BR>

<P>some of the savings in benchmarking, training, and investments in new<BR>

<P>technology.  In addition to separation incentives (see HRM14),<BR>

<P>provide outplacement services to affected staff. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Reduce the costs associated with management control structures by one<BR>

<P>half over a 5-year period. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While we do not oppose reductions in<BR>

<P>management control positions where appropriate, we recognize that<BR>

<P>management control systems were put in place to create particular<BR>

<P>desired effects.  As agencies reduce or eliminate these systems, they<BR>

<P>should be able to demonstrate that (1) other mechanisms will take<BR>

<P>their place, (2) the particular effect is no longer needed or<BR>

<P>relevant in the current environment, or (3) the current system is not<BR>

<P>serving a useful purpose.  We agree that some of the savings<BR>

<P>resulting from such cuts should be reinvested in benchmarking,<BR>

<P>training, and investments in new technology.  We also support the use<BR>

<P>of separation incentives to assist in employment reductions, and<BR>

<P>agree the government should provide outplacement services to affected<BR>

<P>employees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of<BR>

<P>1994 reduced authorized full-time-equivalent (FTE) employment levels<BR>

<P>in the executive branch by 272,900 during fiscal years 1994 through<BR>

<P>1999, and authorized separation incentive payments of up to $25,000<BR>

<P>to employees who resign or retire.  The legislation did not limit<BR>

<P>payment of separation incentives to employees in management control<BR>

<P>positions but allowed payments to any employee separating from any<BR>

<P>position in any location. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A presidential memorandum of September 11, 1993, directed agencies to<BR>

<P>submit streamlining plans by December 1, 1993.  On April 21, 1994,<BR>

<P>OMB asked agencies to submit updated plans, by June 30, 1994,<BR>

<P>describing how they would meet FTE employment levels specified by<BR>

<P>OMB.  Among the streamlining actions suggested by OMB were doubling<BR>

<P>the managerial span of control, eliminating organizational and<BR>

<P>oversight layers, and reducing unnecessary controls and<BR>

<P>micromanagement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to OMB, all agencies submitted updated plans, and further<BR>

<P>plan updates were required to be submitted by September 30, 1994. <BR>

<P>These plans are being reviewed by OMB.  An OMB official stressed<BR>

<P>that, while the reduction of management control positions is an<BR>

<P>important element OMB expects to see in agency streamlining plans, it<BR>

<P>is only one of many factors OMB takes into account in determining and<BR>

<P>revising agency FTE allocations.  He said decisions on individual<BR>

<P>agency restructuring and workforce size are subject to continuing<BR>

<P>revision as presidential priorities, agency appropriations, and world<BR>

<P>events dictate.  Of overriding importance to OMB is the<BR>

<P>governmentwide employment reduction requirement imposed by the<BR>

<P>Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994.  The official added that<BR>

<P>the agencies' plans must demonstrate how mission requirements will be<BR>

<P>met in the restructured and streamlined organizations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Until agency streamlining plans are finalized and implemented, it is<BR>

<P>unknown to what extent the NPR's objective of reducing management<BR>

<P>control structures might be achieved.  OMB is targeting completion of<BR>

<P>its review of agency plans and allocation of FTEs by agency in time<BR>

<P>to use in preparing the fiscal year 1996 budget proposal. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Performance agreements with agency heads (see NPR recommendation<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the implicit intent of this<BR>

<P>recommendation to ensure that downsizing is carried out with regard<BR>

<P>for the management context and particular necessities of individual<BR>

<P>agencies.  Developing performance agreements that address such goals<BR>

<P>as downsizing, reengineering, and other priorities can help focus<BR>

<P>efforts in each agency.  However, it remains to be seen how effective<BR>

<P>such performance agreements will be in providing that focus.  Other<BR>

<P>mechanisms, such as agency strategic plans, could also be used to<BR>

<P>focus action on these priority efforts, including tailoring the<BR>

<P>downsizing to individual agency needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Eight of the 24 executive department and<BR>

<P>agency heads have signed performance agreements with the President,<BR>

<P>and other agreements are in the process of being drafted.  Only three<BR>

<P>of eight signed agreements, however, refer to downsizing in a way<BR>

<P>that can serve as a guide for agency downsizing efforts.  One of the<BR>

<P>three agreements (the Secretary of the Department of<BR>

<P>Transportation's) mentions specific downsizing goals that could be<BR>

<P>used as a guide.  Two of the three agreements (Secretaries of the<BR>

<P>Departments of Labor's and Housing and Urban Development's) refer to<BR>

<P>complying with the President's September 11, 1993, memorandum on<BR>

<P>streamlining the bureaucracy.  The memorandum requires streamlining<BR>

<P>plans to (1) address how agencies will reduce the ratio of managers<BR>

<P>and supervisors to other personnel; (2) be characterized by<BR>

<P>delegations of authority, decentralization, empowerment, and<BR>

<P>accountability; (3) address ways to reduce &quot;red tape&quot;; and (4) seek<BR>

<P>to realize cost savings.  Also, several of the agreements address the<BR>

<P>issues of reengineering, partnering across established boundaries,<BR>

<P>and empowering work teams. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally support a review of civilian agencies'<BR>

<P>field offices to determine which offices might be closed or<BR>

<P>consolidated with other offices to achieve economy and efficiency. <BR>

<P>The accompanying report indicates that the restructuring is required<BR>

<P>because the current field office structure does not reflect changes<BR>

<P>in government services required.  Our work at the Departments of<BR>

<P>Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development supports this view but<BR>

<P>to address problems or objectives that cut across departments should<BR>

<P>be a useful mechanism to obtain multi-agency agreement on difficult<BR>

<P>issues.  This would be especially desirable in those areas where<BR>

<P>interagency cooperation has proven difficult in the past. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  The PMC has sponsored several ongoing initiatives<BR>

<P>to examine issues and take actions that cut across individual<BR>

<P>departments or agencies.  According to an OMB official, these include<BR>

<P>electronic commerce, civil service reform, streamlining the<BR>

<P>government, and field office restructuring.  The PMC also helped in<BR>

<P>the passage of the buy-out legislation affecting most executive<BR>

<P>departments. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As cross-organizational collaborations become an integral part of<BR>

<P>government operations, barriers to ready collaboration and funding<BR>

<P>should be removed. <BR>

<P>cross-organizational cooperation and develop legislative proposals to<BR>

<P>eliminate them. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree that legislative barriers should<BR>

<P>be removed whenever appropriate to facilitate cross-organizational<BR>

<P>cooperation.  However, elimination of some of the specific statutes<BR>

<P>NPR cited in their accompanying report could have consequences other<BR>

<P>than the elimination of barriers to cooperation.  For example, a<BR>

<P>long-standing restriction contained in the Treasury, Postal Service,<BR>

<P>and General Government Appropriations Acts (the &quot;anti-pass-the-hat&quot;<BR>

<P>provisions) prevents interagency financing of boards, commissions,<BR>

<P>councils, or other similar groups without specific statutory<BR>

<P>approval.  Removal of this type of prohibition would significantly<BR>

<P>alter Congress' ability to control the use of appropriated funds. <BR>

<P>Before removing statutory barriers to cross-organizational<BR>

<P>cooperation, the intended purposes of the restrictions should be<BR>

<P>considered to determine if the negative consequences of removing them<BR>

<P>would outweigh the benefits that would be achieved.  Also, it is<BR>

<P>unclear why the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, which was<BR>

<P>intended to improve federal-state-local government cooperation, was<BR>

<P>viewed by NPR in the accompanying report as a barrier to<BR>

<P>cross-organizational cooperation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 25:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In its accompanying report, NPR<BR>

<P>identified four provisions that it believed inhibit<BR>

<P>interorganizational cooperation and customer focus.  In the fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1995 budget, the President proposed the removal of one of these<BR>

<P>provisions (in the annual Treasury, Postal Service, and General<BR>

<P>Government Appropriations Act) that prohibits the funding of<BR>

<P>interagency organizations without congressional action.  However,<BR>

<P>this provision was included in the fiscal year 1995 Treasury/Postal<BR>

<P>appropriation bill as passed by Congress and signed by the President<BR>

<P>on September 30, 1994.  No bills have been introduced to change the<BR>

<P>other provisions NPR identified as barriers to interorganizational<BR>

<P>cooperation and we are not aware of any other actions taken to change<BR>

<P>them. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 18<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Actions have been taken on all of the NPR recommendations on SBA,<BR>

<P>which should make SBA's programs significantly more responsive to the<BR>

<P>needs of small business.  Although none of these recommendations has<BR>

<P>been fully implemented, three have been partially implemented, and<BR>

<P>varying degrees of action have been taken on the remaining five. <BR>

<P>Through several initiatives, SBA has partially implemented the<BR>

<P>recommendation that it reinvent its credit programs.  SBA's new Low<BR>

<P>Documentation Loan Program simplifies the application process for<BR>

<P>loans under $100,000, and the GreenLine Program guarantees revolving<BR>

<P>lines of credit extended to small businesses (SBA03).  Public Law<BR>

<P>103-403, signed on October 22, 1994, authorized a pilot program that<BR>

<P>allows SBA to guarantee loans to nonprofit intermediaries that will,<BR>

<P>in turn, make small loans to small businesses (SBA05).  To improve<BR>

<P>service and efficiency, SBA is also transferring staff from its<BR>

<P>headquarters and regional offices to its district offices, as<BR>

<P>recommended by NPR (SBA07). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Significant activity has occurred in response to two other<BR>

<P>recommendations.  Proposed legislation that would allow judicial<BR>

<P>review of agencies' compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act,<BR>

<P>if enacted, is expected to reduce the regulatory burden on small<BR>

<P>business (SBA01).  Actions taken by the Department of the Treasury's<BR>

<P>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have relaxed some of the<BR>

<P>federal guidelines for lending to small businesses (SBA04). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Progress in other areas has been slower.  SBA has proposed a new<BR>

<P>minority enterprise development program to improve its service to<BR>

<P>minority-owned small businesses, but legislation for implementing the<BR>

<P>program has not yet been introduced (SBA02).  Although SBA developed<BR>

<P>a proposal to charge fees for services provided by its Small Business<BR>

<P>Development Centers, as NPR recommended, Congress enacted legislation<BR>

<P>prohibiting such charges (SBA06).  Efforts to obtain better data on<BR>

<P>small businesses have been limited to meetings between SBA officials<BR>

<P>and officials from the Office of Management and Budget and the<BR>

<P>Council of Economic Advisers (SBA08). <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      SBA01:  ALLOW JUDICIAL<BR>

<P>      REVIEW OF THE REGULATORY<BR>

<P>      FLEXIBILITY ACT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Allow access to the courts when federal agencies develop rules that<BR>

<P>fail to properly examine alternatives that will lessen the burden on<BR>

<P>small businesses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 should be amended to<BR>

<P>allow for judicial review of agency determinations under the RFA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  An executive order should be issued requiring the SBA Office of<BR>

<P>Advocacy to issue governmentwide guidance on appropriate processes<BR>

<P>for complying with the analytical requirements of RFA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have not examined whether judicial<BR>

<P>review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act would or would not improve<BR>

<P>agencies' compliance with the act.  However, other means may be<BR>

<P>available to improve compliance.  In April 1994, we reported on<BR>

<P>federal agencies' implementation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <BR>

<P>Although this report did not examine the implications of implementing<BR>

<P>judicial review, it did identify significant variation in federal<BR>

<P>agencies' compliance with the act.  To improve compliance, we<BR>

<P>suggested that Congress consider amending the act to give SBA clearer<BR>

<P>authority to interpret the act's provisions and require SBA to<BR>

<P>develop criteria on how federal agencies should conduct analyses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  H.R 820, the National Competitiveness<BR>

<P>Act of 1994 (as passed by the Senate on Mar.  16, 1994), and H.R. <BR>

<P>830, the Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1993, provide for<BR>

<P>the judicial review of agencies' determinations under the RFA (action<BR>

<P>item 1).  SBA believes an executive order providing RFA guidance<BR>

<P>(action item 2) would be premature because no guidance can be<BR>

<P>properly issued until the underlying legislative issues have been<BR>

<P>addressed. <BR>

<P>      SBA02:  IMPROVE ASSISTANCE<BR>

<P>      TO MINORITY SMALL BUSINESSES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This proposal recommends a complete review of all federal minority<BR>

<P>business assistance programs and the establishment of a Small<BR>

<P>Disadvantaged Business Set-Aside program for civilian agencies to<BR>

<P>provide increased opportunities for minority small business. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  By December 1, 1994, the Administrator of SBA and the Secretary<BR>

<P>of Commerce, on completion of their review of federal minority<BR>

<P>business assistance programs, should recommend improvements in<BR>

<P>federal assistance to minority small businesses to the President. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The SBA Administrator should streamline the 8(a) application<BR>

<P>process to reduce the amount of time involved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Small Business Act should be amended to allow the Associate<BR>

<P>Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership<BR>

<P>Development to delegate authority for final determinations of Section<BR>

<P>8(a) program eligibility. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Small Business Act should be amended to allow SBA to delegate<BR>

<P>contract award functions to federal procuring agencies, so long as<BR>

<P>they consistently abide by federal acquisition and SBA 8(a) program<BR>

<P>regulations, and to provide SBA with the authority to conduct reviews<BR>

<P>to verify compliance with 8(a) program regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The Small Business Act should be amended to require federal<BR>

<P>procuring agencies to use their existing authority to provide advance<BR>

<P>payments on 8(a) contracts, when such funding is necessary to<BR>

<P>contract performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  The Small Business Act should be amended to provide civilian<BR>

<P>agencies the same authority that DOD currently has for its own &quot;Small<BR>

<P>Disadvantaged Business Set-Aside&quot; program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our work on SBA's minority business development<BR>

<P>program has shown a need to review the effectiveness of federal<BR>

<P>minority assistance programs.  However, if a governmentwide set-aside<BR>

<P>program is established for small disadvantaged businesses, action<BR>

<P>should be taken to ensure that the program does not decrease the<BR>

<P>opportunities available to small businesses in the Section 8(a)<BR>

<P>minority business development program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Although no review has been conducted<BR>

<P>of federal assistance to minority small businesses, SBA has proposed<BR>

<P>a new Minority Enterprise Development (MED) program to replace its<BR>

<P>current Section 8(a) minority development program (action item 1). <BR>

<P>As recommended by the NPR, the proposed MED program will streamline<BR>

<P>the application process to reduce the time required to process<BR>

<P>applications (action item 2), delegate authority for certifying<BR>

<P>programs to SBA district offices (action item 3), remove SBA as the<BR>

<P>prime contractor on program contracts (action item 4), and institute<BR>

<P>a governmentwide program to set aside contracts for small<BR>

<P>disadvantaged firms (action item 6).  Rather than requiring federal<BR>

<P>procuring agencies to advance contract payments to assist firms in<BR>

<P>performing contracts, as recommended by the NPR, the MED program<BR>

<P>proposes to (1) prequalify firms for credit, thereby enabling them<BR>

<P>subsequently to demonstrate their financial capability to perform a<BR>

<P>contract, and (2) guarantee loans made to firms in the program at a<BR>

<P>higher rate than loans made to other businesses (action item 5).  In<BR>

<P>August 1994, SBA presented its MED proposal in testimony before the<BR>

<P>Senate Small Business Committee.  Legislation (S.  2478) passed by<BR>

<P>the Senate on October 7, 1994, would reform SBA's 8(a) minority<BR>

<P>business development program by, among other things, establishing a<BR>

<P>one-stop 8(a) application process, allowing federal agencies to award<BR>

<P>8(a) program contracts directly to 8(a) firms, and instituting a<BR>

<P>governmentwide program to set aside contracts for small disadvantaged<BR>

<P>firms. <BR>

<P>      PROGRAMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Identify ways to improve SBA's credit programs to make SBA more<BR>

<P>responsive to those industries with the potential for creating a<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The SBA Administrator, upon completion of his review of SBA's credit<BR>

<P>programs, should provide a report to the President that outlines<BR>

<P>specific recommendations, including necessary legislative changes, to<BR>

<P>improve, expand, and lower the costs of the SBA credit programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  A reassessment of SBA's credit programs is<BR>

<P>appropriate.  Few changes have been made in SBA's credit programs<BR>

<P>over the last several years even though significant structural<BR>

<P>changes have occurred in the banking industry.  Changes to make SBA's<BR>

<P>credit programs more user-friendly and more accessible, as discussed<BR>

<P>by the NPR, would benefit both small businesses and lenders. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In a February 1994 report to the President,<BR>

<P>the SBA Administrator reported on small businesses' concerns and<BR>

<P>SBA's reaction to these concerns.  Since that time, SBA has taken<BR>

<P>several steps to improve its credit programs.  SBA's Low<BR>

<P>Documentation Loan Program, implemented in June 1994, is designed to<BR>

<P>encourage lenders to guarantee loans of $100,000 or less by requiring<BR>

<P>less paperwork for loan applications (a single loan application, in<BR>

<P>many cases) and allowing a lender to rely on an applicant's character<BR>

<P>rather than on credit factors to approve a loan.  SBA's GreenLine<BR>

<P>Program, implemented in July 1994, provides guarantees of up to 5<BR>

<P>years for lines of credit extended by lenders to small businesses. <BR>

<P>According to SBA, GreenLine is designed for small businesses whose<BR>

<P>capital needs are recurring and cyclical.  SBA's Women's<BR>

<P>Prequalification Pilot Loan Program, under way in 11 cities, is<BR>

<P>designed to streamline the application process for loans of $250,000<BR>

<P>or less to businesses owned by women and to respond quickly to<BR>

<P>nonprofit intermediaries packaging such loans.  SBA's Small Loan<BR>

<P>Express Program, which SBA plans to have operating by the end of<BR>

<P>1994, will allow selected lenders to approve, service, and liquidate<BR>

<P>SBA-guaranteed loans of up to $100,000.  SBA also plans to develop a<BR>

<P>revised application package for section 7(a) small business loans. <BR>

<P>      REQUIREMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The federal government should examine the guidelines bank regulators<BR>

<P>set for small business lending by financial institutions to ensure<BR>

<P>that capital is available without undue barriers while maintaining<BR>

<P>the integrity of the financial institutions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Department of the Treasury, in conjunction with the bank and<BR>

<P>thrift institutions' regulators, should examine guidelines for<BR>

<P>depository institutions to determine whether all small business loans<BR>

<P>made by well-capitalized institutions should be examined solely on<BR>

<P>performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council should<BR>

<P>develop an objective economic indicator of lending to small business. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the need to examine federal guidelines<BR>

<P>for small business lending requirements in order to make capital<BR>

<P>available to small businesses.  We have recommended changes in<BR>

<P>collateral requirements and in supervisory procedures that could<BR>

<P>facilitate traditional small business lending without compromising<BR>

<P>the safety and soundness of banks. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  A 1993 directive from the Department<BR>

<P>of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)<BR>

<P>provided that, for highly rated and adequately capitalized<BR>

<P>institutions, a portion of the loans to small and medium-sized<BR>

<P>businesses would be evaluated solely on performance.  In July 1994,<BR>

<P>OCC also issued streamlined examination procedures that place greater<BR>

<P>emphasis on performance for community banks (action item 1). <BR>

<P>According to OCC, regulatory agencies have decided to defer action on<BR>

<P>collecting data on lending to small businesses until a revised<BR>

<P>Community Reinvestment Act regulation is adopted (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>Allowing SBA to guarantee loans made by banks to nonprofit<BR>

<P>intermediaries, which could, in turn, make small loans to low-income<BR>

<P>individuals, women, minorities, and other small businesses unable to<BR>

<P>obtain credit through traditional lending sources, would increase<BR>

<P>private sector participation and lessen administrative burdens linked<BR>

<P>to direct government lending. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Subsection (m), section 7 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  636,<BR>

<P>should be amended to allow SBA to provide a 100-percent guarantee on<BR>

<P>loans made by approved lenders to intermediaries selected by SBA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Disagree.  We disagree with NPR's proposal to provide a 100-percent<BR>

<P>guarantee for loans made by banks to nonprofit intermediaries.  The<BR>

<P>microloan program is currently a direct loan program:  SBA lends<BR>

<P>funds directly to the nonprofit intermediaries.  Shifting to a<BR>

<P>guarantee program would add complexity to the program by introducing<BR>

<P>an additional party--banks--to the transaction without requiring that<BR>

<P>party to contribute substantively to the program.  Furthermore,<BR>

<P>shifting to a guarantee program would not significantly reduce SBA's<BR>

<P>administrative responsibilities.  In addition to lending funds to<BR>

<P>these nonprofit intermediaries, SBA provides grants to support<BR>

<P>technical assistance activities.  Hence, SBA will need to continue<BR>

<P>monitoring and overseeing the program's activities, making any<BR>

<P>substantial decrease in SBA's administrative responsibilities<BR>

<P>unlikely. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Small Business Administration<BR>

<P>Reauthorization and Amendment Act of 1994 (P.L.  103-403), signed on<BR>

<P>October 22, 1994, authorizes SBA, during fiscal years 1995 through<BR>

<P>1997, to establish a pilot program under which SBA can guarantee<BR>

<P>loans made by private lenders for up to 20 intermediaries in the<BR>

<P>program.  Loans guaranteed by SBA under the pilot program can have a<BR>

<P>term of 10 years and a guarantee rate of not less than 90 percent and<BR>

<P>not more than 100 percent. <BR>

<P>SBDC counseling services in the amount of $15 per hour. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Although establishing user fees for Small<BR>

<P>Business Development Centers' (SBDC) services might reduce federal<BR>

<P>outlays, we have not examined what impact charging clients would have<BR>

<P>on program participation and program effectiveness.  Currently, SBDCs<BR>

<P>provide a variety of business-related services to their clients.  The<BR>

<P>centers receive financial assistance from SBA in the form of annual<BR>

<P>grants, but to be eligible for a grant, the centers must provide an<BR>

<P>equal, matching amount of funds from nonfederal sources.  However,<BR>

<P>most SBDCs put major emphasis on counseling, which is provided at no<BR>

<P>cost.  Our past work has determined that most clients are satisfied<BR>

<P>with the counseling services they receive. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Although SBA took action to implement<BR>

<P>this recommendation, legislation was enacted prohibiting the<BR>

<P>recommended action.  Specifically, SBA included in its fiscal year<BR>

<P>1995 budget request a provision authorizing SBDCs to charge a<BR>

<P>$15-per-hour fee for counseling services.  This provision was<BR>

<P>rejected by the House Committee on Appropriations, which inserted<BR>

<P>language into the fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill prohibiting<BR>

<P>SBA from charging user fees for SBDC services.  This bill was signed<BR>

<P>into law on August 26, 1994 (P.L.  103-317). <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 18:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support allocating resources to where they can do the most<BR>

<P>good.  Reallocating SBA personnel to the district offices would<BR>

<P>improve the effectiveness of SBA's program delivery by putting more<BR>

<P>resources where the small businesses are located. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This approach would also reduce the workload of the overburdened<BR>

<P>relocate to the district offices with the greatest need for staff, as<BR>

<P>defined on the basis of workload.  SBA expects its restructuring of<BR>

<P>regional offices to be completed soon.  Through this restructuring,<BR>

<P>Agree.  Improving the federal government's data on small businesses<BR>

<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The State Department and the U.S.  Information Agency (USIA) have<BR>

<P>begun to adjust to a post-Cold War environment and to budgetary<BR>

<P>constraints.  Both agencies are exploring ways to cut costs and are<BR>

<P>making some management improvements.  Most of these changes were<BR>

<P>under way before the NPR report but the report added impetus to these<BR>

<P>efforts.  Progress toward implementing the NPR recommendations is<BR>

<P>slow in those instances requiring legislation and interagency<BR>

<P>coordination.  For example, the NPR recommends expanding the<BR>

<P>authority of Chiefs of Missions (COM) overseas as a cost reduction<BR>

<P>measure.  Required legislation has not been introduced and some<BR>

<P>affected agencies, such as USIA, do not agree with this<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State has made progress implementing recommendations on the promotion<BR>

<P>of U.S.  business overseas and improving the collection of<BR>

<P>receivables.  State faces a major challenge implementing<BR>

<P>recommendations on improving its financial and information management<BR>

<P>programs, and it will take many years of concerted action to achieve<BR>

<P>substantial improvements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR report included a recommendation to consolidate U.S. <BR>

<P>government international broadcasting operations.  The consolidation<BR>

<P>legislation, proposed before the NPR report, passed on April 30,<BR>

<P>1994.  To implement the legislation, USIA has been working with the<BR>

<P>Board for International Broadcasting to develop a plan for<BR>

<P>consolidating the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio<BR>

<P>Liberty.  Implementing the consolidation will not be easy because<BR>

<P>funding limits will require significant cuts in both staff and<BR>

<P>broadcasts.  In addition, the costs to reduce the size of Radio Free<BR>

<P>Europe/Radio Liberty may exceed the administration's estimates. <BR>

<P>      DOS01:  EXPAND THE AUTHORITY<BR>

<P>      OF CHIEFS OF MISSION<BR>

<P>      OVERSEAS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation proposes a pilot program to expand the management<BR>

<P>authority of Chiefs of Mission overseas in the allocation of fiscal<BR>

<P>and staffing resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The President should issue a directive establishing a pilot<BR>

<P>program to increase the management authority of Chiefs of Mission. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Pilot missions should achieve a 20 percent cumulative reduction<BR>

<P>in overall spending during the span of the project. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Pilot COMs should develop and submit recommendations for<BR>

<P>reapportioning resources within 120 days. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Pilot COMs should encourage the full participation of members of<BR>

<P>the country team in the development of resource reapportionment<BR>

<P>recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Upon completion of the pilot test, the President's original<BR>

<P>directive detailing the test should become the basis for a revised<BR>

<P>NSDD-38. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not yet taken a position on the<BR>

<P>level of authority that should be granted to the Chief of Mission, we<BR>

<P>support the recommendation for a pilot study.  We are currently<BR>

<P>reviewing the size and costs of U.S.  government overseas staffing<BR>

<P>and the processes and mechanisms used to determine staffing needs. <BR>

<P>As part of this work, we are examining the Chief of Mission's role in<BR>

<P>controlling the size and the composition of government staff at U.S. <BR>

<P>embassies and consulates.  We believe that the expanded Chief of<BR>

<P>Mission authority recommended by NPR may help to achieve reductions<BR>

<P>in overall spending at embassies and ensure that resources are<BR>

<P>targeted on priority goals and objectives.  However, there may also<BR>

<P>be some negative consequences.  For example, the Chief of Mission<BR>

<P>could use the expanded authority to discontinue activities that a<BR>

<P>federal agency believes are essential or in a way not intended by<BR>

<P>Congress.  In addition, jurisdictional issues within the executive<BR>

<P>and legislative branches may make it difficult to implement the<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To determine if expanded Chief of Mission authority is feasible and<BR>

<P>can achieve savings without significant negative consequences, we<BR>

<P>believe that conducting a study of the concept would be worthwhile. <BR>

<P>Careful evaluation of the study should be performed before expanded<BR>

<P>authority over all resources and staffing is granted to all Chiefs of<BR>

<P>Mission.  In addition, we believe that missions of varying size<BR>

<P>should be considered as sites for the pilot program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--No Action Taken.  The State Department agrees with<BR>

<P>this recommendation and believes expansion of the Chief of Mission<BR>

<P>authority would promote more efficient use of U.S.  government<BR>

<P>resources allocated for foreign policy objectives.  State is<BR>

<P>exploring how to implement a pilot project to test the expansion of<BR>

<P>the Chief of Mission authority but is awaiting White House action<BR>

<P>before proceeding further.  State believes that initiation and<BR>

<P>successful implementation of the project will depend on strong<BR>

<P>support and commitment from the President and the Vice President and<BR>

<P>that legislative action is needed before proceeding to implement a<BR>

<P>pilot program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President has not issued a directive to establish the pilot<BR>

<P>program proposed by the NPR.  State has not proposed legislative<BR>

<P>action because it believes the pilot program should be viewed as an<BR>

<P>administration initiative in order to gain the interagency support<BR>

<P>such a project would require.  The U.S.  Information Agency (USIA)<BR>

<P>expressed concern that implementing this recommendation would impinge<BR>

<P>upon its legislative mandate.  State recognizes that other agencies<BR>

<P>may also object to expanding the authority of the Chiefs of Mission. <BR>

<P>State officials told us the Department can move no further on this<BR>

<P>recommendation until the NPR/Vice President's staff propose the<BR>

<P>needed legislation to Congress.  However, NPR staff advised us that<BR>

<P>legislative action is the agency's re<BR>

<P>      FOREIGN AFFAIRS RESOURCE<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT PROCESS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends specific reforms of the interagency foreign policy<BR>

<P>resource management process to improve coordination.  The<BR>

<P>recommendation also covers specific improvements within the<BR>

<P>Department of State. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Secretary of State, in conjunction with the National Security<BR>

<P>Council and the Office of Management and Budget, should reform the<BR>

<P>interagency foreign policy resource management process for Budget<BR>

<P>Function 150. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The President should issue a directive to strengthen the<BR>

<P>authority of the Secretary of State in the Function 150 interagency<BR>

<P>resource management process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Secretary of State should extend the new integrated process<BR>

<P>to the field. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Secretary of State should play a role in the resource<BR>

<P>allocation process for non-Function 150 international expenditures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The Department of State should develop a more strategic approach<BR>

<P>to its internal management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have not reviewed the government's processes for<BR>

<P>allocating resources to the various foreign affairs objectives. <BR>

<P>Neither have we reviewed the specific reforms that NPR recommends. <BR>

<P>However, we recognize that effective use of limited resources<BR>

<P>requires a strategic planning and budgeting process that allocates<BR>

<P>resources to the most important priorities.  For example, in March<BR>

<P>1992, we recommended a strategic management approach to help the<BR>

<P>Agency for International Development face current and future<BR>

<P>challenges. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Current U.S.  government processes for allocating resources to U.S. <BR>

<P>foreign affairs objectives are fragmented among many different<BR>

<P>agencies, budget functions, and congressional committees.  Developing<BR>

<P>a more integrated approach will not be easy (DOS01 proposes one<BR>

<P>approach).  However, we believe that implementation of NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendations could assist government decisionmakers to focus on<BR>

<P>the range of U.S.  foreign affairs objectives, the agencies involved,<BR>

<P>and the costs of programs.  This focus would help ensure that<BR>

<P>available resources are allocated in accordance with priorities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Within the State Department, we agree with NPR that management can<BR>

<P>improve the way priorities are set and resources allocated through<BR>

<P>(1) a more strategic, mission-driven approach; (2) better integration<BR>

<P>of program planning with budget formulation and allocation of funds;<BR>

<P>and (3) refinements to the program planning process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The President has not issued a<BR>

<P>directive to strengthen the authority of the Secretary of State in<BR>

<P>the Budget Function 150 interagency resource management process as<BR>

<P>recommended by the NPR.  However, the Secretary of State established<BR>

<P>the Office of Resources, Plans, and Policy to assist the Department<BR>

<P>and other Function 150 agency heads in developing policies, plans,<BR>

<P>and programs to achieve foreign policy goals and enable the Secretary<BR>

<P>to present an integrated international affairs (Function 150)<BR>

<P>resource budget request to the Office of Management and Budget and<BR>

<P>other government agencies.  The creation of this office appears to<BR>

<P>conform with the NPR recommendation.  However, there are other<BR>

<P>agencies, including the Department of Commerce and the Department of<BR>

<P>Defense, whose budgets are not included in Function 150.  This fact<BR>

<P>was recognized by the NPR, but was not addressed by its<BR>

<P>recommendations.  State recognizes the need to coordinate these other<BR>

<P>activities for a fully integrated foreign affairs resource management<BR>

<P>process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In mid-1994, the Under Secretary for Management began conducting<BR>

<P>periodic meetings with all the under secretaries, acting as a<BR>

<P>&quot;corporate board,&quot; to develop a resource management strategy to meet<BR>

<P>the highest priority goals for State operations.  According to State<BR>

<P>officials, these meetings are being held in an effort to better link<BR>

<P>resources to policy priorities.  However, no time frames for<BR>

<P>implementing the strategy have been established.  In addition, the<BR>

<P>Department's program planning process is an effort to link resources<BR>

<P>with foreign policy and management priorities.  To increase the<BR>

<P>importance of the program planning process, we were told that the<BR>

<P>plans are to be tied to the posts' budget request. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The State Department should improve coordination between various<BR>

<P>information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The State Department should provide greater authority and<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not examined the specific actions<BR>

<P>recommended by NPR, we agree that State can make a major contribution<BR>

<P>in promoting U.S.  business interests abroad.  However, State's<BR>

<P>efforts should conform to the requirements of the administration's<BR>

<P>National Export Strategy, and be coordinated with and complement the<BR>

<P>efforts of other federal agencies that are active in this area,<BR>

<P>notably the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The State Department has taken several steps<BR>

<P>to improve its efforts to promote business overseas.  The Secretary<BR>

<P>of State has identified two primary missions for the Department:  (1)<BR>

<P>the reduction of foreign barriers to U.S.  trade and investment and<BR>

<P>(2) aggressive advocacy on behalf of U.S.  firms.  State expects its<BR>

<P>Coordinator for Business Affairs to foster internal and external<BR>

<P>coordination and improve the effectiveness of both U.S.  and overseas<BR>

<P>promotion efforts.  For example, State's Coordinator for Business<BR>

<P>Affairs is an active participant in the Trade Promotion Coordinating<BR>

<P>Committee, which is working to develop a trade advocacy network. <BR>

<P>State worked with the committee to prepare a summary of<BR>

<P>export-related expenditures, which was included in the President's<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1995 budget submission.  The Coordinator for Business<BR>

<P>Affairs wants to formalize the consideration of business interests in<BR>

<P>State's policymaking structure. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State and Commerce officials have discussed assigning State economic<BR>

<P>officers to the Commerce Department on a temporary basis.  However,<BR>

<P>implementation plans have not been developed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To foster internal coordination, State created the Commercial<BR>

<P>Coordinating Committee, comprised of representatives from all of the<BR>

<P>Department's regional bureaus and most of its functional bureaus. <BR>

<P>The Foreign Service Institute, which provides training to Department<BR>

<P>and other U.S.  government employees involved in foreign affairs, has<BR>

<P>revised several training programs to include trade-related issues. <BR>

<P>Many U.S.  embassies have prepared strategic commercial plans, and<BR>

<P>selected overseas posts were provided funding from a $250,000<BR>

<P>business facilitation incentive fund. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of State should make significant changes in the way it<BR>

<P>manages information technology policy.  Several improvements are<BR>

<P>recommended. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The State Department should establish a position for development<BR>

<P>and oversight of departmentwide information management policy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The State Department should use private and/or public sector<BR>

<P>expertise in developing a departmentwide strategic plan for migrating<BR>

<P>to open systems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Our work strongly supports this recommendation.  In our<BR>

<P>August 1994 report on State's efforts to improve its financial<BR>

<P>management systems, we noted that it has serious weaknesses in<BR>

<P>management and accountability of real and personal property,<BR>

<P>worldwide disbursing and cashiering, and payroll transactions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Information system weaknesses contribute to State's financial<BR>

<P>management problems and, as a result, are reported as one of the<BR>

<P>Office of Management and Budget's high-risk categories.  However,<BR>

<P>State needs a concerted effort, involving managers at all levels, to<BR>

<P>identify information requirements and focus on how long-standing<BR>

<P>problems can best be addressed.  In particular, State needs to<BR>

<P>establish a leadership and oversight structure that can develop a<BR>

<P>departmentwide information management strategy plan and provide<BR>

<P>support, direction, and focus for information management initiatives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  State does not have the<BR>

<P>organizational management structure needed to help ensure the<BR>

<P>successful development of its information system initiatives.  For<BR>

<P>example, State has not established a chief information management<BR>

<P>officer as a senior management partner to manage and control system<BR>

<P>improvements on an enterprisewide basis and to coordinate among top<BR>

<P>executives, line managers, and information management specialists. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State's project to develop an integrated financial management system<BR>

<P>is part of a departmentwide effort to redesign its current<BR>

<P>information systems and move them from proprietary computer equipment<BR>

<P>to an open system environment.  State estimates that this effort will<BR>

<P>cost about $530 million from fiscal years 1994 through 1998.  In our<BR>

<P>May 1994 report on best practices in information resource management,<BR>

<P>we provided summaries of 11 fundamental practices that can help<BR>

<P>agencies improve the management of their information resources and<BR>

<P>system development efforts. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Several recommendations are made for reducing U.S.  costs to operate<BR>

<P>missions overseas, including eliminating certain facilities, reducing<BR>

<P>security costs, and considering altogether new forms of overseas<BR>

<P>representation. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  All agencies with overseas representation should consolidate<BR>

<P>administrative support services where appropriate. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The State Department should review all Marine Security Guard<BR>

<P>detachments and deactivate them where possible. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Legislation should be enacted to amend the Foreign Relations<BR>

<P>Authorization Act to reduce costs of local security provision. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not examined the specific<BR>

<P>cost-cutting actions recommended by NPR, we support the general<BR>

<P>thrust of the recommendations.  In several reports, we have<BR>

<P>recommended that State correct management weaknesses affecting<BR>

<P>overseas posts in the areas of real estate, property and funds,<BR>

<P>administrative services, and other areas.  We believe that improved<BR>

<P>management can reduce costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For many years, we have reported long-standing problems with the<BR>

<P>Department's overseas real estate programs.  As a result of these<BR>

<P>problems, the Comptroller General designated management of overseas<BR>

<P>real property as an area at high risk for waste and mismanagement. <BR>

<P>State is taking actions to improve its management practices. <BR>

<P>However, it is important that the Department continue its commitment<BR>

<P>to management reforms and provide strong oversight of overseas real<BR>

<P>property actions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also believe that State and other foreign affairs agencies need to<BR>

<P>seriously consider whether their overseas activities remain essential<BR>

<P>and affordable given the changing world and current budget<BR>

<P>limitations.  In an ongoing review, we are examining agencies'<BR>

<P>efforts to adopt new forms of overseas representation to reduce<BR>

<P>costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  For many years the State Department has been<BR>

<P>considering new approaches to U.S.  representation abroad.  For<BR>

<P>example, the Special Embassy Program was established in 1986 to<BR>

<P>minimize administrative demands on small posts by taking advantage of<BR>

<P>communications and information technology.  The program was tested at<BR>

<P>11 posts and expanded in 1988 to streamline operations in response to<BR>

<P>budgetary problems.  The criteria for inclusion in the program has<BR>

<P>changed and is now solely the size of the post.  The program now<BR>

<P>includes 57 posts, many of which are in areas where U.S.  interests<BR>

<P>are significant. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State officials view the Department's program planning process as a<BR>

<P>vehicle through which cost savings can be achieved.  The Under<BR>

<P>Secretary for Management has issued reduction goals for staffing for<BR>

<P>fiscal years 1994 to 1998.  These goals require State's bureaus to<BR>

<P>examine prospects for restructuring overseas staffing by closing<BR>

<P>consulates; consolidating administrative support; reducing the size<BR>

<P>of large, mid-size, or small embassies; and reducing security costs<BR>

<P>where feasible. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State has deactivated Marine security guard detachments at eight<BR>

<P>posts and plans deactivations at four more posts by April 1995. <BR>

<P>Deactivation at three additional posts is pending.  The NPR suggested<BR>

<P>lifting legal restrictions on hiring security guards overseas.  We<BR>

<P>were told that the fiscal years 1994 and 1995 Foreign Relations<BR>

<P>Authorization Act tightened the restrictions and that the Office of<BR>

<P>Management and Budget did not support a State Department legislative<BR>

<P>proposal to lift the restriction. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The State Department believes legislation is needed to require all<BR>

<P>agencies with overseas representation to consolidate administrative<BR>

<P>support services.  This legislation has not been proposed.  According<BR>

<P>to a State Department report, there have been disputes with other<BR>

<P>agencies over the quality and responsiveness of support already<BR>

<P>provided.  State officials said they have requested, but have not yet<BR>

<P>received Office of Management and Budget assistance in resolving<BR>

<P>issues relating to the administrative support provided to other<BR>

<P>agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>USIA is studying the need for its activities in industrialized,<BR>

<P>information-rich countries.  We were told that this study includes<BR>

<P>reviewing the need for libraries.  We were also told that some<BR>

<P>libraries have been reduced in size and others have been consolidated<BR>

<P>with Foreign Commercial Service libraries operated by the Commerce<BR>

<P>Department. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation supports the administration's decision to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>
<P>1.  Legislation should be enacted to consolidate U.S.  international<BR>

<P>broadcasting under USIA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  USIA and the Broadcasting Board of Governors should continue to<BR>

<P>opportunities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  USIA should reallocate broadcasting resources from radio to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  For years, we have advocated the consolidation of U.S. <BR>

<P>international broadcasting activities.  In our December 1992 report<BR>

<P>on foreign affairs issues, we suggested that consideration be given<BR>

<P>to eliminating potential duplication of activities between Radio Free<BR>

<P>Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the Voice of America (VOA).  We<BR>

<P>support the administration's decision and the NPR recommendation that<BR>

<P>these stations be consolidated.  The consolidation should improve<BR>

<P>both the effectiveness and efficiency of broadcasting efforts, and in<BR>

<P>the long run result in significant savings.  In our September 1993<BR>

<P>report, we identified cost and administrative issues surrounding the<BR>

<P>legislative proposal to consolidate broadcasting activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In our January 1994 report on VOA, we discussed alternatives to<BR>

<P>shortwave radio broadcasts.  We noted that according to a USIA<BR>

<P>research report, communications satellites are making television<BR>

<P>programming more readily available to the world's 1 billion plus<BR>

<P>television sets.  USIA research shows that, where it is available,<BR>

<P>television has become the primary source of news.  Therefore, we<BR>

<P>generally agree with NPR on reallocating resources from radio to<BR>

<P>television.  However, less overall programming would result because<BR>

<P>television production costs are significantly more than radio. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On April 30, 1994, Congress passed the U.S. <BR>

<P>International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to achieve economies and<BR>

<P>strengthen the capability of the United States to use broadcasting to<BR>

<P>support freedom and democracy in a rapidly changing international<BR>

<P>environment.  The law expressed the sense of Congress that the<BR>

<P>funding of RFE/RL should be assumed by the private sector not later<BR>

<P>than December 31, 1999. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The law created a Board of Governors to oversee RFE/RL, VOA, and<BR>

<P>other U.S.  nonmilitary international broadcasting activities.  The<BR>

<P>President has not yet appointed the members of the new board.  The<BR>

<P>U.S.  international broadcast operations will be consolidated within<BR>

<P>the USIA in an International Broadcasting Bureau. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Since the law was passed, the USIA and its broadcasting staff have<BR>

<P>been working with the staff of RFE/RL and the Board for International<BR>

<P>Broadcasting to develop a consolidation plan that has been sent to<BR>

<P>the President.  However, consolidation will not be complete for some<BR>

<P>time.  During fiscal year 1995 RFE/RL, and to a lesser degree VOA,<BR>

<P>will undergo significant downsizing.  In addition, the President has<BR>

<P>approved moving RFE/RL operations from Munich, Germany to Prague, the<BR>

<P>Czech Republic in 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR recommended that USIA reallocate broadcasting resources from<BR>

<P>radio to television.  During the past year, USIA has studied<BR>

<P>television, its organizational placement, and its use to support the<BR>

<P>agency's mission.  In addition, the strategic planning office in<BR>

<P>USIA's Bureau of Broadcasting has studied the potential for applying<BR>

<P>new technology to television news broadcasting.  However, decisions<BR>

<P>on shifting resources from radio to television broadcasting have not<BR>

<P>been made and may await appointment of the new Broadcasting Board of<BR>

<P>Governors. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have not studied the advantages and<BR>

<P>disadvantages of relocating the Regional Administrative Management<BR>

<P>Centers to the United States.  Embassies need accurate and timely<BR>

<P>financial information and services.  However, our work indicates that<BR>

<P>some embassies are dissatisfied with the services provided by the<BR>

<P>regional centers.  We support efforts to improve the quality and<BR>

<P>timeliness of administrative financial support services whether<BR>

<P>through improvement of existing centers or their relocation to the<BR>

<P>United States. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  A new U.S.  Regional Administrative<BR>

<P>Management Center is scheduled to open in Charleston, South Carolina,<BR>

<P>in 1995.  State plans to transfer the processing of all overseas<BR>

<P>American salaries to the new center.  This processing is now done in<BR>

<P>Washington, D.C., and at the Regional Administrative Management<BR>

<P>Centers in Bangkok, Mexico City, and Paris.  The transfer of other<BR>

<P>functions from Mexico City will follow.  We were told that no other<BR>

<P>action will be taken regarding the transfer of functions from the<BR>

<P>Bangkok and Paris Centers until the Charleston Center is operating<BR>

<P>satisfactorily. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to a State Department official, rather than transfer<BR>

<P>existing computer programs from Mexico City, the Department hopes to<BR>

<P>install its new Integrated Financial Management System at the<BR>

<P>Charleston Center.  However, in our August 1994 report on State's<BR>

<P>financial management systems, we recommended that State delay<BR>

<P>awarding a contract for the new system until it (1) articulates how<BR>

<P>the system will solve long-standing internal control and financial<BR>

<P>management systems weaknesses and (2) establishes detailed<BR>

<P>requirements for individual system development projects to address<BR>

<P>high-risk areas.  As a result, State may have to delay the transfer<BR>

<P>of Mexico City functions to Charleston or it may have to transfer its<BR>

<P>existing computer programs from Mexico City to the Charleston Center. <BR>

<P>      DOS08:  IMPROVE THE<BR>

<P>      COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.8<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The State Department should do a better job collecting debts, such as<BR>

<P>medical expenses and others, owed to the Department. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.8.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The State Department should ensure that overseas medical expenses<BR>

<P>are accurately identified and reported by each embassy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The State Department should ensure that all other debts to the<BR>

<P>government are accurately identified and reported. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The State Department should actively collect all accounts<BR>

<P>receivable. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly agree with this recommendation.  Our work has<BR>

<P>shown that State currently does not have adequate controls over<BR>

<P>receivables.  In August 1992, we reported that State does not have<BR>

<P>reasonable assurances that it is recovering the medical insurance<BR>

<P>benefits payable to insured employees and dependents for overseas<BR>

<P>medical expenses paid by the government.  As a result, the government<BR>

<P>may be losing substantial amounts of recoverable expenses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Department of State has planned several<BR>

<P>actions in response to recommendations in GAO reports and the NPR<BR>

<P>report.  Since October 1, 1993, the Office of Medical Services has<BR>

<P>issued individual obligation numbers for each transaction so that it<BR>

<P>can track medical expenditures and identify funds reimbursed to its<BR>

<P>allotment.  The Office is revising procedures in the Foreign Affairs<BR>

<P>Manual to require employees to ensure that the government is<BR>

<P>reimbursed for medical expenditures on their behalf. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, the Bureau of Finance and Management Policy is<BR>

<P>developing accounting and debt collection procedures for funds that<BR>

<P>have been expended on employees' overseas medical expenses.  The<BR>

<P>Bureau will send notices reminding employees to file for<BR>

<P>reimbursement from their insurance companies.  At the same time, the<BR>

<P>Bureau will open an account receivable in employees' names.  If<BR>

<P>employees do not file for reimbursement from their insurance company<BR>

<P>and reimburse State within a specified amount of time, the Department<BR>

<P>will withhold money from their paychecks.  The Department is<BR>

<P>circulating the draft procedures and the revision to the Foreign<BR>

<P>Affairs Manual for internal review. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The repatriation loan program was established to assist destitute<BR>

<P>Americans abroad.  Due to the nature of these loans, recovery rates<BR>

<P>are low:  over $5 million in loans were outstanding in fiscal year<BR>

<P>1993, $689,000 in new loans were made, and only $354,000 was<BR>

<P>collected.  While not optimistic about its ability to collect these<BR>

<P>loans, State plans additional steps to improve the loan collection<BR>

<P>and administration process.  Actions include acceptance of credit<BR>

<P>cards for payment and establishment of a toll-free number for<BR>

<P>recipients to contact the Department concerning their accounts.  The<BR>

<P>Department plans to consider other measures, such as garnishment of<BR>

<P>wages and incentive payment plans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>State's difficulties in collecting money owed have been due in large<BR>

<P>part to deficiencies in its accounting systems.  The Department plans<BR>

<P>to correct these deficiencies through the development of an<BR>

<P>integrated financial management system to be completed by 1999. <BR>

<P>Notwithstanding the needed financial system improvement, State's<BR>

<P>planned actions should increase the collections of accounts<BR>

<P>receivable. <BR>

<P>      ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.9<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation outlines several changes in the United States'<BR>

<P>fiscal relationship with the United Nations, including recommending<BR>

<P>an oversight office for the organization and tax law changes to<BR>

<P>reduce costs to the federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.9.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Seek U.N.  member support for establishment of a consolidated<BR>

<P>oversight and accountability mechanism such as an Office of Inspector<BR>

<P>General. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The President should seek U.N.  member support for a thorough<BR>

<P>reexamination of U.N.  assessment procedures and practices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Legislation should be enacted to amend the Foreign Assistance Act<BR>

<P>of 1961 to eliminate the reporting requirement on voluntary<BR>

<P>contributions to international organizations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Legislation should be enacted to eliminate the collection and<BR>

<P>reimbursement of income taxes on international organization pay. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly endorse the creation of an independent U.N. <BR>

<P>Inspector General or similar body to ensure adequate accountability<BR>

<P>and oversight of U.N.  operations and finances.  In a 1992 report and<BR>

<P>again in a 1993 letter to the President of the Federal Court of Audit<BR>

<P>of Germany, we provided a conceptual framework for an entity to<BR>

<P>provide accountability and oversight. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In another 1992 report we also recommended that the Secretary of<BR>

<P>State instruct the U.S.  representative to the U.N.  to seek support<BR>

<P>for reexamining the basis for, and equity of the special U.N. <BR>

<P>assessment scale for peacekeeping operations.  We have not studied<BR>

<P>the NPR recommendations to change the tax law or eliminate the report<BR>

<P>on voluntary contributions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 19:2.9.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On July 29, 1994, the U.N.  General Assembly<BR>

<P>authorized a U.N.  Office of Under Secretary General for Internal<BR>

<P>Oversight Services and approved the appointment of the new Under<BR>

<P>Secretary General.  On September 7, 1994, the U.N.  Secretary General<BR>

<P>issued implementing procedures for the new Office.  We found that the<BR>

<P>implementing procedures provide regulations to ensure that the new<BR>

<P>Office is operationally independent.  The procedures address<BR>

<P>compliance with Office recommendations and require managers to report<BR>

<P>quarterly on the status of implementation.  The procedures protect<BR>

<P>individuals' rights and protect the confidentiality of sources.  The<BR>

<P>appointment of qualified staff and the commitment of U.N.  management<BR>

<P>will be required to ensure that the Office is instrumental in<BR>

<P>achieving management improvements in the U.N. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Various options have been proposed by U.N.  members and independent<BR>

<P>groups to address equity issues and to simplify the methods for<BR>

<P>calculating the U.N.  regular budget and peacekeeping assessments. <BR>

<P>State Department officials agree that more objective economic<BR>

<P>criteria are needed to assess countries based on their ability to<BR>

<P>contribute.  The U.N.  Committee on Contributions has considered<BR>

<P>several alternatives to the regular budget assessment formula<BR>

<P>proposed by member countries.  Officials of the State Department and<BR>

<P>the U.S.  Mission to the United Nations told us that assessment<BR>

<P>issues will be an agenda item at the 49th General Assembly in fall<BR>

<P>1994.  They added that the United States intends to be vigorous in<BR>

<P>its efforts to promote changes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The State Department has not acted on the NPR recommendations on<BR>

<P>legislative changes to eliminate the reporting requirement on<BR>

<P>voluntary contributions to international organizations or eliminate<BR>

<P>income taxes on international organization pay.  State officials told<BR>

<P>us that the Internal Revenue Service does not support eliminating the<BR>

<P>tax requirement. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 21<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 21:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR recommendations for Treasury span a wide range of government<BR>

<P>activities, including the coordination on federal law enforcement<BR>

<P>agencies, organizational modernization for IRS and Customs, and<BR>

<P>improvement of governmentwide financial management systems.  Treasury<BR>

<P>officials have been cooperating with the Justice Department in<BR>

<P>efforts to improve law enforcement coordination.  The creation of the<BR>

<P>Office of Investigative Agency Policies within Justice appears to be<BR>

<P>a positive step toward better coordination of law enforcement<BR>

<P>efforts.  This office, however, does not have authority over, and<BR>

<P>generally does not affect, either Treasury investigative agencies or<BR>

<P>other federal investigative agencies outside of Justice.  Overall,<BR>

<P>though, Treasury has taken some type of action regarding all of the<BR>

<P>NPR recommendations related to its law enforcement activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Treasury has also taken action on other NPR recommendations.  IRS is<BR>

<P>working with other federal agencies and states to simplify tax and<BR>

<P>wage reporting, and it is drafting legislation to allow greater<BR>

<P>cooperation between the federal government and state governments on<BR>

<P>tax administration.  IRS and Customs are beginning to modernize their<BR>

<P>operations, but full implementation of these efforts will not be<BR>

<P>complete for several years.  Also, reports we have recently issued on<BR>

<P>IRS and Customs showed that these agencies continue to have<BR>

<P>significant problems with their financial management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>      TRE01:  IMPROVE THE<BR>

<P>      COORDINATION AND STRUCTURE<BR>

<P>      OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT<BR>

<P>      AGENCIES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends the designation of the Attorney General as the<BR>

<P>Director of Law Enforcement to coordinate federal law enforcement<BR>

<P>efforts.  It also recommends changes in the alignment of federal law<BR>

<P>enforcement responsibilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the need for greater coordination of the<BR>

<P>numerous agencies involved in federal law enforcement.  The<BR>

<P>decentralized operations, including the 94 U.S.  Attorneys and the<BR>

<P>various investigative agencies within Justice and Treasury,<BR>

<P>complicate efforts by the Department of Justice to coordinate and<BR>

<P>direct a wide variety of initiatives and programs to fight crime.  We<BR>

<P>have not taken a position as to whether the various law enforcement<BR>

<P>agencies should be consolidated into one or more agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Other.  According to information obtained from Treasury officials, to<BR>

<P>improve coordination among investigative agencies within the<BR>

<P>Department as well as with Justice agencies, Treasury (1) recently<BR>

<P>established an under secretary position to coordinate its law<BR>

<P>enforcement activities, (2) is reorganizing its enforcement bureaus<BR>

<P>to be more mission specific, (3) has developed some interagency<BR>

<P>memorandums of understanding regarding coordination of<BR>

<P>responsibilities, and (4) is participating in task forces with the<BR>

<P>FBI. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In a related action, in November 1993 the Attorney General<BR>

<P>established the Office of Investigative Agency Policies (OIAP) to<BR>

<P>improve coordination among its law enforcement agencies, reduce<BR>

<P>duplication, and better utilize investigative resources.  OIAP is<BR>

<P>headed by a Director (currently the FBI Director), appointed by the<BR>

<P>Attorney General from among the heads of the affected investigative<BR>

<P>agencies--FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S.  Marshals<BR>

<P>Service, and Immigration Naturalization Service--and Justice's<BR>

<P>Criminal Division.  OIAP is responsible for resolving operational<BR>

<P>issues among the Justice's investigative agencies where there is<BR>

<P>overlapping jurisdiction and for advising the Attorney General<BR>

<P>regarding administrative, budgetary, and personnel matters involving<BR>

<P>these agencies.  Among other things, OIAP has issued resolutions and<BR>

<P>begun taking actions to improve within Justice the (1) use and<BR>

<P>sharing of federal drug intelligence, (2) coordination of violent<BR>

<P>crime activities, (3) coordination of the budget requests of the<BR>

<P>various investigative agencies, and (4) location and use of Justice<BR>

<P>field offices and resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although Treasury apparently has taken some actions intended to<BR>

<P>improve coordination among its investigative agencies and with<BR>

<P>Justice agencies, at the time of our follow-up inquiry, we were<BR>

<P>unable to obtain sufficiently detailed information to assess those<BR>

<P>actions.  Moreover, while the creation of the OIAP within Justice<BR>

<P>appears to be consistent with the underlying intent of the<BR>

<P>recommendation and a positive step toward improving coordination of<BR>

<P>law enforcement activities within the Department, OIAP does not have<BR>

<P>authority over and generally does not affect Treasury investigative<BR>

<P>agencies or other non-Justice federal investigative agencies. <BR>

<P>Furthermore, according to Justice, there have been no further actions<BR>

<P>on this recommendation pending NPR's issuance of the accompanying<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Given worldwide drug production capacity, domestic demand,<BR>

<P>and the resourcefulness of drug smugglers to adapt to U.S. <BR>

<P>enforcement initiatives, the overall availability of drugs in this<BR>

<P>country has not been diminished despite substantial increases in air<BR>

<P>interdiction efforts and related drug seizures.  The commitment of<BR>

<P>resources should not be made without considering the potential<BR>

<P>effectiveness of alternative efforts, both supply and demand, and<BR>

<P>should be based on achieving measurable goals.  Also, to better<BR>

<P>coordinate agency efforts, improvements in information system<BR>

<P>interoperability, data integrity, security, and overall intelligence<BR>

<P>information management are needed. <BR>

<P>interdiction matters.  An example of the enhanced cooperation is the<BR>

<P>regular communication on interdiction matters between the Treasury's<BR>

<P>Under Secretary for Enforcement and the Deputy Attorney General. <BR>

<P>Treasury has reviewed existing drug interdiction programs to<BR>

<P>determine benefits to the national strategy and has taken steps to<BR>

<P>streamline the programs.  For example, the Agency is reducing funding<BR>

<P>for the P-3 aircraft program and there will be fewer flight hours in<BR>

<P>supported H.R.  3419 because it does not go far enough to allow full<BR>

<P>joint federal-state cooperative activities.  IRS is drafting<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that there are burdens associated with the<BR>

<P>current tax- and wage-reporting requirements and fully support<BR>

<P>attempts to simplify them.  In 1989, we reported on our assessment of<BR>

<P>three possible alternatives to the current system, including one that<BR>

<P>involved establishing a single point to receive and process tax and<BR>

<P>wage data for IRS, the Social Security Administration, and the<BR>

<P>states.  We concluded that although there were advantages to each<BR>

<P>demonstration project in 12 states to eliminate the need for<BR>

<P>employers to send Form W-2s to state tax agencies.  The project is<BR>

<P>expected to be expanded in 1995.  Based on discussions with program<BR>

<P>officials, at least 23 states will be participating in the expanded<BR>

<P>project.  According to IRS officials, the W-2 demonstration project<BR>

<P>was created to increase efficiency within the Department by<BR>

<P>components.  The Director of the FBI serves as the Director of OIAP. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OIAP, in a February 1994 resolution, acknowledged that law<BR>

<P>enforcement agencies have not maximized the sharing of information<BR>

<P>and coordination of activities in the drug intelligence arena.  To<BR>

<P>address this concern, three actions were recommended.  First, the FBI<BR>

<P>and DEA are to create a common drug database to consist of<BR>

<P>the DEA/Customs El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) Advisory Board is<BR>

<P>to consider the FBI's request for appointment of an FBI<BR>

<P>representative as a Deputy Director of EPIC.  Third, the National<BR>

<P>Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) Director is to coordinate strategic<BR>

<P>drug intelligence initiatives with all appropriate Justice law<BR>

<P>enforcement agencies.  None of these recommended actions have taken<BR>

<P>place. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Treasury officials said they have been cooperating with Justice in<BR>

<P>these efforts.  In addition, Treasury has enhanced the capabilities<BR>

<P>of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) by bringing more<BR>

<P>Treasury and non-Treasury agencies to participate in its financial<BR>

<P>information and anti-money laundering services.  They have also been<BR>

<P>&quot;selling&quot; the advantages of the Treasury Enforcement Communications<BR>

<P>System (TEC System) to other law enforcement agencies.  FINCEN and<BR>

<P>the TEC System can provide substantial support to law enforcement<BR>

<P>agencies and thereby reduce duplication by eliminating the need for<BR>

<P>agencies to independently develop such services/information. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, Treasury has consolidated drug intelligence personnel<BR>

<P>from two of its centers to one center.  The Treasury operations<BR>

<P>center is being consolidated with an FBI center.  Treasury is phasing<BR>

<P>in its planned computer security controls for safeguarding the<BR>

<P>integrity and privacy of information.  These changes are covered by a<BR>

<P>December 1993 manual directive Automated Information Systems and<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  In our past work, we have found serious program weaknesses<BR>

<P>that affected Customs' ability to reasonably ensure that it was<BR>

<P>meeting its responsibilities for combating unfair foreign trade<BR>

<P>practices or protecting the public from unsafe goods.  We have<BR>

<P>recommended that Customs institute a strategic management process<BR>

<P>that defines a clear trade enforcement strategy, sets mission<BR>

<P>priorities, establishes performance objectives, and monitors progress<BR>

<P>toward achieving them.  We also recommended the adoption of an<BR>

<P>organizational structure that more adequately supports the<BR>

<P>achievement of Customs' trade enforcement mission.  Customs is taking<BR>

<P>action on these recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Customs has a number of projects<BR>

<P>ongoing that could change the way in which it operates.  For example,<BR>

<P>Customs has established a comprehensive trade enforcement strategic<BR>

<P>planning and monitoring system, redesigned its organizational and<BR>

<P>management structure, redesigned its targeting system for ensuring<BR>

<P>compliance with trade laws, and redesigned its automated systems<BR>

<P>needed to support operations.  On completion of these efforts,<BR>

<P>Customs expects to achieve significant improvement in the effective<BR>

<P>enforcement of trade laws and more efficient administration of<BR>

<P>Customs' services to the public.  Given the scope of its planned<BR>

<P>actions, Customs does not expect this transformation to take place<BR>

<P>quickly.  For example, the Customs' established milestone for fully<BR>

<P>implementing its reorganization plans (including the realignment of<BR>

<P>personnel) is late 1997. <BR>

<P>Agree.  We agree with this recommendation.  The merger of RTC with<BR>

<P>FDIC offers the opportunity to combine the expertise of these<BR>

<P>organizations and improve the efficiency of asset management and<BR>

<P>disposition activities.  We believe that FDIC can benefit from RTC's<BR>

<P>experiences--both positive and negative--in developing systems and<BR>

<P>procedures for asset marketing and disposition, information<BR>

<P>management, contracting, and affordable housing.  As the transition<BR>

<P>progresses, RTC and FDIC should keep Congress informed so that<BR>

<P>developing detailed plans to guide the merger of RTC into FDIC. <BR>

<P>Several working groups have been established, and some have developed<BR>

<P>reports on issues that need to be considered to ensure the efficient<BR>

<P>merger of several RTC and FDIC programs and functions.  These reports<BR>

<P>are intended to provide a basis for the task force to plan for the<BR>

<P>efficient trasfer of RTC staff and responsibilities.  While some<BR>

<P>action on the NPR recommendation has occurred, the recommendation<BR>

<P>cannot be fully implemented until RTC closes in December 1995 and all<BR>

<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Although we have not studied this issue,<BR>

<P>this is an area where we would agree that further examination could<BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Other.  Treasury officials believe a mechanism is already in place<BR>

<P>which is dedicated to accomplishing this recommendation.  The Federal<BR>

<P>Law Enforcement Training Center, or FLETC, was established in 1970 to<BR>

<P>accomplish common training of law enforcement investigators while<BR>

<P>allowing individual participating agencies to do specialized<BR>

<P>training.  Although Treasury supervises administrative and financial<BR>

<P>activities, FLETC is governed by an eight member board of directors<BR>

<P>representing participating agencies, including the Departments of<BR>

<P>Justice, Treasury, Interior and the General Services Administration. <BR>

<P>In all, over 70 law enforcement agencies participate in FLETC. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have not specifically reviewed this issue with<BR>

<P>respect to Treasury employees.  But, given our past work at other<BR>

<P>agencies, we endorse the concept of streamlining background<BR>

<P>investigations provided that thoroughness is not jeopardized,<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.13.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Treasury is in the process of implementing or<BR>

<P>evaluating actions it can take in response to the NPR recommendation. <BR>

<P>Specifically, the implementation of a Treasury Security Manual will<BR>

<P>replace OPM's Federal Personnel Manual and will address both<BR>

<P>personnel security and security investigation matters.  It is<BR>

<P>anticipated that the manual will be released in early fiscal year<BR>

<P>1995.  The manual will specify minimum requirements for employment at<BR>

<P>Treasury but will allow stricter ones for Bureaus which request them. <BR>

<P>Moreover, the manual will allow the Bureaus to investigate applicants<BR>

<P>or secure investigation by other means. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In the area of periodic reinvestigations, Treasury is pilot testing a<BR>

<P>streamlined investigation procedure focusing on criminal background<BR>

<P>and credit checks.  Treasury is also discussing with Intelligence<BR>

<P>agencies ways to modify or reduce requirements for obtaining Top<BR>

<P>Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance.  Finally,<BR>

<P>Treasury is in the process of implementing an on-line system for<BR>

<P>tracking employees' clearance status and need for periodic<BR>

<P>reinvestigation.  For certain Treasury components this system went<BR>

<P>on-line May 23, 1994 and the remaining components are expected<BR>

<P>
<P>Civil monetary penalties have not been adjusted to keep up with<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In principle, we agree that civil penalties should<BR>

<P>Although we have not made a detailed examination of the specifics of<BR>

<P>this recommendation (the final NPR accompanying report has not been<BR>

<P>issued), we recognize that such adjustments could be based on<BR>

<P>inflation as well as other factors such as deterrence.  Our prior<BR>

<P>work on civil debt and criminal fines has shown that much of the<BR>

<P>currently imposed criminal and civil fines and penalties remain<BR>

<P>uncollected.  As of the end of fiscal year 1993, the Department of<BR>

<P>Justice estimated the total amount of unpaid criminal debt exceeded<BR>

<P>for civil monetary penalties requires statutory authority.  H.R. <BR>

<P>3400, as passed by the House of Representatives in November 1993,<BR>

<P>included provisions to use an inflation index to revise all monetary<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.15.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have long been on record as supporting the need<BR>

<P>for improved compliance efforts.  While supporting Compliance 2000 in<BR>

<P>concept, we have not fully endorsed IRS' implementation of that<BR>

<P>concept.  It is also not clear what, if anything, NPR is recommending<BR>

<P>beyond what IRS is already doing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.15.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The IRS has several ongoing compliance<BR>

<P>efforts which are included under the umbrella of IRS' major<BR>

<P>initiative, Compliance 2000.  Changes that IRS made to its<BR>

<P>Installment Agreements and Offer-in-Compromise Programs occurred<BR>

<P>before this NPR recommendation was made.  The Market Specialization<BR>

<P>Program, which is an effort to organize audits of taxpayers by<BR>

<P>industry or issue, is ongoing.  Of 85 to 90 market segments currently<BR>

<P>identified, there are final audit guidelines for 9 segments and draft<BR>

<P>audit guidelines for 27 segments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Reallocating staff at IRS collection field offices has been an<BR>

<P>ongoing effort.  Staffing imbalances among collection field staff are<BR>

<P>expected to be resolved by normal staff attrition and hiring directed<BR>

<P>to understaffed field offices.  IRS' collection procedures have been<BR>

<P>changed to allow case workers to close cases at the earliest point in<BR>

<P>the collection process, thereby reducing collection inventories. <BR>

<P>Part of the changing procedures is to make telephone calls earlier in<BR>

<P>the collection process.  This effort, known as the Early Intervention<BR>

<P>Contact Project, is scheduled to start in January 1995. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.16.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that attention needs to be given to federal agency<BR>

<P>compliance with federal contractor tax reporting requirements.  We<BR>

<P>first reported on this problem in April 1991 and followed with a<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.16.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  An OMB report to Congress dated April<BR>

<P>1, 1994, identified the problems related to this issue and the steps<BR>

<P>necessary to overcome them.  IRS has held meetings to determine how<BR>

<P>it will implement the OMB recommendations.  IRS has several efforts<BR>

<P>under way to strengthen regulations concerning contractors, to audit<BR>

<P>federal agency compliance with the regulations, and to expand agency<BR>

<P>compliance with reporting requirements.  IRS is moving ahead, but<BR>

<P>much remains to be done.  IRS' actions are in accordance with its<BR>

<P>plans.  However, it will be 1996 before the OMB recommendations are<BR>

<P>fully implemented.  IRS has taken over the lead from the Financial<BR>

<P>Management Service on delivering training to the agencies. <BR>

<P>authorizing legislation.  Current plans would incorporate credit card<BR>

<P>payments into TAXLink, a new system being designed to accept<BR>

<P>electronic federal tax deposits.  Such a system was a requirement of<BR>

<P>the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and IRS believes that<BR>

<P>it would be easy to incorporate a credit card tax payment component<BR>

<P>within the electronic payment system.  TAXLink is scheduled to be<BR>

<P>implemented in March 1995 at which time virtually all federal tax<BR>

<P>deposits would be made electronically. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.18.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We do not know what specific changes the<BR>

<P>NPR is recommending for Treasury.  However, during our July 13, 1994,<BR>

<P>testimony on the Department of Treasury's efforts to implement the<BR>

<P>Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act, we stated that several of its<BR>

<P>bureaus continue to have significant problems with their financial<BR>

<P>management systems.  At the crux of these problems are antiquated and<BR>

<P>nonintegrated core financial management systems and nonstandardized<BR>

<P>subsystems.  For instance, our audit report on IRS' fiscal year 1993<BR>

<P>fiscal statements showed significant weaknesses in IRS' basic<BR>

<P>systems, some of which are antiquated, not designed to provide<BR>

<P>necessary financial information, and lack internal controls.  In<BR>

<P>addition, during our audit of Customs' fiscal year 1993 financial<BR>

<P>statements, we found that serious and pervasive weaknesses in key<BR>

<P>internal controls and systems have diminished Customs' ability to<BR>

<P>report reliable financial information and effectively carry out its<BR>

<P>mission.  These weaknesses have resulted in lost revenue to the<BR>

<P>federal government, errors in taxpayer accounts, and lack of proper<BR>

<P>accountability for operating funds and seized assets.  At both<BR>

<P>bureaus we noted significant steps being taken to address these<BR>

<P>problems.  However, many of their efforts are in the early stages of<BR>

<P>development and are not likely to be implemented for several years. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.19.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Alcohol excise tax rates vary considerably by type<BR>

<P>of product, with distilled spirits being taxed at a much higher rate<BR>

<P>per ounce of alcohol than beer or table wine.  The section 5010 tax<BR>

<P>credit was designed to compensate distilled spirits producers who<BR>

<P>used lower-tax ingredients (wine and flavors) in their products by<BR>

<P>lowering their effective tax rates.  The credit thus provides<BR>

<P>producers with an incentive to use wine and flavors in distilled<BR>

<P>spirits products.  As we reported in 1990, these ingredients are<BR>

<P>sometimes added to obtain the tax benefits, rather than in response<BR>

<P>to product requirements, market demand, or cost.  Significantly more<BR>

<P>tax revenues are being lost through use of this credit than Congress<BR>

<P>originally estimated, and the credit is difficult to administer and<BR>

<P>enforce.  We recommended in September 1990 that section 5010 be<BR>

<P>repealed.  Our recommendation was predicated on Congress<BR>

<P>standardizing alcohol excise tax rates across products on the basis<BR>

<P>of the percentage of alcohol in a beverage regardless of the mix of<BR>

<P>ingredients it contains.  It is unclear whether NPR's recommendation<BR>

<P>also anticipated rate standardization.  However, a draft legislative<BR>

<P>proposal prepared by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms<BR>

<P>(BATF) in response to the NPR recommendation would eliminate the<BR>

<P>credit without any reference to standardizing rates. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 21:2.20.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that Congress needs to consider changing<BR>

<P>the special occupational tax provisions.  As we reported in September<BR>

<P>1990, those taxes, primarily paid by alcohol retailers, are difficult<BR>

<P>to collect and administer.  We suggested two alternatives:  (1)<BR>

<P>eliminating the special occupational taxes and offsetting the revenue<BR>

<P>loss through a slight increase in existing excise taxes or (2)<BR>

<P>keeping the special occupational taxes but collecting them only from<BR>

<P>alcohol producers and importers and varying the tax on the basis of<BR>

<P>the size of the facility.  It is our understanding that one of the<BR>

<P>alternatives being considered would continue the tax on retailers but<BR>

<P>would require wholesalers to get proof of tax payment before selling<BR>

<P>to the retailer.  On its surface, this alternative would seem to<BR>

<P>generally meet the intent of our recommendation--to reduce ATF's<BR>

<P>administrative burden. <BR>

<P>ascertain that retailers have paid the federal special occupational<BR>

<P>tax prior to making sales to these retailers.  It sent its two drafts<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 2:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Implementation of the seven NPR recommendations for USDA ranges from<BR>

<P>full implementation to not implemented--action taken.  Although USDA<BR>

<P>has taken or identified actions to implement most of the<BR>

<P>recommendations, it has fully implemented only one--to phase out the<BR>

<P>wool and mohair program (USDA01).  It has also partially implemented<BR>

<P>three other recommendations.  In the fall of 1993, USDA submitted<BR>

<P>legislation to implement a new organizational structure, and the<BR>

<P>legislation was enacted on October 13, 1994 (USDA03).  To contain<BR>

<P>costs in the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and<BR>

<P>Children (WIC), USDA has taken steps to enhance competition among<BR>

<P>manufacturers of infant formula and to provide states with<BR>

<P>information and technical assistance (USDA06).  To prepare for<BR>

<P>delivering food stamp benefits via electronic transfer nationwide, it<BR>

<P>has been participating in an interagency task force and working<BR>

<P>closely with a number of states to pilot test electronic benefit<BR>

<P>transfer projects (USDA07).  UDSA has also taken steps to implement<BR>

<P>three other recommendations.  It developed legislative proposals to<BR>

<P>eliminate the honey subsidy program (USDA02) and to consolidate a<BR>

<P>number of farm management plans (USDA04).  These proposals are<BR>

<P>awaiting congressional action.  To begin implementing the<BR>

<P>recommendation that USDA administer the employment and training<BR>

<P>requirements for food stamp recipients more effectively, the<BR>

<P>Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has directed the<BR>

<P>Service's regional and program offices to look for better ways to<BR>

<P>target employment and training funds (USDA05). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although we generally agree with the NPR's recommendations for USDA,<BR>

<P>we are concerned, as we noted in December 1993, about other issues<BR>

<P>that NPR did not address.  These include<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- eliminating, phasing out, or changing several other commodity<BR>

<P>     programs in addition to the wool and mohair and honey programs<BR>

<P>     because (1) the programs may not be meeting their goals, (2) the<BR>

<P>     programs and goals may not be appropriate in today's<BR>

<P>     marketplace, or (3) the programs may not be addressing farmers'<BR>

<P>     needs;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- centralizing the servicing for the Farmers Home Administration's<BR>

<P>     (FmHA) single-family housing loans to lower delinquency rates<BR>

<P>     and reduce loan losses; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- reducing the farm credit program's exposure to risk by<BR>

<P>     rethinking FmHA's mission and activities so as to improve risk<BR>

<P>     management, reduce transaction costs, and improve farmers'<BR>

<P>     equity while saving taxpayers billions of dollars. <BR>

<P>
<P>      USDA01:  END THE WOOL AND<BR>

<P>      MOHAIR SUBSIDY<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 2:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The subsidy is no longer needed since wool is no longer a strategic<BR>

<P>commodity. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation should be enacted to eliminate federal support payments<BR>

<P>for wool and mohair. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have supported ending the wool and mohair subsidy since<BR>

<P>1990 because (1) the program's costs are high, (2) the federal budget<BR>

<P>faces many constraints, (3) a small number of beneficiaries have been<BR>

<P>receiving the bulk of the payments, and (4) wool has not been<BR>

<P>considered a strategic material since 1960. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  Public Law 103-130, enacted on November 1, 1993,<BR>

<P>phases out the wool and mohair subsidy program over 2 years.  This<BR>

<P>subsidy program will end with the conclusion of the 1995 marketing<BR>

<P>year. <BR>

<P>      SUPPORT FOR HONEY<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 2:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Eliminate the honey subsidy because the program does not serve the<BR>

<P>intended purpose of ensuring the availability of honeybees for crop<BR>

<P>pollination. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation should be enacted to eliminate federal support for honey. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support eliminating the honey program.  In 1985, we<BR>

<P>reported that the program--originally justified as ensuring an<BR>

<P>adequate supply of honeybees for crop pollination--was unnecessary to<BR>

<P>ensure pollination.  We also found that only 1 percent of the<BR>

<P>nation's beekeepers participated in the program.  We recommended that<BR>

<P>the program be phased out by reducing the price-support level over<BR>

<P>time to minimize the impact on the industry. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Annual appropriations legislation for<BR>

<P>fiscal years 1994 and 1995 eliminated payments and greatly curtailed<BR>

<P>loans for the honey program.  Proposed legislation (H.R.  1853 and<BR>

<P>H.R.  3400) authorized honey payments only through the 1995 crop year<BR>

<P>rather than the 1998 crop year as called for under the Omnibus Budget<BR>

<P>Reconciliation Act of 1993.  However, the proposed legislation would<BR>

<P>not definitively terminate the honey program as the NPR recommends. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  USDA should begin immediately a multiyear approach to revising<BR>

<P>the department's structure to reflect its program responsibilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Secretary of Agriculture should submit legislation to<BR>

<P>implement the new organizational structure to enhance the delivery of<BR>

<P>USDA services. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  USDA should review its regional, state, and area office<BR>

<P>structure; eliminate those elements no longer appropriate; and extend<BR>

<P>the restructuring to the &quot;non-county-based&quot; agencies of the<BR>

<P>department. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support the recommendation to reorganize USDA.  In a<BR>

<P>series of reports on the organizational structure and management<BR>

<P>systems of USDA, we identified structural problems that, if<BR>

<P>addressed, could lead to greater efficiency, effectiveness, and cost<BR>

<P>savings.  USDA estimates that streamlining and restructuring its<BR>

<P>headquarters and field structure could save about $2.3 billion over<BR>

<P>the next 5 years. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  USDA has been working for a number of years<BR>

<P>to revise its structure.  The Department also has identified about<BR>

<P>1,100 county offices that it plans to close to streamline its field<BR>

<P>operations (action item 1).  Legislation to implement a new<BR>

<P>organizational structure was introduced in the fall of 1993 and was<BR>

<P>passed and signed into law (P.L.  103-354) on October 13, 1994<BR>

<P>(action item 2).  USDA is currently determining which county offices<BR>

<P>will be closed and how the Department's headquarters offices will be<BR>

<P>reorganized (action item 3). <BR>

<P>      PLAN<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 2:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The farm management plan proposed by Secretary Espy provides an<BR>

<P>opportunity to simplify regulations for farm management and is a good<BR>

<P>way to consolidate competing requirements into a single plan for each<BR>

<P>farm. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  USDA should coordinate federal agencies in assisting producers to<BR>

<P>implement the consolidated farm management plan.  This should include<BR>

<P>assuring the quality of consolidated farm management plans and<BR>

<P>compliance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The consolidated farm management plan should seek to coordinate<BR>

<P>with programs administered by other federal agencies and states in<BR>

<P>order to create an integrated comprehensive farm management plan. <BR>

<P>The plan, however, should not override or supersede requirements of<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not recommended a consolidated<BR>

<P>farm management plan, we agree that the concept provides an excellent<BR>

<P>opportunity to simplify regulations and help make government<BR>

<P>regulations &quot;farmer friendly.&quot; This recommendation also complements<BR>

<P>NPR's recommendation to reorganize USDA, streamline its field<BR>

<P>structure, and improve service to its customers. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Legislation was introduced in 1993 to<BR>

<P>consolidate the number of management plans required by USDA. <BR>

<P>However, this legislation focuses only on environmental and<BR>

<P>conservation management plans and does not include all farm<BR>

<P>management plans.  Therefore, while related to the recommendation,<BR>

<P>the legislation would not fully implement the recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation should be enacted to amend the Food Stamp Act to<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not done work on this issue, in<BR>

<P>our view it makes good sense to redirect funds from ineffective<BR>

<P>programs to programs that have proven results.  That is simply good<BR>

<P>public policy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  USDA has not taken any specific<BR>

<P>action to redirect funds so that food stamp recipients can<BR>

<P>participate in employment and training programs with proven results. <BR>

<P>Nor has legislation been introduced to amend the Food Stamp Act, as<BR>

<P>required by this recommendation.  However, the Administrator of the<BR>

<P>Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) announced, in a May 1994 letter to<BR>

<P>regional administrators and operators of the Employment and Training<BR>

<P>Program, that FNS has changed its approach to administering this<BR>

<P>program.  The Administrator said that FNS is now trying to target the<BR>

<P>program's funds to specific populations within the eligible food<BR>

<P>stamp recipient population rather than encouraging broad-based,<BR>

<P>low-cost programs.  In addition, FNS officials said that the agency<BR>

<P>has drafted changes that may address this NPR recommendation, but OMB<BR>

<P>has not yet approved these changes.  According to USDA officials,<BR>

<P>identifying programs with proven results is difficult.  In addition,<BR>

<P>officials say, the main problem with the Food Stamp Employment and<BR>

<P>Training Program is not that the program is ineffective but that it<BR>

<P>tries to serve too many people with too few dollars. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Congress enacted the WIC Infant Formula<BR>

<P>Procurement Act of 1992 before the NPR issued its recommendations in<BR>

<P>September 1993.  This act directs USDA to take many of the same<BR>

<P>actions as the NPR.  Hence, when USDA acted to fulfill the act's<BR>

<P>mandates, it also partially implemented this NPR recommendation. <BR>

<P>Recent legislation extends to infant cereal the cost-containment<BR>

<P>contract provisions that currently apply to the procurement of infant<BR>

<P>formula.  In the meantime, USDA has worked with the states to contain<BR>

<P>costs by encouraging competition among producers of infant formula<BR>

<P>and other items in the WIC food package (action item 1) and by<BR>

<P>providing information and technical support to states that are<BR>

<P>soliciting and evaluating bids for WIC contracts (action item 2). <BR>

<P>Recent legislation improves breastfeeding promotion and support. <BR>

<P>USDA is also hiring a consultant to formulate a strategy for<BR>

<P>soliciting funds to support a national campaign to promote<BR>

<P>breastfeeding (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In our February 1994 testimony, which focused on<BR>

<P>the potential for EBT to reduce fraud and abuse and analyzed EBT<BR>

<P>pilot projects, we stated that the cost-effectiveness of EBT as a<BR>

<P>replacement for the coupon-based system for delivering food stamp<BR>

<P>benefits has not been conclusively demonstrated.  Our work to date<BR>

<P>indicates that EBT may prove more useful and cost-effective when it<BR>

<P>is used to deliver benefits for a number of federal and state<BR>

<P>programs and not solely for the Food Stamp Program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 2:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  USDA participated fully and actively in an<BR>

<P>interagency task force that reported to the Vice President in May<BR>

<P>1994 and developed a plan containing 12 recommendations for<BR>

<P>implementing EBT nationwide.  USDA also worked closely with one state<BR>

<P>(Maryland) to implement a statewide EBT system and with six other<BR>

<P>states (Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, and<BR>

<P>Pennsylvania) to implement pilot EBT projects.  Three other states<BR>

<P>(South Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming) have selected vendors to<BR>

<P>implement EBT projects.  In total, 10 states have made progress<BR>

<P>toward deploying EBT; therefore, this NPR recommendation is<BR>

<P>considered partially implemented. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 22<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 22:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Veterans Affairs has partially implemented 4 of its<BR>

<P>16 recommendations and has not implemented, but has taken some action<BR>

<P>on, the remaining 12.  Actions taken have included issuing internal<BR>

<P>policies, establishing implementing committees, testing new<BR>

<P>procedures, installing new equipment in various regional offices,<BR>

<P>conducting customer satisfaction surveys, installing bedside<BR>

<P>telephones in many VA hospitals, and reducing its pharmaceutical<BR>

<P>inventories in centralized warehouses.  Full implementation of 9 of<BR>

<P>the 16 recommendations requires legislative actions that have either<BR>

<P>been eliminated in congressional debate or are unlikely to pass this<BR>

<P>year. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although VA has been taking actions in response to the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations, we have expressed concern regarding the direction<BR>

<P>some of the legislative proposals would have taken the VA.  For<BR>

<P>example, some of the legislative proposals to reform VA's health care<BR>

<P>system would have, we testified in June, 1994, created significant<BR>

<P>risks of increased fraud, waste, and abuse because they would have<BR>

<P>essentially eliminated most internal controls under the personnel and<BR>

<P>contracting laws and regulations.  VA did not appear to be developing<BR>

<P>adequate administrative controls to replace the personnel and<BR>

<P>contracting requirements that would have been eliminated. <BR>

<P>      VETERANS RECORD AND<BR>

<P>      MODERNIZE THE DEPARTMENT'S<BR>

<P>      INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Creation of a master veterans record (MVR) for all VA programs and<BR>

<P>improvements in the Department's information technology will improve<BR>

<P>services to veterans and their families. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Veterans Affairs should move expeditiously to<BR>

<P>strengthen and modernize its information infrastructure, with an<BR>

<P>emphasis on establishing the scope of the MVR. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly support this recommendation and were instrumental<BR>

<P>in getting OMB and VA to establish a formal agreement articulating<BR>

<P>specific service improvement goals in part through the use of<BR>

<P>automation.  The agreement included the creation of a master veterans<BR>

<P>record. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  In February 1994 VA's Master Veterans<BR>

<P>Record (MVR) Working Group issued a MVR requirements study.  The<BR>

<P>study outlines both VA's current business environment and the<BR>

<P>cooperative environment that the MVR will create.  The study<BR>

<P>recommended that MVR information requirements be a departmental<BR>

<P>priority, that short term changes within VA's current technical<BR>

<P>capability be made, and that the MVR Working Group's proposal be used<BR>

<P>as a starting point toward the completion of the technical approach<BR>

<P>to sharing information across the various VA administrations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>An MVR Technical Design Team was established to determine<BR>

<P>alternatives and costs, design the long term solutions, and oversee<BR>

<P>implementation of the MVR.  Pilot testing of information exchange is<BR>

<P>scheduled to begin soon and short term improvements are scheduled to<BR>

<P>be completed by October 1994. <BR>

<P>improve the quality of service and save taxpayer dollars over time. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should continue to ensure that<BR>

<P>the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) modernization plan is<BR>

<P>implemented on schedule and within budget. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Secretary should expeditiously resolve issues of concern<BR>

<P>raised by other executive agencies and congressional oversight<BR>

<P>committees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We fully support efforts to modernize benefits claims<BR>

<P>processing.  VA, based on our recommendations, is currently analyzing<BR>

<P>its business practices as one of the initial steps in reengineering<BR>

<P>benefits claims processing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  VA has installed Phase I equipment at<BR>

<P>49 of its 58 regional offices and the installation is continuing. <BR>

<P>The Phase II contract is expected to be awarded by the end of this<BR>

<P>fiscal year, if funded.  Currently funding has not been authorized. <BR>

<P>Obligation authority for Phase III has been delayed until September<BR>

<P>1995 and VA is currently revising its implementation schedule. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Conversion and redesign of information support is expected to be<BR>

<P>completed by fiscal year 2000.  Twelve interim support projects which<BR>

<P>should provide moderate improvements are expected to be deployed<BR>

<P>during fiscal years 1994 and 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VA is covered by a number of special legislative requirements,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Eliminate travel, training, and personnel restrictions (including<BR>

<P>floors and ceilings) in the Department of Veterans Affairs budget and<BR>

<P>authorizing legislation, and give flexibility to field managers to<BR>

<P>obtain multiyear funding when requested. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the thrust of this<BR>

<P>recommendation and are currently assessing some of the legislative<BR>

<P>barriers that could hinder VA's ability to compete with private<BR>

<P>sector health plans under the President's health reform proposal.  In<BR>

<P>addition, our office and OMB have, for years, been required to<BR>

<P>certify, each time an appropriation bill or continuing resolution is<BR>

<P>enacted, that funds and personnel have been properly released to VA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The Government Reform and Savings Act<BR>

<P>of 1993 (H.R.  3400) would have addressed many of the legislative<BR>

<P>budget constraints by (1) eliminating the hospital and nursing home<BR>

<P>bed capacity requirements, (2) allowing a reduction in the number of<BR>

<P>positions in the Office of Inspector General after notifying the<BR>

<P>appropriate congressional committees and giving them 45 days to act,<BR>

<P>(3) giving VA greater flexibility for administrative reorganizations,<BR>

<P>and (4) eliminating the requirement that VA provide certain health<BR>

<P>care services, leaving the determination to the discretion of the<BR>

<P>Secretary. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The House passed H.R.  3400 on November 22, 1993.  The bill was<BR>

<P>referred to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which reported<BR>

<P>out a new bill, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (S. <BR>

<P>2170), on June 9, 1994.  The Senate bill did not include the VA<BR>

<P>provisions and was enacted into law as Public Law 103-356 on October<BR>

<P>13, 1994.  The language VA included in its fiscal year 1995 budget<BR>

<P>request was not included in the final appropriation bill. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Health Security Act (H.R.  3600), as introduced, would have gone<BR>

<P>even further, allowing VA to establish its own personnel system and<BR>

<P>exempting it from most current federal personnel laws and<BR>

<P>regulations, allowing VA to complete administrative reorganizations<BR>

<P>without notifying Congress, and establishing a series of new revenue<BR>

<P>sources to decrease VA's reliance on appropriations.  H.R.  3600, as<BR>

<P>amended by the House Veterans Affairs Committee, would have provided<BR>

<P>guaranteed payments for VA health plans, further reducing VA's<BR>

<P>dependence on annual appropriations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Further action is not anticipated in the 103rd Congress on either the<BR>

<P>original Health Security Act or the proposals that replaced it. <BR>

<P>      CLAIMS PROCESSING<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VA should examine the usefulness of a New York Regional Office<BR>

<P>approach to benefits claims processing that promises to streamline<BR>

<P>the process.  It should also examine regional staffing. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Department of Veterans Affairs should assess the performance<BR>

<P>of the prototype Self-Directed Work Teams established in the VBA's<BR>

<P>New York Regional Office.  It should closely monitor the progress of<BR>

<P>similar, ongoing reinvention initiatives in other VBA regional<BR>

<P>offices.  Improved business practices identified through these<BR>

<P>initiatives should be implemented, where appropriate, throughout<BR>

<P>VBA's 58 regional offices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The VA should ensure that staffing and other resources allocated<BR>

<P>to the adjudication process are commensurate with the quantity and<BR>

<P>complexity of the workload in each of VBA's regional offices.  3. <BR>

<P>The Veterans' Appeals Improvement Act of 1993 should be enacted into<BR>

<P>law. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that benefit claims processing should be<BR>

<P>streamlined and are currently examining VA's efforts to stre<BR>

<P>the process in all regions.  As part of that review, we assessed the<BR>

<P>New York Regional Office project. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  VA plans to expand the experimental<BR>

<P>claims processing concept used in the New York Regional Office and<BR>

<P>other regional offices by the end of the fiscal year.  Experiments in<BR>

<P>other regional offices are under evaluation.  VA has received a<BR>

<P>contractor's study on its resource allocation model, and will test<BR>

<P>this model during fiscal year 1995 before implementing it during the<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1996 budget cycle. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although the provisions for improving the operations of the Board of<BR>

<P>Veterans' Appeals were contained in H.R.  3400, they were removed and<BR>

<P>introduced in the Board of Veterans' Appeals Administrative<BR>

<P>Procedures Improvement Act of 1994 (S.  1904) to expedite<BR>

<P>consideration.  Both houses passed separate versions of the<BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Department of Veterans Affairs should revise its policy to<BR>

<P>all collection costs for all categories of Veterans Health<BR>

<P>Administration (VHA) receivables. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  VA should seek legislative authority to enable the MCCR Program<BR>

<P>year revenues that exceed projected total collections, as a<BR>

<P>gain-sharing incentive to optimize cost recoveries. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support actions to allow VA to use a portion of recovery<BR>

<P>funds to defray debt collection costs; such action, however, has<BR>

<P>already been taken and no further revisions are needed.  NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendation does not address many other important aspects of cost<BR>

<P>recovery, such as income verification and establishing billing rates. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that decisionmaking can often be<BR>

<P>decentralized, but have repeatedly found problems in VA's efforts to<BR>

<P>implement legislative and administrative policies because too much<BR>

<P>autonomy was given to medical centers.  VA currently operates a<BR>

<P>decentralized medical care system and the VA Central Office is<BR>

<P>reluctant to direct field facilities to take action to correct<BR>

<P>operational problems.  While we agree, in theory, with delegating<BR>

<P>decisionmaking to field staff, our transition series report documents<BR>

<P>repeated problems in correcting operational problems and implementing<BR>

<P>legislative initiatives because field facilities were given too much<BR>

<P>autonomy and were not held accountable for taking corrective actions. <BR>

<P>There needs to be a balance between giving field facilities increased<BR>

<P>flexibility in designing corrective actions and implementing policies<BR>

<P>and retaining central office oversight to ensure that those actions<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  VA completed surveys to identify areas where<BR>

<P>improved customer service is needed and, in August 1994, issued a<BR>

<P>customer service plan.  Improvements appear to have occurred under<BR>

<P>VA's claims processing initiative in its New York Regional Office<BR>

<P>benefits program in New York but the limited data available do not<BR>

<P>yet indicate improved timeliness.  According to the VA, it has also<BR>

<P>placed an increased emphasis on involving veterans service<BR>

<P>organizations in key decisions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Bedside telephones have been installed in 40 of VA's 172 hospitals<BR>

<P>through a joint effort between VA and PT Phone Home, a volunteer,<BR>

<P>charitable organization that includes many of the largest<BR>

<P>communications companies in the United States and donated skilled<BR>

<P>labor from the Communication Workers of America and the International<BR>

<P>Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  VA estimates that this<BR>

<P>arrangement will result in installation of bedside telephones in all<BR>

<P>VA hospitals by 1996 at a savings to the government of $189 million. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have not done any work specifically<BR>

<P>addressing this recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  VA is about three-quarters through<BR>

<P>implementing this recommendation.  The pharmaceutical inventory in<BR>

<P>VA's depots has decreased from about $40 million to about $500,000. <BR>

<P>VA now contracts with prime vendors to provide pharmaceuticals.  VA<BR>

<P>has not yet awarded prime vendor contracts for its medical surgical<BR>

<P>supplies, but is in the process of awarding prime vendors contracts<BR>

<P>for its hospital food supplies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although VA is converting to a just-in-time delivery system, some of<BR>

<P>the functions at the depots will still remain and, therefore, the<BR>

<P>depots will not be completely closed down.  For example, VA's<BR>

<P>distribution of American flags to the families of deceased veterans<BR>

<P>will be retained at the Hines depot and the quality assurance<BR>

<P>functions (installing and testing radiology and laundry equipment,<BR>

<P>processing precious metals, etc.) will be retained at the Sommerville<BR>

<P>depot.  VA is currently using about 25,000 to 30,000 square feet of<BR>

<P>the approximately 1 million square feet of space at the Sommerville<BR>

<P>depot. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 22:2.12<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VA should expand its use of electronic media to reduce paperwork and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.12.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Department of Veterans Affairs should expand its use of<BR>

<P>electronic data interchange (EDI) for invoicing, government bills of<BR>

<P>lading (GBL), and purchase orders, and analyze the cost-effectiveness<BR>

<P>of EDI applications in VHA and VBA programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  VA should seek to implement electronic funds transfer (EFT) for<BR>

<P>compensation and pension beneficiaries who do not now use it. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  VA should work with the Department of the Treasury to develop a<BR>

<P>the accuracy of payments and cut administrative costs, even though we<BR>

<P>have not done any work looking specifically at electronic fund<BR>

<P>transfers for payment of VA compensation and pension benefits.  We<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.12.3<BR> 

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  VA has formed an interdisciplinary<BR>

<P>work group to formulate a short term plan to enhance its existing<BR>

<P>Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data Exchange Program and to meet the<BR>

<P>initial requirements of the Federal Electronic Commerce Acquisition<BR>

<P>Team.  Development plans, which include detailed tasks and<BR>

<P>organizational responsibilities, indicate VA should complete work on<BR>

<P>this recommendation in late 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Treasury signed a<BR>

<P>Memorandum of Agreement on September 9, 1994, to complete a series of<BR>

<P>NPR &quot;electronic commerce&quot; initiatives.  These initiatives will be<BR>

<P>implemented over the next several months to improve existing<BR>

<P>financial operations, and may enhance many systems maintained by VA<BR>

<P>for benefit, administrative, and vendor payments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Finally, VA and Treasury are conducting a test of electronic benefits<BR>

<P>transfer for beneficiaries in the Dallas and Houston, Texas areas. <BR>

<P>This test will be completed in December 1994 and the results will be<BR>

<P>evaluated at that time. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly support the elimination of sunset dates. <BR>

<P>Establishing sunset dates gives the illusion of additional cost<BR>

<P>savings when the measures are reauthorized.  Our prior work has been<BR>

<P>instrumental in getting sunset provisions extended with respect to<BR>

<P>using VA, IRS, and SSA records to verify veterans' reported incomes<BR>

<P>for VA health care and pension benefits determinations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Equally important, however, is prompt implementation of cost saving<BR>

<P>measures once they are enacted.  As we point out in our 1992<BR>

<P>transition series report, slow implementation of legislative<BR>

<P>initiatives cost VA an estimated $120 million in copayment revenues<BR>

<P>from veterans who underreported their incomes to VA.  Although the<BR>

<P>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 extended the sunset date<BR>

<P>another 5 years, no savings will occur unless VA implements the<BR>

<P>policies for using tax records to verify veterans' reported incomes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.15.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly agree that restructuring of the veterans' health<BR>

<P>care system is needed with or without national health reform.  NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendation, however, lacks specificity and VA is already<BR>

<P>reexamining its role.  Through a series of completed and ongoing<BR>

<P>assignments, we are assessing the reasonableness of VA's plans.  As<BR>

<P>discussed in our transition series report, we believe Congress should<BR>

<P>consider limiting construction of additional VA acute care capacity<BR>

<P>until the reformed health care system takes shape and VA's role in<BR>

<P>that system is defined. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.15.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  There is little prospect for major<BR>

<P>health reform, either nationally or in many of the states considering<BR>

<P>comprehensive reforms, this year.  In addition, both the<BR>

<P>administration's proposals and the minority party's health reform<BR>

<P>proposal<BR>

<P>(S.  2374) focused primarily on preserving the acute care system. <BR>

<P>Only<BR>

<P>H.R.  3600 would have made significant changes in nursing home<BR>

<P>coverage and eligibility for VA services not included in the standard<BR>

<P>benefit package.  Regardless of whether there is health reform this<BR>

<P>year, there will continue to be a need to restructure the VA health<BR>

<P>care system to better meet the health care needs of veterans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In the fall of 1993, VA established a National Health Care Reform<BR>

<P>Office to develop plans for transforming VA health care facilities<BR>

<P>into a series of managed care plans in anticipation that some<BR>

<P>elements of the veterans' health care provisions of the<BR>

<P>administration's Health Security Act would be included in any final<BR>

<P>health reform legislation.  The reform office held a series of<BR>

<P>working group sessions in January 1994 to identify and address<BR>

<P>barriers to VA managed care and, in May 1994, issued a report<BR>

<P>containing a framework for reform. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The reform office is also monitoring other reform proposals and<BR>

<P>legislation enacted or proposed in the states.  VA is currently<BR>

<P>evaluating proposals to establish pilot projects in up to five states<BR>

<P>that have enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation.  The<BR>

<P>pilot projects would test certain recommendations to allow VA to<BR>

<P>better compete in a health care reform environment.  VA believes the<BR>

<P>pilot programs can be implemented without enactment of specific<BR>

<P>legislation. <BR>

<P>      VETERANS' INSURANCE PROGRAM<BR>

<P>      FROM PREMIUMS AND DIVIDENDS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 22:2.16<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VA should be permitted to recover certain insurance program costs<BR>

<P>from insurance trust fund surpluses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.16.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Department of Veterans Affairs should work with Congress to amend<BR>

<P>title 38 of the U.S.  Code to permit the payment of administrative<BR>

<P>expenses of the United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI),<BR>

<P>National Service Life Insurance (NSLI), and Veterans Special Life<BR>

<P>Insurance (VSLI) programs from their trust fund surpluses. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.16.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly support this position and recommended such action<BR>

<P>in a March 1992 report.  VA has proposed legislation to amend title<BR>

<P>38 of the U.S.  Code to allow administrative costs for three programs<BR>

<P>to be paid from insurance trust fund earnings.  At that time, GAO<BR>

<P>estimated that 5-year savings would be about $150 million and would<BR>

<P>cost the average policyholder about $11 a year in reduced dividends. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 22:2.16.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  To implement this recommendation, VA<BR>

<P>proposed using excess program income to fund the administrative<BR>

<P>expenses of its insurance programs.  VA included this provision in<BR>

<P>its fiscal year 1995 budget proposal to Congress.  VA estimates that<BR>

<P>this provision would save about $30 million in fiscal year 1995 and<BR>

<P>$113 million over 5 years.  This provision was removed by the House<BR>

<P>Committee on Veterans Affairs when it considered VA's submission. <BR>

<P>Paid From Excess Funds (GAO/HRD-92-42, Mar.  10, 1992). <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 27<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 27:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although management reform efforts (e.g., GPRA and performance<BR>

<P>agreements) have been partially implemented, action on<BR>

<P>recommendations specific to the budget process have been mixed. <BR>

<P>Congress has in several cases already addressed recommendations<BR>

<P>through specific agency appropriations requests, (e.g., multiyear and<BR>

<P>no-year appropriations, budget account restructuring, and roll over<BR>

<P>of unobligated balances).  However, recommendations that call for<BR>

<P>governmentwide authorities or seek to change the nature or extent of<BR>

<P>legislative oversight have not been accepted, (e.g., biennial<BR>

<P>appropriations and elimination of earmarkings).  Other<BR>

<P>recommendations, such as expedited rescission authority, biennial<BR>

<P>budget resolution, and biennial appropriations processes have been<BR>

<P>made and are awaiting final congressional action.  Actions to revise<BR>

<P>executive branch internal processes have been taken, notably the<BR>

<P>executive budget formulation, although some pre-date NPR, (e.g.,<BR>

<P>simplification of the apportionment process).  Finally, some<BR>

<P>recommendations lack a strategy for implementation, (e.g., eliminate<BR>

<P>FTE controls and manage on the basis of operating costs). <BR>

<P>

<P>Susan J.  Irving, Associate Director, Budget Issues, Accounting and<BR>

<P>Information Management Division, (202) 512-9142. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      BGT01:  DEVELOP PERFORMANCE<BR>

<P>      AGREEMENTS WITH SENIOR<BR>

<P>      POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THAT<BR>

<P>      REFLECT ORGANIZATIONAL AND<BR>

<P>      POLICY GOALS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President should develop performance agreements with agency<BR>

<P>heads, starting with the top two dozen.  Agency heads should also use<BR>

<P>performance agreements within their agency to forge an effective team<BR>

<P>committed to achieving organizational goals and objectives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Developing such agreements can help focus efforts on key<BR>

<P>priorities in each agency and help achieve the results-oriented<BR>

<P>environment that we believe is needed to improve effective delivery<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse the importance of agencies and Congress reaching<BR>

<P>agreement on (1) agency mission and realistic, outcome-oriented<BR>

<P>goals, (2) developing measures of performance in terms of those<BR>

<P>goals, and (3) publicly reporting results.  We believe that this<BR>

<P>management framework--which is set forth in GPRA--could serve as the<BR>

<P>foundation for a broad range of efforts to improve federal<BR>

<P>management.  Providing managers with the tools and incentives they<BR>

<P>need to achieve their missions will be critical if results-oriented<BR>

<P>management is to increase the effectiveness of federal programs. <BR>

<P>However, coming to agreement on outcome-oriented goals and objectives<BR>

<P>and indicators of performance will be difficult and take time.  We<BR>

<P>strongly endorse the need for agencies to begin preparing now for<BR>

<P>implementation of GPRA by defining mission statements, developing<BR>

<P>strategic plans, and identifying and developing performance measures. <BR>

<P>The success of GPRA will depend in part, however, on achieving the<BR>

<P>goals of the CFO legislation for generating reliable financial<BR>

<P>information and accurate operating cost data. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also endorse designating as pilots several multi-agency efforts<BR>

<P>with related programs and functions, and development of common<BR>

<P>measures and data collection efforts for crosscutting issues.  In<BR>

<P>this way, various implementation strategies can be explored and<BR>

<P>lessons can be learned about best practices in forging critical<BR>

<P>crosscutting linkages across the federal government and with state<BR>

<P>and local governments as well. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  GPRA requires that the Office of Management<BR>

<P>and Budget (OMB) designate at least 10 agencies as pilot projects in<BR>

<P>performance measurement for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. <BR>

<P>However, as an indication of the widespread interest in<BR>

<P>results-oriented management, more than 70 pilots in 27 departments<BR>

<P>and agencies were designated for the 3-year performance measurement<BR>

<P>pilots.  These pilot projects range in size from small programs to<BR>

<P>entire agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Social<BR>

<P>Security Administration, and the Defense Logistics Agency. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB reviewed more than 50 performance plans prepared by designated<BR>

<P>GPRA pilots for fiscal year 1994 and provided feedback to agencies to<BR>

<P>improve the fiscal year 1995 plans.  OMB, however, has not<BR>

<P>aggressively sought to develop common measures, a position we<BR>

<P>generally endorse as appropriate during a pilot phase.  With agencies<BR>

<P>in the leadership role, OMB gives the agencies substantial discretion<BR>

<P>in defining goals and performance indicators and in carrying out<BR>

<P>their responsibilities under the act. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  The degree of overitemization is a matter<BR>

<P>of interpretation and political judgment, potentially affecting the<BR>

<P>balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. <BR>

<P>Changing the account structure is not simply a matter of management<BR>

<P>flexibility.  An examination of the structure and number of<BR>

<P>appropriation accounts, however, could provide useful information for<BR>

<P>consideration of changes in the current structure and how such<BR>

<P>changes would affect oversight.  It also will be necessary--although<BR>

<P>conceptually difficult--to identify direct operating costs if the<BR>

<P>focus of government management is to be on cost-effective<BR>

<P>performance.  Harmonizing this approach with existing program<BR>

<P>definitions and budgetary account structures will present difficult<BR>

<P>problems, which the administration and Congress will need to resolve. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  OMB has established a working group to<BR>

<P>study better ways to align program inputs with outputs through budget<BR>

<P>account restructuring.  According to OMB, however, defining or<BR>

<P>identifying operating costs is not part of its task.  As a result of<BR>

<P>its work, OMB's Circular A-11 requires agencies in their<BR>

<P>justification materials to show the relationship between major<BR>

<P>programs and budget account structures where they do not coincide. <BR>

<P>The agency may also describe in narrative statements the total costs<BR>

<P>and sources of funding for programs when the total financing needed<BR>

<P>to conduct a major program is not contained within a single budget<BR>

<P>account. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR's September 1994 Status Report did not provide details on the<BR>

<P>approximately one-third of the agencies that reported that they had<BR>

<P>(1) restructured their budget accounts to reduce over-itemization and<BR>

<P>(2) identified direct operating costs.  An NPR official said that the<BR>

<P>NPR relied on what agencies reported and did not verify the<BR>

<P>information or how it was derived. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB staff have been advised to work with the agencies to respond to<BR>

<P>concerns about the apportionment process.  While no formal guidance<BR>

<P>has been issued, OMB for several years has offered some agencies a<BR>

<P>simplified apportionment approval process--letter apportioning--which<BR>

<P>reduces paperwork and gives agencies increased control over the rate<BR>

<P>in which they obligate funds. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to OMB, agencies have the lead in (1) identifying and<BR>

<P>proposing changes to earmarks and restrictions in appropriations<BR>

<P>language and (2) reducing the complexity of their financial operating<BR>

<P>plans.  OMB officials did not provide any evidence or examples of<BR>

<P>agency action. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 27:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  This recommendation seeks to change the<BR>

<P>nature--and perhaps the extent--of legislative oversight.  Pending<BR>

<P>development of alternatives, employment ceilings and floors are both<BR>

<P>means by which Congress expresses its intentions on priorities. <BR>

<P>Ceilings seek to affect total personnel resources whereas floors are<BR>

<P>directed at the allocation of resources.  As NPR recognizes,<BR>

<P>implementation of this proposal is currently not possible because the<BR>

<P>Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 mandates reductions in<BR>

<P>the size of the federal workforce using FTEs as the measure. <BR>

<P>Additionally, there are conceptual and practical difficulties<BR>

<P>involved in defining operating costs.  The Federal Accounting<BR>

<P>Standards Advisory Board is planning to issue an exposure draft on<BR>

<P>management cost standards in the fall of 1994, with final recommended<BR>

<P>standards planned to be released in Spring 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It has consistently been GAO's position that workforce requirements<BR>

<P>and personnel management decisions should be based on appropriate and<BR>

<P>credible workforce planning systems and procedures.  During times of<BR>

<P>increasing fiscal constraints, it is even more important that<BR>

<P>agencies develop well conceived implementation plans to achieve the<BR>

<P>agreed upon reductions in federal workforce levels to minimize the<BR>

<P>impact on agency and program effectiveness.  However, until a tenable<BR>

<P>alternative is developed, monitoring by FTEs will continue to be<BR>

<P>agencies to consider requesting appropriations with multiyear<BR>

<P>availability, particularly for fixed capital assets with long<BR>

<P>acquisition cycles. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A general provision in the fiscal year 1995 Treasury, Postal Service,<BR>

<P>and General Government Appropriations Act allows agencies covered by<BR>

<P>salaries and expenses accounts to the next fiscal year.  However,<BR>

<P>pre-approval by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations is<BR>

<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  In two recent testimonies we concluded<BR>

<P>that current rescission procedures were working as originally<BR>

<P>intended by Congress.  Rescissions can only have a relatively small<BR>

<P>influence on budgetary totals and deficits of today's magnitude. <BR>

<P>Therefore, in our testimonies we concluded that any change in the<BR>

<P>current rescission procedure should be viewed as a question of the<BR>

<P>relative balance of power between the President and Congress. <BR>

<P>IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICES (ICS)<BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 26<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The administration substantially implemented the NPR's recommendation<BR>

<P>to establish an overall policy for providing quality services to the<BR>

<P>public by issuing Executive Order 12862 &quot;Setting Customer Service<BR>

<P>Standards&quot; (September 1993).  The order required all agencies that<BR>

<P>provided services directly to the public to, among other things,<BR>

<P>survey customers, establish service quality standards, measure<BR>

<P>performance against the standards, and address customer complaints. <BR>

<P>According to an NPR official and the NPR report Putting Customers<BR>

<P>First:  Standards for Serving the American People, many agencies had<BR>

<P>surveyed their customers about their service needs and established<BR>

<P>standards for service delivery.  The NPR official said that the next<BR>

<P>step for agencies will be to measure their performance against the<BR>

<P>standards and report the results to the public.  The official could<BR>

<P>not verify that all agencies that provided services directly to the<BR>

<P>public had initiated customer service programs.  However, the<BR>

<P>official said that NPR had coordinated with OMB to identify agencies<BR>

<P>with major service delivery programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In response to the NPR's agency-specific recommendations, the Social<BR>

<P>Security Administration (SSA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),<BR>

<P>and the Postal Service each had made progress.  SSA surveyed its<BR>

<P>customers and posted service standards in each of its field offices. <BR>

<P>The SSA had plans to update its strategic plan based on its customer<BR>

<P>survey results.  The IRS published customer service standards and<BR>

<P>planned to post these standards in field locations and include the<BR>

<P>standards in its January 1995 mailing to taxpayers.  The IRS also<BR>

<P>worked to increase the electronic transmission of refund data to the<BR>

<P>Financial Management Service (FMS) to speed up the payment of tax<BR>

<P>refunds.  Postal Service officials said that 75 percent of its post<BR>

<P>offices had posted the 5-minute wait standard.  They also said that<BR>

<P>they encouraged post offices to display and promote the local<BR>

<P>telephone number for the 24-hour information line using brochures or<BR>

<P>other means.  They said they were still planning how to display their<BR>

<P>first-class mail delivery standards.  However, it should be noted<BR>

<P>that these recommendations involve publishing or displaying<BR>

<P>performance standards, not taking action to meet those standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Officials in OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs<BR>

<P>(OIRA) said they streamlined the approval process for over 20<BR>

<P>agencies that sought to conduct voluntary surveys of their customers. <BR>

<P>OIRA officials said that under the streamlined process, OIRA reviewed<BR>

<P>and acted on agencies' applications for generic classes of voluntary<BR>

<P>customer surveys within 2 weeks compared to up to 90 days under the<BR>

<P>old process. <BR>

<P>
<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      ICS01:  CREATE<BR>

<P>      CUSTOMER-DRIVEN PROGRAMS IN<BR>

<P>      ALL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES<BR>

<P>      THAT PROVIDE SERVICES<BR>

<P>      DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Establish an overall policy for quality of federal services delivered<BR>

<P>to the public and initiate customer service programs in all agencies<BR>

<P>that provide services directly to the public. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Establish an overall policy for the quality of federal services<BR>

<P>delivered to the public, and initiate customer service programs in<BR>

<P>all agencies that provide services directly to the public. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly advocate the creation of such a policy, which<BR>

<P>could foster good public relations and timely service to citizens. <BR>

<P>We have recommended that a governmentwide focus on citizen's needs be<BR>

<P>the foundation for the government's management and reorganization. <BR>

<P>Further, we have supported a customer-oriented approach in individual<BR>

<P>federal agencies.  Also, we have suggested incorporating the needs of<BR>

<P>the American public in developing information technology strategies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It should be noted that many government services are provided to the<BR>

<P>public through third parties, such as housing administrations or<BR>

<P>medical insurance providers.  Our ongoing work suggests that it may<BR>

<P>be appropriate to include requirements for ensuring or measuring<BR>

<P>customer service in the contracts or agreements with such third<BR>

<P>parties.  A pertinent consideration in this regard is whether<BR>

<P>additional government funds would be needed if this were done. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Executive Order 12862 established an overall<BR>

<P>policy for the quality of federal services to the public.  The<BR>

<P>executive order required that all agencies that provided significant<BR>

<P>services directly to the public should strive to provide customer<BR>

<P>service equal to &quot;the best in the business.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Many federal agencies that provide services directly to the public<BR>

<P>have initiated customer service programs.  According to an NPR<BR>

<P>official, 152 federal agencies published more than 1,500 customer<BR>

<P>service standards.  NPR published these standards in the report<BR>

<P>Putting Customers First:  Standards for Serving the American People. <BR>

<P>These agencies also published short, easy-to-read brochures that<BR>

<P>described the service standards customers could expect.  The official<BR>

<P>said that nearly all of the customer service standards resulted from<BR>

<P>customer input obtained through surveys, focus groups, discussion<BR>

<P>groups, or complaint systems.  The official could not verify that all<BR>

<P>agencies that provided services directly to the public had initiated<BR>

<P>customer service programs.  However, the official said that NPR staff<BR>

<P>had worked with agencies and with OMB to ensure that most major<BR>

<P>programs had been covered. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The NPR official said that meeting all the requirements of Executive<BR>

<P>Order 12682 will take time but that agencies had made a good start by<BR>

<P>publishing their standards.  The official said that the next step<BR>

<P>will be for agencies to measure their performance against these<BR>

<P>standards and to align their management systems to support a customer<BR>

<P>focus. <BR>

<P>      PERFORMANCE<BR>

<P>      STANDARDS--INTERNAL REVENUE<BR>

<P>      SERVICE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its participation in NPR, the Internal Revenue Service is<BR>

<P>publishing customer service performance standards.  To speed the<BR>

<P>delivery of taxpayer refunds, the Secretary of the Treasury should<BR>

<P>delegate disbursing authority to IRS in 1993 and future tax seasons. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  As part of its participation in the National Performance Review,<BR>

<P>IRS should publish customer service performance standards, to include<BR>

<P>the following examples. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- A refund due on your paper return will be mailed within 40 days;<BR>

<P>     a refund due on your electronic return will be mailed within 21<BR>

<P>     days when you request a check, or sent within 14 days when you<BR>

<P>     specify direct deposit. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Our goal is to resolve your account inquires in a single<BR>

<P>     contact; if you have a repeat problem you can contact the<BR>

<P>     Problem Resolution Office, which will resolve the problem in an<BR>

<P>     average of 21 days. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- When you provide sufficient and correct information to an IRS<BR>

<P>     tax assistor and get an incorrect answer, we will cancel related<BR>

<P>     penalties. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Let us know where our tax forms or instructions are confusing or<BR>

<P>     difficult--by 1995, we plan to boost the clarity of tax forms<BR>

<P>     and instructions so that 90 percent of individual returns are<BR>

<P>     error-free. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Secretary of the Treasury should delegate disbursing<BR>

<P>authority to IRS for refunds made using electronic funds transfer and<BR>

<P>should, for all other disbursements, expedite efforts to transmit<BR>

<P>refund information electronically between IRS and FMS. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While we agree with the intent of<BR>

<P>publishing customer performance standards and of getting refunds to<BR>

<P>taxpayers in a timely manner, we are unsure whether delegation of<BR>

<P>disbursing authority to IRS is an appropriate means to that end.  We<BR>

<P>would have to know more about the costs and implications of such a<BR>

<P>change. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  According to IRS officials, IRS has expanded<BR>

<P>the customer service standards listed in the NPR accompanying report<BR>

<P>on improving customer service from four to eight, and will publish<BR>

<P>the standards in the tax packages mailed to taxpayers in January<BR>

<P>1995.  The eight standards were included in the IRS Customer Service<BR>

<P>Plan, published in September 1994, and were to be displayed on a<BR>

<P>poster wherever possible in IRS offices and volunteer assistance<BR>

<P>sites.  A communications strategy is being developed to provide news<BR>

<P>releases and fact sheets publicizing and explaining the standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Treasury Department officials said the IRS and the Treasury<BR>

<P>Department have agreed that the Treasury Department should not<BR>

<P>delegate disbursing authority to the IRS for refunds made using<BR>

<P>electronic funds transfer.  The FMS within the Treasury Department<BR>

<P>currently provides the service of issuing both electronic and paper<BR>

<P>refunds to taxpayers on behalf of the IRS because the IRS does not<BR>

<P>have the resources to provide this service.  FMS officials said that<BR>

<P>because they provide the service of obtaining funds from the Federal<BR>

<P>Reserve Bank and issuing payments to individuals for many federal<BR>

<P>agencies, they can provide this service more efficiently than could<BR>

<P>any individual agency.  Beyond efficiency concerns, FMS officials<BR>

<P>said that individual agencies do not want the responsibility of<BR>

<P>certifying that the correct amount of money is issued to the correct<BR>

<P>recipient.  FMS officials also said that the Federal Reserve Bank<BR>

<P>prefers to do business with one intermediary, such as the FMS, rather<BR>

<P>than with many individual agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The IRS and the FMS have taken steps to speed up the electronic<BR>

<P>transmission of refund information from the IRS to the FMS to replace<BR>

<P>the practice of transmitting this data on tapes that have to be<BR>

<P>physically delivered.  IRS and FMS officials said that this is an<BR>

<P>ongoing effort and could not provide a precise timeline as to when it<BR>

<P>would be completed. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its participation in NPR, the Social Security<BR>

<P>Administration is publishing customer service performance standards. <BR>

<P>SSA will also obtain customer opinions on all the goals and<BR>

<P>objectives of their strategic plan, using that input to revise the<BR>

<P>goals and objectives as needed, set priorities, and establish interim<BR>

<P>objectives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  As part of its participation in the National Performance Review,<BR>

<P>SSA should publish nationally and post in each of its offices<BR>

<P>performance standards for customer service. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- You will be treated with courtesy every time you contact us. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- We will provide you with all the information you need in order<BR>

<P>     to understand SSA programs, including your own potential for<BR>

<P>     benefits. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- We will also provide you with information about other social<BR>

<P>     service programs that may help you. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- When you call our 1-800 service for information or help, you<BR>

<P>     will reach us on the first call. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  In addition, SSA should obtain customer opinions on all the goals<BR>

<P>and objectives of the strategic plan, using that input to revise the<BR>

<P>goals and objectives as needed, set priorities, and establish interim<BR>

<P>objectives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse SSA's efforts to improve its customer service<BR>

<P>performance.  We have recently completed audit work suggesting that<BR>

<P>SSA put forth sustained effort to improve management and future<BR>

<P>plans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In February 1994, SSA instructed all of its<BR>

<P>field offices to post the recommended customer service standards on<BR>

<P>signs in both English and Spanish in a prominent, visible location. <BR>

<P>In September 1994, SSA published updated customer service standards. <BR>

<P>These standards were based on the results of SSA's customer survey<BR>

<P>activities, including focus groups, direct surveys, and comment<BR>

<P>cards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SSA officials said that SSA used 26,000 customer comment cards as the<BR>

<P>primary means to survey its customers' opinions on the goals and<BR>

<P>objectives in its strategic plan.  By July 1994, SSA had received<BR>

<P>11,355 responses.  The questions on the comment cards asked the<BR>

<P>respondent to fill in blanks with the amount of time that would<BR>

<P>represent good service for different types of SSA services, such as<BR>

<P>receiving a decision after applying for retirement benefits.  SSA<BR>

<P>officials said the results of the survey were to be used to update<BR>

<P>SSA's strategic plan by the end of 1995. <BR>

<P>      PERFORMANCE<BR>

<P>      STANDARDS--POSTAL SERVICE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its participation in NPR, the U.S.  Postal Service will<BR>

<P>expand its plans to display customer service standards in post office<BR>

<P>retail lobbies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As part of its participation in the National Performance Review, the<BR>

<P>U.S.  Postal Service should expand its plans to display the following<BR>

<P>standards in post office lobbies: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>You can expect first-class mail delivered anywhere in the U.S.  in 3<BR>

<P>days, your local mail overnight;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>you will receive counter service within 5 minutes;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>and you can get postal information 24 hours a day by calling the<BR>

<P>following local number:  (appropriate local numbers will be used). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We fully support the Postal Service's current initiative to<BR>

<P>develop standards to govern the provision of customer services and<BR>

<P>agree that those standards should be fully disclosed to the public. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Postal Service has made progress in<BR>

<P>displaying the three service standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to Postal Service officials, although The Postal Service<BR>

<P>has had internal service targets for the delivery of first class mail<BR>

<P>for over 20 years, these standards had not been prominently displayed<BR>

<P>to postal customers.  An initiative to put large geographic maps<BR>

<P>depicting overnight, 2, and 3-day service areas is in the<BR>

<P>developmental stage.  The Postal Service is planning initially to<BR>

<P>display these maps in the post offices, stations, and branches of the<BR>

<P>96 cities currently covered by the External First-Class Measurement<BR>

<P>System--an independent customer satisfaction survey. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Officials told us that the Postal Service also is in the process of<BR>

<P>displaying the standard that customers will receive service at post<BR>

<P>office counters within 5 minutes.  Postmasters are working toward<BR>

<P>achieving this standard and are posting the standard in each office<BR>

<P>where it has been attained.  Postal Service officials said that to<BR>

<P>date 75 percent of main offices, stations, and branches had posted<BR>

<P>this standard. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Officials told us that the Postal Answer Line (PAL), an automated<BR>

<P>24-hour information source, is available in 81 major metropolitan<BR>

<P>areas, serving over 110 million postal customers.  The Postal Service<BR>

<P>is planning to expand this system to include customers with rotary<BR>

<P>telephones and customers who are hearing impaired.  Postal Service<BR>

<P>officials said that current policies call for post offices to<BR>

<P>publicize the PAL number where it is available in the telephone book<BR>

<P>and in brochures placed in lobbies. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For voluntary information collection requests directed at customers,<BR>

<P>OMB will delegate authority to approve such requests if departments<BR>

<P>certify that they will fully comply with Paperwork Reduction Act<BR>

<P>(PRA) requirements.  OMB will also clarify rules on the use of focus<BR>

<P>groups and streamline renewals of previously approved survey<BR>

<P>requests. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  For voluntary customer surveys, the Office of Management and<BR>

<P>Budget will delegate its survey approval authority under the<BR>

<P>Paperwork Reduction Act to departments that are able to comply with<BR>

<P>the act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Administrator of OIRA should issue guidance on focus groups,<BR>

<P>specifically establishing under what circumstances group discussion<BR>

<P>activities would be excluded from OIRA review. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Administrator of OIRA should greatly simplify and speed<BR>

<P>renewal of previously approved information collection requests (ICR)<BR>

<P>when the questions asked and the recipients of the ICR are unchanged. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree with the thrust of this recommendation to<BR>

<P>streamline the collection of customer satisfaction information. <BR>

<P>However, OMB will need to continue to coordinate agency voluntary<BR>

<P>customer surveys to minimize duplicate requests for information from<BR>

<P>citizens. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 26:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The directors of OMB and OIRA issued<BR>

<P>memoranda to department and agency heads and to OIRA Branch Chiefs<BR>

<P>and Desk Officers outlining initiatives to facilitate the clearance<BR>

<P>of customer surveys. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  According to OIRA officials and memoranda, OIRA has not delegated<BR>

<P>its survey approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act to<BR>

<P>departments that are able to comply with the act.  Instead, OIRA has<BR>

<P>implemented a streamlined process for providing &quot;generic clearances&quot;<BR>

<P>to classes of voluntary customer survey instruments proposed by<BR>

<P>agencies.  For a survey to be voluntary it must be perceived as<BR>

<P>voluntary by the recipients.  To obtain the generic clearance,<BR>

<P>agencies must provide OIRA with general details about the surveys it<BR>

<P>plans to do and certify that the surveys will comply with the<BR>

<P>requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act.  OIRA has committed to<BR>

<P>review agency requests for generic clearances within 2 weeks.  OIRA<BR>

<P>grants the clearances for a 3 year period.  However, as an agency<BR>

<P>issues a survey covered by the generic clearance, it must provide to<BR>

<P>OMB a copy of the survey, a description of how the survey will be<BR>

<P>used, and an estimate of the total hours recipients will spend<BR>

<P>completing the survey.  OIRA officials said that during the past year<BR>

<P>more than 20 departments and agencies received generic clearances<BR>

<P>within two weeks compared to up to 90 days under the old process. <BR>

<P>Although OIRA initially excluded regulatory agencies from the new<BR>

<P>process, OIRA nevertheless has attempted to streamline the approval<BR>

<P>of customer surveys by regulatory agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  OMB issued guidance stating that focus groups fall within the<BR>

<P>coverage of PRA and require OMB clearance, but that a program of<BR>

<P>focus groups designed to elicit customer concerns would be a prime<BR>

<P>candidate for a generic clearance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  OIRA officials said that they are working to simplify and speed<BR>

<P>the renewal of ICRs when the questions asked and the recipients of<BR>

<P>the ICR are unchanged.  For example, OIRA has expressed a willingness<BR>

<P>to shorten the time it reserves for public comment on ICR renewals<BR>

<P>because they are generally uncontroversial. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 4:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOD has made some progress in implementing its 12 NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations.  One of the recommendations has been fully<BR>

<P>implemented, and the remainder have advanced to some degree.  Five of<BR>

<P>the recommendations have been partially implemented and the remaining<BR>

<P>six have not been implemented, but some action has been taken.  DOD<BR>

<P>does not expect to finish implementation of some recommendations<BR>

<P>until as late as the year 2000.  We believe adopting the<BR>

<P>recommendations throughout an organization as large as DOD could<BR>

<P>require an even longer period of time. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Many of NPR's recommended improvements to DOD operations are in line<BR>

<P>with the thrust of our reports and testimonies presented over the<BR>

<P>last several years.  If properly implemented, these actions could<BR>

<P>result in substantially greater efficiencies in DOD operations.  When<BR>

<P>changing existing operations, however, we believe that it is<BR>

<P>important to understand why existing procedures were put in place so<BR>

<P>as to avoid the possibility of making costly mistakes.  In addition<BR>

<P>to implementing the NPR recommendations, we believe that DOD must<BR>

<P>improve its financial management systems and internal controls as<BR>

<P>well as its inventory management. <BR>

<P>
<P>      DOD01:  REWRITE POLICY<BR>

<P>      DIRECTIVES TO INCLUDE BETTER<BR>

<P>      GUIDANCE AND FEWER<BR>

<P>      PROCEDURES<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOD should clarify policy directives and procedures to reduce<BR>

<P>administrative burden and unnecessary regulatory controls. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse efforts to clarify the policy directives to reduce<BR>

<P>unnecessary procedures and controls.  However, there are risks that<BR>

<P>must be considered.  Directives were created based on extensive<BR>

<P>experience and lessons learned.  Changing existing directives without<BR>

<P>adequate consideration of what brought about the original directives<BR>

<P>invites a repetition of costly mistakes.  Revisions to existing<BR>

<P>directives should ensure that appropriate checks and balances are<BR>

<P>maintained. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On June 24, 1994, DOD Directive 5025.1 was<BR>

<P>issued which declared that there shall be a single streamlined system<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We are not familiar with the DOD<BR>

<P>experiment called the Unified Budget Test referred to in the NPR<BR>

<P>report and therefore cannot comment on this recommendation<BR>

<P>specifically.  While this overall recommendation is broadly worded,<BR>

<P>the elaboration of the recommendation and the discussion concerning<BR>

<P>minimizing budget restrictions in the NPR report as it relates to DOD<BR>

<P>appear to focus on the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) portion of<BR>

<P>the budget.  DOD's budget is divided into six major appropriations<BR>

<P>categories--military personnel; O&amp;M; procurement; research<BR>

<P>development, test, and evaluation; military construction; and family<BR>

<P>housing.  The O&amp;M account represents the largest portion of the<BR>

<P>proposed fiscal year 1995 DOD budget--almost 37 percent and $93<BR>

<P>billion.  The O&amp;M budget is further subdivided by DOD components and<BR>

<P>then again within these components.  This recommendation is not clear<BR>

<P>as to how high a level of aggregation of the O&amp;M budget is desirable<BR>

<P>or how a unified budget would be affected by the lack of needed<BR>

<P>improvements in DOD's financial management systems and internal<BR>

<P>President's fiscal year 1995 budget to permit family housing costs to<BR>

<P>be incurred in the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) account if funds<BR>

<P>are available from base support savings.  The funds are not to exceed<BR>

<P>$25 million for the Army, $25 million for the Air Force, $20 million<BR>

<P>for the Navy, and $5 million for the Marine Corps.  DOD believes this<BR>

<P>change would provide flexibility in responding to emergencies.  DOD<BR>

<P>is also reviewing policies to allow DOD components to incur costs for<BR>

<P>non-centrally managed equipment requirements in their O&amp;M account. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree with this recommendation and would support an<BR>

<P>approach where functions are outsourced on a case by case basis.  For<BR>

<P>example, we recently reviewed a price comparison of DOD printing<BR>

<P>operations and found that, like other price comparisons done in the<BR>

<P>past, the recent one, drawn largely from DOD facilities in the<BR>

<P>Washington area, showed that significant savings could be achieved if<BR>

<P>more of DOD's printing and duplicating work were procured<BR>

<P>commercially rather than being performed in-house.  We are doing<BR>

<P>additional price comparisons to determine the extent to which DOD<BR>

<P>printing and duplicating savings can be achieved nationwide.  Similar<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation proposes giving managers and commanders the<BR>

<P>ability to generate income at the installation level by allowing the<BR>

<P>Corps of Engineers to recover its costs for processing certain<BR>

<P>commercial applications and by establishing goals for solid waste<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We have not done specific work regarding<BR>

<P>whether the Corps of Engineers should attempt to generate income to<BR>

<P>recover costs at the installation level.  Consequently, we are not in<BR>

<P>a position to address this matter regarding the Corps. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We have, however, reviewed DOD's resource recovery and recycling<BR>

<P>program.  Our report, Widespread Abuse in Recycling Program Increases<BR>

<P>Funds for Recreation Activities issued in December 1993, looked at<BR>

<P>DOD units other than the Corps of Engineers and found widespread<BR>

<P>abuse in the recycling program.  Millions of dollars were being used<BR>

<P>annually for morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) activities that<BR>

<P>should have been used instead to offset the need for appropriated<BR>

<P>funds or be returned to the U.S.  Treasury.  We reported that this<BR>

<P>was occurring because military bases were routinely receiving money<BR>

<P>from the sale of aircraft, vehicles, and other materials that DOD<BR>

<P>policy specifically excluded from the recycling program and then were<BR>

<P>using the proceeds to fund MWR activities.  Although the purpose of<BR>

<P>the program is to reduce the volume of items going to the waste<BR>

<P>stream, we found that about 90 percent of the program's proceeds<BR>

<P>appeared to represent excluded items and items that would not go into<BR>

<P>the waste stream. <BR>

<P>collected for the recover of costs associated with the preparation of<BR>

<P>environmental impact statements and for wetlands delineations. <BR>

<P>Congress also considered the Government Reform and Savings Act of<BR>

<P>associated fund is effectively managed.  However, our experience with<BR>

<P>DOD's capital asset program, now funded under the Defense Business<BR>

<P>Operations Fund, has not been good.  DOD has not established adequate<BR>

<P>procedures, including controls over revenues and expenditures and<BR>

<P>separate reserve accounts, to accurately track and account for<BR>

<P>capital asset revenues, obligations, and expenditures.  These<BR>

<P>weaknesses have raised questions about appropriate funding levels,<BR>

<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly support the idea of using quality<BR>

<P>management concepts at all levels in DOD.  We support DOD's using<BR>

<P>these concepts to pursue an organizational culture that is devoted to<BR>

<P>continuous improvement; the quest for more economic, efficient, and<BR>

<P>effective operations in all activities; and the pilot testing and<BR>

<P>departmentwide implementation of the best management practices in the<BR>

<P>public and private sectors.  While we have not specifically<BR>

<P>recommended that DOD establish a &quot;defense quality workplace,&quot; we have<BR>

<P>reported that DOD needs to change its culture with respect to certain<BR>

<P>areas, such as increasing emphasis on economy and efficiency in<BR>

<P>inventory and supply management, and particularly training, since<BR>

<P>training is a key element in perpetuating cultural change.  We have<BR>

<P>also recommended that DOD pilot test a number of commercial practices<BR>

<P>in an effort to find ways to improve its operations and reported that<BR>

<P>most federal installations that practice Total Quality Management<BR>

<P>benefit in such areas as increased productivity and improved quality,<BR>

<P>timeliness, attention to customer requirements, and problem-solving<BR>

<P>skills. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  A DOD Quality Advisor is in place and is<BR>

<P>working with senior managers on the DOD staff to implement quality<BR>

<P>management.  Curricula are also in place throughout DOD.  The agency<BR>

<P>is currently in the process of training many of its personnel in<BR>

<P>Total Quality Management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Action on other parts of this recommendation is expected to be<BR>

<P>completed by 1998. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 4:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We fully support the prudent use of emerging technology to<BR>

<P>upgrade and improve health care delivery at DOD health care<BR>

<P>facilities.  The primary means for using emerging technology to<BR>

<P>achieve improvements in clinical operations is the Composite Health<BR>

<P>The outpatient and ancillary portions of the system are nearly ready<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.10<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>By giving DOD installation commanders more authority over<BR>

<P>installation management, DOD will be better able to manage its<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Greater empowerment of installation<BR>

<P>commanders to manage is a recommendation that on the surface appears<BR>

<P>to have much merit.  However, the report does not provide sufficient<BR>

<P>information to indicate what additional authorities are intended to<BR>

<P>be granted and/or to what extent those authorities might run counter<BR>

<P>to greater centralization of management functions evident in recent<BR>

<P>Defense Management Review initiatives, such as in the areas of<BR>

<P>finance and accounting and printing.  Nor is it clear to what extent<BR>

<P>such empowerment could result in the transfer of funding designated<BR>

<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  DOD has given this recommendation emphasis by<BR>

<P>creating 21 subelements for it.  As part of developing a cost<BR>

<P>accounting system for installation management, the Defense Finance<BR>

<P>and Accounting Service has issued a functional requirements document<BR>

<P>for the selection of certain systems in the Defense Business<BR>

<P>Operations Fund.  There are, however, areas such as reviewing the<BR>

<P>financial constraints and limitations imposed on installations where<BR>

<P>no plan has been established to accomplish the goal. <BR>

<P>      DOD11:  REDUCE NATIONAL<BR>

<P>      GUARD AND RESERVE COSTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.11<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation makes two changes in the current costs for<BR>

<P>reservists:  (1) to limit compensation of federal employees on<BR>

<P>reserve duty to the greater of civilian or reserve compensation or to<BR>

<P>allow the reservist to take annual leave; and (2) to limit the basic<BR>

<P>allowance for quarters only to reservists who actually bring their<BR>

<P>dependents on short-term duty assignments when quarters are not<BR>

<P>provided to dependents. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  This recommendation has merit from the<BR>

<P>standpoint of eliminating any perceived inequity between the amount<BR>

<P>of government pay provided to federal employees and nonfederal<BR>

<P>employees on reserve duty.  It also recognizes that the existing<BR>

<P>fiscal year impact could grow if pressures continue to build to<BR>

<P>increasingly rely on reservists for periods of extended active duty<BR>

<P>time.  The recommended change would require a change in legislation. <BR>

<P>However, our prior work in reserve issues does not put us in a<BR>

<P>position to gauge the importance of current legislative provisions to<BR>

<P>recruiting or to maintaining needed reserve manning levels, or<BR>

<P>likewise to estimate the likely effect of any legislative change. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 4:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOD believes that two laws, 5 U.S.C. <BR>

<P>section 6323 and 37 U.S.C.  section 403, must be amended to implement<BR>

<P>this recommendation.  Draft legislation has been prepared that would<BR>

<P>change 5 U.S.C.  section 6323, which involves reservist pay.  Under<BR>

<P>this proposal, military basic pay for federal employee reservists<BR>

<P>would be paid only to the extent that it exceeds civilian basic pay<BR>

<P>for periods of military leave.  It would not affect reservists who<BR>

<P>use annual leave for the reserve period.  Draft legislation also has<BR>

<P>been prepared that would eliminate payment of the basic allowance for<BR>

<P>quarters to reservists who are serving on active duty for 15 days or<BR>

<P>less if they are provided quarters by the government and are not<BR>

<P>accompanied by their dependents. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Completion of this effort is not expected before 1996. <BR>

<P>Engineers' division offices was withdrawn by the President in<BR>

<P>November 1993.  The Secretary of the Army through the Acting<BR>

<P>Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASA-CW) is now<BR>

<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------- Section 5:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The majority of the recommendations have not been implemented,<BR>

<P>although action has been initiated to effect the needed changes for<BR>

<P>all but one of the recommendations.  Partly in response to a number<BR>

<P>of recommendations, the Department issued revised regulations,<BR>

<P>changed some of its policies and operating procedures, or took other<BR>

<P>actions to address some of the recommendations, but the effect of<BR>

<P>these actions has yet to be demonstrated.  For other recommendations,<BR>

<P>the legislation needed to implement the suggested changes was not<BR>

<P>enacted in the 103rd Congress.  Neither the Department of Education<BR>

<P>nor the Department of Defense has taken action to consolidate<BR>

<P>National Security Act Programs (ED04). <BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Rigidity in the Chapter 1 program should be replaced by<BR>

<P>accountability for results. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The disincentives created by the use of standardized testing<BR>

<P>should be reversed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Chapter 1 funding should be concentrated on schools serving large<BR>

<P>proportions of low-income students. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Schools and school districts should be permitted to use some<BR>

<P>Chapter 1 funds to identify needed social services and develop<BR>

<P>cooperative arrangements with the other agencies that can provide<BR>

<P>those services. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have recommended better targeting of Chapter 1 funds to<BR>

<P>counties with the most needy students.  Simplified requirements for<BR>

<P>schools receiving federal aid could enable categorical programs to<BR>

<P>better fit into school reform efforts, according to our report on<BR>

<P>systemwide education reform. <BR>

<P>emphasis placed on standardized testing by replacing current testing<BR>

<P>requirements with state-level, multiple measures of student<BR>

<P>performance aligned with state performance standards; (3) includes<BR>

<P>measures to better target Chapter 1 funds on schools serving large<BR>

<P>proportions of low-income students; and (4) permits schools and<BR>

<P>school districts to use some Chapter 1 funds to identify needed<BR>

<P>social services and develop cooperative arrangements with other<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally support reducing the administrative<BR>

<P>burden at federal and local levels.  Although not speaking directly<BR>

<P>to education program consolidation, we have suggested that Congress<BR>

<P>consider simplifying current approaches to assist dislocated workers<BR>

<P>to one that assists workers regardless of the reason for their<BR>

<P>dislocation.  We have also suggested making existing federal<BR>

<P>categorical education programs more conducive to systemwide reform<BR>

<P>while meeting the needs of at-risk students.  Reducing the number of<BR>

<P>programs may be one of many strategies used to do this. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the thrust of this<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Legislation should be enacted to repeal Section 431 of the<BR>

<P>General Education Provisions Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  To shorten the grant application review process, the Department<BR>

<P>of Education should change the policy for receipt of applications to<BR>

<P>require that applications be received by the closing date (not<BR>

<P>postmarked by the closing date), while extending the time available<BR>

<P>for applicants to prepare application packages. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The Department of Education should consider ways to reduce the<BR>

<P>unnecessary paperwork in applying for funding under some<BR>

<P>discretionary grant competitions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Department of Education should give program offices the<BR>

<P>flexibility to eliminate the peer review panel process in cases where<BR>

<P>it adds little benefit to the grant award process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Where panel reviews continue to be used, the Department of<BR>

<P>Education should immediately contract out panel review logistics to a<BR>

<P>single contractor which would perform the function for all program<BR>

<P>offices, including photocopying of applications, booking hotel<BR>

<P>facilities, and other clerical functions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  The Department of Education should develop materials to explain<BR>

<P>better to customers how the department reviews applications so that<BR>

<P>applicants have a better understanding of what happens to an<BR>

<P>application once it reaches the department. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  The Department of Education should reduce the need for<BR>

<P>negotiation with grant recipients by publishing in the Federal<BR>

<P>Register program announcement the maximum amount of grant awards and<BR>

<P>return to the applicant, as disqualified from competition, any<BR>

<P>proposal which exceeds the maximum amount. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  The Department of Education should initiate immediate steps to<BR>

<P>further standardize the negotiation process through staff training. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>9.  The Department of Education should notify applicants of the<BR>

<P>status of their applications and funding as early as possible to help<BR>

<P>applicants plan and, if necessary, seek alternative funding. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>10.  The Department of Education should improve training for program<BR>

<P>and grants specialists so they can better serve their customers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>11.  Grants and Contracts Service (GCS) staff members should rotate<BR>

<P>to program offices and program office staff members should rotate to<BR>

<P>the GCS on detail periodically to remain in touch with, and gain a<BR>

<P>better understanding of, the work of the other part of the<BR>

<P>department. <BR>

<P>
<P>12.  The Department of Education should eliminate the continuation<BR>

<P>application process for budget years within the project period. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>13.  The Department of Education should develop criteria for<BR>

<P>evaluating the quality of a grantee's final program progress report. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>14.  The Department of Education should revise the Education<BR>

<P>Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to allow the<BR>

<P>Secretary of Education to refuse future funding under any department<BR>

<P>program, excluding student aid, to a grantee that has failed to<BR>

<P>submit a final program progress report or has submitted a report of<BR>

<P>unacceptable quality. <BR>

<P>
<P>15.  The Department of Education should use identified risk factors<BR>

<P>to establish priorities in monitoring of grantees. <BR>

<P>and practices; (2) aid in the dissemination of information to<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 5:2.7<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR recommends developing ways of measuring default indicators,<BR>

<P>creating profiles of high-risk institutions, and removing eligibility<BR>

<P>of institutions to participate in federal financial aid programs once<BR>

<P>the schools have become ineligible to receive federal student loan<BR>

<P>funds. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.7.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Legislation should be enacted to allow the Department to<BR>

<P>implement changes in the measures of school quality.  The following<BR>

<P>changes should be considered and used if appropriate: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Development of additional default indicators, including a<BR>

<P>     default rate based on proportion of dollars in default and the<BR>

<P>     percentage of students receiving loans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Creation of profiles of high-risk institutions that are<BR>

<P>     potentially insolvent or likely to misuse student aid funds,<BR>

<P>     which would then be used to concentrate oversight resources on<BR>

<P>     institutions that pose the greatest risk. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Establishment of outcome measures to determine performance of<BR>

<P>     participating schools, regardless of course length.  These<BR>

<P>     measures would include program completion rates, employment and<BR>

<P>     earnings following program completion, and occupational skills<BR>

<P>     testing to determine if students had acquired the knowledge<BR>

<P>     required for the occupation for which the training was<BR>

<P>     undertaken.  Unsatisfactory performance would be grounds for<BR>

<P>     removing an institution's eligibility to participate in the<BR>

<P>     program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Withholding of a certain percentage of funds from the school<BR>

<P>     until a student has successfully completed the program of<BR>

<P>     instruction and been employed for 90 days.  A variation on this<BR>

<P>     theme would be to provide a bonus to the school for successful<BR>

<P>     training, placement, and retention of students. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The Department should move aggressively to implement those<BR>

<P>provisions of the Higher Education Act that became effective July 1,<BR>

<P>1994, which greatly strengthen the program integrity requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 should<BR>

<P>be amended to avoid the effect of the interpretation of the existing<BR>

<P>statute made in recent court decisions.  The amendment should remove<BR>

<P>allegations of improper servicing and collection of loans as a basis<BR>

<P>for contesting the accuracy of cohort default rates. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Legislation should be enacted to provide that once a school has<BR>

<P>been determined to be ineligible for participation in the student<BR>

<P>loan program, it would also become ineligible for all federal student<BR>

<P>aid programs, unless it can be demonstrated that the default rates<BR>

<P>are high because the school serves a historically disadvantaged<BR>

<P>population and the school shows a continuing good-faith effort to<BR>

<P>reduce the default rate. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  The Department should review the accuracy of, then expand, the<BR>

<P>current institutional Quality Assurance Program to provide regulatory<BR>

<P>relief to more institutions with reliable performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Department of Education has developed a<BR>

<P>number of changes through negotiated rulemaking and new &quot;in house&quot;<BR>

<P>procedures to measure school quality.  But additional actions, such<BR>

<P>as implementing performance measures, are needed.  The Department<BR>

<P>disagrees with the recommendation that Congress should remove a<BR>

<P>school's eligibility for participation in all federal student aid<BR>

<P>programs once a school is determined ineligible for participation in<BR>

<P>student loan programs. <BR>

<P>      DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN<BR>

<P>      DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<BR>

<P>-------------------------------------------------------- Section 5:2.9<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Education should create a full spectrum of activities that can<BR>

<P>contribute to career development, including conducting a<BR>

<P>departmentwide assessment of training and development needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.9.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Department of Education should set employee development as a<BR>

<P>priority. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The department should conduct an assessment of the training and<BR>

<P>development needs for each Principal Operating Component and Regional<BR>

<P>Office, and for each individual employee, so that future planning and<BR>

<P>budgeting can be well-grounded in data. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Managers throughout the Department, including Regional Offices,<BR>

<P>should be held accountable for investing in and supporting employee<BR>

<P>development activities by including this as an element in each<BR>

<P>manager's performance plan. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Horace Mann Learning Center (HMLC) should develop generic<BR>

<P>curriculum useful to all employees to support new directions<BR>

<P>indicated by the National Education Goals, such as performance<BR>

<P>measurement; and HMLC should develop alternative means of delivering<BR>

<P>learning services to employees, e.g., the use of distance learning<BR>

<P>and desktop personal computers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Principal Operating Components should be encouraged to make use<BR>

<P>of their own internal staff expertise to provide training events for<BR>

<P>others in the department. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  Employees should be encouraged to develop and implement<BR>

<P>individual development plans that indicate the skill and knowledge<BR>

<P>areas needing attention and the training and development activities<BR>

<P>that will address those areas. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 5:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly recommend these types of actions, which are<BR>

<P>necessary to successfully develop and upgrade the serious skill<BR>

<P>weaknesses of Education staff in such areas as accounting, finance,<BR>

<P>analysis, writing, and management.  This would also function as part<BR>

<P>several internal implementation activities under way.  In the<BR>

<P>Department's strategic plan, employee training and development are<BR>

<P>designated as a high priority.  The Department has established a<BR>

<P>training and development team to reinvent the current training<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The upcoming reauthorization of Office of Educational Research<BR>

<P>and Improvement should include several of the central recommendations<BR>

<P>from the National Academy of Sciences report.  These include: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- A stable and broad-based advisory board--including outstanding<BR>

<P>     researchers, teachers, principals, parents, and state and local<BR>

<P>     officials--should be established and charged with guiding the<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- The board should identify procedures for contracts and grant<BR>

<P>     peer-review panels that ensure that research merit and<BR>

<P>     programmatic merit of proposals are judged only by those with<BR>

<P>     the appropriate professional expertise. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- The currently fragmented education research structure (centers,<BR>

<P>     labs, clearinghouses, etc.) and the functional division of<BR>

<P>     research funding (institution-based, individual, etc.) should be<BR>

<P>     replaced as it becomes feasible by a very few education research<BR>

<P>     and development (R&amp;D) institutes established after the model of<BR>

<P>     the National Institutes of Health.  Each should target a<BR>

<P>     specific problem area with a sustained program of research and<BR>

<P>     development that includes field-initiated efforts,<BR>

<P>     institutionally based R&amp;D, and special projects.  These<BR>

<P>     institutes should be charged with conducting high-quality<BR>

<P>     research and development in support of the national education<BR>

<P>     goals. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- A Reform Assistance Office should be established to coordinate<BR>

<P>     the integration and translation of research into reform<BR>

<P>     assistance efforts. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- OERI should report research findings directly to streamline its<BR>

<P>     work and minimize opportunities for political pressure. <BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although none of the 14 NPR recommendations for which DOI is<BR>

<P>primarily responsible has been fully implemented, action has been<BR>

<P>taken toward implementing all of them.  Five recommendations have<BR>

<P>been partially implemented--to establish a national spatial data<BR>

<P>infrastructure (DOI03), to rationalize federal land ownership<BR>

<P>(DOI06), to improve land acquisition policies (DOI07), to establish a<BR>

<P>system of personnel exchanges (DOI09),and to create a new mission for<BR>

<P>the Bureau of Reclamation (DOI12).  Congressional action is required<BR>

<P>to implement all or part of other recommendations, including those to<BR>

<P>establish a hardrock mine reclamation fund (DOI01), to redefine<BR>

<P>federal oversight of coal mine regulation (DOI02), to promote<BR>

<P>entrepreneurial management of the National Park Service (DOI04), to<BR>

<P>obtain a fair return for federal resources (DOI05), to improve the<BR>

<P>Minerals Management Service's royalty collections (DOI08), and to<BR>

<P>improve the federal helium program (DOI13).  Remaining<BR>

<P>recommendations or action items that agency heads can implement<BR>

<P>themselves have simply taken more than a year to put into effect. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As implementation proceeds, it is becoming increasingly clear that<BR>

<P>many of the recommendations for which DOI is primarily responsible<BR>

<P>are interrelated and interdependent and are merely components of a<BR>

<P>much larger issue--how best to fulfill the federal government's<BR>

<P>stewardship responsibilities, including sustaining multiple uses of<BR>

<P>federal lands and protecting the environment.  For example, 18<BR>

<P>federal agencies--including 9 within DOI, 3 within the Department of<BR>

<P>Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency--have identified<BR>

<P>activities related to a new, broader approach to managing the<BR>

<P>nation's lands and natural resources called &quot;ecosystem management,&quot;<BR>

<P>and the administration's fiscal year 1995 budget proposes to<BR>

<P>implement the NPR's recommendation to develop cross-agency ecosystem<BR>

<P>planning and management (see ENV02).  However, implementing ecosystem<BR>

<P>management will require collecting and linking large volumes of<BR>

<P>scientific and socioeconomic data (DOI03) and managing along<BR>

<P>ecological rather than political or administrative boundaries<BR>

<P>(DOI06).  Implementing this approach could also affect such issues as<BR>

<P>land acquisition policies (DOI07), personnel exchanges (DOI09), and<BR>

<P>the priority given to cleaning up abandoned hardrock mining sites<BR>

<P>(DOI01).  Therefore, it will become increasingly important for these<BR>

<P>agencies to have a shared vision of the future, good systems to<BR>

<P>collect and use data for gauging operational success and<BR>

<P>accountability, and staff with the skills needed to accomplish the<BR>

<P>federal government's stewardship mission. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      DOI01:  ESTABLISH A HARDROCK<BR>

<P>      MINE RECLAMATION FUND TO<BR>

<P>      RESTORE THE ENVIRONMENT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To address health and safety threats and environmental damage caused<BR>

<P>by toxic metal and chemical leaching from abandoned mines, the<BR>

<P>federal government should establish a hardrock mine reclamation fund. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Legislation should be enacted to establish a new hardrock mine<BR>

<P>reclamation fund, with restrictions placed on the purposes for which<BR>

<P>the fund can be spent, emphasizing its use for cleanup and research,<BR>

<P>prohibiting use for unrelated purposes, and limiting the<BR>

<P>administrative expenses of the program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  DOI should establish a nationwide priority system for cleanup of<BR>

<P>abandoned hardrock mines based on the risks involved and identified<BR>

<P>through an inventory of mine sites. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  In the course of formulating the administration's position on<BR>

<P>hardrock mine reclamation, DOI should carefully review the strengths<BR>

<P>and weaknesses of the existing coal abandoned mine land (AML)<BR>

<P>program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Using the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and DOI's<BR>

<P>Bureau of Mines cooperative research project as a model, DOI should<BR>

<P>take the lead in developing an interagency program of research and<BR>

<P>development and implementation of mine cleanup on federal lands,<BR>

<P>beginning with a thorough inventory of mining sites. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We endorse the concept of ensuring that threats to<BR>

<P>health and safety and environmental damage resulting from hardrock<BR>

<P>mining are remedied.  However, we have not addressed the issue of<BR>

<P>establishing a federal program and a funding source to ensure that<BR>

<P>past hardrock mining problems on federal, state, and private lands<BR>

<P>are remedied. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOI staff communicated their views on<BR>

<P>mining law reform and on various implementation issues to<BR>

<P>congressional staff (action item 1); these views were based, in part,<BR>

<P>on the DOI staffs' knowledge of and experiences with the existing AML<BR>

<P>program (action item 3).  Two bills--H.R.  322 and S.  775--were<BR>

<P>introduced to amend the Mining Law of 1872 by, among other things,<BR>

<P>establishing an abandoned mine fund.  Under H.R.  322, all receipts<BR>

<P>from royalties and holding fees would have gone into the fund; under<BR>

<P>S.  775, one-third of these receipts would have gone into the fund. <BR>

<P>However, the mining law was not amended because a conference<BR>

<P>committee was unable to resolve differences between the two bills. <BR>

<P>Efforts to amend the act during the 103rd Congress were abandoned on<BR>

<P>September 29, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has also assembled an interagency<BR>

<P>task force within DOI to develop a departmentwide inventory of mine<BR>

<P>sites (action item 4) and a priority system for cleaning up abandoned<BR>

<P>mine sites (action item 2). <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To overcome organizational problems that inhibit an effective<BR>

<P>state-federal relationship, federal oversight of coal mine<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOI's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM),<BR>

<P>in consultation with state mining regulators, should develop national<BR>

<P>standards of excellence for regulatory and AML programs, establishing<BR>

<P>goals, performance measures, and a process for evaluation of<BR>

<P>effective performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Once this project is completed, DOI should propose legislation to<BR>

<P>revise the distribution formula for AML grants based on program goals<BR>

<P>and state performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  By January 1995, OSM should review its organizational structure<BR>

<P>based on the review of its oversight role and submit a plan to close<BR>

<P>or downsize offices with declining workloads, eliminate unnecessary<BR>

<P>management levels, and adjust its field and Washington staffing<BR>

<P>ratio. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The Secretary of the Interior should persuade the state of<BR>

<P>Tennessee to submit its proposed regulatory programs to DOI, as a<BR>

<P>first step toward assuming primacy. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Future appropriation bills should remove language requiring &quot;per<BR>

<P>state limits&quot; on AML emergency funds.  States should be required to<BR>

<P>assume responsibility for administering their AML emergency programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act should be amended<BR>

<P>so that the Rural Abandoned Mine Program is administered by the<BR>

<P>states. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  Grant funding for reclamation should be in the form of<BR>

<P>consolidated grants, building on the existing simplified grant<BR>

<P>program, with states given the responsibility for establishing<BR>

<P>reclamation priorities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse a reevaluation of the regulatory structure and the<BR>

<P>state-federal relationship.  Because this area has largely been<BR>

<P>managed by the states with policy direction by the federal<BR>

<P>government, achieving a balanced approach that satisfies the<BR>

<P>divergent interests has been difficult. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OSM has established a task force to<BR>

<P>develop national standards of excellence for the AML program (action<BR>

<P>item 1) and is reviewing the need for legislation to revise the<BR>

<P>program (action item 2).  OSM is deciding how to close or downsize<BR>

<P>offices with declining workloads, as recommended by the NPR (action<BR>

<P>item 3).  OSM is also working with Tennessee to have the state take<BR>

<P>over its regulatory program (action item 4).  OSM has sought to<BR>

<P>remove &quot;per state limits&quot; on AML emergency funds in its budget and<BR>

<P>appropriations bills (action item 5), has attempted to reduce its<BR>

<P>budget for the rural abandoned mine program to phase out federal<BR>

<P>funding (action item 6), and has simplified its AML grant process<BR>

<P>(action item 7). <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>By supporting a cross-agency coordinating effort, the federal<BR>

<P>government can develop a coherent vision for the national spatial<BR>

<P>data infrastructure (NSDI).  (Spatial or geographic data refer to<BR>

<P>information that can be placed on a map.) This will allow greatly<BR>

<P>improved information analysis in a wide range of areas, including the<BR>

<P>analysis of environmental information and the monitoring of<BR>

<P>endangered animals and sensitive land areas. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The leadership role of the Federal Geographic Data Committee<BR>

<P>(FGDC) should be strengthened beyond its original charter of OMB<BR>

<P>Circular A-16.  Federal agencies should be instructed to participate<BR>

<P>fully in FGDC activities by providing adequate staff support and<BR>

<P>high-level committee representation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The federal government should establish, through FGDC, a program<BR>

<P>by June 1994 to form partnerships with state and local governments<BR>

<P>and the private sector with the goal of having a 50-percent or higher<BR>

<P>nonfederal cost share for new or enhanced activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  FGDC should submit a schedule and funding plan to OMB by<BR>

<P>September 1994 for completing the collection and production of<BR>

<P>national core geospatial data by January 2000. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  FGDC should identify thematic data sets of critical national<BR>

<P>importance and establish priorities, standards, and a funding plan by<BR>

<P>September 1994, based on partnerships for collection of these data. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  By June 1994, FGDC should create a geospatial data clearinghouse,<BR>

<P>which will use existing computer networks, to provide public access<BR>

<P>to spatial data. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have reported that the use of geographic information<BR>

<P>systems by federal agencies is growing.  However, (1) many agencies<BR>

<P>have neither official mechanisms nor programs in place to coordinate<BR>

<P>their projects or to cooperate with other federal, state, or local<BR>

<P>agencies and (2) most agencies have not developed written policies<BR>

<P>for using these systems or instructions for disposing of spatial<BR>

<P>data.  Therefore, we support the development of a coherent vision for<BR>

<P>the NSDI. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We have also found that developing cross-agency ecosystem planning<BR>

<P>and management, as recommended by the NPR (see ENV02), will require<BR>

<P>collecting and linking large volumes of scientific data.  In<BR>

<P>addition, large volumes of socioeconomic data must be collected,<BR>

<P>organized, and analyzed (1) to identify important relationships<BR>

<P>between human activities and ecological conditions and trends and (2)<BR>

<P>to make necessary or desired trade-offs among ecological and<BR>

<P>socioeconomic values and concerns.  However, available data are often<BR>

<P>not comparable, and large gaps in information exist.  Furthermore,<BR>

<P>there is still much uncertainty about how ecosystems<BR>

<P>function--uncertainty that contributes to strong differences in the<BR>

<P>interpretation of scientific evidence. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Although target dates for implementing<BR>

<P>several of the action items under this recommendation have slipped by<BR>

<P>3 to 6 months, FGDC has made significant progress in implementation. <BR>

<P>Specifically, FGDC has implemented the action item to strengthen its<BR>

<P>leadership role.  FGDC has developed strategies for state, local,<BR>

<P>private, and academic partnerships and has collected and made<BR>

<P>available framework (core) and thematic data.  (Framework data refer<BR>

<P>to information that nearly all users of spatial data require to<BR>

<P>accurately locate features on the earth's surface, including<BR>

<P>transportation and water networks, terrain (elevation), and<BR>

<P>administrative and sociopolitical boundaries, such as county lines. <BR>

<P>Thematic data are traditionally not used to develop other data sets,<BR>

<P>such as framework data, but are critical to answering questions of<BR>

<P>national significance.  Thematic data include information about<BR>

<P>wetlands, soils, geology, land cover, endangered and threatened<BR>

<P>species, and socioeconomic elements.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Executive Order 12906 (Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and<BR>

<P>Access:  The National Spatial Data Infrastructure, Apr.  11, 1994)<BR>

<P>provided more specific guidance to federal agencies on the NSDI and<BR>

<P>changed certain actions and dates.  FGDC is now chaired by the<BR>

<P>Secretary of the Interior, and most agencies have elevated their<BR>

<P>representation to the policy level (action item 1).  Activities are<BR>

<P>under way to develop strategies for partnerships with state and local<BR>

<P>governments, the private sector, and academia.  These strategies<BR>

<P>include a Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program to provide<BR>

<P>incentives to nonfederal parties to document and make available<BR>

<P>existing data (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>By January 1995, FGDC is to submit a plan to OMB for collecting and<BR>

<P>under OMB Circular A-16, various agencies have been assigned<BR>

<P>responsibilities for developing standards for different themes of<BR>

<P>data (action item 4).  Finally, a prototype of a geospatial data<BR>

<P>clearinghouse has been established by about a dozen federal agencies. <BR>

<P>After January 1995, all federal agencies have been instructed to<BR>

<P>begin documenting all new data collected and to ensure that they are<BR>

<P>consistent with a geospatial metadata standard developed and approved<BR>

<P>by FGDC.  Metadata are &quot;data about data&quot; that describe the content,<BR>

<P>quality, condition, and other characteristics of data.  By April<BR>

<P>1995, federal agencies are to (1) use the clearinghouse to find data<BR>

<P>before investing in any new data collection efforts and (2) develop a<BR>

<P>plan for making their geospatial data available to the public (action<BR>

<P>      OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The National Park Service (NPS) should be allowed to raise additional<BR>

<P>revenues from appropriate sources and to use a portion of the money<BR>

<P>for investment in park infrastructure.  This proposal would increase<BR>

<P>selected park entry fees and would increase fees on park<BR>

<P>concessioners. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Secretary of the Interior should submit legislation giving<BR>

<P>NPS the authority to set fees at all parks subject only to broad<BR>

<P>policy oversight. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  NPS should explore barrier-free admissions based on automated<BR>

<P>entry equipment and off-site vending of tickets and permits. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  NPS should accelerate its concession reform and renewal program. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Legislation should be enacted to enhance the legal and financial<BR>

<P>flexibility of NPS fund-raising. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  NPS should continue its reform efforts to meet emerging,<BR>

<P>long-term needs of the national parks with a holistic, new vision. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse the concept of park units' raising additional<BR>

<P>revenues that could be used to invest in park infrastructure.  Over<BR>

<P>the past several years, we have identified an almost $2 billion<BR>

<P>cumulative shortfall in funds for park maintenance, as well as<BR>

<P>opportunities to (1) increase the fees that concessioners pay the<BR>

<P>government and (2) improve the pricing of user fees at recreational<BR>

<P>sites.  However, the need to eliminate the backlog in deferred<BR>

<P>maintenance, as well as opportunities to obtain a better return for<BR>

<P>the sale or use of natural resources on federal lands, apply to all<BR>

<P>federal land-managing agencies.  Therefore, this recommendation<BR>

<P>should not be limited to the National Park Service. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Action is proceeding at several<BR>

<P>levels.  First, legislation to increase entrance fees and to give the<BR>

<P>Secretary of the Interior more discretion to set entrance,<BR>

<P>recreation, and special-use fees was introduced in both the House<BR>

<P>(H.R.  4533) and the Senate (S.  2121).  A subcommittee of the House<BR>

<P>Committee on Natural Resources approved an amended bill on July 21,<BR>

<P>1994.  The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources approved<BR>

<P>an amended bill on September 21, 1994.  However, neither of these<BR>

<P>bills was passed before the 103rd Congress adjourned (action items 1<BR>

<P>and 4). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Second, on July 28, 1994, the House amended and approved S.  208,<BR>

<P>which the Senate had approved on March 22, 1994, to reform the Park<BR>

<P>Service's concessions policy.  Neither piece of legislation was<BR>

<P>passed before the 103rd Congress adjourned (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Third, a barrier-free admissions system was introduced this summer at<BR>

<P>the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, and other systems<BR>

<P>will be tested over the next year at three national parks--Mount<BR>

<P>Rainier in Washington; Yellowstone in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho;<BR>

<P>and Olympic in Washington (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Finally, although Congress has not continued to fund the office<BR>

<P>established to oversee and coordinate the Park Service's<BR>

<P>implementation of the Vail Agenda--a blueprint, or planning model,<BR>

<P>adopted by the Park Service in 1991 to guide its management<BR>

<P>strategies into the 21st century--the Park Service continues to study<BR>

<P>initiatives that it should pursue to meet the long-term needs of the<BR>

<P>parks.  On September 8, 1994, it published a comprehensive Customer<BR>

<P>Service Plan (action item 5). <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The federal government should institute reforms to guarantee a fair<BR>

<P>return for federal resources such as livestock grazing and hardrock<BR>

<P>mining.  Some of the programs regulating the commercial sale and use<BR>

<P>of natural resources on federal lands operate at a loss to the<BR>

<P>taxpayers and fail to provide incentives for good stewardship<BR>

<P>practices.  The administration should also develop a new fee schedule<BR>

<P>for communications sites on DOI and Department of Agriculture lands. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The administration should establish a formula for grazing of<BR>

<P>federal land at a fee level that is fair to both the taxpayers and<BR>

<P>the livestock permittees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  The administration should support hardrock mining reform<BR>

<P>legislation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  The administration should develop regulations, which should be<BR>

<P>implemented by fiscal year 1995, establishing a new rental schedule<BR>

<P>for communications sites. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  In our view, the federal government should (1) seek a better<BR>

<P>return for the sale or use of the mineral, renewable, and other<BR>

<P>natural resources on its lands; (2) cover the cost of programs to a<BR>

<P>reasonable extent and convert some programs into producers of revenue<BR>

<P>rather than contributors to the national debt, as they are now; and<BR>

<P>(3) provide a revenue base that can be used to better manage and<BR>

<P>improve federal lands so that they will remain a viable public<BR>

<P>resource in the future.  In addition to addressing livestock grazing,<BR>

<P>hardrock mining, and the leasing of communications sites on federal<BR>

<P>lands, we have identified the need to reform federal policies and<BR>

<P>practices on water and timber and to change the basis on which<BR>

<P>federal land-managing agencies share revenues with states and<BR>

<P>counties. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  On March 25, 1994, DOI proposed a<BR>

<P>rule in the Federal Register to improve the management of rangeland<BR>

<P>ecosystems and the administration of the livestock grazing program,<BR>

<P>as well as to change grazing fees.  A final rule is anticipated for<BR>

<P>early in 1995 (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A bill (S.  775) passed by the Senate in May 1993 to amend the Mining<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOI needs to reinvent the way it manages and acquires federal lands. <BR>

<P>Due to historical patterns of settlement and development of this<BR>

<P>country, adjoining federal lands often fall under the jurisdiction of<BR>

<P>several federal agencies.  To the degree possible, this should be<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.6.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOI should establish trial pilot coordinated management areas,<BR>

<P>preferably watershed based. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  After the pilot projects have been operating for 18 to 24 months,<BR>

<P>DOI should evaluate their progress to determine if legislative<BR>

<P>proposals to transfer lands between the Department of Agriculture's<BR>

<P>Forest Service and DOI's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on an<BR>

<P>agencywide or limited jurisdiction are required. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree with the thrust of this recommendation and note that<BR>

<P>management of federal lands has been handicapped by the number and<BR>

<P>diversity of agencies involved.  DOI's nine highly decentralized and<BR>

<P>autonomous agencies and the Forest Service often have overlapping<BR>

<P>jurisdictions and different and conflicting missions.  Moreover,<BR>

<P>there is currently no system for coordinating the management of<BR>

<P>federal lands, even when such lands are adjacent to each other and<BR>

<P>part of a single ecosystem.  DOI and the Forest Service need to<BR>

<P>reassess the way they do business throughout their fragmented<BR>

<P>organizations and rethink the traditional functional and<BR>

<P>organizational alignment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In February 1994 testimony, we concluded that federal land management<BR>

<P>agencies need to work together and with Congress to find ways to<BR>

<P>operate more efficiently and to manage activities and uses across<BR>

<P>existing federal land units so as to preserve the nation's natural<BR>

<P>resources and sustain their long-term economic productivity.  We<BR>

<P>believe that to accomplish these objectives, a coordinated<BR>

<P>interagency strategy may be needed to link reforms being considered<BR>

<P>by the individual federal land management agencies.  The ultimate<BR>

<P>goal of this strategy would be to coordinate and integrate the<BR>

<P>agencies' programs, activities, and functions so that they operate as<BR>

<P>a unit at the local level.  Managing along ecological rather than<BR>

<P>political or administrative boundaries is discussed in our August 16,<BR>

<P>1994, report on ecosystem management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Efforts by DOI and the Forest Service to<BR>

<P>reinvent the way they manage and acquire federal lands are linked to<BR>

<P>the agencies' efforts to implement ecosystem management (see ENV02). <BR>

<P>In August 1994, BLM selected the Mojave/California desert in the arid<BR>

<P>southeast corner of California as its first pilot coordinated<BR>

<P>management area.  BLM plans to identify additional pilot areas by<BR>

<P>early 1995.  The Mojave/California desert was also selected, together<BR>

<P>with the Great Plains grasslands (in Minnesota, North Dakota, South<BR>

<P>Dakota, and Nebraska) and Monterey Bay, as a &quot;new initiative<BR>

<P>laboratory&quot; by an interagency work group formed to examine major<BR>

<P>issues that influence the effectiveness of ecosystem management and<BR>

<P>to make recommendations for improvements (action item 1). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The laboratories will employ a collective process to document<BR>

<P>historical ecosystems, develop a vision of the range of desired<BR>

<P>future conditions, and consider how current stakeholders' actions<BR>

<P>will address key concerns.  Recommendations for improvements may<BR>

<P>require legislation or other assistance from Congress to remove<BR>

<P>institutional and legal barriers to the use of an ecosystem approach<BR>

<P>to environmental management.  Congress passed the California Desert<BR>

<P>Protection Act that, among other things, creates nearly 8 million<BR>

<P>acres of wilderness areas and transfers significant portions of BLM<BR>

<P>acreage to DOI's National Park Service (action item 2). <BR>

<P>procedures.  Revised procedures were circulated for review and<BR>

<P>comment within DOI and Agriculture in late June and have been<BR>

<P>implemented (action item 1).  In addition, on July 31, 1994, DOI,<BR>

<P>Agriculture, and OMB adopted new procedures to address the issues<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.8.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  By fiscal year 1995, the Royalty Management Program (RMP) should<BR>

<P>develop and implement additional computer programs to analyze and<BR>

<P>verify transactions across the lease population. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We endorse better management of DOI's strategy for auditing<BR>

<P>royalty payors.  Ideally, such a strategy would consist of systematic<BR>

<P>and field-based activities for monitoring and correcting the major<BR>

<P>components of the royalty equation.  However, problems with DOI's<BR>

<P>automated systems have prevented the Department from ensuring correct<BR>

<P>reporting.  Furthermore, its field-based royalty compliance audits do<BR>

<P>not provide reasonable assurance that royalty payors comply with<BR>

<P>applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  DOI also needs to improve<BR>

<P>its verification program for both onshore and offshore oil and gas<BR>

<P>production. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  DOI's Minerals Management Service<BR>

<P>(MMS) has identified several computer system enhancements to analyze<BR>

<P>and verify transactions across the lease population; these<BR>

<P>enhancements are being reviewed (action item 1).  MMS has also<BR>

<P>reassigned 20 staff positions to audit/compliance functions (action<BR>

<P>item 2); submitted penalty legislation that passed the House in<BR>

<P>November 1993 (H.R.  3400) but did not pass the Senate (S.  1637);<BR>

<P>and received clearance from OMB for proposing language changes to the<BR>

<P>penalty legislation responding to the mining industry's concerns<BR>

<P>(action item 3).  In addition, MMS and BLM have agreed on consistent<BR>

<P>liability policies for DOI and have drafted a proposed rule (action<BR>

<P>item 4). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In response to recommendations from a &quot;multiconstituent laboratory,&quot;<BR>

<P>MMS has taken several additional steps to improve efficiency and<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support efforts to address the structural<BR>

<P>barriers among DOI's autonomous bureaus and between these bureaus and<BR>

<P>the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.  We note that pending<BR>

<P>legislation to establish a National Biological Survey (NBS) within<BR>

<P>DOI as an independent, nonregulatory source of information on the<BR>

<P>nation's biological resources appears to be a step in this direction. <BR>

<P>In the interim, the Secretary of the Interior transferred biological<BR>

<P>research and monitoring programs from existing DOI agencies to NBS. <BR>

<P>NBS became operational on November 11, 1993.  We believe that a<BR>

<P>Partially Implemented.  DOI has tested a system of in-house<BR>

<P>contracts/consultants and a system of personnel exchanges in three of<BR>

<P>its bureaus/offices (action items 1 and 2).  It has drafted a<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Our work has shown that budgetary constraints and scientific<BR>

<P>findings will challenge federal agencies as never before to find new<BR>

<P>and different ways to achieve their programs' goals with fewer<BR>

<P>resources and to realize their visions for the future in an<BR>

<P>affordable manner.  For example, we believe that federal land<BR>

<P>management agencies in DOI and the Department of Agriculture need to<BR>

<P>work with Congress to find ways to operate more efficiently and to<BR>

<P>manage activities and uses across existing federal land units so as<BR>

<P>to preserve the nation's natural resources and sustain their<BR>

<P>long-term economic productivity.  We believe that to accomplish these<BR>

<P>objectives, a coordinated interagency strategy may be needed to link<BR>

<P>reforms being considered by federal land management agencies.  The<BR>

<P>ultimate goal of this strategy would be to coordinate and integrate<BR>

<P>the programs, activities, and functions of federal land management<BR>

<P>agencies so that they operate as a unit at the local level. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We also support efforts to consolidate administrative functions.  For<BR>

<P>example, in a 1988 report we noted that duplication of administrative<BR>

<P>functions reduced program efficiency for environmental studies of the<BR>

<P>outer continental shelf in Alaska.  We recommended, and DOI<BR>

<P>implemented, an alternative that consolidated these functions, saving<BR>

<P>about $800,000 in fiscal years 1991 and 1992. <BR>

<P>concerns, time line, and reduction targets.  Next, in April 1994, DOI<BR>

<P>developed a consolidated approach for streamlining personnel<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  DOI should implement standard practices for electronic<BR>

<P>communications and an agencywide data network strategy with the<BR>

<P>following steps: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- agree upon a conceptual framework identifying networks, common<BR>

<P>     databases (e.g., payroll), and a network architecture;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- establish ways to share data across bureaus;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- require data centers to use compatible communications software;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- require bureaus to optimize communications capacity (e.g., T-1<BR>

<P>     circuit bandwidth and video-conferencing room time);<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- shift to Government Open Systems' Interconnection Profiles;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- standardize imaging systems across the Department for<BR>

<P>     transmission of financial data, land records, rules and<BR>

<P>     regulations, library material, and basic review documents to<BR>

<P>     reduce paperwork in the workplace; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- standardize telephone system capability across bureaus to<BR>

<P>     provide timesaving components and to improve quality of direct<BR>

<P>     communication. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  DOI should ensure that its data network initiatives all tie into<BR>

<P>a departmental data network. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  DOI should establish a council to review all internal,<BR>

<P>self-imposed procurement regulations, eliminate as many of them as<BR>

<P>possible, evaluate any requests by individual departmental<BR>

<P>agencies/bureaus to retain specific rules, and determine the<BR>

<P>advisability of rescinding the authority of agencies/bureaus to issue<BR>

<P>restrictive supplements to federal acquisition guidelines. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  To guarantee the compatibility of its financial and acquisition<BR>

<P>systems, DOI should make the Federal Financial System (FFS) interface<BR>

<P>capacity a top priority in the development of DOI's Electronic<BR>

<P>Acquisition System. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  DOI should develop and implement a strategic plan for making the<BR>

<P>FFS readily available to field users through alternative system<BR>

<P>environments such as mini-computers and local area networks. <BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>of FFS users to certify payments and streamline payment processing by<BR>

<P>implementing Treasury's Vendor Express Program (Electronic Payment<BR>

<P>System) and Electronic Certification System. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>7.  DOI should streamline the processing of bills by establishing a<BR>

<P>separate appropriation account within the Department to pay common<BR>

<P>costs rather than issuing separate billings to each bureau. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>8.  DOI should take measures to revise existing correspondence<BR>

<P>guidelines and reduce excessive and unnecessary review of<BR>

<P>correspondence. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>9.  DOI should use its semiannual regulatory agenda to establish<BR>

<P>dates for formulation and publication of rules that can be achieved<BR>

<P>within agency resource constraints. <BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  To implement this recommendation, DOI<BR>

<P>has taken or initiated several actions.  In June 1994, it completed a<BR>

<P>networking concept paper that lays out a data network strategy for<BR>

<P>all organizational components, and in August 1994 it completed a<BR>

<P>communications guide to assist in evaluating and acquiring hardware<BR>

<P>and software applications at administrative service centers (action<BR>

<P>item 1).  A basic data network is now available for use by the<BR>

<P>bureaus, and an enhanced data network will be available as certain<BR>

<P>planned steps for action item 1 are completed (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To implement Executive Order 12861, which directs all federal<BR>

<P>agencies to reduce the number of civilian internal management<BR>

<P>regulations that are not required by law, DOI established two groups<BR>

<P>to oversee the Department's effort.  These groups drafted an initial<BR>

<P>plan for reducing the number of regulations.  The first cycle of<BR>

<P>regulatory reduction occurred in May 1994, and further reductions are<BR>

<P>planned (action item 3). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In June 1994, DOI drafted and distributed a concept paper to its<BR>

<P>bureaus for comment; this paper specifies the framework for an<BR>

<P>interface of financial and procurement data (action item 4).  DOI is<BR>

<P>making the FFS available to field users and expanding the system's<BR>

<P>capabilities (action items 5 and 6) through a broader DOI initiative<BR>

<P>to improve the effectiveness of its financial management.  A final<BR>

<P>report for the first phase of its initiative, called the Financial<BR>

<P>Management Best Practices Project, was distributed to DOI financial<BR>

<P>managers on September 16, 1994.  DOI studied establishing a separate<BR>

<P>appropriation account to pay common costs (action item 7) but decided<BR>

<P>in July 1994 not to do so.  It will, however, make billing<BR>

<P>improvements, such as billing costs quarterly instead of monthly, to<BR>

<P>address some concerns. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>DOI's Office of Executive Secretariat has purchased personal<BR>

<P>computers and plans to purchase software to track and control the<BR>

<P>review of correspondence (action item 8).  In response to Executive<BR>

<P>Order 12866 on regulatory planning and review, in March 1994, DOI<BR>

<P>submitted a report to OMB on streamlining the regulatory process in<BR>

<P>DOI.  Furthermore, DOI drafted a regulatory plan for submission to<BR>

<P>1995 (action item 9).  Finally, the Office of Regulatory Affairs<BR>

<P>developed an alert system that informs potentially interested DOI<BR>

<P>      FOR THE BUREAU OF<BR>

<P>      RECLAMATION<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 13:2.12<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) needs to redefine its mission toward<BR>

<P>new environmental priorities and clarify its role in water<BR>

<P>management.  The original mission to develop water resources and<BR>

<P>provide for economic development of the West is almost complete. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.12.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  By the beginning of fiscal year 1995, BOR should develop a new<BR>

<P>mission which assumes a leadership role in western water policy and<BR>

<P>focuses on water management functions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  BOR should complete construction of approved projects, review<BR>

<P>personnel needs, and reduce full-time equivalents and/or redirect<BR>

<P>skilled personnel to other DOI priorities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  BOR should develop legislation to sell or transfer title of all<BR>

<P>distribution and drainage facilities to state or local water user<BR>

<P>organizational entities (such as irrigation districts). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  The existing Rehabilitation and Betterment Act and Distribution<BR>

<P>System Loan Act should be repealed and the Small Reclamation Projects<BR>

<P>Act amended to eliminate the provision making irrigation a required<BR>

<P>project component. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  BOR should implement internal controls to ensure the federal<BR>

<P>government recovers an equitable share of its financing cost for<BR>

<P>water use transferred from irrigation to municipal and industrial<BR>

<P>purposes. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.12.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that Reclamation's era of dam building is over and<BR>

<P>support efforts to downsize the agency or change its mission. <BR>

<P>However, previous proposals to cut Reclamation's workforce have not<BR>

<P>been successful, and history has shown that any change must take<BR>

<P>place with the full involvement of Congress.  In addition, the<BR>

<P>development of a long-term framework for water resources management,<BR>

<P>development, and protection must be consistent with DOI's efforts to<BR>

<P>implement other NPR recommendations, such as rationalizing federal<BR>

<P>land ownership (DOI06) and consolidating administrative and<BR>

<P>programmatic functions (DOI10). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Although we have not thoroughly reviewed Reclamation's efforts to<BR>

<P>develop a strategic plan and long-term framework for water resources<BR>

<P>management, development, and protection, we have examined several of<BR>

<P>the issues cited in the action items for implementing this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  For example, we have issued products on the need to<BR>

<P>improve water management, reduce subsidies, and use market-based<BR>

<P>incentives to increase federal revenues and protect natural<BR>

<P>resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.12.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Reclamation has developed a new mission<BR>

<P>statement focusing on western water policy and water management<BR>

<P>functions (action item 1).  In accordance with its new mission,<BR>

<P>Reclamation was reorganized (Secretary of the Interior Order 3179,<BR>

<P>Apr.  13, 1994) and its staffing was realigned, downgraded, or<BR>

<P>reduced (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Reclamation is drafting legislation to sell or transfer certain<BR>

<P>facilities to users (action item 3) and is evaluating legislative<BR>

<P>proposals for eliminating irrigation as a required project component<BR>

<P>(action item 4).  Finally, Reclamation has prepared draft policy<BR>

<P>memorandums and sent draft regulations to the Federal Register for<BR>

<P>comment.  These regulations would ensure the recovery of federal<BR>

<P>financing costs for water use (action item 5). <BR>

<P>      HELIUM PROGRAM<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 13:2.13<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The federal government needs to reexamine its role in the federal<BR>

<P>helium program.  The program can be run more efficiently, reducing<BR>

<P>outlays by federal helium customers and increasing revenue.  To<BR>

<P>obtain maximum benefit from helium operations, the government should<BR>

<P>cancel the helium debt, reduce costs, increase efficiencies in helium<BR>

<P>operations, and increase sales of crude helium as market conditions<BR>

<P>permit. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.13.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  The Helium Act of 1960 should be amended to cancel the<BR>

<P>outstanding principal and interest of the helium debt. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Coincident with debt elimination, the Bureau of Mines (BOM)<BR>

<P>should reduce prices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  BOM should reduce costs and increase efficiencies by<BR>

<P>discontinuing operations such as small cylinder filling, maintenance,<BR>

<P>and testing, and other nonrevenue producing operations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  BOM should increase fees charged to private industry for storage,<BR>

<P>transmission, and withdrawal of privately owned helium stored in the<BR>

<P>government reservoir, increasing revenues by $1 million. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  BOM should increase sales of crude helium from the reserve to<BR>

<P>private businesses as market conditions permit. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that because conditions have changed since<BR>

<P>the Helium Act of 1960 was passed, the act's objectives should be<BR>

<P>reassessed.  We have recommended canceling the helium debt because<BR>

<P>doing so would not adversely affect the federal budget and would<BR>

<P>allow for a more realistic assessment of what the federal<BR>

<P>government's role should be in meeting federal helium needs.  In<BR>

<P>addition, we think that before the act is altered to address the<BR>

<P>changes that have occurred, consideration must be given to the<BR>

<P>interrelationship of the act's objectives.  For example, a decision<BR>

<P>to sell the federal helium inventory would probably put an end to the<BR>

<P>private crude helium industry.  We have not examined the efficiency<BR>

<P>of federal helium operations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.13.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Legislation proposed by BOM to cancel<BR>

<P>the helium debt and reduce helium prices was not enacted during the<BR>

<P>103rd Congress (action items 1 and 2).  BOM notified its customers<BR>

<P>that it would no longer be filling small cylinders as of July 1, 1994<BR>

<P>(action item 3); is reviewing existing storage contracts (about half<BR>

<P>of which expired at the end of fiscal year 1994) to determine<BR>

<P>whether, and if so, how, storage fees can be increased (action item<BR>

<P>4); and has drafted a Federal Register notice of intent to increase<BR>

<P>federal helium sales (action item 5). <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 13:2.14<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The time is right to integrate skills across bureau boundaries in the<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 13:2.14.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  The pace of assessing and evaluating federal hazardous waste<BR>

<P>sites has been slow.  We think that DOI and EPA should work together<BR>

<P>to identify and take action to remediate sites.  The high cost of<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 35:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The four recommendations for reinventing environmental management<BR>

<P>have been implemented in varying degrees.  The recommendation to<BR>

<P>increase environmentally and economically beneficial landscaping has<BR>

<P>been fully implemented through the issuance of an executive order<BR>

<P>(ENV04).  Two recommendations have been partially implemented:  An<BR>

<P>executive order has been issued, an interagency working group has<BR>

<P>been established and legislation has been enacted to increase energy<BR>

<P>and water efficiency (ENV03), and an interagency task force has begun<BR>

<P>to develop cross-agency ecosystem planning and management (ENV02). <BR>

<P>Although steps have been taken to improve federal decisionmaking<BR>

<P>through environmental cost accounting, none of the action items for<BR>

<P>implementing this recommendation has been addressed directly (ENV01). <BR>

<P>Generally, action on the recommendations for reinventing<BR>

<P>environmental management appears to be slowed by the need for<BR>

<P>involvement across federal agencies. <BR>

<P>      ENVIRONMENTAL COST<BR>

<P>      ACCOUNTING<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Develop demonstration projects to test the applicability of<BR>

<P>environmental cost accounting.  Based on project results, develop<BR>

<P>guidelines to implement environmental cost accounting throughout the<BR>

<P>federal government.  Issue an executive order to encourage the use of<BR>

<P>environmental cost accounting by federal agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Develop pilot projects to demonstrate the use of environmental<BR>

<P>cost accounting by the federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Report on the demonstration projects and make recommendations on<BR>

<P>the use of environmental cost accounting in the federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Issue a directive to implement environmental cost accounting in<BR>

<P>the federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We concur that environmental cost accounting has<BR>

<P>merit and could help federal agencies conduct their operations in a<BR>

<P>more environmentally sound manner.  We have related work on<BR>

<P>environmental auditing at federal agencies under way. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Without directly addressing the<BR>

<P>action items under this recommendation, the Environmental Protection<BR>

<P>Agency (EPA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have taken a number<BR>

<P>of steps to promote environmental cost accounting.  For example, EPA<BR>

<P>has initiated a Design for the Environment program that works closely<BR>

<P>with private sector partners to incorporate environmental<BR>

<P>considerations at the front end of products and processes.  Through a<BR>

<P>Management Accounting and Capital Budgeting for Environmental Costs<BR>

<P>project, this program's officials are encouraging businesses to fully<BR>

<P>account for environmental costs in their business decisions and<BR>

<P>budgeting practices.  EPA also convened a workshop of key<BR>

<P>stakeholders, who developed an action agenda identifying steps that<BR>

<P>the business community, professional associations, academia,<BR>

<P>government, and small businesses can take to improve environmental<BR>

<P>accounting and integrate environmental cost information into<BR>

<P>decisionmaking.  This agenda suggests, among other things, that EPA<BR>

<P>continue to facilitate environmental accounting.  Grant funding is<BR>

<P>under way to support EPA's efforts to inform practitioners of<BR>

<P>available cost accounting methods.  DOD is asking its military<BR>

<P>departments for volunteer pilot projects to test the applicability<BR>

<P>and effectiveness of environmental cost accounting in the federal<BR>

<P>government.  DOD has also drafted a new standard for systems<BR>

<P>engineering that will include environmental cost considerations for<BR>

<P>acquisitions (action item 1).  Efforts to address the second and<BR>

<P>third action items under this recommendation will depend on the<BR>

<P>lessons learned from the demonstration projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  As we reported in August 1994, initiatives by the<BR>

<P>administration and individual agencies to implement a governmentwide<BR>

<P>approach to ecosystem management reflect a growing recognition that<BR>

<P>the current practice of managing individual politically or<BR>

<P>administratively established land units and individual natural<BR>

<P>resources is not adequately addressing two basic legislative<BR>

<P>mandates:  (1) to sustain in perpetuity multiple uses of federal<BR>

<P>lands and (2) to provide minimum levels of protection for individual<BR>

<P>natural resources.  Ecosystem management seeks to change the federal<BR>

<P>government's approach to fulfilling these stewardship<BR>

<P>responsibilities through a better scientific understanding of their<BR>

<P>relationship to one another.  We concluded that although the<BR>

<P>administration's fiscal year 1995 budget proposes to fund the initial<BR>

<P>stage of a governmentwide approach to ecosystem management,<BR>

<P>additional actions are needed, including (1) clarifying the policy<BR>

<P>goal for ecosystem management, (2) taking certain practical steps to<BR>

<P>implement the principles set forth in the budget document, (3)<BR>

<P>testing the approach in certain geographic areas to identify barriers<BR>

<P>and options for resolving them, (4) establishing outcome-oriented and<BR>

<P>measurable objectives and milestones, and (5) becoming more<BR>

<P>accountable to Congress.  The NPR recommendation's action items are<BR>

<P>consistent with these conclusions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In 1993, the White House Office on<BR>

<P>Environmental Policy established an Interagency Ecosystem Management<BR>

<P>Task Force to implement an ecosystem approach to environmental<BR>

<P>management.  The task force was charged with establishing overarching<BR>

<P>goals for all federal agencies; removing barriers that frustrate more<BR>

<P>effective, efficient interagency cooperation; and learning from<BR>

<P>large-scale ecosystem-based management efforts.  The task force is<BR>

<P>chaired by the Director of the White House Office on Environmental<BR>

<P>Policy and is composed of assistant secretaries from 12 departments<BR>

<P>and agencies as well as representatives from OMB and the White House<BR>

<P>Office of Science and Technology Policy (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Progress has also been made toward implementing the other four action<BR>

<P>items under this recommendation.  For example, the task force<BR>

<P>prepared and approved a draft &quot;Ecosystem Management Initiative<BR>

<P>Overview&quot; that summarizes the efforts of the agencies to clarify<BR>

<P>goals, translate principles, and derive lessons from ongoing<BR>

<P>ecosystem management efforts that can be applied to other ecosystems<BR>

<P>(action item 1).  The task force also developed the administration's<BR>

<P>fiscal year 1995 budget proposal to fund the initial stage of a<BR>

<P>governmentwide approach to ecosystem management, including four pilot<BR>

<P>projects.  The task force formed an interagency work group to examine<BR>

<P>major factors that influence the effectiveness of ecosystem<BR>

<P>management--such as the budget process, legal authorities, and<BR>

<P>information management--and to make recommendations to the task force<BR>

<P>for improvements.  During July and August, this group surveyed<BR>

<P>ongoing activities in seven ecosystems.  The task force expects to<BR>

<P>issue a report on its findings and recommendations by the end of<BR>

<P>November and to use this report to identify the next steps to be<BR>

<P>taken in forging an ecosystem approach (action item 3).  Regional<BR>

<P>teams have been established (action item 4), management plans have<BR>

<P>been developed, and implementation has begun (action item 5) in two<BR>

<P>of the pilot project ecosystems--the old-growth forests of the<BR>

<P>Pacific Northwest and south Florida, including the Everglades and<BR>

<P>Florida Bay. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally support efforts to increase the<BR>

<P>efficiency with which federal facilities use energy and water.  Our<BR>

<P>completed work shows that federal agencies should place greater<BR>

<P>emphasis on these efforts.  We see merit in the National Defense<BR>

<P>Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 that provides DOD with<BR>

<P>incentives to pursue water efficiency projects--for example, allowing<BR>

<P>the Department to retain the savings derived from such projects if<BR>

<P>the funds are used for additional conservation projects.  We would<BR>

<P>also support efforts by all agencies to develop mechanisms that would<BR>

<P>enable them to retain rebates from utilities, as required by a March<BR>

<P>1994 executive order. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Several actions have been taken to partially<BR>

<P>implement this recommendation.  Executive Order 12902--Energy<BR>

<P>Efficiency and Water Conservation at Federal Facilities--was issued<BR>

<P>on March 8, 1994, directing agencies to develop and implement a<BR>

<P>program to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent by the year 2005<BR>

<P>and to implement cost-effective water conservation projects (action<BR>

<P>item 1).  Section 502 of this order requires the Director of OMB,<BR>

<P>along with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense, and the<BR>

<P>Administrator of the General Services Admistration, to develop<BR>

<P>guidelines and implement procedures that will allow an agency to<BR>

<P>retain utility rebates and incentives received by the agency, as well<BR>

<P>as savings from energy efficiency and water conservation efforts, as<BR>

<P>provided in section 152 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and 10<BR>

<P>U.S.C.  2865 and 2866.  To address the requirements of this order, an<BR>

<P>Interagency Energy Management Task Force's Retention of Savings<BR>

<P>Working Group, located in the Department of Energy's Federal Energy<BR>

<P>Management Program, was established.  This working group has<BR>

<P>identified barriers to the retention of utility rebates and developed<BR>

<P>recommendations to address these barriers (action item 3).  In<BR>

<P>addition, Public Law 103-160 was approved on November 30, 1993,<BR>

<P>allowing DOD to retain the savings generated through water efficiency<BR>

<P>projects (action item 2). <BR>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 35:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  This recommendation was fully implemented by an<BR>

<P>April 26, 1994, presidential memorandum--Environmentally and<BR>

<P>Economically Beneficial Practices on Federal Landscaped<BR>

<P>Grounds--directing the heads of executive departments and agencies to<BR>

<P>implement landscape practices that will benefit the environment and<BR>

<P>generate long-term cost savings for the federal government.  These<BR>

<P>practices include increasing the use of native species and reducing<BR>

<P>the use of water and chemicals at federal facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As directed by the presidential memorandum, an interagency working<BR>

<P>group has been established, headed by the Federal Environmental<BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------- Section 34:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Legislation has been enacted in selected areas to develop a framework<BR>

<P>for improved federal/state/local relations.  Legislative actions such<BR>

<P>as the Goals 2000:  Educate America Act, the Human Service<BR>

<P>Amendments, and the creation of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise<BR>

<P>Communities Program foster bottom-up strategies to address the<BR>

<P>problem of grant proliferation and its accompanying red tape.  While<BR>

<P>these initiatives address a small portion of the federal grant<BR>

<P>system, they could provide a body of knowledge about how the overall<BR>

<P>system should be reformed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>There has been little or no progress in areas such as reducing red<BR>

<P>tape through regulatory relief, simplifying reimbursement procedures<BR>

<P>for administrative costs of federal grant disbursement, simplifying<BR>

<P>the compliance certification process, and modifying the common grant<BR>

<P>rule on small purchases.  Efforts to implement these recommendations<BR>

<P>will require modification of agency and governmentwide rules and<BR>

<P>regulations which are in various stages of drafting and review. <BR>

<P>Additionally, the administration and Congress need to agree on the<BR>

<P>size and capacity of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental<BR>

<P>Relations (ACIR) if it is to serve as a catalyst for strengthening<BR>

<P>the intergovernmental service delivery partnership. <BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      FSL01:  IMPROVE THE DELIVERY<BR>

<P>      OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC GRANT<BR>

<P>      PROGRAMS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Create flexibility and encourage innovation by designing a bottom-up<BR>

<P>solution to the problem of grant proliferation and its accompanying<BR>

<P>red tape.  Also, support the pending proposal for Federal-State<BR>

<P>Flexibility Grants that has been developed by the National Governors<BR>

<P>Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures. <BR>

<P>Establish a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Create flexibility and encourage innovation by designing a<BR>

<P>bottom-up solution to the problem of grant proliferation and its<BR>

<P>accompanying red tape. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Support proposals for Federal-State Flexibility Grants. <BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>initiatives in community empowerment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that new federal strategies need to be explored to<BR>

<P>assist state and local governments to develop solutions to improving<BR>

<P>service delivery.  However, as we have reported, because states<BR>
occupy an increasingly central place in the intergovernmental system,<BR>

<P>the combination of reduced federal support and increased requirements<BR>

<P>pose a special threat to states' leadership.  We have also documented<BR>

<P>the efficacy of seeking service delivery solutions at points nearest<BR>

<P>to the client rather than through &quot;top-down&quot; efforts.  While we have<BR>

<P>not done work evaluating specific strategies to improve the overall<BR>

<P>capacity of state and local governments to deliver domestic services,<BR>

<P>we agree that the federal role should be one that supports &quot;local<BR>

<P>solutions for local problems.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Several laws have been enacted addressing<BR>

<P>this recommendation.  The Goals 2000:  Educate America Act (P.L. <BR>

<P>103-227) encourages state and local agencies to develop comprehensive<BR>

<P>improvement plans, providing a framework for program integration, and<BR>

<P>gives the Education Secretary the authority to waive federal<BR>

<P>statutory and regulatory requirements.  The Human Services Amendments<BR>

<P>(P.L.  103-227) created the Community Based Family Resource Program,<BR>

<P>which consolidated four HHS programs to assist states in developing<BR>

<P>and implementing a comprehensive system of social service resources<BR>

<P>for families.  The Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities<BR>

<P>Program was created by Public Law 103-66 to assist poverty-stricken<BR>

<P>inner city and rural communities in identifying their assets and<BR>

<P>problems and structuring plans to improve conditions.  Further, an<BR>

<P>executive order called for increased flexibility for state/local<BR>

<P>waivers.  Per this order, agencies are to review and streamline their<BR>

<P>waiver application processes and consider waiver applications, where<BR>

<P>applicable, with the goal of increasing opportunities for utilizing<BR>

<P>regulatory approaches at the state/local levels.  While these laws<BR>

<P>and orders provide some framework for addressing this recommendation,<BR>

<P>agencies still need to develop procedures and regulations to<BR>

<P>implement the legislative initiatives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  While regulation of states and localities is an important<BR>

<P>tool for the federal government to attain its statutory objectives,<BR>

<P>tensions among levels of government have mounted over the years as<BR>

<P>regulatory requirements, preemptions, and mandates increased.  The<BR>

<P>cumulative effect of these increases could force state and local<BR>
governments to choose between meeting their service responsibilities<BR>

<P>and fulfilling national regulatory objectives. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  One law has been enacted related to this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  The Goals 2000:  Educate America Act encourages<BR>

<P>state and local agencies to develop comprehensive improvement plans,<BR>

<P>providing a framework for program integration, and gives the<BR>

<P>Education Secretary the authority to waive federal statutory and<BR>

<P>regulatory requirements.  Other legislation has been proposed to<BR>

<P>address this recommendation, but most have not been passed.  These<BR>

<P>other bills (H.R.  820, the Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of<BR>

<P>1993; H.R.  3421, the Federal Mandate Reduction, Reform, and Budget<BR>

<P>Act of 1993; S.  165, Amendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act;<BR>

<P>S.  490, the Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1993; S.  648,<BR>

<P>the Federal Mandates Relief Act of 1993, section 3; S.  993, the<BR>

<P>Community Regulatory Relief Act) would provide for changes to the<BR>

<P>federal regulatory rulemaking process.  The proposed bills would<BR>

<P>impose either more thorough analysis of the impact of federal<BR>

<P>regulation or federal reimbursement to states and localities for the<BR>
direct costs of federal rules and regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The administration issued Executive Order 12875 in October 1993,<BR>

<P>which calls for increased flexibility for state/local waivers.  The<BR>

<P>order directs federal agencies to review and streamline their waiver<BR>

<P>application processes with the goal of increasing opportunities for<BR>

<P>utilizing regulatory approaches at the state and local levels.  In<BR>

<P>addition, OMB is convening quarterly meetings with intergovernmental<BR>

<P>partners to identify actions to improve regulations affecting states<BR>

<P>and localities. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  While we have not recently studied the issue of<BR>

<P>raising the thresholds with regard to small purchases by local<BR>

<P>governments, we have taken the stance that thresholds for small<BR>

<P>purchases for the federal government should be raised.  Overall, we<BR>

<P>believe that grant administration can be simplified.  However, we<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We fully support strengthening intergovernmental<BR>

<P>partnerships to improve the delivery of services.  Because state and<BR>

<P>local governments are often the frontline providers of services,<BR>

<P>their views on ways to improve program efficiency and effectiveness<BR>

<P>should be given the utmost consideration.  While a reinvigorated ACIR<BR>

<P>could be the focal point for identifying opportunities to improve<BR>

<P>intergovernmental partnerships, we have not done work to support this<BR>

<P>expanded role and it is conceivable that other entities could also<BR>

<P>perform this function.  For example, individual federal agencies must<BR>

<P>become more involved in pursuing opportunities for stronger<BR>

<P>partnerships with state and local governments within existing<BR>

<P>structures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 34:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Goals 2000:  Educate America Act calls<BR>

<P>for the establishment of benchmarks in state improvement plans. <BR>

<P>Also, the Community Enterprise Board included benchmark requirements<BR>

<P>in its application package to encourage communities to set real goals<BR>

<P>and performance benchmarks for measuring revitalization progress.  A<BR>

<P>new ACIR executive director has been selected, members have been<BR>

<P>selected from federal, state, and local governments, and they are<BR>

<P>meeting on a quarterly basis to discuss the NPR recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>However, due to ACIR's limited budget, the agency is looking for<BR>

<P>outside sources to develop performance benchmark research.  ACIR<BR>

<P>noted that federal agencies will have to develop performance<BR>

<P>benchmarks because of their Government Performance Act requirements. <BR>

<P>IMPROVING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>(FM)<BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 28<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Of the 13 NPR financial management recommendations, 5 have been<BR>

<P>partially implemented and action has been taken on the remaining 8. <BR>

<P>Overall, these recommendations are in line with the thrust of the<BR>

<P>financial systems and information improvement actions our reports and<BR>

<P>testimonies have outlined and, if properly implemented, could result<BR>

<P>in strengthened government accountability. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Reliable financial reports that are easy to understand can help<BR>

<P>establish desperately needed accountability and provide the<BR>

<P>high-level credible information needed to help restore public<BR>

<P>confidence in government.  The enactment of the Government Management<BR>

<P>Reform Act of 1994, Public Law 103-356, underscores the government's<BR>

<P>efforts to (1) establish accountability within federal agencies, (2)<BR>

<P>provide decisionmakers the tools to better understand the issues<BR>

<P>government faces as well as the implications of the decisions it<BR>

<P>makes, and (3) better manage scarce resources once those decisions<BR>

<P>are made.  The financial statements of all executive agencies and<BR>

<P>activities required by this act will provide a wealth of critical<BR>

<P>information to Congress and the executive branch in assessing the<BR>

<P>government's financial status and making informed decisions. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      FM01:  ACCELERATE THE<BR>

<P>      ISSUANCE OF FEDERAL<BR>

<P>      ACCOUNTING STANDARDS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Issue a comprehensive set of federal financial accounting standards<BR>

<P>within 18 months.  If all standards are not issued under the present<BR>

<P>advisory board structure, create an independent federal financial<BR>

<P>accounting standards board. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>1.  Issue a comprehensive set of federal financial accounting<BR>

<P>standards within 18 months. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Create an independent federal financial accounting standards<BR>

<P>board with the power to develop, publish, and interpret accounting<BR>

<P>principles and standards for the federal government, if a<BR>

<P>comprehensive set of accounting standards is not issued within 18<BR>

<P>months. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Dedicate staff to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board<BR>

<P>(FASAB) to develop a high-level set of cost accounting standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We fully support the accelerated issuance of<BR>

<P>federal agency accounting standards.  We would not, at this time,<BR>

<P>though, endorse the creation of an independent standards setting<BR>

<P>board.  We have dedicated staff to FASAB to develop a high-level set<BR>

<P>of cost accounting standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  FASAB has recently made significant strides<BR>

<P>to accelerate its standard setting process and plans to have a<BR>

<P>substantially complete set of federal financial standards by the<BR>

<P>March 1995 deadline that NPR established.  It has completed one<BR>

<P>concept statement and three statements on accounting.  It has<BR>

<P>published an exposure draft on entity and display (August 1994),<BR>

<P>managerial cost accounting (October 1994), and liabilities (November<BR>

<P>1994).  Other projects are under way to complete a comprehensive set<BR>

<P>of accounting standards. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The amount of progress achieved during the next several months will<BR>

<P>be telling.  The question is not only how quickly FASAB can come to<BR>

<P>agreement on the many controversial matters inherent in these<BR>

<P>difficult issues, but also what the reactions will be to the exposure<BR>

<P>drafts on these issues, which will be circulated widely for comment<BR>

<P>after the board has reached agreement. <BR>

<P>      STRENGTHEN THE FINANCIAL<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT ROLES OF OMB AND<BR>

<P>      TREASURY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to clarify the roles of<BR>

<P>OMB and Treasury in financial management.  Create a governmentwide<BR>

<P>budget and financial information steering group to develop and<BR>

<P>provide guidance in implementing an integrated budget and financial<BR>

<P>information strategic plan.  Shift review of the Financial Management<BR>

<P>Service's budget to the OMB Deputy Director for Management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Develop an MOU to clarify central agency roles and<BR>

<P>responsibilities for financial management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Develop and publish a strategic plan for improving financial<BR>

<P>management. <BR>

<P>financial system. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  OMB's and Treasury's roles are pivotal to federal<BR>

<P>financial management reform; thus, it is essential that their<BR>

<P>responsibilities be clearly delineated and they be provided<BR>

<P>commensurate resources.  Also, we fully support the use of steering<BR>

<P>groups, such as the CFO Council and the Joint Financial Management<BR>

<P>Improvement Program (JFMIP), to improve financial management<BR>

<P>governmentwide.  We have not, though, specifically addressed the<BR>

<P>issue of shifting the review of Treasury's Financial Management<BR>

<P>Service's budget to OMB's Deputy Director for Management. <BR>

<P>
<P>Since the formulation of this recommendation, OMB has implemented OMB<BR>

<P>2000 which will shift some of the financial oversight<BR>

<P>responsibilities within OMB.  GAO has been requested to review OMB<BR>

<P>2000 to determine its impact on, among other things, the oversight of<BR>

<P>federal financial management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  While this recommendation has not been fully<BR>

<P>implemented, OMB, the CFO Council, and the JFMIP have taken steps<BR>

<P>towards achieving it. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We reviewed an April 18, 1994, draft of the MOU and found it does not<BR>

<P>include specifics for the roles and functions of Treasury and OMB. <BR>

<P>However, according to OMB, they are developing specific examples of<BR>

<P>OMB's and Treasury's functions that will be included as attachments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB issued its third Federal Financial Management Status Report and<BR>

<P>5-Year Plan in August 1994.  The current status report details<BR>

<P>milestones for accomplishment of various areas needing attention as<BR>

<P>detailed in the CFO Act.  Additionally, the CFO Council drafted and<BR>

<P>published a financial management vision with goals and strategies for<BR>

<P>governmentwide implementation.  These strategies, once developed,<BR>

<P>should cascade to agency level plans and be supported by specific<BR>

<P>agency operating strategies and performance measures that will show<BR>

<P>how they are progressing annually toward meeting their goals.  It is<BR>

<P>important that the next status report address the progress made in<BR>

<P>achieving the goals included with the vision statement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB has prepared a draft charter for the governmentwide budget and<BR>

<P>financial information steering group and the OMB Deputy Director for<BR>

<P>Management has been briefed.  Steering group members, however, have<BR>

<P>not been named. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The JFMIP issued a Framework for Federal Financial Management Systems<BR>

<P>exposure draft document in September 1994.  The document sets up a<BR>

<P>framework for integrating budget, financial and program information. <BR>

<P>A definition of an integrated financial system is included. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>High level tasks and major initiatives of the governmentwide<BR>

<P>integrated budget and financial information strategic plan are<BR>
contained in OMB's latest Federal Financial Management Status Report<BR>

<P>and 5-Year Plan, according to OMB.  They plan to coordinate those<BR>

<P>initiatives with the CFO Council and specific agency initiatives are<BR>

<P>to be identified during the upcoming fiscal year 1996 budget process. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Ensure that agency financial systems are in compliance with a revised<BR>

<P>OMB Circular A-127, &quot;Financial Management Systems,&quot; by September<BR>

<P>1996.  Provide interagency funding for the joint development of<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Ensure that agency financial systems are in compliance with the<BR>

<P>revised OMB Circular A-127. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Establish an innovation fund for financial systems development. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly endorse the concept of fully<BR>

<P>integrating budget, financial, and program information as mandated by<BR>
the CFO Act and urge that agency financial systems be in compliance<BR>

<P>with OMB Circular A-127.  While we have not specifically recommended<BR>

<P>that agencies jointly develop financial systems through interagency<BR>

<P>funding, we support the concept and have also suggested the<BR>

<P>possibility of agencies having standard systems and expanding the use<BR>

<P>of cross-servicing arrangements.  Wise investments in sorely needed<BR>

<P>modern financial systems are critical to the federal government's<BR>

<P>improving financial program management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We believe that existing working capital funds or other types of<BR>

<P>revolving funds could be used to fund agency efforts to promote<BR>

<P>innovations.  Congress has already provided statutory authority to<BR>

<P>create budget accounts in all executive departments with the<BR>

<P>essential features of the franchise fund proposals contained in<BR>

<P>Public Law 103-356.  These budget mechanisms are already being used,<BR>

<P>in select cases, to upgrade systems, including financial management<BR>

<P>systems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Public Law 103-356 calls for the establishment of a franchise fund<BR>

<P>pilot program in six executive agencies.  The funds can be used for,<BR>

<P>among other things, to acquire automated data processing systems, and<BR>

<P>financial management and management information systems.  (See FM06<BR>

<P>for more on franchise funds.  See also FM07 for more on innovation<BR>

<P>funds.)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  While the 24 CFO agencies have<BR>

<P>improvements under way, they will not be completed for quite a while. <BR>

<P>The need to upgrade the systems is a major point of emphasis in the<BR>

<P>CFO Act and has been a major point of concern on our audits. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB believes that the franchising fund proposals in Public Law<BR>

<P>103-356 will provide an effective interagency funding mechanism for<BR>

<P>joint development of financial systems.  However, these franchise<BR>

<P>funds will not be adequate to cover all of the needed system<BR>

<P>development costs.  Therefore, OMB is pursuing other initiatives to<BR>

<P>set up funding for systems which will also include provisions for<BR>

<P>joint agency systems development. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>JFMIP is working with the NPR FinanceNet Team to develop and<BR>

<P>implement an electronic clearinghouse via Internet.  The<BR>

<P>clearinghouse will include key financial management laws, standards,<BR>
policies, practices, and other guidance from the central agencies<BR>

<P>represented on JFMIP as well as content from program agencies. <BR>

<P>Current developments and &quot;best practices,&quot; when identified, will be<BR>

<P>featured.  A calendar of scheduled events and activities will be<BR>

<P>included.  Implementation, which started in September 1994, is taking<BR>

<P>place on a phased-in basis as documents are received and placed in<BR>

<P>FinanceNet.  Some documents are already in the library and others<BR>

<P>will be added and updated on a continuing basis.  Training on the use<BR>

<P>of FinanceNet is under development with training sessions slated to<BR>

<P>begin in the fall of 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>FASAB has issued the Exposure Draft for cost accounting standards. <BR>

<P>Funding for a dedicated core of systems personnel is not available,<BR>

<P>according to JFMIP.  Therefore, a task force has been formed which<BR>

<P>will utilize existing GAO work on cost accounting system<BR>

<P>requirements.  This work is sufficiently advanced that an exposure<BR>

<P>draft for systems requirements to implement the cost accounting<BR>

<P>standards is expected to be issued by March 1995. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.4.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Issue all federal employee pay and expense reimbursement through<BR>

<P>EFT. <BR>

<P>make them fully electronic and reduce the paperwork burden. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we support electronic funds transfer, we<BR>

<P>have found that there are some barriers in the agencies' ability to<BR>

<P>fully implement electronic commerce.  For example, GSA has<BR>

<P>encountered some limitations in its piloting of electronic data<BR>

<P>interchange (EDI).  Through Vendor Express, GSA can electronically<BR>

<P>transfer funds to vendors, however some vendors who agreed to use<BR>

<P>Vendor Express have requested to be taken off Vendor Express because<BR>

<P>of the system's inability to match payments with invoices.  Also,<BR>

<P>some of the smaller vendors with which the government is required to<BR>

<P>conduct business are not set up to handle Vendor Express. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Additionally, although a substantial amount of GSA's services are<BR>

<P>provided to DOD, DOD does not use the OPAC system which allows<BR>

<P>agencies to electronically transfer funds between Treasury accounts. <BR>

<P>Lastly, employee unions have worked to preserve employee rights to<BR>

<P>receive pay checks.  For example, GSA has two separate employee<BR>

<P>unions that have voted against employee mandated EFT for payroll<BR>

<P>checks. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  While this recommendation has not<BR>

<P>been implemented, OMB in conjunction with Treasury and other agencies<BR>

<P>has taken steps toward achieving it.  For example, on August 16,<BR>

<P>1994, OMB issued a policy (OMB Bulletin 94-09) that establishes and<BR>

<P>requires electronic funds transfer (EFT) as the federal government's<BR>

<P>standard method of payment.  The bulletin directs federal agencies to<BR>

<P>use EFT to (1) pay its employees; (2) make interagency payments; (3)<BR>

<P>pay vendors; (4) make payments to state and local governments,<BR>

<P>educational institutions, and other not-for-profit organizations; and<BR>

<P>(5) disburse benefits and assistance to individuals, including<BR>

<P>military and civilian retirees, disabled veterans, social security<BR>

<P>recipients, and public assistance beneficiaries.  The bulletin also<BR>

<P>encourages agencies to work with state and local governments to make<BR>

<P>EFT, along with electronic benefit transfer, an option for federal<BR>

<P>assistance programs administered by such nonfederal organizations. <BR>

<P>According to OMB, the next step is for Treasury--the lead agency for<BR>

<P>implementation of this initiative--to work with the other agencies to<BR>
ensure these requirements are implemented to the greatest extent<BR>

<P>practicable.  The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. <BR>

<P>103-356) requires recipients of federal wage, salary, or retirement<BR>

<P>payments, who begin to receive such payments on or after January 1,<BR>

<P>1995, to be paid such amounts by EFT, unless another method has been<BR>

<P>determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be appropriate. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Many agencies had fully electronic processes or plans in place for<BR>

<P>fully electronic processes prior to NPR's recommendation and have<BR>

<P>used the recommendation as an avenue to solicit cooperation from<BR>

<P>outside parties.  As required by the Electronic Commerce Application<BR>

<P>Team schedule, OPM purchased software to accommodate the electronic<BR>

<P>commerce program.  OPM plans to complete Vendor Express for accounts<BR>

<P>payable and Mainstreet for procurement by the end of fiscal year<BR>

<P>1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>About 95 percent of Commerce's interagency payments are being made<BR>

<P>through Treasury's OPAC System; and about 95 percent of Commerce's<BR>

<P>payments to state and local governments are being made by EFT. <BR>

<P>Commerce's plan calls for optimizing these two forms of payments<BR>

<P>through the CAMS, which is currently under development.  CAMS is<BR>

<P>being designed to make these payments automatically, when<BR>

<P>appropriate. <BR>

<P>
<P>GSA and OPM have electronic payroll systems.  GSA's system includes<BR>

<P>electronic approval whereas OPM's does not.  DOJ, GSA, and OPM<BR>

<P>encourage EFT for employee payroll checks.  GSA's payroll system is<BR>

<P>designed to have funds deposited in the employees' account to<BR>

<P>coincide with the date when funds are available to employees who<BR>

<P>receive checks.  National Finance Center's payroll system, which<BR>

<P>services numerous federal agencies, followed GSA's example and has<BR>

<P>changed the date of when funds are to be deposited in employee<BR>

<P>accounts.  GSA is currently working with DOD to use the OPAC system<BR>

<P>on a limited basis. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Treasury modified the Treasury Financial Manual to encourage all<BR>

<P>agencies to use EFT.  According to Treasury, it currently pays almost<BR>

<P>90 percent of its employees via EFTs and all of its interagency<BR>

<P>payments are made via OPAC. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly advocate these types of actions, which are<BR>

<P>critically needed to strengthen financial management leadership,<BR>

<P>attract and retain qualified financial management personnel, and<BR>

<P>develop useful and relevant financial reports that emphasize<BR>

<P>accountability and operating performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The CFO Act's objectives are integral to establishing accountability. <BR>

<P>We will begin to review CFO Act implementation at all 24 agencies in<BR>

<P>the act.  Our reviews will focus on assessing each agency's progress<BR>

<P>towards implementing the act's requirements, the status of<BR>

<P>implementing the NPR recommendations, and progress in achieving the<BR>

<P>goals as outlined in the Vision for Financial Management contained in<BR>

<P>the OMB Status Report and 5-Year Plan. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The passage of Public Law 103-356, which requires audited agencywide<BR>

<P>financial statements for executive agencies, will provide a<BR>

<P>foundation for ensuring that the information being collected,<BR>

<P>disseminated, and reported on is useful, objective, timely, and<BR>

<P>accurate for the benefit of program managers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Some progress has been made on most of the<BR>

<P>action items, but work remains to be done.  Qualification Standards<BR>

<P>established pursuant to the CFO Act for Chief Financial Officers and<BR>

<P>their Deputies were developed by OMB and distributed to all agencies<BR>

<P>in 1991.  OMB considers the group of CFOs in place to be<BR>

<P>well-qualified. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We have been encouraged by the quality of the current appointments to<BR>

<P>many of the agency CFO positions.  Strong CFO leadership is urgently<BR>

<P>needed to deal with the serious personnel and system weaknesses that<BR>

<P>are at the heart of the government's financial management problems. <BR>

<P>While OMB considers the current cadre of CFOs to be well qualified,<BR>

<P>it is also important that the agencies have qualified Deputy CFOs in<BR>

<P>place and that these officers have appropriate responsibilities as<BR>

<P>envisioned by the act.  Because this area is so critical, our<BR>

<P>assessments of CFO implementation will review in detail the<BR>

<P>qualifications of financial management personnel (action item 1) and<BR>

<P>whether financial management functions, as identified by OMB, are<BR>

<P>reporting to agency CFOs (action item 5).

Title:  GAO, Implementation of NPR Recommendations: FINANCIAL MGMT Part II<BR>

<P>Author: GAO<BR>

<P>Date:   December 5, 1994<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The CFO Council has begun identifying steps to ensure that all<BR>

<P>financial management personnel are fully qualified.  In a recently<BR>

<P>published document they have defined the CFO's role in strengthening<BR>

<P>financial management at the component organization level.  This<BR>

<P>document contains appendices with examples of position descriptions,<BR>

<P>critical job elements, and technical qualifications used for<BR>

<P>component CFOs.  It also details selected actions taken or planned by<BR>

<P>CFOs to strengthen organizational and personnel activities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>JFMIP is working with the CFO Council Human Resources Committee on<BR>

<P>CPE and training issues.  A jointly sponsored training symposium is<BR>

<P>scheduled to be held in November 1994.  The Association of Government<BR>

<P>Accountants is developing a Certified Government Financial Manager<BR>

<P>Program with specified CPE requirements for certificate holders.  It<BR>

<P>could have potential to provide a base for CPE/training for<BR>

<P>government financial managers, according to JFMIP.  There has been<BR>

<P>cross-agency training given by OMB, GAO and the Inspector General<BR>

<P>Auditor Training Institute on various topics during the past year,<BR>

<P>and this will be ongoing. <BR>

<P>
<P>The new OMB Deputy Director for Management has met individually with<BR>

<P>departmental deputy secretaries to discuss financial management<BR>

<P>issues according to OMB.  It is important that he and the recently<BR>

<P>appointed Controller have a continuing dialogue with departmental<BR>

<P>deputy secretaries on key financial management issues (action item<BR>

<P>4). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On February 9 and June 10, 1993, memorandums to agency heads were<BR>

<P>issued by OMB outlining the requirements of the CFO Act.  Emphasis<BR>

<P>was placed on the set of financial management functions that should<BR>

<P>report to agency CFO's in the June 10, 1993 memo from the OMB<BR>

<P>Director to agency heads.  The functions reporting to the CFOs are<BR>

<P>detailed by agency in the Status Report and 5-Year Plan along with an<BR>

<P>indication of those agencies planning to reorganize to meet the OMB<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>      SERVICES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.6<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President's Management Council should encourage agencies to<BR>

<P>purchase common administrative services, such as payroll, computer<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Implement franchising for service functions at the agency head's<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Congress has already provided statutory authority<BR>

<P>to create budget accounts in all executive departments to support<BR>

<P>centralized administrative services on a reimbursable basis.  These<BR>

<P>accounts have the essential features of the franchise fund proposals<BR>

<P>contained in Public Law 103-356, the Government Management Reform Act<BR>

<P>of 1994.  Absent a specific account, the Economy Act provides broad<BR>

<P>authority to all agencies to seek the most cost-effective means of<BR>

<P>procuring administrative services through interagency agreements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The Government Management Reform Act<BR>

<P>(P.L.  103-356), signed into law on October 13, 1994, allows<BR>

<P>franchise funds to be tested through pilot projects.  In addition, a<BR>

<P>separate agency proposal to expand GSA's existing working capital<BR>

<P>fund was included in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General<BR>

<P>Government Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1995 (P.L.  103-329). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action has been taken on the recommendation to establish a<BR>

<P>franchise implementation team under the President's Management<BR>

<P>Council.  However, the CFO Council has established a franchise<BR>

<P>planning committee to discuss issues related to cross servicing<BR>

<P>operations. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While making capital available for<BR>

<P>innovation could help the government strengthen and modernize its<BR>

<P>support services, it is not clear how this recommendation would be<BR>

<P>implemented.  Various budgetary mechanisms (working capital funds,<BR>

<P>business operating funds, etc.) are already available, and have been<BR>

<P>for many years, that allow accumulation of retained earnings.  These<BR>

<P>mechanisms could be used to fund agency efforts to promote<BR>

<P>innovations.  We did have concerns over the innovation fund proposal<BR>

<P>that the administration made as part of H.R.  3400.  That proposal<BR>

<P>would have been a significant departure from current<BR>

<P>legislative-executive relationships, and it is not clear whether the<BR>

<P>budget mechanism, as proposed, would have been self-sustaining. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The House-passed version of the<BR>

<P>Government Reform and Savings Act of 1993 (H.R.  3400) would have<BR>

<P>allowed innovation funds to be created at the discretion of agency<BR>

<P>heads, with the concurrence of OMB.  This provision was deleted from<BR>

<P>the Senate bill (S.  2170) and was not included in the Government<BR>

<P>Management Reform Act (P.L.  103-356).  The fiscal year 1995<BR>

<P>President's Budget proposed to establish a Reinvention Investment<BR>

<P>Fund--which would serve a similar purpose as an innovation<BR>

<P>fund--within the Department of Labor's working capital fund account. <BR>

<P>This proposal was deleted from the fiscal year 1995 appropriations<BR>

<P>act for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and<BR>

<P>Education, and related agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to OMB officials, there were three legislative proposals<BR>

<P>that would have allowed agencies to match funds:  (1) the franchise<BR>

<P>fund proposal in H.R.  3400, which was sharply curtailed in Public<BR>

<P>Law 103-356; (2) the innovation fund proposal in H.R.  3400, which<BR>

<P>was deleted in Public Law 103-356; and (3) section 527 of the<BR>

<P>Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act<BR>

<P>for fiscal year 1995, a general provision to roll over 50 percent of<BR>

<P>unobligated balances in salary and expense accounts contained in the<BR>

<P>act, which was restricted by requiring pre-approval by the House and<BR>

<P>Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to expending these funds. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In principle, GAO supports actions to improve<BR>

<P>federal cash management practices regarding small payments and the<BR>

<P>use of alternative pay, prompt pay, and other practices wherever<BR>

<P>appropriate, as long as these practice and procedures are accompanied<BR>

<P>by strong internal control systems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GAO has recommended that OMB Circular A-50, &quot;Audit Followup,&quot; be<BR>

<P>revised to indicate when audit recommendations should be closed and<BR>

<P>what kind of documentation is sufficient to support closure of audit<BR>

<P>recommendations.  We believe that much of the benefit from audit work<BR>

<P>is in the effective resolution of audit recommendations and that<BR>

<P>successful implementation should be the primary reason for closing<BR>

<P>them.  We also believe that while all recommendations need to be<BR>

<P>followed up on, follow up efforts should be concentrated on those<BR>

<P>recommendations which have substantial potential impact in terms of<BR>

<P>improved government operations.  Thresholds can provide a useful<BR>

<P>measure for determining, on a cost effective basis, the extent of<BR>

<P>follow-up and documentation required to close audit recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While we have not studied the elimination of time and attendance<BR>

<P>records, title 6 of GAO's Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance<BR>

<P>of Federal Agencies allows employees' time to be recorded on an<BR>

<P>exception basis, which is consistent with NPR's recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Treasury representatives told us that<BR>

<P>the Department is against letting agencies establish commercial<BR>

<P>checking accounts because it would lose interest revenue and control<BR>

<P>over the funds held by agencies.  It is, however, evaluating other<BR>

<P>options that would help agencies in making payments involving small<BR>

<P>amounts of money.  These options include the Fed Select Program and<BR>

<P>the use of electronic fund transfers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A Treasury/Financial Management Service-led task force is examining<BR>

<P>ways to fold together alternative pay, prompt pay, and electronic<BR>

<P>commerce payment practices for payments of small amounts due vendors. <BR>

<P>The task force plans to develop options and distribute them to<BR>

<P>agencies for comment in early 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB had planned to have a revision of Circular A-50, &quot;Audit<BR>

<P>Follow-up&quot;, ready sometime during fall 1994.  However, work on<BR>

<P>Circular A-50 has not been completed and OMB is considering combining<BR>

<P>Circular A-50 with Circular A-123, &quot;Internal Control Systems&quot;. <BR>

<P>
<P>Twenty-five agencies attended a June 6, 1994 meeting to discuss the<BR>

<P>status of agency implementation of automated time and attendance<BR>

<P>systems.  A little more than half of these agencies (14) already use<BR>

<P>some kind of automated time and attendance system; 10 of the<BR>

<P>remaining agencies plan to develop or obtain such automated systems. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We independently contacted four federal departments (Justice,<BR>

<P>Commerce, Labor, and Agriculture) and two independent agencies (GSA<BR>

<P>and OMB).  These departments/agencies are at various stages of<BR>

<P>addressing the recommendations on the use of timesheets, although<BR>

<P>several have already eliminated timesheets and enter time and<BR>

<P>attendance data on an exception basis.  GSA and OMB appear to be<BR>

<P>fairly far along.  OMB already enters time and attendance data on an<BR>

<P>exception basis to an automated system and approves the data<BR>

<P>electronically.  GSA is in the process of phasing in such a system. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On September 28, 1994, GAO sent a letter to the NPR in response to<BR>

<P>its request on timesheets and the use of the exception basis of<BR>

<P>recording payroll data, as it relates to GAO's title 6, Policies and<BR>

<P>Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.  Each of the<BR>

<P>applications proposed involved eliminating use of timesheets for<BR>

<P>full-time employees in a certain situation.  The letter expresses our<BR>
support for efforts to gain efficiencies by streamlining payroll<BR>

<P>operations, as long as such changes are made within a framework of<BR>

<P>adequate controls to insure that payroll related transactions are<BR>

<P>properly authorized and sufficient records of these transactions are<BR>

<P>maintained. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly support financial planning and<BR>

<P>accountability reporting as the cornerstone of improved federal<BR>

<P>financial reporting.  We also fully support efforts to consolidate<BR>

<P>and streamline reporting, where needed, with the goal of more useful<BR>

<P>and meaningful reporting.  However, the potential impact of this<BR>

<P>recommendation on specific reports to Congress and the President<BR>

<P>which agencies are required by law to prepare cannot be determined<BR>

<P>from the information provided.  Accordingly, it would be essential<BR>

<P>that any changes be fully coordinated with and agreed to by cognizant<BR>

<P>congressional committees. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.9.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The first action item has been completed with<BR>

<P>the passage of the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. <BR>

<P>103-356).  The act allows OMB to adjust the frequency and due dates<BR>

<P>of or consolidate any statutorily required reports of agencies to OMB<BR>

<P>or the President and of agencies or OMB to Congress under any laws<BR>

<P>for which OMB has financial management responsibility.  The act also<BR>

<P>has provisions for audited agency and governmentwide financial<BR>

<P>statements which will provide a foundation for the accountability<BR>
report mentioned in the second and third action items.  The agency<BR>

<P>planning report referred to in action item two is required for<BR>

<P>agencies beginning in 1997 under the Government Performance and<BR>

<P>Results Act of 1993.  More action may be needed to ensure that any<BR>

<P>future financial management reporting requirements be addressed in<BR>

<P>either the planning or the accountability reports, as recommended in<BR>

<P>action item three. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly believe that the public is entitled to<BR>

<P>be provided financial reports annually on the government's<BR>

<P>stewardship of taxpayer monies and that such financial statement<BR>

<P>information should be subjected to audit.  Thus, we believe the<BR>

<P>Annual Financial Report to the Public should be derived from the<BR>

<P>proposed audited governmentwide financial statements to make this<BR>

<P>report more useful and credible.  Also, we have generally advocated<BR>

<P>the inclusion in the budget of the expected costs of contingent<BR>

<P>liabilities, such as is done for credit programs under the Credit<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  While we have not examined all aspects of the<BR>

<P>credit management and debt collection programs.  We have specifically<BR>

<P>reported on the need for legislation to lift restrictions on the use<BR>

<P>of private collection agencies by the Customs Service.  Also, we have<BR>

<P>proposed that agencies keep a portion of any increased collections to<BR>

<P>improve debt collection systems and practices.  Further, we have<BR>

<P>Departments of Justice and Agriculture recently signed a memorandum<BR>
of understanding whereby special U.S.  Attorneys would be used to<BR>

<P>collect delinquent debts for the USDA. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While some progress has been made on other actions, these actions<BR>

<P>have not been fully implemented.  Progress has been made, for<BR>

<P>example, on the expansion of CAIVRS to other agencies.  As of June<BR>

<P>1994, in addition to HUD, three other agencies (the Departments of<BR>

<P>Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration, and the<BR>

<P>Department of Agriculture) are using CAIVRS.  Also, the Department of<BR>

<P>Education provides delinquent debt information to CAIVRS, and Justice<BR>

<P>will participate in CAIVRS by providing HUD with data on judgments. <BR>

<P>However, the recommendation to establish a credit management function<BR>

<P>in the Chief Financial Organization has not yet been completed.  OMB<BR>

<P>is developing a standard policy on how this will be implemented. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Also, agencies still need to improve their estimates of the allowance<BR>

<P>for doubtful accounts.  While our audit of Customs' and IRS' fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1993 financial statements noted that these agencies developed<BR>

<P>reliable methodologies for determining the collectibility of their<BR>

<P>receivables, we found that their accounting systems do not routinely<BR>

<P>produce reliable information about valid and collectible accounts<BR>

<P>receivable. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Further, SBA and HUD have established performance agreements with OMB<BR>

<P>for their loan and collection programs and USDA and VA are in the<BR>

<P>process of developing agreements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have reported that budget reporting of the cost<BR>
of most civilian personnel programs can be improved by including data<BR>

<P>on liabilities incurred, rather than on the cash basis.  While we<BR>

<P>have not addressed all facets of charging agencies for civilian<BR>

<P>retiree health benefits, we have reported on payments for retiree<BR>

<P>health benefits that the Postal Service is required to make to the<BR>

<P>Civil Service Fund.  Also, the accounting standards prescribed for<BR>

<P>use by the private sector require employers to recognize the cost of<BR>

<P>retiree health benefits when liable for making such payments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 28:2.13.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OMB has initiated actions to require<BR>

<P>all agencies to pay and report the full accruing costs of Civil<BR>

<P>Service Retirement System Pensions but they are not near completion. <BR>

<P>OMB recommended that Congress require all agencies to pay the full<BR>

<P>accruing cost of Civil Service Retirement System Pensions in the 1995<BR>

<P>Budget.  OMB is currently working with relevant agencies to draft<BR>

<P>legislation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OPM is currently involved in framing legislation that would require<BR>

<P>agencies to pay the full cost of benefits without having major<BR>

<P>budgetary implications for the contributing agencies.  In addition,<BR>

<P>OPM has been researching the possibility of charging agencies for the<BR>

<P>full accruing cost of civilian and retiree health benefits.  This<BR>

<P>research involves studying how these calculations would be made and<BR>

<P>how the costs should be reported, both by OPM and the contributing<BR>

<P>agencies.  According to OPM, no formal proposals have been developed<BR>

<P>but there are plans to have one developed by January 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) exposure<BR>

<P>draft on accounting for liabilities of the federal government would<BR>

<P>require that agencies report the full normal cost of Civil Service<BR>

<P>Retirement System Pensions in their accounting systems, and require<BR>

<P>that they be reported in the annual financial statements. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 32<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 32:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The recommendations in this section, which comprise an ambitious set<BR>

<P>of goals, are in their early stages of development.  These<BR>

<P>recommendations, designed to create an &quot;electronic government,&quot; could<BR>

<P>dramatically improve the type and level of service provided to<BR>

<P>citizens while reducing the cost of these services.  While action has<BR>

<P>been taken on all of these recommendations, none has been fully<BR>

<P>implemented and most are still in the planning stage.  Fortunately,<BR>

<P>the preliminary nature of these recommendations also creates an<BR>

<P>opportunity for the administration to address development concerns<BR>

<P>before plans are finalized and significant funding has been spent. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We believe three issues could adversely impact the successful<BR>

<P>implementation of these recommendations: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- The administration has created interagency groups to implement<BR>

<P>     many of these recommendations.  These groups are a good<BR>

<P>     mechanism for creating quick and meaningful involvement by<BR>

<P>     diverse federal agencies.  However, these groups rely upon the<BR>

<P>     current administration for their existence and do not have<BR>

<P>     independent funding sources.  Thus, interagency cooperation may<BR>

<P>     have to be strengthened and institutionalized to ensure the<BR>

<P>     long-term success of these recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Effective information management is a significant challenge at<BR>

<P>     most agencies.  For these recommendations to succeed over the<BR>

<P>     long term, agencies will need to improve their information<BR>

<P>     technology management skills and implementation practices.  If<BR>

<P>     these skills and practices are not improved, the benefits<BR>

<P>     promised from these recommendations may never be realized. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>  -- Policy makers should be aware that trade-offs may have to be<BR>

<P>     made between different national policy goals to fully implement<BR>

<P>     these recommendations. <BR>

<P>      LEADERSHIP TO INTEGRATE<BR>

<P>      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INTO<BR>

<P>      THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 32:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Create a Government Information Technology Services (GITS) Working<BR>

<P>Group to develop a strategic vision for the use of government<BR>

<P>information technology and to implement NPR's information technology<BR>

<P>recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 32:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Plan for effective use of information technology throughout<BR>

<P>government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Coordinate and oversee implementation of information technology<BR>

<P>plans. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 32:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the recommendation for developing a<BR>

<P>strategic vision for the use of government information technology. <BR>

<P>We have consistently cited poor management as a root cause of<BR>

<P>agencies' shortcomings in using information technology to streamline<BR>

<P>their operations and improve their service to the public. <BR>

<P>Specifically, top federal managers continue to overlook the strategic<BR>

<P>role of information technology in reengineering business practices. <BR>

<P>The working group has published a strategic vision and an<BR>

<P>implementation plan.  Actual implementation of the NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations, however, would likely require resources beyond the<BR>

<P>working group. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 32:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The charter for the GITS Working<BR>

<P>Group was approved on Feb.  10, 1994.  A draft statement of work has<BR>

<P>been developed to use contracted assistance to develop a governmental<BR>

<P>IRM enterprise model.  In addition, a strategic vision document for<BR>

<P>improving the use of IT in the federal government was published in<BR>

<P>September 1994.  GITS is continuing to meet with interagency teams to<BR>

<P>identify common IT implementation problems and solutions.  GITS also<BR>

<P>provided input into OMB's revision of Circular A-130 that encourages<BR>

<P>the integration of IRM plans with agency strategic plans and budgets. <BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 14<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:1<BR>

<P>
<P>The Department of Justice has fully implemented one NPR<BR>

<P>recommendation and either partially implemented or taken action on<BR>

<P>the other NPR recommendations for which it is responsible.  Justice<BR>

<P>has fully implemented the recommendation to make civil fraud recovery<BR>

<P>a priority and to take steps to improve its white collar fraud<BR>

<P>enforcement.  For many of the recommendations, Justice's actions have<BR>

<P>included such efforts as issuing resolutions, enhancing communication<BR>

<P>and coordination, awarding contracts, drafting new agency policies,<BR>

<P>developing proposals and pilot testing implementation plans.  Several<BR>

<P>recommendations on which Justice has taken action are expected to be<BR>

<P>implemented within the next year or two. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To improve the coordination and structure of federal law enforcement<BR>

<P>agencies, the Attorney General established the Office of<BR>

<P>Investigative Agency Policies (OIAP).  OIAP is responsible for<BR>

<P>resolving operational issues among the Justice's investigative<BR>

<P>agencies where there is overlapping jurisdiction and for advising the<BR>

<P>Attorney General regarding administrative, budgetary, and personnel<BR>

<P>matters involving these agencies.  While the creation of the OIAP<BR>

<P>within Justice appears to be a positive step toward improving<BR>

<P>coordination of law enforcement activities within the Department, it<BR>

<P>does not affect Department of the Treasury investigative agencies or<BR>

<P>other federal investigative agencies outside of Justice. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Several recommendations were not within Justice's authority to<BR>

<P>implement, so the Department drafted legislation.  Implementation of<BR>

<P>these recommendations will be determined through the legislative<BR>

<P>process. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      DOJ01:  IMPROVE THE<BR>

<P>      COORDINATION AND STRUCTURE<BR>

<P>      OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT<BR>

<P>      AGENCIES<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>NPR recommends the designation of the Attorney General as the<BR>

<P>Director of Law Enforcement to coordinate federal law enforcement<BR>

<P>efforts.  It also recommends changes in the alignment of federal law<BR>

<P>enforcement responsibilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the need for greater coordination of the<BR>

<P>numerous agencies involved in federal law enforcement.  The<BR>

<P>decentralized operations, including the 94 U.S.  Attorneys and the<BR>

<P>various investigative agencies within Justice and Treasury,<BR>

<P>complicate efforts by the Department of Justice to coordinate and<BR>

<P>direct a wide variety of initiatives and programs to fight crime.  We<BR>

<P>have not taken a position as to whether the various law enforcement<BR>

<P>agencies should be consolidated into one or more agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Other.  In November 1993, the Attorney General established the Office<BR>

<P>of Investigative Agency Policies (OIAP) to improve coordination among<BR>

<P>its law enforcement agencies, reduce duplication, and better utilize<BR>

<P>investigative resources.  OIAP is headed by a Director--currently the<BR>

<P>Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)--appointed by<BR>

<P>the Attorney General from among the heads of the affected<BR>

<P>investigative agencies--FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),<BR>

<P>U.S.  Marshals Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service<BR>

<P>(INS)--and Justice's Criminal Division.  OIAP is responsible for<BR>

<P>resolving operational issues among the Justice's investigative<BR>

<P>agencies where there is overlapping jurisdiction and for advising the<BR>

<P>Attorney General regarding administrative, budgetary, and personnel<BR>

<P>matters involving these agencies.  Among other things, OIAP has<BR>

<P>issued resolutions and begun taking actions to improve within Justice<BR>

<P>the (1) use and sharing of federal drug intelligence, (2)<BR>

<P>coordination of violent crime activities, (3) coordination of the<BR>

<P>budget requests of the various investigative agencies, and (4)<BR>
location and use of Justice field offices and resources. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>According to information obtained from Treasury officials, the<BR>

<P>Department also has begun taking several related actions to improve<BR>

<P>coordination among its investigative agencies as well as with Justice<BR>

<P>agencies.  Specifically, Treasury (1) recently established an under<BR>

<P>secretary position to coordinate its law enforcement activities, (2)<BR>

<P>is reorganizing its enforcement bureaus to be more mission specific,<BR>

<P>(3) has developed some interagency memoranda of understanding, and<BR>

<P>(4) is participating in task forces with FBI. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>While the creation of OIAP within Justice appears to be consistent<BR>

<P>with the underlying intent of the recommendation and a positive step<BR>

<P>toward improving coordination of law enforcement activities within<BR>

<P>the Department, OIAP does not have authority over and generally does<BR>

<P>not affect Treasury investigative agencies or other non-Justice<BR>

<P>federal investigative agencies.  Moreover, according to Justice,<BR>

<P>there have been no further actions on this recommendation pending<BR>

<P>NPR's issuance of the accompanying report.  Also, although Treasury<BR>

<P>apparently has taken some actions intended to improve coordination<BR>

<P>among its investigative agencies and with Justice agencies, we were<BR>
unable to obtain sufficiently detailed information to assess those<BR>

<P>actions. <BR>

<P>      DOJ02:  IMPROVE BORDER<BR>
      MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal border management should be significantly improved.  NPR<BR>

<P>recommends a series of actions to be taken by Customs and INS to make<BR>

<P>these improvements. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.2.1<BR>

<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Customs and INS have a long history of interagency rivalry,<BR>

<P>poor coordination, and ineffective cooperation, despite sharing<BR>

<P>responsibility for primary inspections at land border ports of entry. <BR>

<P>We have recommended that OMB, working with the Treasury, Justice, and<BR>

<P>State Departments, develop a proposal for ending the dual management<BR>

<P>of border inspections. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  INS and Customs are working on five<BR>

<P>cooperative areas:  coordinated shift scheduling; special operations;<BR>

<P>cross training; joint performance standards; and development of port<BR>

<P>quality improvement committees.  However, at this time there is no<BR>

<P>indication from INS or Customs that they are working on a strategic<BR>

<P>improvement plan or that the actions they are taking will<BR>

<P>comprehensively address previously identified problems. <BR>

<P>      COORDINATE RESOURCES<BR>

<P>      DEDICATED TO INTERDICTION OF<BR>

<P>      DRUGS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation outlines changes that can be made to better<BR>

<P>coordinate federal programs directed at the air interdiction of<BR>

<P>drugs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Given worldwide drug production capacity, domestic demand,<BR>

<P>and the resourcefulness of drug smugglers to adapt to U.S. <BR>

<P>enforcement initiatives, the overall availability of drugs in this<BR>

<P>country has not been diminished despite substantial increases in air<BR>

<P>interdiction efforts and related drug seizures.  The commitment of<BR>

<P>resources should not be made without considering the potential<BR>

<P>effectiveness of alternative efforts, both supply and demand, and<BR>
should be based on achieving measurable goals.  Also, to better<BR>

<P>coordinate agency efforts, improvements in information system<BR>

<P>interoperability, data integrity, security, and overall intelligence<BR>

<P>information management are needed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The recommended changes have not been<BR>

<P>implemented, but several agency actions have been taken.  Treasury<BR>

<P>and Justice have enhanced their communication and coordination on<BR>

<P>interdiction matters.  An example of the enhanced cooperation is the<BR>

<P>regular communication on interdiction matters between the Treasury's<BR>

<P>Under Secretary for Enforcement and the Deputy Attorney General. <BR>

<P>Justice has created the OIAP to strengthen coordination among FBI,<BR>

<P>DEA, INS, and the Marshals Service.  Also, the FBI and DEA have<BR>

<P>developed a common drug database to facilitate sharing of<BR>

<P>information. <BR>

<P>      EFFORTS<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>This recommendation would make improvements in the Justice debt<BR>
collection effort, including giving the Department the ability to<BR>

<P>retain a small percentage of debts collected and allowing Justice to<BR>

<P>credit its working capital fund with a percentage of debt collections<BR>

<P>to be used for the creation of a centralized debt tracking and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree with the recommendation's objectives of enhancing<BR>

<P>Justice's ability to make improvements in its debt collection effort. <BR>

<P>In October 1993, Congress enacted legislation allowing Justice to<BR>

<P>credit to its working capital fund up to 3 percent of all amounts<BR>

<P>collected pursuant to its civil debt collection activity.  Justice<BR>

<P>can use these funds to pay for costs of processing and tracking debt<BR>

<P>collection litigation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In November 1993, Justice awarded a contract<BR>

<P>to Data Transformation Corporation to develop and implement a<BR>

<P>financial litigation and collection management information system. <BR>

<P>The system will be similar to the COLLECTOR system which is presently<BR>

<P>used to track litigation and debt collection activities in 7 of the<BR>

<P>94 U.S.  Attorney Offices.  Justice, using another private<BR>

<P>contractor, Ogden Government Services, is testing the system to<BR>

<P>identify system strengths and weaknesses.  Justice has selected the<BR>

<P>U.S.  Attorneys Office in the District of Columbia as the first site<BR>

<P>for the new system and plans to implement the system nationally on a<BR>

<P>incremental basis during 1994.  In addition, Justice has expanded its<BR>

<P>pilot test of using private attorneys to collect civil debts from 10<BR>

<P>to 15 district offices. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.5<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NPR makes a series of recommendations for improving prison education,<BR>

<P>training, and inmate financial responsibility policies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.5.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) should<BR>

<P>strengthen its inmate education and training programs.  Many inmates<BR>

<P>leave prison without marketable job skills, English language<BR>

<P>proficiency, or completing a secondary education, yet are expected to<BR>

<P>become assimilated into society, i.e., become law-abiding productive<BR>

<P>citizens.  We have not examined inmate financial responsibility<BR>

<P>policies and have no comment on those recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  To further the education of inmates working<BR>

<P>in BOP labor programs (e.g., help inmates complete a GED diploma),<BR>

<P>BOP has drafted a program statement instructing institutions to<BR>

<P>increase the number of half-day work and education programs.  The<BR>

<P>program statement is to be implemented by December 1995. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>To provide increased work opportunities through job training, BOP has<BR>

<P>set up a recycling factory and increased the number of inmates<BR>

<P>participating in public works programs.  Other planned changes are<BR>

<P>dependent on legislative action.  For example, to expand work<BR>

<P>opportunities, BOP has sought legislation authorizing it to develop<BR>

<P>additional markets for its prison industry program.  Such statutory<BR>

<P>language was introduced and subsequently dropped from H.R.  3400. <BR>

<P>Also, legislative action is required to expand community service<BR>

<P>initiatives beyond federal projects. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Similarly, expansion of inmate financial responsibilities requires<BR>

<P>legislative action.  Statutory language to charge a nominal user fee<BR>

<P>for prison health care (one aspect of the financial responsibility<BR>

<P>programs) was prepared by DOJ but was dropped from H.R.  3400. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have identified the need for improvements in<BR>

<P>asset management and disposition activities by several agencies.  We<BR>

<P>are continuing to assess asset management and disposition activities<BR>

<P>of selected agencies.  We have work in progress to address possible<BR>

<P>duplication of resources within the Department of Justice and<BR>

<P>Treasury asset forfeiture programs.  Also, we are studying the<BR>

<P>feasibility of a single federal agency for disposing real property<BR>

<P>from four agencies:  Housing and Urban Development, Farmers Home<BR>

<P>Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Resolution<BR>

<P>Trust Corporation (RTC).  We will also identify recent federal<BR>

<P>government efforts to improve coordination among asset disposition<BR>

<P>entities. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Some actions have been taken to implement the<BR>

<P>NPR recommendation.  For example, the Departments of Justice and<BR>

<P>Treasury have agreed to jointly develop and implement a seized<BR>

<P>property tracking system to be used by all Justice and Treasury<BR>

<P>agencies as well as several other agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>RTC has taken actions to improve asset disposition by acting on the<BR>

<P>21 management reforms mandated by the RTC Completion Act of December<BR>

<P>1993.  Three of these reforms specifically address asset disposition. <BR>

<P>Another significant action to improve asset disposition is being<BR>

<P>taken by the Department of Treasury and the General Services<BR>

<P>Administration.  They are leading a pilot project designed to improve<BR>

<P>coordination between 11 federal agencies responsible for disposing of<BR>

<P>real property.  The project has included multi-agency sales and<BR>

<P>marketing events, and development of standards for program<BR>

<P>performance. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the recommendation's<BR>

<P>objectives of eliminating duplication and improving coordination in<BR>

<P>federal drug intelligence.  While NPR has recommended the position of<BR>

<P>Director of Law Enforcement to manage the national counternarcotics<BR>

<P>program, such a position has not yet been established.  Therefore,<BR>

<P>there is little detail provided on the roles and responsibilities of<BR>

<P>the office and how it will manage such an effort.  Overlapping<BR>

<P>responsibilities among the numerous law enforcement and defense<BR>

<P>agencies result in fragmentation and duplication.  NPR may want to<BR>

<P>further describe how the Director of Law Enforcement will improve<BR>

<P>coordination among such agencies as Justice, Treasury, and Defense. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The Attorney General has created the<BR>

<P>OIAP within the Department of Justice (28 C.F.R.  O.17).  This office<BR>

<P>was created to increase efficiency within the Department by<BR>

<P>coordinating specified activities of Justice's criminal investigative<BR>

<P>components.  The Director of the FBI serves as the Director of OIAP. <BR>

<P>
<P>OIAP, in a February 1994 resolution, acknowledged that law<BR>

<P>enforcement agencies have not maximized the sharing of information<BR>

<P>and coordination of activities in the drug intelligence arena.  To<BR>

<P>address this concern, three actions were recommended.  First, the FBI<BR>

<P>and DEA are to create a common drug database to consist of<BR>

<P>information contained in those agencies' existing databases.  Second,<BR>

<P>the DEA/Customs El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) Advisory Board is<BR>

<P>to consider the FBI's request for appointment of an FBI<BR>

<P>representative as a Deputy Director of EPIC.  Third, the National<BR>

<P>Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) Director is to coordinate strategic<BR>

<P>drug intelligence initiatives with all appropriate Justice law<BR>

<P>enforcement agencies.  None of these recommended actions has taken<BR>

<P>place.

<P>Author: GAO<BR>

<P>Date:   December 5, 1994<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Treasury officials said they have been cooperating with Justice in<BR>

<P>these efforts.  In addition, Treasury has enhanced the capabilities<BR>

<P>of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) by bringing more<BR>

<P>Treasury and non-Treasury agencies to participate in its financial<BR>

<P>information and anti-money laundering services.  They have also been<BR>

<P>&quot;selling&quot; the advantages of the Treasury Enforcement Communications<BR>

<P>(TEC) system to other law enforcement agencies.  FINCEN and the TEC<BR>

<P>system can provide substantial support to law enforcement agencies<BR>

<P>and thereby reduce duplication by eliminating the need for agencies<BR>

<P>to independently develop such services/information.  In addition,<BR>

<P>Treasury has consolidated drug intelligence personnnel from two of<BR>

<P>its centers to one center.  The Treasury operations center is being<BR>

<P>consolidated with an FBI center.  Treasury is phasing in its planned<BR>

<P>computer security controls for safeguarding the integrity and privacy<BR>

<P>of information.  These changes are covered by a December 1993 manual<BR>

<P>directive, Automated Information Systems and Network Security. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  Over the past decade, weak management systems and<BR>

<P>inconsistent leadership at INS led to segmented autonomous programs,<BR>

<P>each attempting to deal with its own set of problems without much<BR>

<P>attention to the impact on other INS programs.  Without coherent<BR>

<P>overall direction and basic management reforms, the organization has<BR>

<P>been unable to effectively address changing enforcement<BR>

<P>responsibilities and long-standing service delivery problems. <BR>

<P>Further, we have recommended the appointment of an Associate<BR>

<P>Commissioner for Financial Management as the focal point for<BR>

<P>developing an overall financial management plan. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The INS Commissioner developed a<BR>
reorganization proposal that was submitted to and approved by<BR>

<P>Congress.  INS expects to complete the reorganization soon.  However,<BR>

<P>it is too early to determine if the reorganization will fully address<BR>

<P>the concerns that we expressed in our previous reports or the<BR>

<P>concerns that prompted the NPR recommendation. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We believe that improving litigation<BR>

<P>service to customers is a goal that should be pursued by the<BR>

<P>Department.  We have reported on the need for uniform and accurate<BR>

<P>litigative case management data and on weaknesses in ADP management<BR>

<P>and operations, most notably in the area of ADP security.  We have<BR>

<P>not made an in-depth evaluation of other alternatives to existing<BR>

<P>litigation practices. <BR>

<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Justice is in the process of implementing but<BR>

<P>has not completed various actions to improve its effectiveness as the<BR>

<P>federal government's law firm.  For example, it has instituted a<BR>

<P>single identifier numbering system for tracking its caseloads and is<BR>

<P>developing a departmentwide case management system which should<BR>

<P>improve its ability to track cases now contained in separate agency<BR>

<P>systems.  Also, it has made some progress in exchanging attorneys<BR>

<P>among some of its various components to enhance training and<BR>

<P>cooperation within the Department and with other client agencies.  In<BR>

<P>addition, it has pilot tested a customer satisfaction survey which it<BR>

<P>hopes to complete and fine tune in October 1994 for full use. <BR>

<P>Insufficient Information.  We recognize that civil fraud recoveries<BR>

<P>are an important aspect of white collar fraud enforcement.  (See our<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.10.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  The Department of Justice has completed its<BR>

<P>planned actions to implement the NPR recommendation.  First, to<BR>

<P>emphasize white collar crime, the Attorney General announced at a<BR>

<P>U.S.  Attorney National Conference in January 1994 that white collar<BR>

<P>crime, especially health care fraud, was among the nation's top law<BR>

<P>enforcement priorities.  In March 1994, at House Appropriation<BR>

<P>hearings, the Attorney General described health care fraud as the<BR>

<P>Justice Department's second enforcement priority, with violent crime<BR>

<P>being the highest priority.  Second, to attack health care fraud in a<BR>

<P>coordinated fashion, the Department of Justice has developed an<BR>

<P>executive level health care fraud group.  Third, in October 1993<BR>

<P>Congress enacted legislation allowing Justice to credit to its<BR>

<P>working captial fund up to 3 percent of all amounts collected from<BR>

<P>its civil debt collection activity to pay for the costs of processing<BR>

<P>and tracking debt collection litigation.  Lastly, the Departmentof<BR>

<P>Justice has included at least one senior attorney from its Civil<BR>

<P>Division in the white collar fraud civil enforcement working group. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  Although we have not studied this issue,<BR>

<P>this is an area where we would agree that further examination could<BR>

<P>prove worthwhile.  Law enforcement agencies, while having unique<BR>

<P>missions that require individualized training, frequently have<BR>

<P>overlapping jurisdictions and perform functions that require similar<BR>

<P>Other.  The Department of Justice has not as yet addressed this<BR>

<P>issue.  However, Treasury officials believe a mechanism is already in<BR>

<P>place which is dedicated to accomplishing this recommendation.  The<BR>

<P>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, or FLETC, was established in<BR>

<P>1970 to accomplish common training of law enforcement investigators<BR>

<P>while allowing individual participating agencies to do specialized<BR>

<P>training.  Although Treasury supervises administrative and financial<BR>

<P>activities, FLETC is governed by an eight-member Board of Directors<BR>

<P>representing participating agencies, including the Departments of<BR>

<P>Justice, Treasury, and Interior and the General Services<BR>

<P>Administration (GSA).  In all, over 70 law enforcement agencies<BR>

<P>participate in FLETC.  However, several agencies are not<BR>

<P>participants, including U.S.  Postal Inspection Service, Drug<BR>

<P>Enforcement Administration, and the Army Criminal Investigation<BR>

<P>Division; in addition, the FBI maintains its own training facilities. <BR>

<P>
<P>The current method of completing background examinations on federal<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.12.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have not specifically reviewed this issue with<BR>

<P>respect to Justice employees.  But, given our past work at other<BR>

<P>agencies, we endorse the concept of streamlining background<BR>

<P>investigations provided that thoroughness is not jeopardized,<BR>

<P>particularly with respect to the investigation of employees for<BR>

<P>sensitive positions such as those in law enforcement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.12.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Department of Justice has not as yet<BR>

<P>addressed this issue.  However, Treasury is in the process of<BR>

<P>implementing or evaluating actions it can take in response to the NPR<BR>
recommendation.  Specifically, the implementation of a Treasury<BR>

<P>Security Manual will replace OPM's Federal Personnel Manual and will<BR>

<P>address both personnel security and security investigation matters. <BR>

<P>It is anticipated that the manual will be released in early fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1995.  The manual will specify minimum requirements for<BR>

<P>employment at Treasury but will allow stricter ones for bureaus that<BR>

<P>request them.  Moreover, the manual will allow the bureaus to<BR>

<P>investigate applicants or secure investigation by other means. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In the area of periodic reinvestigations, Treasury is pilot testing a<BR>

<P>streamlined investigation procedure focusing on criminal background<BR>

<P>and credit checks.  Treasury is also discussing with intelligence<BR>

<P>agencies ways to modify or reduce requirements for obtaining Top<BR>

<P>Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance.  Finally,<BR>

<P>Treasury is in the process of implementing an on-line system for<BR>

<P>tracking employees' clearance status and need for periodic<BR>

<P>reinvestigation.  For certain Treasury components this system went<BR>

<P>on-line May 23, 1994 and the remaining components are expected<BR>

<P>on-line by the end of 1994. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 14:2.13<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Civil monetary penalties have not been adjusted to keep up with<BR>

<P>inflation.  Under this recommendation, a &quot;catch-up&quot; adjustment would<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  In principle, we agree that civil penalties should<BR>

<P>be periodically adjusted so that they do not lose relevancy. <BR>

<P>Although we have not made a detailed examination of the specifics of<BR>

<P>this recommendation (the final NPR accompanying report has not been<BR>

<P>issued), we recognize that such adjustments could be based on<BR>

<P>inflation as well as other factors such as deterrence.  Our prior<BR>

<P>work on civil debt and criminal fines has shown that many of the<BR>

<P>currently imposed criminal and civil fines and penalties remain<BR>

<P>uncollected.  As of the end of fiscal year 1993, the Department of<BR>

<P>Justice estimated the total amount of unpaid criminal debt exceeded<BR>

<P>$3.5 billion, and civil debt exceeded $1.9 billion; the balances owed<BR>

<P>implement an inflation adjustment for civil monetary penalties.  H.R. <BR>

<P>3400, as passed by the House of Representatives in November 1993,<BR>

<P>included provisions to use an inflation index to revise all monetary<BR>

<P>penalties every 4 years, and to provide for an immediate one-time<BR>

<P>catch-up adjustment.  The provision was deleted from the bill in the<BR>

<P>Senate (S.  2170).  Subsequently, S.  2170 was enacted as Public Law<BR>

<P>103-356 on October 13, 1994, and did not contain the provision in<BR>

<P>question. <BR>

<P>concerns it is intended to address.  Nonetheless, we recognize that<BR>

<P>federal courthouses need to be secure and Marshals Service resources<BR>

<P>need to be targeted at the greatest security needs based on<BR>

<P>systematic assessments of potential risk.  In this regard, we issued<BR>

<P>a report on federal judicial security in July 1994 that contained<BR>

<P>numerous recommendations aimed at ensuring that a comprehensive<BR>

<P>risk-based security program is fully and consistently implemented in<BR>

<P>all judicial districts; that the program include assessments of<BR>

<P>off-site security risks and needs; and that the Marshals Service,<BR>

<P>Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC), and GSA clarify<BR>

<P>their roles and responsibilities for judicial security and<BR>

<P>effectively coordinate and carry them out.  Justice, as well as the<BR>

<P>number of persons sent to prison.  Between fiscal years 1986 and<BR>

<P>1992, the federal inmate population grew from 41,500 to more than<BR>

<P>89,000, in part reflecting changes in sentencing policies.  Absent a<BR>

<P>change in those policies, the rapid growth in the federal prison<BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 14:2.16.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  BOP is making a number of programmatic<BR>

<P>changes in an attempt to develop lower-cost solutions to federal<BR>

<P>prison space problems.  By October 1995, BOP expects to activate a<BR>

<P>third boot camp (Lompoc Boot Camp) and is in the process of<BR>

<P>requesting funding for four additional camps so that each region will<BR>

<P>have one boot camp.  Also, as part of a pilot test, BOP has expanded<BR>

<P>its comprehensive sanction centers by adding 350 inmate beds. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Justice has also been exploring sentencing options.  Given that drug<BR>

<P>offenders comprise a substantial proportion of the inmate population,<BR>

<P>Justice has analyzed the impact of changes to the mandatory minimum<BR>

<P>sentencing of certain drug offenders, e.g., those with minimal<BR>

<P>criminal histories.  Administration officials are also meeting to<BR>

<P>consider legislative proposals related to community corrections and<BR>

<P>the resultant potential for freeing up prison bed space.  No<BR>

<P>consensus has yet been reached on what should be done.  Regarding<BR>

<P>home confinement, BOP officials do not envision a substantial<BR>

<P>increase unless legislation is enacted that would change the<BR>

<P>=========================================================== Section 24<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 24:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal management control systems are intended to help ensure the<BR>

<P>economical and effective operation of federal programs, activities,<BR>

<P>and organizations.  As a result of breakdowns in these systems,<BR>

<P>federal programs have not achieved their intended outcomes and<BR>

<P>billions of dollars have been lost due to fraud, waste, abuse, and<BR>

<P>mismanagement.  The NPR recommendations in this area have highlighted<BR>

<P>the critical need for greater coordination and cooperation among<BR>

<P>agency management, legal counsel, auditors, and Congress.  They also<BR>

<P>create the opportunity for greater efficiency and effectiveness<BR>

<P>through the reduction of reports and regulations that, while<BR>

<P>requiring significant resources, provide little added value to<BR>

<P>programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Implementation efforts are under way on seven of the eight<BR>

<P>recommendations.  Completion of these actions will be an important<BR>

<P>step in the correction of the problems that exist in the management<BR>

<P>controls area.  However, because these actions will involve efforts<BR>

<P>at departments and organizations throughout the government, effective<BR>

<P>implementation will require a sustained effort and it will likely<BR>

<P>take several years before the intended benefits will be realized.  No<BR>

<P>action has been taken to implement a systems design approach to<BR>

<P>management control. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      SMC01:  IMPLEMENT A SYSTEMS<BR>

<P>      DESIGN APPROACH TO<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT CONTROL<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Redesign the existing collection of management control mechanisms for<BR>

<P>the executive branch, using a systems design approach, in order to<BR>

<P>create a well-managed and cost-effective system. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Redesign the existing set of control mechanisms for the executive<BR>

<P>branch, using a systems design approach. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We fully support agency and governmentwide efforts<BR>

<P>to strengthen internal control systems.  For example, systems should<BR>

<P>be cost-effective and managers should manage for risks.  We also<BR>

<P>agree that the management control system should include preventative<BR>

<P>actions and results-oriented measures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--No Action Taken.  The President's Management Council<BR>

<P>(PMC), which serves as the President's chief instrument to retool<BR>

<P>management systems throughout the executive branch, has been<BR>

<P>designated responsibility for implementing this recommendation.  The<BR>

<P>PMC has not taken action on this recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         RELATED GAO PRODUCTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.1.4<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Financial Management:  DOD Has Not Responded Effectively to Serious,<BR>

<P>Long-Standing Problems (GAO/T-AIMD-93-1, July 1, 1993). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Government Management:  Report on 17 High-Risk Areas (GAO/T-OCG-93-2,<BR>

<P>Jan.  8, 1993). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Federal Internal Control and Financial Management Systems:  Major<BR>

<P>Reform Efforts Are Needed (GAO/T-AFMD-90-14, Apr.  18, 1990). <BR>

<P>      INTERNAL CONTROLS PROGRAM TO<BR>

<P>      MAKE IT AN EFFICIENT AND<BR>

<P>      EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT TOOL<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Rescind the current set of Internal Control Guidelines and replace<BR>

<P>them with a broader handbook on management controls. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Rewrite OMB Circular A-123, &quot;Internal Control Systems,&quot; to be a<BR>

<P>succinct document that defines the policy for establishing and<BR>

<P>reviewing management controls. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Replace OMB's existing Internal Control Guidelines with a<BR>

<P>handbook on management controls. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Revise government-sponsored management training to teach<BR>

<P>management control as an integral function of management, not as a<BR>

<P>reporting requirement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 24:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Clearly, changes are needed in the government's<BR>

<P>internal control program.  Agencies must fix the long-standing<BR>

<P>control weaknesses that limit the efficiency and effectiveness of<BR>

<P>their programs and undermine public confidence in government.  Over a<BR>

<P>decade after the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA)<BR>

<P>became law, we see the same kinds of internal control problems<BR>

<P>emerging in our current audits as existed prior to the act's passage. <BR>

<P>Moreover, our audits of the Air Force, Army, NASA, Internal Revenue<BR>

<P>Service, and the Customs Service have identified a lack of adequate<BR>

<P>reporting of those problems as required by FMFIA.  GAO and OMB<BR>

<P>efforts have shown that serious problems, when they are properly<BR>

<P>identified, are deep-rooted and require major efforts to correct. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A broader handbook on management controls could be a part of the<BR>

<P>solution.  But, ways must be found to shift the focus from a<BR>

<P>process-oriented activity to an identification of the root causes of<BR>

<P>the problems and the correction of those problems.  Senior managers<BR>

<P>must be held accountable for fixing the internal control problems<BR>

<P>that are identified.  A start should be made on those that pose the<BR>

<P>highest risk.  Of course, in designing control systems, a<BR>

<P>cost-benefit analysis is required and agencies' operations must not<BR>

<P>be impeded. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support inspectors general broadening their role<BR>

<P>to evaluate management control systems and, when circumstances<BR>

<P>warrant it, to be more collaborative and less adversarial.  The key<BR>

<P>is to appoint inspectors general with the competence and interest in<BR>

<P>taking on this broader role.  In that regard, financial audits under<BR>

<P>the CFO Act, for which inspectors general now have responsibility,<BR>

<P>provide much of the needed incentive and opportunity.  We would<BR>

<P>caution, however, that inspectors general not lose sight of their<BR>

<P>independence and other legislative responsibilities to conduct audits<BR>

<P>and investigations. <BR>

<P>on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) and the Executive Council on<BR>

<P>Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) in January 1994, is an important<BR>

<P>first step in defining their broader role while reaffirming their<BR>

<P>statutory mission.  The vision statement addresses ways for the IGs<BR>

<P>to work with agency heads and managers to improve program management,<BR>

<P>maximize the positive impact of the IG's reviews, and provide<BR>

<P>recommendations to prevent problems before they occur. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. <BR>

<P>103-356) requires that executive agencies prepare annual audited<BR>

<P>financial statements covering all accounts and associated activities. <BR>

<P>These audits are the responsibililty of the IGs and provide<BR>

<P>opportunities for the IGs and management to work together to make<BR>

<P>improvements to management control systems.  However, auditing<BR>

<P>management's compliance with applicable laws and regulations<BR>

<P>continues to be a significant part of these audits and other work<BR>

<P>states that OGCs should help identify alternative approaches whenever<BR>

<P>they consider a proposed management initiative to be not legally<BR>

<P>acceptable.  In addition, ACUS was requested to evaluate and<BR>

<P>recommend whether it is desirable to reestablish the now-defunct<BR>

<P>Federal Legal Council to address common legal issues related to<BR>

<P>implementing other NPR recommendations, and the training needed. <BR>

<P>Agree.  We have long recognized the importance of being attuned to<BR>

<P>our customers' needs.  In 1992, we surveyed key congressional staff,<BR>

<P>representing our primary customers, in an effort to find ways to<BR>

<P>improve our services.  We are also looking at ways to get feedback<BR>

<P>from agencies so we can be assured that our work is as helpful as<BR>

<P>possible to them as well.  We fully recognize that, like everyone<BR>

<P>else, we need to continuously seek ways to better serve our customers<BR>

<P>if we are to improve our effectiveness. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In our reports, it has always been our policy to recognize noteworthy<BR>

<P>management accomplishments identified during our work.  Government<BR>

<P>auditing standards note that such information is necessary to fairly<BR>

<P>present, and provide balance to, the issues covered.  Including such<BR>

<P>information could stimulate improved performance by other government<BR>

<P>(OPM), and the General Services Administration (GSA) have said that<BR>

<P>they are receptive to considering waivers, although none of these<BR>

<P>central management agencies have established a coordinated process to<BR>

<P>apply for waivers.  For example, OMB will consider waivers on an<BR>

<P>frustrated by the complexity and time-consuming nature of applying<BR>

<P>for waivers.  These agencies have had difficulties determining which<BR>

<P>regulations require a waiver from the central management agencies,<BR>

<P>which regulations are imposed by law and which regulations were<BR>

<P>created by the agencies themselves.  Some executive agencies have<BR>

<P>been granted waivers.  For instance, the State Department and<BR>

<P>Bonneville Power Administration have requested and received waivers<BR>

<P>from selected GSA regulations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In addition, OMB has been authorized, through GPRA, to designate<BR>

<P>several pilot projects within a variety of executive agencies to test<BR>

<P>managerial accountability and flexibility.  OMB will be granting<BR>

<P>these pilot projects waivers from certain nonstatutory administrative<BR>

<P>requirements to give managers greater flexibility in managing their<BR>

<P>programs and organizations in return for greater accountability for<BR>

<P>program results and performance. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 30:1<BR>

<P>
<P>Enactment of comprehensive procurement reform legislation in October<BR>

<P>1994, coupled with notable executive agency initiatives in several<BR>

<P>areas, resulted in actions that we believe &quot;fully implemented&quot; 2 NPR<BR>

<P>recommendations and &quot;partially implemented&quot; 15 of the remaining 18<BR>

<P>recommendations.  Actions have been taken to implement the remaining<BR>

<P>three NPR recommendations in this section.  To implement NPR's<BR>

<P>recommendation to incorporate such principles as customer focus in<BR>

<P>procurement, the administration issued Executive Order 12931 in<BR>

<P>October 1994.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 fully<BR>

<P>implements the NPR recommendation to authorize multiyear contracts<BR>

<P>and allow contracts for severable services to cross fiscal years. <BR>

<P>The act made other legislative changes NPR recommended, which should<BR>

<P>improve procurement system operations, workforce, and culture. <BR>

<P>Specifically, the act will permit procurement officials to build an<BR>

<P>innovative workforce, test new procurement methods, use simplified<BR>

<P>acquisition procedures more frequently, amend certain protest rules,<BR>

<P>enhance programs for small and small disadvantaged businesses,<BR>

<P>increase use of purchase cards and federal supply schedules, make it<BR>

<P>easier to buy commercial items, establish a governmentwide electronic<BR>

<P>commerce program, encourage best value procurement, promote<BR>

<P>excellence in vendor performance, and conform requirements for<BR>

<P>civilian and defense agencies' procurements.  The act did not include<BR>

<P>provisions to authorize use of a two-phase competitive source<BR>

<P>selection process for certain types of contracts, as recommended by<BR>

<P>NPR. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Executive agencies and departments addressed several NPR action items<BR>

<P>through various initiatives, particularly in the areas of simplified<BR>

<P>acquisition procedures, use of purchase cards, acquisition labor laws<BR>

<P>and regulations, information technology procurements, electronic<BR>

<P>commerce, commercial item procurements, best value buying, and buying<BR>

<P>for the environment.  We strongly support procurement reform, the<BR>

<P>reform legislation, and agencies' reform actions.  To sustain this<BR>

<P>noteworthy progress and translate the NPR and legislative reform<BR>

<P>goals into day-to-day operating realities will require government<BR>

<P>procurement officials to develop and implement long-term strategies<BR>

<P>and programs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      PROC01:  REFRAME ACQUISITION<BR>

<P>      POLICY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Convert the 1,600 pages of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<BR>

<P>from a set of rigid rules to a set of guiding principles. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Convert the Federal Acquisition Regulation from rigid rules to<BR>

<P>guiding principles. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Implement the procurement reform plan. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy<BR>

<P>(OFPP), within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is<BR>

<P>reviewing several possible approaches to rewriting the FAR. <BR>

<P>Information on specific changes is not yet available. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  OFPP established an interagency group<BR>

<P>of senior officials to implement this recommendation.  OFPP published<BR>

<P>(1) proposed guiding principles to define and guide the government's<BR>

<P>general vision for the acquisition process and (2) alternative<BR>

<P>approaches for rewriting the FAR.  OFPP requested written comments<BR>

<P>and also held a public meeting to receive ideas and suggestions. <BR>

<P>OFPP is reviewing these comments, ideas, and suggestions.  OFPP<BR>

<P>officials told us that a plan to rewrite the FAR has not yet been<BR>

<P>developed. <BR>

<P>      PROCUREMENT WORKFORCE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Establish an interagency program to improve the governmentwide<BR>

<P>procurement workforce.  Provide civilian agencies with authority for<BR>

<P>improving the acquisition workforce similar to that of the Defense<BR>

<P>Department's. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Establish an interagency program to improve the federal<BR>

<P>government's procurement workforce. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Provide civilian agencies with authority similar to DOD's for<BR>

<P>improving the acquisition workforce. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly support efforts to improve the management,<BR>

<P>training, and career development of the procurement workforce<BR>

<P>governmentwide.  We believe all agencies, civilian as well as<BR>

<P>military, should have the authority needed to improve acquisition<BR>

<P>workforce management and training.  However, we have not specifically<BR>

<P>addressed the applicability to civilian agencies of the Defense<BR>

<P>Department's authority and initiatives in acquisition workforce<BR>

<P>issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The NPR Accompanying Report calls for the<BR>

<P>Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), to develop a<BR>

<P>plan to fund Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) programs to improve<BR>

<P>the governmentwide procurement workforce.  The OFPP Administrator is<BR>

<P>responsible for recommending a sufficient budget for the FAI to the<BR>

<P>GSA.  OFPP recommended that the fiscal year 1996 GSA budget include a<BR>
one-time increment of $950,000 to enable FAI to (1) complete the<BR>

<P>courses in the competency-based skills development program for<BR>

<P>contract specialists, and (2) develop and pilot test instruction in<BR>

<P>procurement to be delivered via desktop computers so that contracting<BR>

<P>personnel can receive training and instruction on an interactive<BR>

<P>basis in their office environment.  GSA forwarded the OFPP<BR>

<P>recommended FAI initiatives to OMB, but not as part of the GSA<BR>

<P>appropriations budget request.  The FAI initiatives will not be<BR>

<P>funded unless OMB includes additional resources in the fiscal year<BR>

<P>1996 GSA budget for them. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 provides civilian<BR>

<P>agencies with authority similar to DOD's for improving the<BR>

<P>acquisition workforce.  Among other things, the act requires the<BR>

<P>Deputy Director for Management of OMB to:  (1) establish policies and<BR>

<P>procedures for designating acquisition positions and managing<BR>

<P>employees (including the accession, education, training, and career<BR>

<P>development of employees) in the designated acquisition positions,<BR>

<P>and (2) review the incentives and personnel actions available for<BR>

<P>encouraging excellence in the federal acquisition workforce.  In<BR>

<P>addition, Executive Order 12931, dated October 13, 1994, requires<BR>

<P>heads of executive agencies to establish career education programs<BR>

<P>and enhance development of the procurement workforce. <BR>

<P>methods.  Establish a mechanism to disseminate information<BR>

<P>governmentwide on innovative procurement ideas. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.3.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>
----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support agency testing of innovative procurement<BR>

<P>methods and believe that establishing means to publicize innovative<BR>

<P>ideas could be beneficial.  Adequate controls and oversight over<BR>

<P>testing should be maintained, however. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 authorizes the OFPP Administrator to test alternative and<BR>

<P>innovative procurement procedures.  The act further stipulates that<BR>

<P>OFPP not take action to use the test authority at an agency before<BR>

<P>the date on which the agency head certifies to Congress that it has<BR>

<P>implemented full electronic commerce capability.  In February 1994,<BR>

<P>the former Associate Administrator for Acquisition Policy, GSA,<BR>

<P>recommended funding Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) initiatives<BR>

<P>to (1) develop and pilot test an electronic acquisition curriculum,<BR>

<P>and (2) determine the feasibility, costs, and benefits of<BR>

<P>establishing a research consortium, including both public and private<BR>

<P>sector research activities.  There is no funding in the GSA fiscal<BR>

<P>year 1996 appropriations budget request for either of these<BR>

<P>initiatives.  OFPP officials said the recommendation to establish a<BR>

<P>steering group to oversee and set strategy for FAI research has<BR>

<P>merit; however, OFPP has not yet identified the group. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support recommendations such as these which, if<BR>

<P>effectively implemented, can (1) increase the productivity of a<BR>

<P>shrinking federal workforce, (2) reduce costs for both the government<BR>

<P>and its suppliers, and (3) enhance federal contracting opportunities<BR>

<P>for small businesses.  We believe that an electronic commerce (EC)<BR>

<P>capability that employs nationally accepted industry standards can<BR>

<P>help to achieve these reform goals. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 establishes a new simplified acquisition threshold at $100,000,<BR>

<P>and waives numerous laws for purchases below that amount.  Simplified<BR>

<P>acquisition procedures are initially authorized for all contracts<BR>

<P>below $50,000, subject to the requirement that notice of solicitation<BR>

<P>be published in the Commerce Business Daily for contracts above<BR>

<P>$25,000.  Waivers of notice and use of simplified procedures for<BR>

<P>contracts up to $100,000 are permitted under the act for the next 5<BR>

<P>years for agencies with an interim level of EC capability.  After 5<BR>
years, however, the authorization for the use of simplified<BR>

<P>procedures reverts to $50,000 for any agency that has not achieved<BR>

<P>full electronic commerce capability. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>On October 26, 1993, the President signed an executive memorandum on<BR>

<P>&quot;Streamlining Procurement through Electronic Commerce,&quot; which<BR>

<P>requires, among other things, that electronic commerce be implemented<BR>

<P>for appropriate federal purchases as quickly as possible.  In a<BR>

<P>September 21, 1994, memorandum, the OMB Acting Director provided<BR>

<P>guidance to the heads of executive departments and agencies to assist<BR>

<P>them in developing their long-range EC implementation plans.  The<BR>

<P>guidance requires agencies and departments to focus their plans on<BR>

<P>small purchases, including milestones and estimated costs for<BR>

<P>integrating existing electronic small purchase systems and bulletin<BR>

<P>boards into the governmentwide EC program, to support a single face<BR>

<P>to industry.  OMB began reviewing the agencies' implementation plans<BR>

<P>in October 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council has adopted an action plan<BR>

<P>that establishes regulation writing teams and milestones for<BR>

<P>developing the implementing regulations for the Federal Acquisition<BR>

<P>Streamlining Act of 1994.  In addition, federal agencies have<BR>

<P>reported to the NPR that they are in the process of reviewing their<BR>

<P>internal regulations to ensure that they (1) do not impede the<BR>

<P>objectives of simplified purchasing, and (2) comply with the<BR>

<P>statutory requirements of the act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OMB and the Small Business Administration are coordinating outreach<BR>

<P>and training activities to inform small businesses about changes in<BR>

<P>government procurement policies, including new statutory requirements<BR>

<P>applicable to purchases made using simplified acquisition procedures. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We believe that simplification of acquisition labor<BR>

<P>laws is a step in the right direction.  One step we support to<BR>

<P>further this simplification is to consolidate Davis-Bacon functions,<BR>

<P>now shared by the Department of Labor (DOL) and GAO, in DOL.  While<BR>

<P>we have not specifically addressed the issue of access to wage<BR>

<P>schedules through on-line electronic systems, we believe it<BR>

<P>represents good business practices. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  In 1993, one bill to repeal the Davis-Bacon<BR>

<P>Act and other bills to amend it and the Copeland Act were introduced<BR>

<P>in Congress.  A 1994 proposal (S.  2328) would have revised and<BR>

<P>simplified these two laws, as well as the Contract Work Hours and<BR>

<P>Safety Standards Act and the Service Contract Act. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A measure to repeal the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (except for<BR>

<P>certain definitional provisions) was included in S.  1587, as passed<BR>

<P>by the Senate in June 1994.  While this measure was not in the final<BR>

<P>version of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the act<BR>

<P>does amend Walsh-Healey to eliminate requirements that contractors<BR>

<P>certify themselves as manufacturers or regular dealers of items<BR>

<P>supplied to the federal government.  Since the Walsh-Healey<BR>

<P>provisions on convict labor have not been repealed, there is no need<BR>

<P>to amend Executive Order 11755.  In February 1994, Davis-Bacon Act<BR>

<P>wage determinations became available on an electronic bulletin board<BR>

<P>operated by the National Technical Information Service.  To improve<BR>

<P>service, DOL (1) proposed making preaward equal employment<BR>

<P>opportunity compliance reviews optional and (2) is developing revised<BR>

<P>labor regulations to require hearings be held on substantial variance<BR>

<P>cases under the Service Contract Act and decisions rendered within 60<BR>

<P>calendar days. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 allows contract negotiation up to the point of award, with<BR>

<P>certain limitations, even though a protest has been filed with the<BR>

<P>GSBCA; clarifies the authority of the GSBCA to review contracting<BR>

<P>officer decisions, but does not change the GSBCA standard of review;<BR>

<P>and authorizes GSBCA to impose appropriate procedural sanctions,<BR>

<P>including dismissal, for a frivolous protest.  The act does not adopt<BR>

<P>language from an earlier House bill that would have explicitly<BR>

<P>authorized the GSBCA to impose on a protestor bringing a frivolous<BR>

<P>protest liability for the government's costs in defending against it. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We are not aware of any efforts to identify costs to the government<BR>

<P>and contractors of responding to protests.  In March 1994, however,<BR>

<P>OFPP issued a report, based on a survey of senior agency procurement<BR>

<P>executives, addressing the effect of protest delay on the<BR>

<P>government's ability to acquire current computer technology.  OFPP's<BR>

<P>survey results suggested that agencies are taking steps to ensure<BR>

<P>that they are not receiving outmoded technology as a result of<BR>

<P>protest delays.  Also, OFPP's survey indicated that, at times,<BR>

<P>agencies may experience a cost impact from continuing to use outmoded<BR>

<P>technology while awaiting resolution of protests.  The Federal Bar<BR>

<P>Association has offered its assistance to OFPP to conduct an analysis<BR>

<P>of economic costs, as well as economic benefits, of the current<BR>

<P>protest process, if OFPP decides this information is needed. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>With respect to identifying causes of protests, GSA officials told us<BR>

<P>that GSA's Office of General Counsel identified the most common bases<BR>

<P>of protests and is preparing multiple products.  DOD officials told<BR>

<P>us they routinely scrutinize available protest statistics; DOD has<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support increasing delegations of procurement<BR>

<P>authority to those agencies that have a good information technology<BR>

<P>acquisition track record.  Given the history of widespread problems<BR>

<P>in government information technology acquisitions, however, we do not<BR>

<P>support increased delegations or relief from planning requirements<BR>

<P>for agencies that do not have proven track records.  Proper<BR>

<P>evaluation of alternatives lessens the risk that agencies will select<BR>

<P>alternatives that do not fully meet user requirements or are<BR>

<P>unnecessarily complex and expensive.  We believe the recommendation<BR>

<P>to &quot;eliminate in-depth requirements for analyses of alternatives&quot; for<BR>

<P>smaller acquisitions is unnecessary because the government's current<BR>

<P>policy states that agencies should vary the depth of their analyses<BR>

<P>based upon the size and complexity of their requirements.  We support<BR>

<P>pilot-testing of alternative methods of acquisition. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  An interagency team to improve the federal<BR>

<P>information technology acquisition process delivered a final report<BR>

<P>to the GSA Administrator in May 1994.  The report contains 42<BR>

<P>comprehensive recommendations for improving and streamlining the<BR>

<P>information technology acquisition process.  GSA drafted amendments<BR>

<P>to the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation to (1)<BR>

<P>increase delegation of authority to agencies to purchase information<BR>

<P>technology and (2) adjust the requirements and alternatives analysis<BR>

<P>thresholds to an $100,000 level.  According to a GSA official, both<BR>

<P>rules could be published in late 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA (1) identified two pilot-test alternatives for commodity<BR>

<P>information technology acquisitions and (2) plans to publish<BR>

<P>information about innovative operational procurement strategies in<BR>

<P>the federal government.  In an ongoing pilot, NASA uses an electronic<BR>

<P>bulletin board to disseminate advance procurement and solicitation<BR>

<P>information and receive vendor offers electronically for acquisitions<BR>

<P>between $25,000 and $500,000.  In the other pilot, DOL plans to award<BR>

<P>personal computer and support service contracts with options for<BR>

<P>vendors to offer upgrades and repricing at 6-month intervals.  To<BR>

<P>reduce information technology acquisition costs, GSA now requires<BR>

<P>software vendors to offer their complete line of software under<BR>

<P>right-to-copy licensing arrangements.  GSA officials estimate that<BR>

<P>buying right-to-copy licensing will result in a minimum of 25 percent<BR>

Title:  GAO, Implementation of NPR Recommendations: PROCUREMENT Part II<BR>

<P>Author: GAO<BR>

<P>Date:   December 5, 1994<BR>

<P>
<P> <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We have reported that, with adequate internal controls, the<BR>

<P>small purchases credit card program can help agencies improve the<BR>

<P>efficiency of their purchasing and payment processes when used for<BR>

<P>purchases of $25,000 or less from both commercial and government<BR>

<P>sources.  The credit card program offers several benefits, such as<BR>

<P>reduced paperwork, prompt receipt of items, improved management<BR>

<P>information and audit capability, and a reduction in the number of<BR>

<P>invoices and inquiries about payments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.9.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The government's commercial purchase card<BR>

<P>program began as a procurement reform initiative under Executive<BR>

<P>Order 12352.  In most cases, the card may be used to pay for all<BR>

<P>commercially available goods and services under the small purchase<BR>

<P>limit.  Since October 1993, an Interagency Purchase Card Council has<BR>

<P>been working to increase use of the card throughout the federal<BR>

<P>government.  As of September 1994, GSA statistics show that over<BR>

<P>82,800 cards have been issued to employees of over 60 federal<BR>

<P>agencies. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>As of September 1994, Treasury authorized the following federal<BR>

<P>supply sources to process purchase card transactions:  GSA,<BR>

<P>Government Printing Office, Federal Prison Industries, and Office of<BR>

<P>Personnel Management.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 simplifies procurement procedures for purchases of $2,500 or<BR>

<P>less, including exemptions from certain statutory provisions. <BR>

<P>Executive Order 12931, dated October 13, 1994, encourages executive<BR>

<P>agencies to take maximum advantage of this micro-purchase authority<BR>

<P>and to expand the use of government purchase cards.  The current<BR>

<P>contract for purchase card services prohibits card use for cash<BR>

<P>advances.  Treasury has deferred proposing regulations that would<BR>

<P>authorize purchase card use for cash advances by imprest fund<BR>

<P>cashiers because the need for such cashiers could be eliminated with<BR>

<P>electronic commerce. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Agree.  We advocate the use of procurement management reviews as an<BR>

<P>important tool in procurement planning, management, and oversight. <BR>

<P>Our work shows that procurement management reviews can provide useful<BR>

<P>information to improve agencies' procurement organizations and<BR>

<P>operations.  These reviews can incorporate principles advocated by<BR>

<P>the NPR for greater effectiveness. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.10.3<BR>

<P>Executive Order 12352 and issued Executive Order 12931, &quot;Federal<BR>

<P>Procurement Reform.&quot; The new order directs heads of executive<BR>

<P>agencies to implement various principles advocated by the NPR,<BR>

<P>including ensuring that their procurement organizations focus on<BR>

<P>measurable results and give increased attention to understanding and<BR>

<P>meeting customer needs. <BR>

<P>procurement ethics laws. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.11.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support the reasoned and equitable application<BR>

<P>of procurement ethics laws.  Ethical conduct in the procurement area<BR>

<P>is governed by several statutes, some of which contain overlapping<BR>

<P>provisions.  Some agencies, such as DOD, are subject to additional<BR>

<P>statutory restrictions or requirements not applicable elsewhere in<BR>

<P>the government.  We have previously reported that agencies had<BR>

<P>difficulty implementing some of these provisions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.11.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining<BR>

<P>Act of 1994 makes very few changes in procurement ethics laws.  The<BR>

<P>conference report accompanying the act states that the conferees<BR>

<P>anticipated &quot;a thorough review and reform of the procurement<BR>

<P>integrity statutes in the next Congress.&quot; In the meantime, the act<BR>

<P>suspends one post-employment, or &quot;revolving door,&quot; law that places<BR>

<P>special restrictions on retired military officers (18 U.S.C.  281)<BR>

<P>through December 31, 1996.  The act repeals another post-employment<BR>

<P>law that restricted military officers (37 U.S.C.  801).  The act<BR>

<P>contains some exemptions.  Government officials authorized to make<BR>

<P>purchases of $2,500 or less, and totalling $20,000 or less annually,<BR>

<P>are not considered &quot;procurement officials&quot; and are exempted from<BR>

<P>certain controls which would otherwise have applied to them.  In<BR>

<P>addition, contractors for commercial item procurements are exempted<BR>

<P>from some procurement integrity certification requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OFPP officials told us that one of their current projects includes<BR>

<P>identifying and encouraging the use of best practices that are needed<BR>

<P>to balance (1) protecting the integrity of the acquisition process<BR>

<P>and (2) allowing communications between government agencies and<BR>

<P>industry that would improve procurements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.12.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  While we have not specifically analyzed<BR>

<P>this issue, we believe that allowing federal, state, and local<BR>

<P>governments to share supply sources may offer opportunities to<BR>

<P>increase the government supplier base and decrease costs of common<BR>

<P>supplies and services at all levels of government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.12.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 amended the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to<BR>

<P>permit use of GSA's federal supply schedules by state or local<BR>

<P>governments, Puerto Rico, or Indian tribal governments.  The entity<BR>

<P>using the federal supply schedule may be required to reimburse GSA<BR>

<P>for any administrative costs of using the schedule.  There is no<BR>

<P>provision in the act to allow federal agencies to enter into<BR>

<P>cooperative agreements to share state and local government supply<BR>

<P>sources. <BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------ Section 30:2.13<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Change laws to make it easier to buy commercial items.  For example,<BR>

<P>revise the definition of commercial item.  Revise governmentwide and<BR>

<P>agency regulations and procedures which preclude the use of<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.13.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Agree.  We strongly support efforts to promote and simplify<BR>

<P>commercial item acquisitions.  We also fully support the use of<BR>

<P>commercial product descriptions, whenever they best satisfy the<BR>

<P>government's legitimate needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.13.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of<BR>

<P>1994 defines &quot;commercial item&quot; and &quot;nondevelopmental item&quot; and<BR>

<P>requires government buyers to conduct market research and give<BR>

<P>preference to commercial items.  The act requires agencies to revise<BR>

<P>procurement policies, practices, and procedures to reduce impediments<BR>

<P>to the acquisition of commercial items. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>For commercial items that are not acquired competitively, the act<BR>

<P>requires the contracting officer to seek information on prices at<BR>

<P>which the same or similar items have been sold in the commercial<BR>

<P>market.  If the information is adequate to evaluate price<BR>

<P>reasonableness, the contracting officer must exempt the procurement<BR>

<P>from cost and pricing data requirements. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition<BR>

<P>Regulations Council agreed on a final rule to amend the Federal<BR>

<P>Acquisition Regulation to clearly reflect the preference for use of<BR>

<P>voluntary standards, commercial item descriptions, and functional or<BR>

<P>performance specifications over design-type specifications.  As a<BR>

<P>result, an interim rule was amended and finalized in March 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum in June 1994 directing<BR>

<P>DOD to use performance and commercial specifications and standards in<BR>

<P>lieu of military specifications and standards, unless no practical<BR>

<P>alternative exists to meet the user's needs.  The Secretary's<BR>

<P>memorandum directed that regulatory language be developed within 60<BR>

<P>days and made effective in 180 days. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA is implementing a Federal Specification Conversion Project with a<BR>

<P>targeted completion date of December 1996.  GSA officials told us<BR>

<P>that of 869 federal specifications prepared by GSA, GSA expects to<BR>

<P>cancel about 24 percent, convert about 34 percent to commercial item<BR>

<P>descriptions, and retain 42 percent that cannot be converted because<BR>

<P>they are too complex or no similar commercial item is available. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.14.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that automated technologies can be used to<BR>

<P>facilitate computer-to-computer exchange of routine information and<BR>

<P>that such a capability could play a key role in greatly improving the<BR>

<P>federal government's business operations and processes, including<BR>

<P>procurement of products and services.  Effective implementation of<BR>

<P>electronic data interchange (EDI) systems would help reduce the<BR>

<P>burdens of the paper-based processes now imposed on business and<BR>

<P>government and could increase small business participation in<BR>

<P>government procurements.  Experience implementing EDI within large<BR>

<P>private sector companies and the Department of Defense shows that<BR>

<P>effective EDI implementation requires (1) business plans that clearly<BR>

<P>define how the technology will benefit the targeted business areas,<BR>

<P>(2) using a standard approach that concentrates on consistent<BR>

<P>electronic business forms for each business area and employs<BR>

<P>nationally accepted industry standards, and (3) a corporatewide<BR>
telecommunications infrastructure to support electronic business<BR>

<P>within the agency and with external trading partners (other agencies,<BR>

<P>vendors, etc.). <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.14.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  An October 26, 1993, presidential memorandum<BR>

<P>requires that the government implement an EC system that includes<BR>

<P>electronic payments and document interchange by July 1995, and<BR>

<P>complete governmentwide implementation, to the maximum extent<BR>

<P>possible, by January 1997.  An interagency Electronic Commerce for<BR>

<P>Acquisition Program Management Office (ECA-PMO) is coordinating,<BR>

<P>monitoring, and reporting on EC implementation throughout the<BR>

<P>government.  In September 1994, OMB tasked agencies to submit their<BR>

<P>long-range EC implementation plans covering fiscal years 1995 through<BR>

<P>1997.  These plans are to focus on small purchases and should include<BR>

<P>milestones and estimated costs for an outreach program, an internal<BR>

<P>training program, automated systems that support EC implementation of<BR>

<P>small purchases, integrating existing electronic small purchase<BR>

<P>systems and bulletin boards into the govenmentwide program, and<BR>

<P>streamlining and reengineering the small purchase process.  OMB began<BR>

<P>reviewing the agencies' implementation plans in October 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 provides for<BR>

<P>implementation of electronic commerce procedures in two phases over a<BR>

<P>5-year period.  Ongoing implementation actions coordinated by the<BR>

<P>ECA-PMO incorporate the EC capability and timeframes required in the<BR>

<P>act.  OFPP officials said (1) FAR revisions are now being drafted to<BR>

<P>implement the act, and (2) these revisions will support full<BR>

<P>implementation of EDI and EC by the federal acquisition community. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.15.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We strongly support the use of best value<BR>

<P>procurement principles in federal procurement.  The government should<BR>

<P>have the means to ensure that it gets the greatest value for the<BR>

<P>dollar.  We also support the proposed improvements.  Best value<BR>

<P>buying requires, however, that evaluation criteria be clear and that<BR>
procurement personnel be properly trained. <BR>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.15.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  OFPP has several projects that focus on<BR>

<P>implementing best value buying and involve formal commitments by<BR>

<P>agencies to employ certain approaches and provide information to<BR>

<P>OFPP.  Experience obtained from these projects is to be used to<BR>

<P>refine the concept of best value and develop governmentwide best<BR>

<P>practices guides.  Existing guidance is found in the Federal<BR>

<P>Acquisition Regulation, OFPP Policy Letters, and agency guidance. <BR>

<P>Federal agencies are offering training on source selection<BR>

<P>techniques.  The Federal Acquisition Institute has developed source<BR>

<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994<BR>

<P>includes provisions authorizing multiyear contracts and contracts for<BR>

<P>agencies to enter into multiyear contracts if (1) sufficient funds<BR>

<P>are available and obligated for the contract, and (2) the agency<BR>

<P>determines that the need for the property or services is reasonably<BR>

<P>firm and continuing over the period of the contract and serves the<BR>

<P>best interests of the Government.  The act defines a multiyear<BR>

<P>contract as a contract not exceeding 5 years.  It also requires a<BR>

<P>notice to Congress for any multiyear contract containing a<BR>

<P>cancellation ceiling in excess of $10,000,000.  The act authorizes<BR>

<P>agencies to enter into contracts for severable services which cross<BR>

<P>clarify procurement issues that impede achievement of its procurement<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.20.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support environmentally sound buying practices.  Our work<BR>

<P>has shown that agencies can improve their efforts in this regard. <BR>

<P>NPR's recommendations have merit. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 30:2.20.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Although legislation to amend RCRA was not<BR>

<P>introduced, Executive Order 12873, dated October 20, 1993,<BR>

<P>accomplishes some of the same environmental procurement reforms that<BR>

<P>NPR wanted and contains some additional requirements as well,<BR>

<P>according to OFPP officials.  In late October 1994, the OFPP<BR>

<P>Administrator tasked the Department of Energy to develop &quot;best<BR>

<P>practice&quot; guides on contracting for the environment.  In the interim,<BR>

<P>an OFPP memorandum encourages agencies' senior procurement executives<BR>

<P>to seek out creative ways to create markets for new energy-efficient<BR>

<P>products. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA provided energy efficiency and other information on<BR>

<P>environmentally beneficial products in government supply catalogs. <BR>

<P>In addition, a GSA and DLA combined effort produced a catalog listing<BR>

<P>a wide variety of lighting products that minimize energy consumption. <BR>

<P>A GSA rule, which OMB was reviewing in November 1994, would require<BR>

<P>multiple award schedule vendors to identify products' environmental<BR>

<P>attributes in their responses to GSA solicitations.  GSA added<BR>

<P>information in its automated supply system about stock items and<BR>

<P>services with environmentally beneficial attributes.  GSA accepts<BR>

<P>participation in programs, such as EPA's Energy Star computer<BR>

<P>program, to support vendor claims that items they manufacture are<BR>

<P>energy efficient. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>GSA has undertaken several initiatives to promote energy audits in<BR>

<P>federal agencies including (1) encouraging agencies to request energy<BR>

<P>audits from utility firms having areawide utility service contracts<BR>

<P>with the federal government and (2) directing each of its 10 regional<BR>

<P>offices to make energy audits available through indefinite quantity<BR>

<P>contracts.  In July 1994, GSA directed each of its regional offices<BR>

<P>to either (1) award new indefinite quantity contracts for retrofit<BR>

<P>services or (2) modify existing indefinite quantity repair and<BR>

<P>alteration contracts to include retrofit services as nonscheduled<BR>

<P>items. <BR>

<P>      DESIGN AS A FORMAL<BR>

<P>      DISCIPLINE<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President's Management Council should commission the development<BR>

<P>of a handbook to help federal managers understand the strengths and<BR>

<P>weaknesses of various forms of program design. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>No action items were published by NPR by September 7, 1994. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that substantial benefits can be gained<BR>

<P>through analysis of diverse program design methodologies as they<BR>

<P>relate to specific program goals or objectives.  We have not studied<BR>

<P>the feasibility of a handbook as cited by NPR, but note that many<BR>

<P>benefits may be derived from program design guidelines and resources<BR>

<P>such as the handbook. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--No Action Taken.  There has been no progress on this<BR>
recommendation. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  As discussed in the comment for DES01, we have not<BR>

<P>studied the feasibility of a handbook as cited by NPR.  However, if a<BR>

<P>handbook is developed, pilot testing it in a few agencies would be an<BR>

<P>effective way to observe and analyze the feasibility of different<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 33:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not assessed specific mechanisms,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 23:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It will take a long-term effort to bring all executive departments<BR>

<P>and agencies to full speed in managing in accordance with quality<BR>

<P>principles.  While many of the recommendations and action items under<BR>

<P>Creating Quality Leadership and Management seem to be under way to<BR>

<P>full implementation, some are on hold pending action from government<BR>

<P>officials.  For example, the Federal Quality Institute is working<BR>

<P>with agencies to provide the training and support needed.  However,<BR>

<P>the White House has not worked with executive departments and<BR>

<P>agencies to create qualification guidance for certain senior<BR>

<P>political appointee positions.  Without coordinated action in the<BR>

<P>executive branch, managing in accordance with quality principles will<BR>

<P>be difficult to implement.  No action has been taken to implement the<BR>

<P>recommendation to improve legislative-executive branch relationships<BR>

<P>by forming a bipartisan, bicameral workgroup. <BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      QUAL01:  PROVIDE IMPROVED<BR>

<P>      LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF<BR>

<P>      THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The President should define a vision for the management of the<BR>

<P>government in the 21st century.  To act on this vision, he should<BR>

<P>direct department and agency heads to designate chief operating<BR>

<P>officers and he should establish a President's Management Council<BR>

<P>(PMC), comprised of the chief operating officers, to oversee the<BR>

<P>implementation of NPR's recommendations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Provide governmentwide leadership, direction, and commitment for<BR>

<P>effective management of the executive branch. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Direct department and agency heads to designate chief operating<BR>

<P>officers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Establish a President's Management Council. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Update and refocus the executive order establishing the<BR>

<P>President's Council on Management Improvement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>5.  Conduct periodic performance reviews to provide ongoing<BR>

<P>improvement and renewal in the executive branch. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>6.  Redefine the Federal Quality Institute as an organization to<BR>

<P>support the President, Vice President, Cabinet, and PMC in the<BR>

<P>implementation of strategic and quality management throughout the<BR>

<P>federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We have emphasized that achieving quality results<BR>

<P>in the federal government must begin with a strategic vision of the<BR>

<P>future.  Further, we have endorsed the roles played by the<BR>

<P>President's Council on Management Improvement and the President's<BR>

<P>Council on Integrity and Efficiency in helping implement management<BR>

<P>reform.  However, it is unclear how the PMC's role differs from those<BR>

<P>of the councils already established. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  According to officials from NPR and the<BR>

<P>Office of Management and Budget (OMB), two of the six action items<BR>

<P>under this recommendation, have been fully implemented, three have<BR>

<P>been partially implemented, and one has not been implemented.  The<BR>

<P>President, the Vice President, OMB, and agency heads have regularly<BR>

<P>expressed support for NPR's implementation and mananaging for<BR>

<P>results, but a presidential memorandum expressing NPR principles has<BR>

<P>not been issued (action 1).  On October 1, 1993, the President issued<BR>

<P>a memo that directed agencies to designate chief operating officers,<BR>

<P>and established a President's Management Council (PMC) (action 2 and<BR>

<P>3).  The executive order establishing the President's Council on<BR>

<P>Management Improvement has not been updated (action 4).  NPR issued<BR>

<P>an update report on the NPR recommendations and has plans for issuing<BR>

<P>a future report on reengineering efforts on September 1995 (action<BR>

<P>5).  The Federal Quality Institute (FQI) has continually supported<BR>

<P>the PMC and cabinet agencies by providing guidance and training, but<BR>

<P>the FQI has not been redefined (action 6). <BR>

<P>      QUAL02:  IMPROVE GOVERNMENT<BR>

<P>      PERFORMANCE THROUGH<BR>

<P>      STRATEGIC AND QUALITY<BR>

<P>      MANAGEMENT<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Encourage all department and agency heads to lead and manage in<BR>

<P>accordance with the criteria in the Presidential Award for Quality. <BR>

<P>To begin this culture change, all executive branch<BR>

<P>employees--starting with the President and Cabinet--should attend<BR>

<P>appropriate educational sessions on strategic and quality management. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  All department and agency heads should lead and manage in<BR>

<P>accordance with the criteria in the Presidential Award for Quality. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  All executive branch employees should attend appropriate<BR>

<P>educational sessions on strategic and quality management, to include<BR>

<P>the criteria for the Presidential Award for Quality. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3.  Each department and agency head should establish a top-level<BR>

<P>&quot;quality council&quot; to lead that organization's culture change. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>4.  Create a category within the Malcolm Baldrige Award for quality<BR>

<P>in the federal government. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We fully support the need for federal managers to<BR>

<P>lead and manage for quality.  A key legislative action prompting a<BR>

<P>greater focus on improving management in the federal government was<BR>

<P>the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.  This act recognized the need<BR>

<P>for performance measures and emphasized that, where feasible,<BR>

<P>organizational and individual performance be appraised in terms of<BR>

<P>timeliness, quality, and efficiency.  More broadly, the Government<BR>

<P>Performance and Results Act of 1993 emphasizes strategic planning as<BR>

<P>one of the critical elements for instilling a results-oriented<BR>

<P>management focus throughout the federal government.  We believe,<BR>

<P>however, that establishing this focus will also require that federal<BR>

<P>managers have available to them the tools and incentives necessary<BR>

<P>for achieving results. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>We support the use of the Presidential Award for Quality criteria to<BR>

<P>assess program performance.  However, this should be revised, as<BR>

<P>necessary, to ensure it recognizes other criteria that exist on<BR>

<P>quality management, and lessons learned from using these criteria. <BR>

<P>Finally, we have found that training is one of the critical elements<BR>

<P>in perpetuating cultural change. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  According to an NPR official, 3 federal<BR>

<P>agencies have reported that they have established procedures<BR>

<P>comparable to the Presidential Award for Quality, and 13 departments<BR>

<P>and agencies have established a top level quality council.  According<BR>

<P>to an FQI official, they have completed their training materials and<BR>

<P>are currently marketing their services to federal agencies.  However,<BR>

<P>all executive branch employees have not attended such training.  The<BR>

<P>inclusion of a category for federal organizations in the Malcolm<BR>

<P>Baldrige Award is currently under discussion, but has not been<BR>

<P>finalized. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 23:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that political appointees should be<BR>

<P>appointees.  Moreover, we have emphasized the need to establish<BR>

<P>strong financial management leadership at both OMB and the agencies,<BR>

<P>and support the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act requirement that<BR>

<P>OMB develop qualification standards for agency CFOs and their<BR>

<P>
<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 36:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Significant progress has been made during the past year to implement<BR>

<P>a number of the NPR regulatory recommendations using executive and<BR>

<P>agency action.  Several of the recommendations were implemented or<BR>

<P>facilitated by the issuance of Executive Order 12866, &quot;Regulatory<BR>

<P>Planning and Review,&quot; and several associated presidential memoranda<BR>

<P>on September 30, 1993.  Federal regulatory agencies and the Office of<BR>

<P>Management and Budget (OMB) responded to the specific requirements of<BR>

<P>the executive order and the memoranda by, for example, participating<BR>

<P>in an interagency regulatory working group, developing plans to<BR>

<P>streamline their rulemaking processes, and focusing on ways to<BR>

<P>enhance public awareness and participation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Gauging implementation of some of the NPR regulatory recommendations<BR>

<P>is difficult due to the broad scope of the recommendations and/or the<BR>

<P>lack of objective standards or baselines for measurement.  For<BR>

<P>example, we were not able to determine whether public awareness and<BR>

<P>participation in the rulemaking process has been enhanced (REG04)<BR>

<P>because no baseline information exists on the pre-NPR level of public<BR>

<P>awareness or participation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>It is unclear whether one of the recommendations will be implemented,<BR>

<P>and whether some recommendation action items prompted implementation<BR>

<P>efforts in certain areas.  One recommendation--that agencies formally<BR>

<P>establish a technical drafting service for Congress (REG09)--is not<BR>

<P>being implemented because agencies believe the current process of<BR>

<P>providing informal drafting services is sufficient.  Implementation<BR>

<P>of some recommendation action items (e.g., the increased used of<BR>

<P>electronic information technology in the rulemaking process) may be<BR>

<P>the result of the normal process of using new tools when practical,<BR>

<P>and would likely have occurred even if there had been no<BR>

<P>recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>Create an interagency Regulatory Coordinating Group (RCG) to share<BR>

<P>information and coordinate approaches to regulatory issues. <BR>

<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEM<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>Create an interagency Regulatory Coordinating Group to share<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the creation of an<BR>

<P>interagency RCG.  While we have done no work on the need for such a<BR>

<P>group, the RCG's purpose of sharing information and coordinating<BR>

<P>regulatory approaches could help reduce regulatory overlap.  Having<BR>

<P>representatives from each federal regulatory agency with significant<BR>

<P>domestic regulatory responsibility, presidential and<BR>

<P>vice-presidential advisors on regulatory policy, and the<BR>

<P>Vice-President as members underscores the importance attached to this<BR>

<P>group's mission.  The RCG's role as a forum for agencies to discuss<BR>

<P>common regulatory concerns could encourage coordination among the<BR>

<P>agencies within a more ordered and comprehensive environment. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Fully Implemented.  Executive Order 12866 on &quot;Regulatory Planning and<BR>

<P>Review,&quot; issued September 30, 1993, established the Regulatory<BR>

<P>Working Group (RWG).  According to the executive order, the RWG is to<BR>

<P>serve as a forum to assist agencies in identifying and analyzing<BR>

<P>important regulatory issues.  The RWG created four subgroups for<BR>

<P>specific regulatory issues:  (1) regulatory streamlining, (2) risk<BR>

<P>assessment, (3) benefit cost analysis, and (4) electronic information<BR>

<P>technology and rulemaking. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree on the need for more innovation<BR>

<P>in regulatory approaches.  For example, states have used innovative<BR>

<P>measures related to long-term care in an effort to provide services<BR>

<P>within the constraints of regulatory burdens.  Lessons learned from<BR>

<P>states and other countries may help the government change from<BR>

<P>process-oriented regulations to performance goals and outcomes, with<BR>

<P>more state and local latitude for determining how best to serve<BR>

<P>people requiring long-term care.  A deskbook on regulatory design<BR>

<P>could draw from the experiences of all regulatory agencies at the<BR>

<P>federal and state levels and promote best practices. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Executive Order 12866 established the use of<BR>

<P>innovative regulatory approaches as administration policy.  A<BR>

<P>&quot;deskbook on regulatory design&quot; has not been developed, but some<BR>

<P>efforts are under way to address this part of the recommendation. <BR>

<P>The RWG's subgroup on regulatory streamlining collected agency<BR>

<P>guidebooks on regulatory issues.  No decision has been made on how<BR>

<P>the information collected from these guidebooks will be used to<BR>

<P>develop the deskbook. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree that a consensus-based approach<BR>

<P>to drafting regulations can provide a useful alternative to the<BR>

<P>traditional rulemaking process.  It appears reasonable to require the<BR>

<P>regulatory agencies, that have not used negotiated rulemaking since<BR>

<P>the enactment of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, to identify<BR>

<P>at least one rulemaking to draft using this process, or explain why<BR>

<P>using the process isn't feasible.  The NPR accompanying report<BR>

<P>recognizes that negotiated rulemaking is not appropriate for all<BR>

<P>rules, and agencies are advised to consider advantages and<BR>

<P>disadvantages before they embark on a negotiated regulatory effort. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Substantive efforts were made to implement<BR>

<P>the recommendation, and consensus-based methods were being used in<BR>

<P>some agencies to develop regulations.  However, we were not able to<BR>

<P>determine whether there was a general increase in the use of<BR>

<P>negotiated rulemaking. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12866 (September 30, 1993) directed<BR>

<P>each federal regulatory agency to consider the use of consensual<BR>

<P>mechanisms, including negotiated rulemaking, when developing<BR>

<P>regulations.  The presidential memorandum on &quot;Negotiated Rulemaking&quot;<BR>

<P>(September 30, 1993) directed each federal regulatory agency to<BR>

<P>identify to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs<BR>

<P>(OIRA), within 90 days of Executive Order 12866, at least one<BR>

<P>rulemaking in which it will use negotiated rulemaking in the upcoming<BR>

<P>year, or to explain why it wouldn't be feasible to use this process. <BR>

<P>Seventeen federal regulatory agencies responded to this directive,<BR>

<P>and 16 identified specific rulemakings that will use, or be<BR>

<P>considered for, a negotiated rulemaking.  Early in calendar year<BR>

<P>1994, the Department of Labor (DOL) combined information technology<BR>

<P>and consensus-based methods by using electronic bulletin boards to<BR>

<P>support the negotiated rulemaking it identified to OIRA. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree with the recommendation's<BR>

<P>objectives of enhancing public awareness and participation during the<BR>

<P>rulemaking process.  The recommended actions to increase public<BR>

<P>participation in the rulemaking process, enhance public awareness and<BR>

<P>evaluation of programs, and increase the use of information<BR>

<P>technology in rule development, hold great potential for improving<BR>

<P>the quality and equity of regulations.  However, these activities may<BR>

<P>conflict with the goal of another NPR recommendation to streamline<BR>

<P>agencies' rulemaking procedures (REG05).  Therefore, efforts to make<BR>

<P>the rulemaking process more inclusive and responsive must be<BR>

<P>carefully coordinated with actions taken to streamline agencies'<BR>

<P>rulemaking procedures. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Several federal regulatory agencies took<BR>

<P>actions to increase and enhance public participation in the<BR>

<P>rulemaking process and to increase the use of information technology. <BR>

<P>However, we are not able to determine if public participation in the<BR>

<P>rulemaking process did, in fact, increase or become enhanced by these<BR>

<P>actions. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12866 (September 30, 1993) directed<BR>

<P>each agency to provide the public with meaningful participation in<BR>

<P>the regulatory process.  According to OMB, OIRA's review of proposed<BR>

<P>rules indicates that the federal regulatory agencies are more<BR>

<P>sensitive to increasing and enhancing public participation since this<BR>

<P>executive order was issued.  For example, OMB said the Department of<BR>

<P>Education has made an effort to enhance and increase public<BR>

<P>participation in its rulemaking.  According to OMB, the Department<BR>

<P>(1) sent out to 400 affected parties and interest groups the draft of<BR>

<P>a significant regulation; (2) published the draft rule in various<BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards; (3) sponsored several public conferences<BR>

<P>to give the affected parties and interest groups an opportunity to<BR>

<P>discuss the draft rule after allowing for a period of review; (4)<BR>

<P>developed its proposed rule for publication in the Federal Register;<BR>

<P>and (5) published a version of the proposed rule, showing deleted,<BR>

<P>edited and final wording, on the electronic bulletin boards. <BR>

<P>According to OIRA, the issue of increased and early consultation with<BR>

<P>affected government entities during the development of regulations<BR>

<P>was discussed in several meetings with state, local, and tribal<BR>

<P>governments. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>A RWG subgroup is exploring the use of information technology in the<BR>

<P>regulatory process.  The mission of the subgroup is to expand access<BR>

<P>to the federal regulatory process at all stages using advanced<BR>

<P>technology and to enhance public participation in the rulemaking<BR>

<P>process.  Several agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture's<BR>

<P>Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Nuclear Regulatory<BR>

<P>Commission, are accepting comments on proposed rules through<BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards.  The Department of Labor (DOL) used<BR>

<P>electronic bulletin boards to support a negotiated regulatory process<BR>

<P>developing rules to protect workers building steel structures. <BR>

<P>appropriate for each type.  However, these streamlining activities<BR>

<P>may conflict with the goal of another NPR recommendation to enhance<BR>

<P>public awareness and increase public participation in the rulemaking<BR>

<P>process (REG04).  Another concern is whether the decision process to<BR>

<P>determine what are significant and insignificant rules will be<BR>

<P>reasonable and applied consistently in all situations, within and<BR>

<P>among agencies. <BR>

<P>

<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Some federal regulatory agencies, such as<BR>

<P>DOL, the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Environmental<BR>

<P>Protection Agency (EPA), have streamlined their rulemaking process,<BR>

<P>and some agencies are using direct final rulemaking.  According to<BR>

<P>the President's &quot;Memorandum on Agency Rulemaking&quot; (September 30,<BR>

<P>1993), one of the main objectives of Executive Order 12866 (September<BR>

<P>30, 1993) is to streamline the rulemaking process to reduce delay in<BR>

<P>developing and promulgating rules.  The memorandum required federal<BR>

<P>regulatory agencies to examine their internal review procedures in<BR>

<P>their rulemaking process to determine areas for streamlining.  The<BR>

<P>agencies were required to report the results of their examination to<BR>

<P>the President and the Vice President by March 31, 1994 and 14<BR>

<P>agencies responded to the requirement.  As a result of their<BR>

<P>examination, DOL developed a new rulemaking process and implemented<BR>

<P>it in January 1994.  DOT also used the examination to identify areas<BR>

<P>in its rulemaking process to streamline, and described streamlining<BR>

<P>changes made to rulemaking classifications and delegations of<BR>

<P>authority in their report.  EPA officially instituted a new<BR>

<P>rulemaking process in June 1994 designed to streamline the agency's<BR>

<P>regulatory development process, as called for in its report. <BR>

<P>According to an official in the RWG, EPA regularly uses direct final<BR>

<P>rulemaking in its regulatory process.  DOT noted in its regulatory<BR>

<P>streamlining report that it used direct final rulemaking in some<BR>

<P>limited instances and planned to expand its use.  We could not find<BR>

<P>evidence of activity addressing the third and fourth action items of<BR>

<P>this recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree that an increase in the use of<BR>

<P>alternative means of dispute resolution (ADR) might reduce<BR>

<P>litigation, improve negotiated resolutions, and facilitate<BR>

<P>implementation of regulations.  We have not, however, examined ADR<BR>

<P>use in all the federal regulatory agencies.  Presidential support for<BR>

<P>the ADR process alone probably does not assure an increase in its<BR>

<P>usage, but if federal regulatory agencies determine that this process<BR>

<P>could save them time and funds, they will be inclined to use it more<BR>

<P>frequently. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.6.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  On May 16, 1994, 24 federal agencies signed a<BR>

<P>pledge to use ADR techniques rather than litigation to resolve or<BR>

<P>avoid contract disputes.  Six of the 24 agencies signed specific<BR>

<P>pledges to use ADR in a total of 60 contracts, valued at a total of<BR>

<P>$1.4 billion.  OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) was<BR>

<P>the coordinating agency for the pledge effort.  Subsequently, the<BR>

<P>Internal Revenue Service joined this ADR pledge effort with a<BR>

<P>contract valued at $1.3 billion.  The Administrative Conference of<BR>

<P>the United States plans to form a project team with OFPP to assist<BR>

<P>agencies in using ADR.  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also<BR>

<P>took steps to encourage ADR usage.  It sponsored a conference on ADR,<BR>

<P>issued an ADR Resource Guide, and developed two ADR training courses. <BR>

<P>While ADR was used in some federal agencies prior to NPR, some new<BR>

<P>efforts are under way.  For example, after a pilot test use of ADR in<BR>

<P>DOL's Philadelphia Region had positive results, DOL is planning to<BR>

<P>expand ADR usage throughout the agency. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.7.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We generally agree that regulatory agencies should<BR>

<P>assess the extent of risks facing the public in determining their<BR>

<P>regulatory agendas and anticipate future problems.  For example, we<BR>

<P>recommended that the EPA Administrator work with Congress to identify<BR>

<P>opportunities to shift resources from problems of less severe risk to<BR>

<P>problems with greater risks.  We also recommended that Congress<BR>

<P>consider incorporating the concept of relative risks to human health<BR>

<P>and environment in authorizing and appropriating funds for EPA. <BR>

<P>However, we are aware that the Office of Technology Assessment and<BR>

<P>the National Academy of Science's National Research Council issued<BR>

<P>reports in 1993 that discuss problems they have identified in the<BR>

<P>current risk assessment process. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.7.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  EPA published risk rankings for environmental<BR>

<P>problems in its 1987 report Unfinished Business:  A Comparative<BR>

<P>Assessment of Environmental Problems and its Science Advisory Board<BR>

<P>reviewed them in 1990.  DOT's Research and Special Programs<BR>

<P>Administration implemented a Risk Assessment Prioritization (RAP)<BR>

<P>process to rank Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) actions according to<BR>

<P>their potential to reduce the risk of pipeline failures.  OPS is<BR>

<P>categorizing and prioritizing the risks identified by the RAP process<BR>

<P>to develop a risk ranking.  While these actions substantially address<BR>

<P>part of this recommendation, they do not cover all the federal<BR>

<P>regulatory agencies that have regulations incorporating<BR>

<P>environmental, health, or safety risks. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Executive Order 12881 (November 23, 1993) established the National<BR>

<P>Science and Technology Council (NSTC).  The NSTC Subcommittee on Risk<BR>

<P>Assessment reviews ongoing federal risk assessment research to<BR>

<P>develop options for its enhancement. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The RWG is charged with exploring the methods, efficacy, and utility<BR>

<P>of comparative risk assessment.  The RWG created a subgroup on risk<BR>

<P>assessment to examine issues and develop policy with respect to the<BR>

<P>use of risk analysis in the federal regulatory decisionmaking<BR>

<P>process.  EPA has a Futures Studies Unit whose mission is to develop,<BR>

<P>support, and promote an anticipatory, systemic approach to<BR>

<P>environmental policymaking. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.9.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Although we have not examined the extent to which<BR>

<P>Congress needs technical drafting services from agencies, we believe<BR>

<P>that such services may be useful to Congress in certain circumstances<BR>

<P>and that agencies should provide such services to Congress upon<BR>

<P>request.  It is not clear, however, that a formal system of technical<BR>

<P>drafting services would work better than the current informal system<BR>

<P>providing such services. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.9.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--No Action Taken.  We did not find evidence of<BR>

<P>federal regulatory agency action to formally establish technical<BR>

<P>drafting services for congressional committees and subcommittees. <BR>

<P>However, OMB said that agencies already provide technical drafting<BR>

<P>services, on an informal basis, to congressional committees and<BR>

<P>subcommittees.  An official at EPA stated that the agency frequently<BR>

<P>provides technical drafting services to Congress and has done so for<BR>

<P>many years.  According to this official, these drafting activities<BR>

<P>are informally done and are not centrally planned within the agency<BR>

<P>as suggested by the recommendation.  DOT stated that DOT officials,<BR>

<P>including DOT's General Counsel and Assistant Secretary for<BR>

<P>Intergovernmental Affairs, recently discussed becoming more<BR>

<P>responsive to Congress' need for technical drafting services and<BR>

<P>encouraging better internal coordination within the department when<BR>

<P>providing these services.  There was no plan to install a formalized<BR>

<P>system or process to implement these objectives.  The Department of<BR>

<P>Defense (DOD) provides technical drafting services on an informal<BR>

<P>basis to Congress when requested by a committee or subcommittee.  DOD<BR>

<P>is not planning to formalize this arrangement. <BR>

<P>---------------------------------------------------- Section 36:2.10.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Insufficient Information.  We agree that training is an important<BR>

<P>presidential appointees assigned to regulatory agencies.  However, we<BR>

<P>cannot comment on this recommendation until we have more information<BR>

<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  No evidence exists that any of the<BR>

<P>specific action items were implemented, but there was some activity<BR>

<P>by OMB and the RWG that could facilitate implementation.  The<BR>

<P>President has not directed political appointees to attend a<BR>

<P>comprehensive training program on regulatory development, or that a<BR>

<P>training program be established which would provide this training. <BR>

<P>However, the RWG asked the Administrative Conference of the United<BR>

<P>States (ACUS) to propose a design for such a training program and<BR>

<P>ACUS agreed to develop this proposal.  We understand that no<BR>

<P>legislation was proposed to move the Legal Education Institute back<BR>

<P>to Washington, D.C.  from Columbia, South Carolina.  This year, the<BR>

<P>Administrator of OMB's OIRA instituted a program to rotate staff<BR>

<P>between OIRA and other federal agencies.  An OMB official told us<BR>

<P>that while this is not officially an honors rotation program, the<BR>

<P>candidates selected for the OIRA program are accomplished,<BR>

<P>high-quality employees.  We found no evidence that heads of federal<BR>

<P>regulatory agencies developed policies that recognize and reward<BR>

<P>achievements in innovative, consensus-based, and effective<BR>

<P>regulation. <BR>

<P>   OVERALL SUMMARY<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 31:1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Four of the 11 NPR recommendations in this section have been<BR>

<P>partially implemented, and actions have been taken or are under way<BR>

<P>on the other 7 recommendations.  Also, NPR's one overall<BR>

<P>recommendation in the General Services Administration (GSA) section<BR>

<P>of this report, which has been acted upon but not implemented,<BR>

<P>relates directly to several NPR recommendations in this support<BR>

<P>services section; especially SUP03, SUP04, SUP08, SUP09, and SUP10. <BR>

<P>In addition, NPR's recommendations in the Reengineering through<BR>

<P>Information Technology, Reinventing Federal Procurement, and<BR>

<P>Improving Financial Management sections relate to this section. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The four support services recommendations that have been partially<BR>

<P>implemented are (1) SUP04--streamline and improve contracting<BR>

<P>strategies for the Multiple Award Schedule Program; (2) SUP05--expand<BR>

<P>agency authority and eliminate congressional control over federal<BR>

<P>fleet vehicle management; (3) SUP06--give agencies authority and<BR>

<P>incentive for personal property management and disposal; and (4)<BR>

<P>SUP08--give customers choice and create real property enterprises<BR>

<P>that promote sound real property asset management.  On SUP04, one of<BR>

<P>seven action items have been completed, and efforts have been made or<BR>

<P>are under way to address the other six items.  On SUP05, two of the<BR>

<P>four action items have been completed, another action item has been<BR>

<P>addressed, and one action item has not been addressed.  On SUP06, one<BR>

<P>of three action items has been completed, another action item has<BR>

<P>been addressed, and one action item has not been addressed.  SUP08<BR>

<P>has been partially implemented in several respects, but 3 of the 11<BR>

<P>action items have not been addressed.  GSA has actions under way to<BR>

<P>address most of NPR's action items on the other seven<BR>

<P>recommendations.  However several of these under way action items<BR>

<P>require legislation or special emphasis by the Office of Management<BR>

<P>and Budget, and little, if any, progress has been made in several of<BR>

<P>these areas. <BR>

<P>   RECOMMENDATION INFORMATION<BR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>      SUP01:  AUTHORIZE THE<BR>

<P>      EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO<BR>

<P>      ESTABLISH A PRINTING POLICY<BR>

<P>      THAT WILL ELIMINATE THE<BR>

<P>      CURRENT PRINTING MONOPOLY<BR>

<P>------------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Give the executive branch authority to make its own printing policy<BR>

<P>that will eliminate the mandatory printing source.  Develop a new<BR>

<P>executive branch printing policy for the 21st century. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         ACTION ITEMS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.1.1<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>1.  Give the executive branch the authority to make its own printing<BR>

<P>policy that will eliminate the mandatary printing source. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2.  Develop an executive branch printing policy for the 21st century. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.1.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that the Government Printing Office's<BR>

<P>(GPO) monopoly-like status contributes to inefficiencies and<BR>

<P>ineffectiveness and that GPO's mandatory source status for executive<BR>

<P>branch agencies should be eliminated.  We also agree that a new<BR>

<P>executive branch printing policy will be needed, but we have no basis<BR>

<P>to say who, within the executive branch, should be responsible for<BR>

<P>developing such a policy or what specific provisions should be<BR>

<P>included to ensure agencies have sufficient flexibility in meeting<BR>

<P>their printing needs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.1.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Because existing legislation<BR>

<P>requires, with some exceptions, that agencies go through GPO to<BR>

<P>procure printing services, this legislation would have to be changed<BR>

<P>to alter GPO's role and implement this recommendation.  The<BR>

<P>administration proposed legislative language (H.R.  3400) to<BR>

<P>accomplish this change, but the bill was not enacted.  However,<BR>

<P>Congress included language in the fiscal year 1995 Legislative<BR>

<P>Appropriations Act that actually expanded GPO's role by amending the<BR>

<P>definition of printing to include duplication.  Subsequently, the<BR>

<P>administration generally agreed to accept the amended printing and<BR>

<P>duplicating policy for fiscal year 1995 and to work with Congress to<BR>

<P>develop legislation to change the printing policy. <BR>

<P>
<P>1.  Give the executive branch responsibility for the distribution of<BR>

<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.2.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree with this recommendation's intent to<BR>

<P>assure public access to federal information.  However, we have no<BR>

<P>basis to comment on how or who in the executive branch should<BR>

<P>implement it or bear the associated costs. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.2.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Under existing legislation, GPO is<BR>

<P>responsible for disseminating copies of new and revised government<BR>

<P>publications designated for distribution to libraries that are<BR>

<P>required to receive all or some of these materials.  Thus,<BR>

<P>legislation transferring this role to the executive branch is<BR>

<P>required before this recommendation can be implemented.  The<BR>

<P>administration proposed legislative language in (H.R.  3400) to<BR>

<P>implement this recommendation, but this bill was not enacted.  The<BR>

<P>version that passed the House on November 22, 1993, did not authorize<BR>

<P>the executive branch to disseminate publications.  The executive and<BR>

<P>congressional branches agreed in September 1994 to work together over<BR>

<P>the next fiscal year to resolve differences and draft needed<BR>

<P>legislation.  An interagency effort is under way to establish an<BR>

<P>automated system that the public can use to access federal<BR>

<P>information.  A standard for how this should be accomplished and an<BR>

<P>OMB Bulletin spelling out the responsibilities of federal agencies<BR>

<P>have been developed; the OMB Bulletin is with agencies for review and<BR>

<P>comment.  No efforts have been made to implement the one-stop<BR>

<P>shopping part of the recommendation. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.3.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We agree that the federal distribution systems need to be<BR>

<P>improved.  Federal agencies should be allowed to choose the most<BR>

<P>cost-effective supply sources.  This means that centralized federal<BR>

<P>supply entities like GSA and Federal Prison Industries, which now<BR>

<P>have mandatory source status, will have to compete directly with the<BR>

<P>private sector and others for federal agencies' business.  Equipment<BR>

<P>and supply inventories in federally owned depots can and should be<BR>

<P>reduced under current operating procedures, and opportunities for<BR>

<P>reductions could increase if their mandatory source status is<BR>

<P>removed.  While we support improving supply operations, existing<BR>

<P>barriers and obstacles likely would inhibit federal supply agencies'<BR>

<P>ability to compete because the playing field would not be level. <BR>

<P>These impediments need to be identified, examined, and resolved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.3.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Not Implemented--Action Taken.  Although not implemented, GSA,<BR>

<P>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DOD), and<BR>

<P>FPI have taken actions and have efforts under way to respond to this<BR>

<P>recommendation.  GSA (1) has drafted regulations to eliminate its<BR>

<P>mandatory supply source requirements and already begun converting its<BR>

<P>new Multiple Awards Schedules to nonmandatory use; (2) has outside<BR>

<P>experts trying to identify ways of improving the distribution<BR>

<P>system's cost-effectiveness; (3) has increased its use of commercial<BR>

<P>product descriptions and is trying to increase the availability of<BR>

<P>automated ordering and billing; and (4) is using reinvention labs and<BR>

<P>two collaborative efforts with other agencies and private sector<BR>

<P>organizations to test other logistic models.  DOD is considering a<BR>

<P>change in its regulations that would allow components greater<BR>

<P>flexibility to use sources other than the central supply system and<BR>

<P>has developed a plan to increase the use of electronic commerce. <BR>

<P>DOD's Defense Logistics Agency is comparing DOD and commercial<BR>

<P>distribution costs.  VA plans to close its depots and has<BR>

<P>commercialized most item descriptions.  The executive branch drafted<BR>

<P>legislation to end the FPI's mandatory source status and force it to<BR>

<P>compete commercially for federal agencies' business.  However, the<BR>

<P>Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons objected to this change,<BR>

<P>and this proposed legislation has not been introduced in Congress. <BR>

<P>FPI is adding an electronic commerce capability to its operations. <BR>

<P>Finally, the House passed a bill authorizing parallel contracting,<BR>

<P>(H.R.  2238) but this provision was removed from the legislation that<BR>

<P>was eventually enacted (P.L.  103-355). <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.4.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We support efforts to improve the Multiple Award<BR>

<P>Schedule Program, including streamlining the solicitation, selection,<BR>

<P>and related requirements under the schedules.  We have supported<BR>

<P>proposals to revise the dollar threshold for announcement<BR>

<P>requirements, but have not supported elimination of those<BR>

<P>requirements.  Our work to date has not addressed eliminating the use<BR>

<P>of mandatory supply schedules. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.4.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  This recommendation has been partially<BR>

<P>implemented because one of the seven action items--raise the maximum<BR>

<P>order limitations for information technology acquisitions--has been<BR>

<P>completed.  Beginning in January 1994, the GSA increased the maximum<BR>

<P>dollar amount for MAS information technology acquisitions from<BR>

<P>$300,000 to $500,000.  According to a responsible GSA official,<BR>

<P>however, this change will not result in any significant improvements<BR>

<P>because the order limit was not really a problem.  Rather, he stated<BR>

<P>that the problem is the time-consuming nature of the existing<BR>

<P>requirement to advertise any purchases over $50,000.  GSA has taken<BR>

<P>or is taking actions to address the other six action items under this<BR>

<P>recommendation, but these action items are still open.  GSA (1) has<BR>

<P>drafted or proposed regulatory changes to remove mandatory source<BR>

<P>requirements and reduce cases requiring advertising and has already<BR>

<P>begun converting its new schedules to nonmandatory use; (2) is<BR>

<P>testing a new computer solicitation, revising MAS order instructions,<BR>

<P>trying to automate its MAS schedule for information technology<BR>

<P>systems, and working with a private sector association to identify<BR>

<P>the best design for an electronic bulletin board; (3) has two<BR>

<P>reinvention efforts under way looking for innovative and<BR>

<P>cost-effective MAS procurement strategies that will remove or<BR>

<P>simplify some agency and vendor paperwork requirements and decrease<BR>

<P>delivery time; and (4) has revised its solicitation for computer<BR>

<P>software to require that vendors allow the government to copy<BR>

<P>software that is purchased, which GSA estimates could save 25 percent<BR>

<P>over the previous arrangement.  GSA planned to reduce the<BR>

<P>administrative burden for MAS purchases under $10,000, but the<BR>

<P>Department of Defense (DOD) disagreed with the idea because it<BR>

<P>removed MAS from Federal Acquisition Regulation coverage.  GSA agreed<BR>

<P>to defer this change until all agency comments were received and<BR>

<P>considered. <BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.5.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  Our ongoing work in this area indicates that this<BR>

<P>NPR recommendation has merit.  This recommendation was originally<BR>

<P>proposed by the President's Management Improvement Council in 1992<BR>

<P>and has been accepted by GSA, the Office of Management and Budget,<BR>

<P>and other agencies with motor vehicle fleets.  However, actions<BR>

<P>should not be restricted to these operational matters.  State<BR>

<P>governments and private firms have made additional strategic<BR>

<P>improvements to their fleets through benchmarking and improved<BR>

<P>information systems that might also be applicable to the federal<BR>

<P>vehicle fleet. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.5.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  Two of the four action items--update vehicle<BR>

<P>replacement standards and increase emergency repair limits--have been<BR>

<P>implemented.  The General Services Administration (GSA) revised the<BR>

<P>Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) to (1) allow vehicle<BR>

<P>replacement on a 3-year instead of a 6-year basis and (2) increase<BR>

<P>emergency repair limits to $150.  Completing the other two action<BR>

<P>items will require legislative changes; the administration has<BR>

<P>proposed one change, but taken no action on the other one.  The<BR>

<P>administration proposed eliminating appropriation language<BR>

<P>limitations on the purchase price of new government vehicles in the<BR>

<P>Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act<BR>

<P>of 1995, but both the Senate and House removed this language.  The<BR>

<P>administration has not proposed legislation to provide incentives to<BR>

<P>agencies that dispose of their vehicles.  However, GSA has solicited<BR>

<P>and is considering agencies' comments on another FPMR change that<BR>

<P>would allow agencies to dispose of personal property, including<BR>

<P>vehicles. <BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.6.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Generally Agree.  We agree that property management and disposal<BR>

<P>policies and practices need improvement and that federal efforts to<BR>

<P>identify, manage, and dispose of unneeded or underutilized property<BR>

<P>have been largely ineffective.  Most federal agencies have no<BR>

<P>incentive to give up such property because they generally get nothing<BR>

<P>for it.  Thus, financial incentives could result in improvements. <BR>

<P>However, most federal agencies do not know the market value of their<BR>

<P>property and pay no penalty for using it inefficiently. <BR>

<P>adapted the Multi-Use File for Interagency News (MUFFIN) so that<BR>

<P>federal agencies can use it to screen available excess personal<BR>

<P>property.  In October 1994, GSA changed the FPMR to allow agencies to<BR>

<P>dispose of their personal property.  GSA has not drafted or proposed<BR>

<P>legislation to provide incentives to agencies to dispose of excess<BR>

<P>personal property. <BR>

<P>these actions have not been completed.  GSA has arranged to work with<BR>

<P>the Joint Financial Management Improvement Project to improve federal<BR>

<P>travel regulations.  GSA said it had also changed its criteria for<BR>

<P>awarding airline ticket contracts to provide more emphasis on<BR>

<P>customer service and less on cost which should give travelers more<BR>

<P>desirable options (e.g., nonstop flights at convenient times) while<BR>

<P>still getting a good value for the government.  GSA has plans to<BR>

<P>begin experimenting, in December 1994 in seven domestic markets, with<BR>

<P>letting airlines set and adjust government ticket rates in lieu of<BR>

<P>the traditional contractually established rates.  Under this pilot<BR>

<P>test, agencies plan to scan the rates offered and select the rate<BR>

<P>         GAO COMMENTS<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.8.2<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Agree.  We support the overall thrust of this recommendation.  It<BR>

<P>echoes our long-standing concerns about GSA's monopoly and<BR>

<P>conflicting roles and the unbusinesslike way the federal government's<BR>

<P>vast, valuable real estate assets are acquired and managed.  While we<BR>

<P>support the concepts of ending GSA's office space monopoly and<BR>

<P>creating a new real property asset management enterprise to oversee<BR>

<P>the federal real estate portfolio and help maximize its return on<BR>

<P>investment, barriers inhibiting effective asset management and GSA's<BR>

<P>ability to compete will need to be reexamined and resolved. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>         IMPLEMENTATION<BR>

<P>----------------------------------------------------- Section 31:2.8.3<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Partially Implemented.  This recommendation has been partially<BR>

<P>implemented in several respects.  GSA has a new public buildings<BR>

<P>information system that contains information on available GSA and<BR>

<P>commercial space in the marketplace.  Equipment and software needed<BR>

<P>to make the system operational have been delivered to all<BR>

<P>headquarters and most field users.  GSA is completing system<BR>

<P>installation and training staff to use the system.  Also, GSA is<BR>

<P>reorganizing its existing real estate activities now provided by the<BR>

<P>Public Buildings Service and Federal Property Resources Service.  GSA<BR>

<P>has designated account officers for some agencies who will provide<BR>

<P>agencies a single contact point.  GSA has developed a conceptual<BR>

<P>framework for a new organizational structure to perform its public<BR>

<P>buildings activities.  This framework encompasses general components<BR>

<P>that are responsive to the concepts outlined in NPR's report and<BR>

<P>includes a governmentwide real property policy office, an enterprise<BR>

<P>for managing real property assets, and centers of expertise.  The<BR>

<P>details of how these entities will operate and interact is still<BR>

<P>being developed.  GSA's Denver Regional Office is conducting a 1-year<BR>

<P>pilot test that involves delegating acquisition authority for leases<BR>

<P>of 3,000 square feet or less to interested federal agencies, but no<BR>

<P>agency has requested a delegation of authority.  To date, no actions<BR>

<P>have been initiated to commercialize the Federal Buildings Fund,<BR>

<P>promote competition between existing real property providers, or<BR>

<P>change the congressional prospectus authorization process. <BR>

<P>space and these costs are projected to increase to $3 billion<BR>

<P>annually by 2002 unless the ratio of federally owned to leased space<BR>

<H2>Acquisition Reform: Purchase Card Use Cuts Procurement Costs, Improves Efficiency </H2>

<img alt="pdf" src="/gifs/pdficon.gif"><A HREF="/library/gao/ns96138.pdf">GAO/NSIAD-96-138 Aug. 6 (18 pages).</A> <P>


The National Performance Review recommended in 1993 that agencies increase their use of government commercial credit cards--called purchase cards--for
small purchases to cut the red tape normally associated with federal procurement. Since then, legislation has eliminated some requirements for purchases of
&#036;2,500 or less, called micropurchases. Agencies have found that they can carry out their missions at lower cost by having staff use the purchase cards for
simple purchases. Further, agency studies have shown that card use reduces labor and payment-processing costs. In fact, a 1994 interagency study showed
that costs had often been cut by more than half; other studies have identified millions in potential savings from card use. Since the cards first became available
governmentwide, their use has skyrocketed. Even so, significant room for growth exists: the average purchase card transaction was &#036;375 in fiscal year 1995,
well below the micropurchase threshold. Despite the growth in purchase card use, GAO found no evidence of increased abuses. In fact, the electronic data
stored on all purchase card transactions permits close monitoring of card use. Officials at most agencies GAO reviewed believe that the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, which governs federal procurement, should more clearly address card use. Also, although agencies want to learn from one another's experiences,
no mechanism exists for them to communicate with one another and to share their improvements.

Management Reform: Completion Status of Agency Actions Under the National<BR>
Performance Review (Letter Report, 06/12/96, GAO/GGD-96-94).<BR>

<P>Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the completion status<BR>
of 380 National Performance Review (NPR) recommendations that NPR<BR>
claimed were completed as of September 7, 1995.<BR>

<P>GAO found that: (1) as of September 1995, NPR classified 380, or 32<BR>
percent of the 1,203 action items, as completed; (2) as of January 1996,<BR>
294, or 77 percent of the 380 action items, had been verified as<BR>
completed; (3) of the 86 action items that could not be verified as<BR>
completed, 66 items were either partially implemented or some action had<BR>
been taken; (4) there was no sufficient information available to make a<BR>
determination on 20 action items; (5) the 27 action items classified as<BR>
other were properly implemented as required, but implementation had not<BR>
been completed; and (5) of the 1,203 action items needed to implement<BR>
NPR recommendations, 24 percent have been completed.<BR>

<P>     As we near the first anniversary of Vice President Gore's <BR>

<P>Creating A Government That Works Better &amp; Costs Less: A Report of <BR>

<P>the National Performance Review, the debate over governmental <BR>

<P>reform has moved from the arena of rhetoric to that of <BR>

<P>Executive Summary<BR>

<P>***************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review (NPR), <BR>

<P>with a report issued in September 1993, promised nothing less than <BR>

<P>a revolutionary reinvention of the federal government.  Critics <BR>

<P>dismissed it as hollow rhetoric, and some scholars criticized it <BR>

<P>as dangerous.  In its first year, however, the NPR has produced <BR>

<P>impressive results: a genuine start on changing the culture of <BR>

<P>government; simplification of some rules and procedures, <BR>

<P>especially by eliminating the onerous Federal Personnel Manual and <BR>

<P>the much-hated SF-171 job application form; a reform of the <BR>

<P>procurement process; improved top-level coordination of the <BR>

<P>government's management; and the stimulation of widespread <BR>

<P>innovation by federal managers through &quot;reinvention labs.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR produced more than almost anyone, including perhaps <BR>

<P>the reinventers themselves, believed possible.  Even when the <BR>

<P>movement produced sketchy results, the problems it attacked <BR>

<P>usually were the right ones.  However, to get the NPR moving, the <BR>

<P>reinventers made short-term tactical decisions to get quick wins.  <BR>

<P>The quick wins, though, have come at the cost of building the <BR>

<P>foundation for lasting success.  As a result, the NPR is not now <BR>

<P>self-sustaining.  It has shown great potential, but the risk is <BR>

<P>that the NPR will become just a short-term political tactic <BR>

<P>instead of a lasting reform.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>***************************************************************<BR>

<P>     Two problems, in particular, have plagued the NPR.<BR>

<P>***************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     1. A preoccupation with savings over performance improvement.  <BR>

<P>Of course, a government that works better can cost less, as the <BR>

<P>NPR report's subtitle suggests.  Streamlining procurement can save <BR>

<P>money, while a more customer-focused government can tailor <BR>

<P>programs more carefully to citizens' needs.  In practice, however, <BR>

<P>seeking big savings in short order can undermine the broader <BR>

<P>effort for management improvement and increase costs in the long <BR>

<P>run.  The largest single chunk of the NPR's promised $108 billion <BR>

<P>savings was to come from downsizing the federal work force ($40.4 <BR>

<P>billion).  The downsizing was to be the product of the NPR's <BR>

<P>management improvements.  The Clinton administration's eagerness <BR>

<P>for quick savings, however, led officials to shrink employment <BR>

<P>first and let the management improvements follow.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     On one level, the focus on budget savings quickly alienated <BR>

<P>many government workers.  The NPR had built a strong pro-<BR>

<P>bureaucrat case.  It told public employees that the government's <BR>

<P>performance problems were the fault of the system, not of its <BR>

<P>workers.  It also held out the promise of much greater flexibility <BR>

<P>for managers (&quot;empowerment&quot;) and a reduction in red tape.  The <BR>

<P>prospect of reducing federal employment by 272,900 workers, <BR>

<P>however, quickly preoccupied many managers and soon became the <BR>

<P>defining reality of the NPR for many government workers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     On another level, the savings proved far easier to promise <BR>

<P>than to deliver.  The administration has had recurring disputes <BR>

<P>with members of Congress and the Congressional Budget Office about <BR>

<P>the savings from individual proposals.  These disputes diminished <BR>

<P>congressional support for the NPR and delayed pieces of the <BR>

<P>legislative program, especially the bill that provided buyout <BR>

<P>payments to employees who agreed to leave the federal service.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Moreover, the savings proved the hardest element of the NPR <BR>

<P>to judge.  Some long-term savings required short-term investments, <BR>

<P>like the buyouts.  Some short-term savings risked increasing long-<BR>

<P>term costs, especially if downsizing in the absence of a <BR>

<P>&quot;reinvented&quot; workplace led the wrong employees to leave or <BR>

<P>weakened government management.  Putting hard numbers on the NPR's <BR>

<P>savings, other than counting federal workers who left the <BR>

<P>government, required extraordinary feats of budgetary analysis.  <BR>

<P>That complexity not only increased the difficulty of assessing the <BR>

<P>NPR's savings but also sometimes surrounded the NPR with debate of <BR>

<P>such technical detail as to undermine their political value.  In <BR>

<P>the meantime, the downsizing led many bureaucrats not to enlist in <BR>

<P>the NPR's revolution, but to hope that it would soon go away.  And <BR>

<P>since the public assumes that the NPR has long since produced the <BR>

<P>promised savings, the reinventers face the task of living up to <BR>

<P>the pledge as the task of achieving it   without undermining the <BR>

<P>rest of the movement   becomes ever greater.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     2. The lack of an explicit strategy for dealing with <BR>

<P>Congress.  NPR officials initially believed that they could <BR>

<P>accomplish most of their reforms without seeking congressional <BR>

<P>approval.  The lesson of the first year, however, is that <BR>

<P>virtually no reform that really matters can be achieved without at <BR>

<P>least implicit congressional support.  The NPR has not yet <BR>

<P>developed a full strategy for winning that support.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Congress embraced the broad downsizing initiative and, in <BR>

<P>fact, increased the reduction from 252,000 to 272,900 employees.  <BR>

<P>For months, however, members stalled the buyout bill required to <BR>

<P>produce the savings, in part because of uncertainty about whether <BR>

<P>it would cost or save money in the short run.  The House, <BR>

<P>meanwhile, voted to exempt the Veterans' Health Administration, <BR>

<P>with 212,000 employees, from the downsizing, so as not to threaten <BR>

<P>veterans' health care.  The Senate then voted to exempt federal <BR>

<P>criminal justice activities, so as not to jeopardize the war on <BR>

<P>crime.  Many members of Congress supported the NPR in the whole, <BR>

<P>but then tugged at its individual threads in ways that threatened <BR>

<P>to unravel it. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     At the beginning, the NPR had concentrated on launching its <BR>

<P>report.  It had not developed a strategy for implementing its <BR>

<P>recommendations beyond trying to enlist legions of bureaucrats <BR>

<P>throughout the agencies in the cause and hoping that the power of <BR>

<P>the ideas would defuse opposition.  Members of Congress had <BR>

<P>everything to gain from embracing the broad principles of <BR>

<P>reinvention and then protecting their constituents and favorite <BR>

<P>programs behind the scenes in committee rooms and little-noticed <BR>

<P>riders to complex bills.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     For the NPR to endure, it will need to build congressional <BR>

<P>support.  That will require striking a different kind of bargain <BR>

<P>between the executive and Congress.  The NPR's recommendations <BR>

<P>need congressional support; Congress needs a strategy for <BR>

<P>meaningful oversight.  Although this requires an uneasy balance, <BR>

<P>both the president and Congress have a strong interest in shaping <BR>

<P>it.  The stakes for the executive branch, both political and <BR>

<P>managerial, are clear.  Moreover, especially in Congress's <BR>

<P>Governmental Affairs and Government Operations Committees, there <BR>

<P>is fresh interest in defining a new congressional role in <BR>

<P>management.  Without finding a new kind of bargain between the <BR>

<P>branches, it would be easy for the congressional micro-politics of <BR>

<P>the NPR to nibble away its key elements.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In sum: The NPR, in its first year, accomplished far more <BR>

<P>than cynics suggested might be possible.  It has launched a broad <BR>

<P>reform movement in the right direction, and it has been asking the <BR>

<P>right questions.  Nevertheless, and this is the NPR's critical <BR>

<P>problem, the short-term accommodations it made to get the movement <BR>

<P>going weakened its chances for long-term success.  It is not now a <BR>

<P>self-sustaining revolution, and considerable work needs to be done <BR>

<P>to move the invasion from a beachhead to a breakout, and then from <BR>

<P>a breakout to a conquest.  Launching the reinvention revolution <BR>

<P>was the easy part.  Sustaining the revolution will require much <BR>

<P>harder, and far less glamorous work.  It will require considerable <BR>

<P>creativity, far more than either the reinventers or their critics <BR>

<P>have demonstrated, in recognizing and solving the four critical <BR>

<P>underlying problems that lie beyond the beachhead.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     First, tensions: There really is no such thing as the NPR.  <BR>

<P>It has, in fact, been a three-front campaign: to shrink the size <BR>

<P>and cost of the government; to spread a new gospel of reinvention <BR>

<P>in areas like procurement reform and customer service; and to <BR>

<P>encourage an army of reinventers throughout the federal <BR>

<P>government.  However, NPR's outside game, based on shrinking the <BR>

<P>government, undercut its efforts to transform the government's <BR>

<P>inner workers because it alienated many public employees.  Long-<BR>

<P>term success requires the NPR to ensure that, on each of its <BR>

<P>fronts, its strategies complement and do not disrupt each other.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Second, capacity: The NPR report argued the need to bulldoze <BR>

<P>away overbearing forces of supervision, authority, and oversight.  <BR>

<P>The report, however, was far weaker on what ought to spring up in <BR>

<P>their place.  The overwhelming lesson of the last generation of <BR>

<P>policy experimentation in the United States is that government <BR>

<P>programs do not manage themselves.  Rather, success depends on <BR>

<P>finding the institutions, processes, money, technology, and <BR>

<P>especially people   that is, the capacity   to do the job.  Will a <BR>

<P>reinvented government transform itself into a leaner government, <BR>

<P>faster on its feet and better able to adapt to the dizzying pace <BR>

<P>of change?  Or will the legacy of reinvention be an even more <BR>

<P>hollow government with far less capacity to do its job, a <BR>

<P>government managed by employees with even less incentive to do <BR>

<P>their jobs well?  The former would produce a truly revolutionary <BR>

<P>change.  The latter would worsen the cycle of raised expectations, <BR>

<P>disappointing results, increased inefficiency, and greater public <BR>

<P>cynicism.  Long-term success requires the NPR not only to explain <BR>

<P>what it wants to sweep away but, more important, to define what <BR>

<P>ought to spring up in the place of dysfunctional systems.  <BR>

<P>Strengthening government capacity will require more than adherence <BR>

<P>to the broad themes of employee empowerment and customer service.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Third, ideas: The NPR built on ambitious ideas about cutting <BR>

<P>red tape, putting customers first, empowering employees, and <BR>

<P>cutting back to basics.  Far less clear, however, was what the <BR>

<P>concepts actually meant.  Where do procedural due process and <BR>

<P>proper administrative safeguards become red tape?  Who are the <BR>

<P>government's customers and how can they be served?  Does customer <BR>

<P>service contradict other public goals?  What would it take to <BR>

<P>empower employees, and what risks would empowerment create?  Who <BR>

<P>decides what the basics are?  In their best-selling book <BR>

<P>Reinventing Government, a driving spirit of the NPR, David Osborne <BR>

<P>and Ted Gaebler make the case that government should &quot;steer, not <BR>

<P>row.&quot;  But in what direction should government steer, and how good <BR>

<P>are the ideas that serve as its compass?  The lessons from <BR>

<P>reinventions abroad and private sector reform in the United States <BR>

<P>is that a clear sense of purpose and sharp guiding principles are <BR>

<P>critical to success.  Long-term success requires the NPR to <BR>

<P>define, far more sharply, its purpose and guiding principles, if <BR>

<P>it is to escape the quicksand of fuzzy rhetoric.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Finally, glue: The NPR builds on a philosophy of  <BR>

<P>&quot;empowering&quot; government workers to make better decisions.  It <BR>

<P>argues for a more &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; philosophy, with a competition <BR>

<P>prescription replacing monopoly-based command-and-control <BR>

<P>management.  In short, the NPR seeks to shift power from Congress <BR>

<P>to the bureaucracy and, within the bureaucracy, from top to bottom <BR>

<P>levels.  If empowered bureaucrats behave entrepreneurially, what <BR>

<P>glue will prevent government from disintegrating into a vast <BR>

<P>network of quasi-independent operators?  What processes will <BR>

<P>ensure democratic accountability to elected officials?  What <BR>

<P>processes will ensure that the public interest dominates private <BR>

<P>behavior?  Long-term success requires the NPR to build a force at <BR>

<P>the center of government, perhaps in the Office of Management and <BR>

<P>Budget, to focus government on results and avoid having the reform <BR>

<P>spin off into scores of different, unconnected directions.  It <BR>

<P>also requires the NPR to focus sharply on striking a new kind of <BR>

<P>bargain with Congress over government management.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Even more fundamentally, achieving the NPR's promise will <BR>

<P>require more clearly linking the question of what government ought <BR>

<P>to do with how government ought to do it.  The NPR, in the <BR>

<P>report's own words, &quot;focused primarily on how government should <BR>

<P>work, not on what it should do.&quot;  The burden of a century of <BR>

<P>public management research, however, is that the distinction is <BR>

<P>artificial: the how powerfully shapes the what because means <BR>

<P>embody ends; from the beginning, the how has to be driven by the <BR>

<P>what.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     To a greater degree than even political noncombatants stop to <BR>

<P>recognize, and certainly far more than government officials ever <BR>

<P>acknowledge, many public performance problems are the product of <BR>

<P>what government sets out to do.  Government in fact does many <BR>

<P>things very well, from delivering social security checks to <BR>

<P>providing weather satellite maps.  Often, when things work badly, <BR>

<P>it is because government tries to do things that are very hard or <BR>

<P>impossible, like preventing drug abuse, training unemployed <BR>

<P>workers, cleaning up toxic waste, or providing welfare without <BR>

<P>creating dependence.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Improving performance on one level requires focusing <BR>

<P>government most clearly on the things it does well and figuring <BR>

<P>out how to do them better.  However, we (and this includes the <BR>

<P>NPR, policymakers, and Americans in general) have not thought <BR>

<P>clearly about what those things are.  On another level, if we seek <BR>

<P>to do things that are hard to do well, we must be frank about the <BR>

<P>degree of difficulty and focus sharply on how to do the impossible <BR>

<P>better.  Many of the most basic questions to which the NPR has <BR>

<P>addressed itself revolve around such issues.  If we choose to <BR>

<P>attack these problems at a superficial level, by focusing on the <BR>

<P>number of bureaucrats that can be eliminated or the dollars that <BR>

<P>can be saved, we will both miss the real issues and even further <BR>

<P>undercut government's ability to perform well.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     The National Performance Review accomplished, in just its <BR>

<P>first year, far more than anyone thought possible.  It energized <BR>

<P>employees, it attracted citizens, it drew media attention to <BR>

<P>government management, and it made the point that management <BR>

<P>matters.  In the blush of success, however, the NPR failed to <BR>

<P>build the foundation for success in the long haul.  It borrowed <BR>

<P>bits and pieces of management reform from both the public and <BR>

<P>private sectors and pasted them together in a patchwork that, <BR>

<P>while initially attractive, could not hold together.  In the <BR>

<P>process, the NPR missed the most important lesson that other <BR>

<P>successful reforms teach: in the long run, management, matched to <BR>

<P>mission, matters most.  The movement launched in September 1993, <BR>

<P>however promising, was not self-sustaining.  Making it stick <BR>

<P>requires hard work on tough questions   work that, for the most <BR>

<P>part, has not begun.<BR>

<P>Introduction<BR>

<P>***************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     When Vice President Al Gore released his National Performance <BR>

<P>Review (NPR) report in September 1993, some cynics dismissed it as <BR>

<P>just another hollow piece of rhetoric.  Academic critics attacked <BR>

<P>it as dangerous to the public interest.  They were wrong.  In its <BR>

<P>first year, the NPR has proven one of the most lively management <BR>

<P>reforms in American history.  It has helped reorient the federal <BR>

<P>bureaucracy toward a far more effective attack on problems that it <BR>

<P>must learn to solve.  Public support has been overwhelming. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Indeed, a careful review of the NPR's first year shows <BR>

<P>impressive results that disprove the cynics:1 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> A quick start on culture change.  The report's theme that <BR>

<P>government had to work better and cost less resonated profoundly.  <BR>

<P>Measuring the precise impact of the report on the culture of <BR>

<P>government agencies is impossible, and making such an ambitious <BR>

<P>change stick will take a generation.  But one conclusion is <BR>

<P>already certain: After the report, neither the behavior of <BR>

<P>government workers nor the debate about their jobs can ever be the <BR>

<P>same.  The NPR's four key principles   cutting red tape, putting <BR>

<P>customers first, empowering employees to get results, and cutting <BR>

<P>back to basics   provided new, if rough, guideposts by which to <BR>

<P>steer and judge the federal bureaucracy.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Simplification of rules and processes.  The NPR has also helped <BR>

<P>disentangle some of the rules and procedures that hinder effective <BR>

<P>federal management.  In particular, the Office of Management and <BR>

<P>Budget (OMB) has issued waivers to make it easier for agency <BR>

<P>officials trying to survey citizen satisfaction with public <BR>

<P>services.2   The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) eliminated <BR>

<P>the huge Federal Personnel Manual and the government's monstrous <BR>

<P>all-in-one application form, SF-171, in delegating personnel <BR>

<P>decisions to government agencies.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> A reform of the procurement process.  The Clinton <BR>

<P>administration's enthusiastic support and hard work dovetailed <BR>

<P>with ongoing congressional effort on procurement reform.  The <BR>

<P>result is an important simplification of the procurement process   <BR>

<P>the first major reform of the government's contracting rules and <BR>

<P>procedures in a decade.3 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Improved coordination of the government's management activities.  <BR>

<P>The NPR recommended designating a &quot;chief operating officer&quot; within <BR>

<P>each cabinet department to oversee management and to promote <BR>

<P>culture change.  In addition, the NPR suggested that the chief <BR>

<P>operating officers comprise, together with a handful of other top <BR>

<P>officials, a &quot;President's Management Council&quot; (PMC) &quot;to lead the <BR>

<P>quality revolution and ensure the implementation&quot; of the NPR.4   <BR>

<P>In just a few months, the PMC has proven not only a valuable <BR>

<P>weapon in the Clinton administration's efforts to marshall support <BR>

<P>in the agencies for the NPR.  It has also proven an important <BR>

<P>mechanism for focusing government-wide attention on key management <BR>

<P>issues and for organizing political support for major legislative <BR>

<P>issues.  The coordinated efforts of PMC members contributed <BR>

<P>greatly to the passage of the first piece of the NPR legislative <BR>

<P>program.5   The PMC also provided a secluded forum in which top <BR>

<P>officials could compare approaches   a &quot;counsel council,&quot; in the <BR>

<P>words of Alice Rivlin, who chaired the PMC as OMB deputy director <BR>

<P>before being named the office's director.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P> Widespread innovation by federal managers.  The NPR encouraged <BR>

<P>agency heads to establish &quot;reinvention labs,&quot; and more than one <BR>

<P>hundred sprang up throughout the government.6   While there is no <BR>

<P>systematic survey of what these labs have accomplished, mounting <BR>

<P>evidence suggests that these reinvention labs represent exciting <BR>

<P>innovations in the federal government.  Not all of the labs are <BR>

<P>likely to produce successes; the whole point of experimentation is <BR>

<P>to find what works and what does not.  But the labs are generating <BR>

<P>a mountain of fresh ideas and information about how government <BR>

<P>workers can do their jobs better.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Vice President Gore has recognized &quot;heroes of reinvention&quot; <BR>

<P>around the government who had helped slash government red tape.  <BR>

<P>One hero, the Department of the Interior's Roger Patterson, cut <BR>

<P>the process of approving fish ladders over dams from two and a <BR>

<P>half years to six months, and from thirteen steps to just eight.  <BR>

<P>The old process, Patterson said, &quot;wasted a lot of time.  It wasted <BR>

<P>a lot of money, and it wasted a lot of fish.&quot;  Rodney Martin, a <BR>

<P>Small Business Administration employee in Texas, introduced a <BR>

<P>simple loan application for small business operators that replaced <BR>

<P>a far larger form.  Meanwhile, General Services Administration <BR>

<P>(GSA) officials replaced long approval forms, which cost $50 each <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Two central problems lie at the core of the NPR.  First, the <BR>

<P>NPR is moving far in advance of the ideas driving it.  The central <BR>

<P>themes (cutting red tape, putting customers first, empowering <BR>

<P>employees, and cutting back to basics) are more a call to arms <BR>

<P>than a battle plan.  Second, especially because the NPR builds on <BR>
putting far more power in the hands of bureaucrats, the weakness <BR>

<P>of the battle plan carries grave risks.  If empowerment drives the <BR>

<P>NPR, and empowerment means delegating far greater discretion to <BR>

<P>bureaucrats, what will direct the exercise of that discretion?  <BR>

<P>What will ensure that bureaucrats use their discretion to promote <BR>

<P>the public interest instead of simply their own, perhaps <BR>

<P>idiosyncratic views of what ought to be done?  Indeed, an <BR>

<P>important implication of the economic theory of bureaucracy, on <BR>

<P>which much of the reinvention movement is based, is that <BR>

<P>unsupervised bureaucrats will simply pursue their self interest, <BR>

<P>which in turn will create an ever-growing and ever less efficient <BR>

<P>government.1   What glue will unify governmental policy and <BR>

<P>prevent it from spinning off centrifugally into thousands of <BR>

<P>directions?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The ultimate success of the NPR depends on solving three <BR>

<P>important problems: defining a new approach to the public <BR>

<P>interest, to replace the old version which no longer fits <BR>

<P>administrative practice or America's political life; sharpening <BR>

<P>the notion of customer service, to serve as a proximate compass <BR>

<P>for bureaucratic action; and developing a mature approach to <BR>

<P>performance measurement, to provide long-term guidance to American <BR>

<P>public management.<BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>The New Puzzle of the Public Interest <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The experiments with government reform in the United States <BR>

<P>over the last decade teach three important lessons.  First, there <BR>

<P>is no government service that could not be delivered by <BR>

<P>nongovernmental organizations.  From libraries to police, prisons <BR>

<P>to social services, fire protection to sophisticated planning, <BR>

<P>private and nonprofit agents have eagerly stepped in as <BR>

<P>governments have tried to shrink.  Although the results of the <BR>

<P>American version of privatization have varied widely, the <BR>

<P>overriding lesson is that there is no function left that only the <BR>

<P>public sector can deliver.2   However we choose to define what <BR>

<P>government alone ought to do, we cannot do it by function.3   The <BR>

<P>lesson: Because the private sector can do anything, we are less <BR>

<P>sure about what government ought to do.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Second, the thrust of government reform has been to impose <BR>

<P>market-style incentives on public managers.  It is the <BR>

<P>&quot;entrepreneurial spirit&quot; that drives Reinventing Government, and <BR>

<P>for the NPR the keystone of creating a government that works <BR>

<P>better and costs less is &quot;using market incentives to solve <BR>

<P>problems.&quot;4   Reformers have argued that competition, rewards, and <BR>

<P>sanctions will prove far superior to authority-based, monopolistic <BR>

<P>governmental agencies.  In brief, they suggest that many private-<BR>

<P>sector based mechanisms could usefully replace public-sector <BR>

<P>oriented mechanisms.  The lesson: The debate over incentives has <BR>

<P>made us less sure about how government employees ought to do their <BR>

<P>jobs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Finally, the increasing contracting out of government <BR>

<P>services over the last two decades has increased the mutual <BR>

<P>dependence of both parties: government on private and nonprofit <BR>

<P>organizations to deliver services; private and nonprofit <BR>

<P>organizations on government revenues to sustain their business.  <BR>

<P>In addition, the rules and procedures accompanying the sharing of <BR>

<P>government's power has created a complex fabric of organizational <BR>

<P>linkages.  The lesson: The harder reformers have tried to separate <BR>

<P>the public and private sectors, the more blurred the boundaries <BR>

<P>between them have become.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     What these three lessons have created is a fundamental <BR>

<P>challenge to defining and achieving the public interest.  A <BR>

<P>generation ago, the precepts of traditional public administration <BR>

<P>made clear what public managers ought to do and how.  It was the <BR>

<P>job of public managers to administer the law by the best of their <BR>

<P>technical ability.  Indeed, in 1950, Leonard D. White could write <BR>

<P>in the leading textbook of the day:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The need, incessant and urgent, is for the administrative <BR>

<P>     mind that can hold fast to the public interest and bind <BR>

<P>     conflicting special interests to it by skillful contrivance, <BR>

<P>     based on knowledge but exceeding mere expertise.  In the <BR>

<P>     highest reaches, the administrative art touches the <BR>

<P>     political, but it grows out of different soil.5 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In the years that followed, however, the notion that the public <BR>

<P>interest ought to guide administrative action slowly evaporated as <BR>

<P>the difficulty of defining it grew.  Students of the process <BR>

<P>worried about the growing complexity of political influences on <BR>

<P>managers, which created multiple back channels of influence on <BR>

<P>administrative behavior, and the increasing interconnections among <BR>

<P>government programs, which made it hard to determine who was <BR>

<P>responsible for anything.6   They worried about growing <BR>

<P>professionalization of the public service, which risked making <BR>

<P>managers more accountable to narrow professional norms than to the <BR>

<P>broader goals of the law.7   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The &quot;public interest&quot; consequently disappeared from most <BR>

<P>debate about public management: in part because it became so hard <BR>

<P>to define; in part because some critics wondered if the new <BR>

<P>entrepreneurial spirit might not be superior to the old notions <BR>

<P>that drove it.  Resurrecting the concept along with the old <BR>

<P>definitions clearly will not help debate over the NPR.  The <BR>

<P>classical approach does not fit an administrative world of high <BR>

<P>technology and instantaneous communication, interdependent <BR>

<P>organizations (public as  well as private and nonprofit), and <BR>

<P>institutionalized political tension between the executive and the <BR>

<P>legisla<BR>

<P>
<P>     On the other hand, allowing a careful consideration of the <BR>

<P>public interest to slip from public discourse risks substituting <BR>

<P>one set of problems   steering &quot;empowered&quot; bureaucrats   for <BR>

<P>another   bureaucrats with little incentive for high performance.  <BR>

<P>As Don Hunn, head of New Zealand's Public Service Commission, <BR>

<P>explains, &quot;We spent so much time trying to `let the managers <BR>

<P>manage' that we forgot that government owned these institutions <BR>

<P>and that there is a set of common, core values.&quot;  New Zealand, <BR>

<P>leading the movement for public sector management reform, <BR>

<P>therefore found itself seeking a new definition of the &quot;collective <BR>

<P>interest&quot; as a counterpoint to administrative autonomy.9   Indeed, <BR>

<P>the New Zealand experience helps chart the mines lying ahead in <BR>

<P>the NPR's eager push for reinventing government.  Sweeping away <BR>

<P>the old notions of accountability will not work unless something <BR>

<P>new and equally powerful rises up to replace it.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The success of the NPR depends on establishing and promoting <BR>

<P>a new definition of the public interest:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     based on a full understanding of how enhanced employee <BR>

<P>     discretion helps government tackle its new challenges better <BR>

<P>     than the old procedure and rule-based approaches;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     based on a sophisticated approach to interorganizational <BR>

<P>     networks of public, private, and nonprofit organizations, <BR>
     instead of the old approach founded on an assumption that a <BR>

<P>     single agency was in charge of each program;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     based on outputs instead of inputs, on results instead of <BR>

<P>     activity;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     based on a fully developed comprehension of what customer <BR>

<P>     service and performance measurement really mean; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     in particular, based on a fresh but sound approach to <BR>

<P>     ensuring accountability of government workers for the jobs <BR>

<P>     they do: promoting high performance and low cost while <BR>

<P>     remaining responsible to elected officials.<BR>

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Customer Service <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If empowering employees is the &quot;how&quot; of the NPR, customer <BR>

<P>service is the &quot;why.&quot;  The reinventers worked from a set of <BR>

<P>beliefs that drove them away from traditional top-down management: <BR>

<P>that traditional approaches made bureaucrats unresponsive, self-<BR>

<P>absorbed, and inefficient.  British Prime Minister John Major's <BR>

<P>1991 &quot;Citizens Charter&quot; white paper, as well as other movements <BR>

<P>abroad, heavily flavored the NPR.  The reinventers also borrowed <BR>

<P>from the American private sector reform movement.  As Michael <BR>
Hammer and James Champy put it in their best-seller, Reengineering <BR>

<P>the Corporation:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The reality that organizations have to confront . . . is that <BR>

<P>     the old ways of doing business   the division of labor around <BR>

<P>     which companies have been organized since Adam Smith first <BR>

<P>     articulated the principle   simply don't work anymore.  <BR>

<P>     Suddenly, the world is a different place.10 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Hammer and Champy argue that dealing with this new world begins <BR>

<P>with customers, who increasingly know what they want, have choices <BR>

<P>about how to get it, and do not hesitate to reward companies that <BR>

<P>deliver with their business.  Successful companies are those that <BR>

<P>build from the top down to serve customers from the bottom up.11 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The idea of customer service enraged traditionalists, as we <BR>

<P>saw in the last section.  In part, the customer-based approach <BR>

<P>smacked of importing business management into government, and <BR>

<P>public management specialists have long held up Wallace Sayre's <BR>

<P>axiom that business and government are alike in all unimportant <BR>

<P>respects.12   In part, they argued that accountability in a <BR>

<P>democratic republic works from the voters through elected <BR>

<P>officials to bureaucrats, not directly between citizens-as-<BR>

<P>customers and government managers.  They also quarreled with the <BR>

<P>drumbeat of customer service rhetoric.<BR>

<P>
<P>     In fact, there are three important conclusions about the <BR>

<P>customer service idea.  First, the critics are right.  Government <BR>

<P>is indeed different from the private sector, and any public sector <BR>

<P>reform has to begin from that point.  Second, there is <BR>

<P>nevertheless genuine value in the customer service approach.  <BR>

<P>Bureaucrats at every level, throughout every bureaucracy (public <BR>

<P>or private) have great discretion in how they do their jobs.  How, <BR>

<P>on the margin, should they use that discretion?  The customer <BR>

<P>service notion has great power in answering that question: use the <BR>

<P>discretion to satisfy citizens rather than serve the purposes of <BR>

<P>government agencies and employees.  Third, the notion nevertheless <BR>

<P>has proven a weak compass for the NPR.  The concept is poorly <BR>

<P>developed, and over-enthusiastic rhetoric has often substituted <BR>

<P>for clear thinking.  If there is something to customer service, <BR>

<P>that something needs far more careful development.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR's enthusiasm for customer service builds on the self-<BR>

<P>evident observation that citizens are truly unhappy with the <BR>

<P>performance of their government, and that citizens view government <BR>

<P>as too often pursuing its own internal goals instead of solving <BR>

<P>the problems of citizens.  &quot;Quite simply,&quot; the NPR report <BR>

<P>concludes, &quot;the quality of government service is below what its <BR>

<P>customers deserve.&quot;  To solve that problem, the NPR pledged to <BR>

<P>provide &quot;customer services equal to the best in business.&quot;13   The <BR>

<P>Social Security Administration, for example, promised that callers <BR>

<P>to its toll-free service would reach a person on the first call.  <BR>

<P>The Postal Service pledged to deliver first-class mail anywhere in <BR>

<P>the United States within three days and counter service within <BR>

<P>five minutes.14   On September 11, 1993, President Clinton backed <BR>

<P>that pledge by issuing Executive Order 12862, which mandated <BR>

<P>agencies to define customer service standards.  All executive <BR>

<P>departments and agencies providing &quot;significant services directly <BR>

<P>to the public&quot; were required to:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     (a) identify the customers who are, or should be served by <BR>

<P>         the agency;<BR>

<P>     (b) survey customers to determine the kind and quality of <BR>

<P>         services they want and their level of satisfaction with <BR>

<P>         existing service;<BR>

<P>     (c) post service standards and measure results against them;<BR>

<P>     (d) benchmark customer service performance against the best <BR>

<P>         in business;<BR>

<P>     (e) survey front-line employees on the barriers to, and ideas <BR>

<P>         for, matching the best in business;<BR>

<P>     (f) provide customers with choices in both the sources of <BR>

<P>         service and the means of delivery;<BR>

<P>     (g) make information, services, and complaint systems easily <BR>

<P>         accessible; and<BR>

<P>     (h) provide means to address customer complaints.<BR>

<P>
<P>     It would be hard for even the most cynical critic to object <BR>

<P>to serving citizens in this way.  As employed by the NPR, <BR>

<P>&quot;customer service&quot; essentially requires that government be <BR>

<P>responsive to citizens' needs and wants.  The presumption is that <BR>

<P>too often government becomes inward-directed, toward the myriad <BR>

<P>rules, procedures, and forms that preoccupy public managers.  <BR>

<P>Forcing these managers to focus outward on citizens, for whom <BR>

<P>public programs were originally created, is intended as an <BR>

<P>antidote.  Such an approach is consistent with traditional <BR>

<P>theories of accountability.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The executive order does not call for the exercise of <BR>

<P>discretion beyond the boundaries of existing law.  Rather, it <BR>

<P>calls for government employees to use the inevitable discretion <BR>

<P>embodied in congressional delegation of authority to ensure that <BR>

<P>government services are responsive to citizens.  As Improving <BR>

<P>Customer Service, a report accompanying the NPR, concluded, <BR>

<P>customer service &quot;is probably the simplest way to tell the federal <BR>

<P>work force what kind of service to deliver.&quot;15 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Indeed, some of the most spectacular early successes of the <BR>

<P>NPR came from reinvention labs that dramatically improved customer <BR>

<P>service.  In the Department of Veterans Affairs claims processing <BR>

<P>center in New York, for example, the manager set out to improve <BR>

<P>service to veterans.  Workers previously had focused narrowly on <BR>

<P>specialized parts of the claim process.  Veterans were no more <BR>

<P>than numbers, and the lack of coordination among the pieces of the <BR>

<P>process produced long delays in processing checks.  The manager <BR>

<P>reorganized part of his staff into a team comprised of each of the <BR>

<P>specialties required to process a claim.  Team members focused on <BR>

<P>each individual veteran and worked together to solve the veterans' <BR>

<P>problems.  Processing time dropped from years to weeks or months.  <BR>

<P>The job satisfaction of the workers improved and the veterans were <BR>

<P>much happier with the friendly and prompt action on their claims.  <BR>

<P>Focusing on the customer   how can the process be organized around <BR>

<P>the needs of the veteran?   instead of process   how can we most <BR>

<P>easily process this paper?   dramatically improved the office's <BR>

<P>performance.16 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR, in fact, has helped launch several such customer <BR>

<P>service initiatives, including one-stop career centers in the <BR>

<P>Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration and <BR>

<P>improvements to the Treasury Bureau of Engraving and Printing's <BR>

<P>public tours.  These experiments demonstrate that customer service <BR>

<P>need not be incompatible with bureaucratic accountability   <BR>

<P>responsibility of bureaucrats to elected officials for the <BR>

<P>management of their programs.  In fact, customer service can <BR>

<P>improve accountability while it increases satisfaction.  <BR>

<P>Frederickson has noted that citizens are owners, not customers.17   <BR>

<P>However, even owners appreciate being treated responsively as <BR>

<P>customers.  A stockholder (that is, owner) of an automobile <BR>

<P>company, for example, certainly expects responsiveness when <BR>

<P>entering a car dealership.  Indeed, the stockholder's concern for <BR>

<P>the bottom line can even increase concern about the quality of <BR>

<P>customer service.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The real problem with the NPR's customer service initiative <BR>

<P>is not that it is incompatible with democratic accountability.  <BR>

<P>Rather, the notion of customer service in government itself is so <BR>

<P>new the concept is underdeveloped.  Using the idea to drive <BR>

<P>bureaucratic performance therefore requires substantial <BR>

<P>intellectual innovation which, to date, has not accompanied the <BR>

<P>NPR.  Moreover, as currently employed, it is a crude fit at best <BR>

<P>for what government does and how it does it, for three reasons.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     1. Multiple goals.  Responsiveness to citizens is not the <BR>

<P>only, or even the principal, goal of public programs.18   As <BR>

<P>service recipients, citizens naturally expect responsiveness: <BR>

<P>prompt, friendly, and generous service.  The road that, in a big <BR>

<P>snowstorm, needs to be plowed first is always in front of one's <BR>

<P>own home.  As taxpayers, however, they demand economy and <BR>

<P>efficiency from government.  &quot;Pork-barrel programs&quot; are programs <BR>

<P>given to someone else.  Responsiveness to citizens as service <BR>

<P>recipients inevitably and eternally conflicts with the demands of <BR>

<P>citizens-as-taxpayers.  Government managers therefore tend to face <BR>

<P>greater demands than they can ever possibly meet and clashing <BR>

<P>views about how to meet them.  Should the Interior Department <BR>

<P>reintroduce gray wolves into Yellowstone National Park, as <BR>

<P>environmentalists have advocated, or should it try to clean out <BR>

<P>the wolves, to satisfy ranchers?19   Should the Federal Aviation <BR>

<P>Administration supervise new but small airlines relatively more, <BR>

<P>on the grounds that with less experience they might have greater <BR>

<P>problems?  Or should they focus relatively more attention on the <BR>

<P>older but larger carriers that transport far more travelers?  The <BR>

<P>question is even worse in welfare programs.  Should the Department <BR>

<P>of Health and Human Services seek to make it as easy and painless <BR>

<P>as possible for Medicaid recipients to qualify for health care?  <BR>

<P>Or should the department attempt to manage the program as strictly <BR>

<P>as possible to reduce costs?  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Such conflicts create a dilemma for bureaucrats attempting to <BR>

<P>follow the customer service mantra.  If they concentrate solely on <BR>

<P>responsiveness to citizens as service recipients, and therefore <BR>

<P>seek to maximize the services they deliver, they risk conflict <BR>

<P>with citizens as taxpayers.  If they try to satisfy citizens as <BR>

<P>taxpayers, and therefore seek to deliver a minimal level of <BR>

<P>services, they risk disappointing citizens as service recipients.  <BR>

<P>Asking government bureaucrats, within the realm of their <BR>

<P>discretion, to pursue both efficiency and responsiveness creates <BR>
an impossible problem.  And leaving bureaucrats with impossible <BR>

<P>problems in the end only further increases their discretion and <BR>

<P>the difficulty of holding them accountable to either the law or <BR>

<P>customer service standards.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The more hopeful side of customer service is that bureaucrats <BR>

<P>inevitably have substantial discretion.  The broad promises and <BR>

<P>vague guidance of most acts of Congress leave them considerable <BR>

<P>maneuvering room in doing their jobs.  The customer service <BR>

<P>movement argued that bureaucrats, in exercising that discretion, <BR>

<P>ought to put citizens' needs foremost.  Their job is, at its core, <BR>

<P>to administer the law and maximize the use of available resources.  <BR>

<P>But in deciding just how to do that, the movement contends, <BR>

<P>bureaucrats should focus on their customers.  The question is <BR>

<P>whether more federal employees can be persuaded to find a balance <BR>

<P>among the competing demands on their time and energy that makes it <BR>

<P>easier for citizens to deal with their government.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     2. Connecting with the customer.  Second, many federal <BR>

<P>programs   and most federal bureaucrats   do not provide <BR>

<P>&quot;significant services directly to the public,&quot; in the words of the <BR>

<P>executive order.  There are, to be sure, federal programs and <BR>

<P>bureaucrats that do have substantial contact with citizens: air <BR>

<P>traffic control, patrol of waterways, operation of dams, operation <BR>

<P>of social security, customs collection, the national parks.  But <BR>

<P>the nature of many federal functions and the complexity of program <BR>

<P>implementation both create large challenges for customer service.   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Some government functions, like regulation, tax collection, <BR>

<P>and criminal justice, present tough customer service problems.  <BR>

<P>Government officials must find the difficult balance between <BR>

<P>making their programs user-friendly and preventing abuse.  <BR>

<P>Nevertheless, the IRS has devoted itself to making its tax forms <BR>

<P>more user-friendly and to improving the quality of telephone tax <BR>

<P>advice.  The Customs Service in Miami has received one of Vice <BR>

<P>President Gore's &quot;Hammer Awards&quot; for improving service for the <BR>

<P>airlines and their passengers.  There has even been tentative <BR>

<P>discussion about applying the customer service approach to prisons <BR>

<P>to reduce violence and costs.  The ingenuity of both the reformers <BR>

<P>and government managers has been remarkable, but the underlying <BR>

<P>fact is that the nature of many government functions makes <BR>

<P>pursuing customer service far more difficult than the rhetoric <BR>

<P>suggests.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Working through the long and complex implementation chain of <BR>

<P>most federal programs presents additional challenges.  Most <BR>

<P>federal government employees never encounter a citizen while <BR>

<P>performing their official duties.  Their job, rather, is to help <BR>

<P>others do their job so that citizens, eventually, are served.  It <BR>

<P>is not unusual, for example, for a federal manager to distribute a <BR>

<P>grant to a state agency, which adds state money and state <BR>

<P>requirements and then passes it on to a local agency, which then <BR>

<P>contracts out to a nonprofit organization to actually deliver the <BR>

<P>service to a citizen   who then must negotiate a system providing <BR>

<P>related services through similar complex relationships.  It is, <BR>

<P>quite often, a government by proxy.20   It is the job of the <BR>

<P>federal employee to work with the next person in the chain <BR>

<P>(whether another federal employee, a state government worker, <BR>

<P>perhaps a private contractor).  Under such circumstances, it is <BR>

<P>easy for the citizen-as-customer's concerns to get lost.21   It is <BR>

<P>also easy for everyone along the chain to claim innocence for how <BR>

<P>the citizen is handled.  If everyone is in charge, no one has <BR>

<P>responsibility for results.  Making customer service work means <BR>

<P>focusing everyone along the chain on how well the system works (or <BR>

<P>does not) for the ultimate recipient of services.  It also means <BR>

<P>orienting their actions to improve the odds that citizens' needs, <BR>

<P>not the internal needs of workers in the chain, are served.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In July 1994, Oregon officials proposed a novel, head-on <BR>

<P>attack against these system problems.  State officials proposed <BR>

<P>shifting the intergovernmental programs targeted at Oregon from an <BR>

<P>agency- and program-based effort to one focused on results.  The <BR>

<P>plan, developed by government officials in Oregon, would begin by <BR>

<P>having the federal government join with Oregon state and local <BR>

<P>governments to &quot;identify results to be achieved.&quot;  From there, the <BR>

<P>Oregon officials suggested, <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     we will be contracted to achieve them.  To help us achieve <BR>

<P>     these results, the federal government will merge funding <BR>

<P>     categories and streams, create funding incentives which <BR>

<P>     reward desirable results, and reduce micromanagement and <BR>

<P>     wasteful paperwork.  This collaboration will empower our <BR>

<P>     communities to identify local needs to be met by federal and <BR>

<P>     state programs, to make their own decisions about how to <BR>

<P>     address those needs, and to be accountable for results.22 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The state had already developed a twenty-year strategic plan, with <BR>

<P>specific benchmarks (quantified policy objectives) defined.23   <BR>

<P>Its officials argued that its basic approach (defining goals, <BR>

<P>building programs around people instead of levels of government, <BR>

<P>and constructing the system to serve those goals and people) fit <BR>

<P>into the NPR's philosophy.  Furthermore, they contended, their <BR>

<P>approach would cut through the barriers that hindered &quot;efficiency, <BR>

<P>integrated, client-centered service.&quot;24   Although the proposal <BR>

<P>was embryonic, it attracted widespread interest in Washington.  <BR>

<P>The meeting in Washington to discuss it attracted top officials <BR>

<P>from OMB, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, <BR>

<P>and Labor, and 170 other senior agency staff from around the <BR>

<P>capital.  To many observers and participants, it suggested an <BR>

<P>alternative solution to the intergovernmental dilemma: to focus on <BR>

<P>outcomes instead of inputs and on people instead of programs, and <BR>

<P>to use that approach to transform the organizational arrangements.  <BR>

<P>Armed with a different way of seeing the problem, they hoped, the <BR>

<P>reformers argued that they might be able to crack the old <BR>

<P>quandary.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     3. Hypersensitivity to customer wishes.  Finally, a large <BR>

<P>part of government's performance problem is a hypersensitivity, <BR>

<P>not an insensitivity, to the demands of citizens.  Elected <BR>

<P>officials, indeed, are preoccupied with the demands of their <BR>

<P>constituents.  They have few incentives to worry about broad <BR>

<P>public management issues like performance, quality, or cost; they <BR>

<P>have every incentive to deliver the goods, from new dams to <BR>

<P>protection for social security, to the voters.  That problem led <BR>

<P>George Frederickson to argue, tongue only partially in cheek, that <BR>

<P>real reform lies in employing &quot;total quality politics,&quot; not &quot;total <BR>

<P>quality management.&quot;25   The danger, and it is the most subtle yet <BR>

<P>most important element of the customer service initiative, is that <BR>

<P>customer focus on the part of government managers could reinforce <BR>

<P>the constituent-based pressure of elected officials and produce a <BR>

<P>government hyper-tuned to micro-level needs yet without capacity <BR>

<P>or incentive to deliver broad or sustained performance.26 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     This is not a case against customer service but a brief for <BR>

<P>thinking it through thoroughly and implementing it carefully.  <BR>

<P>That, however, has not yet happened in the NPR.  The customer <BR>

<P>service initiative has proven little more than an executive order <BR>

<P>demanding action and a rhetorical flag under which virtually any <BR>

<P>enterprise can operate.  The British, in fact, have considerably <BR>

<P>more experience with the customer service notion.  Their <BR>

<P>experiences teach several important lessons.27 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Defining customers is much harder than it looks.  Different <BR>

<P>     people tend to want very different things, and these <BR>

<P>     preferences are not easily aggregated.<BR>

<P> <BR>

<P>     A focus on customers   users of services   tends to avoid the <BR>

<P>     question of who ought to pay for services.  It can even <BR>

<P>     accentuate the taxpayer versus service recipient dilemma.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     A service-based approach works poorly for public goods, like <BR>

<P>     defense and pollution control, for which it is impossible to <BR>

<P>     define individual beneficiaries.28   A large share of the <BR>

<P>     federal government's activities, of course, center on such <BR>

<P>     public goods.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The customer service approach encourages individuals to <BR>

<P>     develop, express, and advocate preferences just as <BR>

<P>     government's ability to satisfy them shrinks under the weight <BR>

<P>     of fiscal stress.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Excessive zeal in measuring citizen preferences can produce <BR>

<P>     an information overload. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Customer service can easily be put to partisan use.  Critics <BR>

<P>     of the party in power have used information about citizen <BR>

<P>     complaints to attack the party.  This, naturally, leads the <BR>

<P>     ruling party to collect information most likely to put <BR>

<P>     programs in a favorable light.  Many elected officials <BR>

<P>     complain about spending any money for citizen surveys.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Customer service is an undeniably attractive notion.  Making <BR>

<P>government fit citizens' needs better is an inescapable imper<BR>

<P>ative.  But the notion raises as many problems as it solves.  <BR>

<P>Customer service does, however, have two overriding values.  It <BR>

<P>gears &quot;the organization to serve its public rather than the other <BR>

<P>way around,&quot; as one participant in the British effort explained.29   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     It also provides a fresh approach to the eternal search for <BR>

<P>the Holy Grail of program coordination.  No one can spend much <BR>

<P>time with federal managers without sensing their frustration.  The <BR>

<P>budget cuts of the 1980s have trimmed both people and resources <BR>

<P>from their agencies.  To compensate, most managers have struggled <BR>

<P>to improve their operations to the point where many believe that <BR>

<P>there are few additional savings to be wrung out.  (Notable <BR>

<P>exceptions to this point are &quot;high-risk&quot; areas that pose <BR>

<P>substantial managerial and budgetary problems.  I will return to <BR>

<P>them later.)  They have increasingly come to believe that the next <BR>

<P>generation of front-line reforms will come from improving the <BR>

<P>wiring between agencies and programs, not within them.  That, in <BR>

<P>fact, is the focus of several reinvention labs, the Department of <BR>

<P>Agriculture's rural development initiative,30  and the state of <BR>

<P>Oregon's initiative to improve intergovernmental partnerships.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The customer service initiative therefore has enormous <BR>

<P>potential.  It is most useful as a proximate goal in directing the <BR>

<P>exercise of bureaucratic discretion.  It can never fully steer <BR>

<P>government action, however, in part because of the inherent <BR>

<P>contradictions rooted deeply in the concept and in part because at <BR>

<P>best it is only a weak guide.  A far more important and useful <BR>

<P>guide for government action is performance management.  Developing <BR>

<P>a robust performance system, however, will take years, as I show <BR>

<P>in the next section.  In the meantime, customer service can be a <BR>

<P>road in the same direction.  Even achieving that more limited <BR>

<P>potential, however, will require a far more sophisticated <BR>

<P>exploration of what customer service means, how to do it, and how <BR>

<P>to fit it within the demands and constraints of democratic <BR>

<P>government.  (The Australians, for example, are defining the <BR>

<P>competencies required for high-quality customer service.  See <BR>

<P>appendix I.)  It also requires a frank admission of the value <BR>

<P>conflicts and dilemmas that the customer service initiative will <BR>

<P>surface.  The NPR has done neither, and without taking both steps <BR>

<P>the drive toward customer service will suffer.<BR>

<P>Performance Management <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In the long run, building a government that works better and <BR>

<P>costs less depends on strengthening OMB's ability to guide it.  If <BR>

<P>government is to steer effectively, OMB will have to stand at the <BR>

<P>helm.  But for OMB to steer, it will have to have a compass more <BR>

<P>precise and more far reaching than annual review of the budgetary <BR>

<P>process.  It needs a mature performance management system to <BR>

<P>assess what government actually accomplishes with taxpayers' <BR>

<P>money.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The most promising source of glue to hold the movement <BR>

<P>together and promote the right incentives lies in the Office of <BR>

<P>Management and Budget: the reorganization of the agency launched <BR>

<P>in March 1994 under the banner of &quot;OMB 2000&quot;; and the Government <BR>

<P>Performance and Results Act (GPRA), passed in 1993, which seeks to <BR>

<P>link budget inputs with performance outcomes.  The OMB 2000 <BR>

<P>reorganization was, quite simply, the most fundamental change in <BR>

<P>the agency since its creation.  OMB Director Leon Panetta and <BR>

<P>Deputy Director Alice Rivlin forcefully argued the need to escape <BR>

<P>from routine budget reviews and to &quot;better integrate our budget <BR>

<P>analysis, management review and policy development roles.&quot;31   The <BR>

<P>reorganization eliminated virtually all of the existing <BR>

<P>&quot;management side&quot; of OMB and integrated management functions with <BR>

<P>the budget review in new &quot;resource management offices.&quot;32   These <BR>

<P>new offices would be responsible for formulating and reviewing the <BR>

<P>budget, assessing program effectiveness and efficiency, conducting <BR>

<P>mid- and long-range policy and program analysis, implementing <BR>

<P>government-wide management policy in areas like procurement and <BR>

<P>financial management, and conducting program evaluation.  OMB <BR>

<P>created five resource management offices: National Security and <BR>

<P>International Affairs; Natural Resources, Energy and Science; <BR>

<P>Health and Personnel; Human Resources; and General Government.33   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     OMB 2000 sought to help the budget agency move from the <BR>

<P>deadlines and short time horizons of the annual budget process to <BR>

<P>a longer-term results-oriented perspective.  OMB officials said <BR>

<P>they wanted &quot;to be more strategic in the way we prepare the <BR>

<P>budget.&quot;34   Some analysts have harshly criticized the <BR>

<P>reorganization because it eliminated the management arm.35   <BR>

<P>However, the management division within OMB had long been a weak <BR>

<P>player, especially in overseeing general management issues.  OMB <BR>

<P>officials had only two real options: pursuing the reorganization <BR>

<P>to provide integrated analysis, but risk having short-term budget <BR>

<P>issues drive out long-term management concerns; or create a <BR>

<P>separate office of federal management to assess administrative <BR>

<P>issues, but risk having the office become a eunuch in a setting <BR>

<P>where budgetary decisions inevitably drive policy.36   Faced with <BR>

<P>these choices, Panetta and Rivlin followed the first option.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The reorganization promised several important innovations.  <BR>

<P>First, it provided a linkage between budgetary and management <BR>

<P>issues which previously had been fragmentary at best.  Second, it <BR>

<P>committed OMB to adopt a broader and longer perspective on budget <BR>

<P>and management issues.  Third, it provided the potential for <BR>

<P>integrating performance questions into the annual budgetary <BR>

<P>process (although the ambitious plan had no clear implementation <BR>

<P>plan).  Finally, it sought to change the language of communication <BR>

<P>between OMB and the agencies.  By raising its sights from narrow <BR>

<P>budgetary issues to larger performance issues, OMB sought to <BR>

<P>change the incentives for the way departmental budget officers <BR>

<P>communicated their requests.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The reorganization was ambitious; transforming the deep-<BR>

<P>seated budget-review culture was a huge job.  OMB also faced a big <BR>

<P>problem of training its budget examiners in how to take the <BR>

<P>broader view and of integrating its management experts into the <BR>

<P>resource management offices without undercutting their morale.  <BR>

<P>OMB was never successful in combining management and budget <BR>

<P>analysis in the same agency.  Nor was it ever truly successful in <BR>

<P>combining long-term strategic planning with short-term attention <BR>

<P>to details.  OMB 2000 attempts both tough jobs, but this time <BR>

<P>makes the transformation within people, especially budget <BR>

<P>examiners, instead of their organizational structure.  One risk is <BR>

<P>that the short-term focus of the annual budget process will drive <BR>

<P>out careful attention to the more long-term management issues.  <BR>

<P>Another risk is that OMB's historical focus on money and inputs <BR>

<P>will drive out attention to administration and outputs.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In the best of cases, OMB will acquire the capacity to link <BR>

<P>outputs and inputs, budget and management.  In the worse of cases, <BR>

<P>central attention to federal management will disappear from the <BR>

<P>top circle in government.  And that is something that cannot be <BR>

<P>allowed to happen.  If the challenges are great, however, the <BR>

<P>direction is sound.  The annual budget process remains the single <BR>

<P>most important way of focusing the attention of federal managers <BR>

<P>at every level.  Transforming that process offers the most <BR>

<P>important way of transforming the behavior of those managers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     OMB's reorganization was designed to support GPRA.  GPRA is <BR>

<P>part of a far wider movement, in both the United States and <BR>

<P>abroad, to focus managers' attention on accountability for <BR>

<P>results.  It aimed at improving the effectiveness of federal <BR>

<P>programs and citizen satisfaction by improving &quot;the confidence of <BR>

<P>the American people in the capability of the Federal Government, <BR>

<P>by systematically holding Federal agencies accountable for <BR>

<P>achieving program results.&quot;37   In the long run, moreover, GPRA <BR>

<P>may well prove to be the keystone of the federal government's <BR>

<P>reinvention movement.  It defines performance as the critical <BR>

<P>touchstone of the government's programs; it defines the linkages <BR>

<P>among the government's activities; and it provides important <BR>

<P>incentives for government managers to focus on results.  Under the <BR>

<P>act, each federal agency, by the end of the ten-year phase-in <BR>

<P>period, will prepare: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     a five-year strategic plan, that is updated every three <BR>

<P>     years;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     a comprehensive mission statement that links the agency's <BR>

<P>     current operations with its long-term goals;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     an identification of the goals and objectives, along with the <BR>

<P>     resources, systems, and processes required to achieve the <BR>

<P>     goals;<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     a description of the most important external factors that <BR>

<P>     could affect the agency's success in achieving the goals; and<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     annual program evaluations to help agency officials assess <BR>

<P>     their success, explain why goals might not have been met, and <BR>

<P>     revise the goals if necessary.<BR>

<P>
<P>OMB and the president would then use the process to set future <BR>

<P>budgets and to revise programs, if necessary.  The law called for <BR>

<P>at least ten pilot projects.  By the summer of 1994, federal <BR>

<P>agencies had put forward seventy-one pilots in twenty-one <BR>

<P>departments and agencies.38 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     OMB did not expect the transition to performance-based <BR>

<P>management to come easily.  In their briefing documents, OMB <BR>

<P>officials asserted that change will require a long-term process, <BR>

<P>even though they quickly encouraged performance measures as part <BR>

<P>of agency budget submissions.39   This process, in turn, required <BR>

<P>fundamental changes in the culture of government management and <BR>

<P>the assumption of more responsibility by managers throughout the <BR>

<P>government.  OMB officials, in fact, repeatedly stressed that <BR>

<P>agency officials would be the leaders in GPRA.  They did not <BR>

<P>intend for this to be a top-down management reform.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Most important, GPRA depends on technology that does not now <BR>

<P>exist.  There is no budgetary system, no performance measurement <BR>

<P>system, and no career track within government for the people to do <BR>

<P>the work.  There are few incentives for such a long-range <BR>

<P>perspective, and only a passing audience among elected officials, <BR>

<P>citizens, and the media for the results.40   That is not a <BR>

<P>prescription for failure, but it is a measure of the work to be <BR>

<P>done if the promise of GPRA is to be met.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The federal government's ragged experience with management <BR>

<P>and reform, from planning-programming-budgeting and management by <BR>

<P>objectives through zero-based budgeting and total quality <BR>

<P>management, suggests caution in pressing ahead without building <BR>

<P>the technology for GPRA.  But several things are clearly different <BR>

<P>this time.  First, this is the first of the reforms launched by <BR>

<P>law instead of executive order or administrative action.  GPRA's <BR>

<P>base in law ensures both congressional and executive branch <BR>

<P>involvement and makes it harder for its sponsors to retreat.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Second, unlike previous reforms that began with an across-<BR>

<P>the-board effort, GPRA builds slowly from pilot programs to <BR>

<P>governmentwide implementation.  This provides an opportunity for <BR>

<P>learning along the way.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Third, the early evidence suggests that this reform enjoys <BR>

<P>far broader and more enthusiastic support throughout the <BR>

<P>bureaucracy than earlier efforts.  The surprising eagerness of <BR>

<P>federal agencies to volunteer for the pilot phase of the act <BR>

<P>underlined the eagerness of federal managers and top political <BR>

<P>appointees to grab the leverage that GPRA offered.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Finally, GPRA speaks with unusual clarity to problems that <BR>

<P>citizens want to have solved.  It would be hard to find anyone who <BR>

<P>finds government performance satisfactory, or that linking budgets <BR>

<P>with results is not a good idea.  The 1992 Perot presidential <BR>
campaign underlined that point.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Like the OMB 2000 reorganization, GPRA offered considerable <BR>

<P>promise for linking the big politics of reducing the size of <BR>

<P>government and the little politics of improving its performance.  <BR>

<P>OMB 2000 potentially provides the incentive for agencies to pay <BR>

<P>more attention to performance; GPRA provides the language to <BR>

<P>discuss it.  Past experience with aggressive budget and management <BR>

<P>reforms argues for caution in predicting results.  If the NPR is <BR>

<P>to have lasting meaning, however, linking the two revolutions is <BR>

<P>critical.  If joined, they offer substantial potential.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The problem is that it is far easier to talk about <BR>

<P>performance management than to do it.  Goals are notoriously <BR>

<P>difficult to define.  Greater specificity regularly attracts <BR>

<P>greater political conflict.  Moreover, even if goals can somehow <BR>

<P>be made clear, measuring progress is even harder.  Public programs <BR>

<P>are public often because the private sector cannot or will not <BR>

<P>produce them.  The very nature of public programs typically makes <BR>

<P>outcomes even harder to judge.  Managers often have little choice <BR>

<P>but to substitute input or activity measures (money spent or <BR>

<P>people served) for outcome measures (what the money accomplishes).  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If the technical problems of measuring progress can be <BR>

<P>surmounted, building the capacity throughout the government to do <BR>

<P>the job is difficult indeed, especially with the NPR's pledge to <BR>
shrink the federal bureaucracy by 272,900 positions within five <BR>

<P>years.  OMB has pledged to attack the job by merging its budget <BR>

<P>and management staffs into &quot;resource management offices,&quot; but the <BR>

<P>critical problem there is the old one: ensuring that short-term <BR>

<P>budget demands do not drive out assessment of long-term management <BR>

<P>problems.  And if measures emerge, comparing data across widely <BR>

<P>different programs is a daunting job.  How can decisionmakers <BR>

<P>compare the results of health programs against highway <BR>

<P>construction, social security against defense?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Finally, even if results can be measured and compared with <BR>

<P>goals, it is hard to gain an audience for the findings.  Elected <BR>

<P>officials frequently gain far more value by supporting new <BR>

<P>programs than by overseeing performance.41   Administrators have <BR>

<P>few incentives for allowing anyone to measure what they actually <BR>

<P>do.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Nearly everyone agrees that &quot;the budget process is not likely <BR>

<P>to be changed substantially until and unless decisionmakers use <BR>

<P>information on program performance when making allocation <BR>

<P>decisions,&quot; as the Congressional Budget Office argued.42   Only by <BR>

<P>changing the incentives for managers, by focusing members of <BR>

<P>Congress on performance issues when they make budgetary decisions, <BR>

<P>will performance management become a reality.  The difficulty is <BR>

<P>that elected officials understandably concentrate far more on the <BR>

<P>front end of the process.  Even if measuring performance were <BR>

<P>easy, changing the political culture to focus on outcomes runs <BR>

<P>against the driving incentives of the American system.  And <BR>

<P>measuring performance is decidedly not easy.  If it were, it would <BR>

<P>not have taken the federal government decades to commit itself to <BR>

<P>the effort   and then to give itself another decade to put the <BR>

<P>idea into place.<BR>

<P>Summary <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The biggest difficulty in thinking through the problems of <BR>

<P>performance management is that reformers and managers alike far <BR>

<P>too often consider it simply as a problem of measurement.  <BR>

<P>Committing the government to performance-based management, of <BR>

<P>course, requires that officials throughout government identify and <BR>

<P>measure results.  The more fundamental question, however, is what <BR>

<P>we will do with these measures.  Too often, reformers pursue <BR>

<P>measurement for its own sake.  If that becomes the case with GPRA, <BR>

<P>then it will simply become a new procedural shibboleth to replace <BR>

<P>an old one.  It will become a fresh symptom of the program it was <BR>

<P>designed to solve.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Performance-based management is most fundamentally about <BR>
communication, not measurement.  Moreover, this communication <BR>

<P>occurs within a broader political process, in which the players <BR>

<P>have a wide array of different incentives.  Performance-based <BR>

<P>management will have meaning only to the degree to which it shapes <BR>

<P>and improves those incentives.  If we think about performance-<BR>

<P>based management only as a measurement problem   how can we gauge <BR>

<P>the results that public programs produce?   we will miss the big <BR>

<P>questions:  How does what we know about results shape how we <BR>

<P>manage public programs?  How does our knowledge about results <BR>

<P>shape decisions about what programs we ought to adopt?  And how <BR>

<P>does the process of measuring results affect the behavior of <BR>

<P>political institutions?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     This leads to several important lessons for GPRA:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Performance measurement is different at different levels of <BR>

<P>     the bureaucracy.  While front-line supervisors might be <BR>

<P>     interested in assessing the quality of work done by their <BR>

<P>     subordinates, higher-level officials are likely to want to <BR>

<P>     judge the quality of their programs.  Top administration <BR>

<P>     officials and members of Congress will be looking not only at <BR>

<P>     program performance but where they can squeeze out extra <BR>

<P>     performance for the same amount of money, cut spending <BR>

<P>     without losing as much performance, or guess what additional <BR>

<P>     results they will buy with extra money.  In short, debate at <BR>

<P>     the political level revolves around broad strategic measures <BR>

<P>     and outcomes.  On the front lines, supervisors focus on <BR>

<P>     outputs.  Managers in between need to build the linkage <BR>

<P>     between these very different questions.43   Measures that <BR>

<P>     work at one level will not necessarily work well at another.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Aggregating performance measures from lower levels is likely <BR>

<P>     to produce meaningless noise.  A huge temptation in <BR>

<P>     performance measurement is to layer performance measures from <BR>

<P>     lower levels on top of each other and pass the information <BR>

<P>     along to higher-level officials.  Such an approach will not <BR>

<P>     only produce information that will not be easily digestible <BR>

<P>     by top officials.  It also creates the potential for burying <BR>

<P>     officials in paper and hiding embarrassing details in a <BR>

<P>     mountain of data.  Officials at each level will have to <BR>

<P>     define the kind of information they find most useful.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Performance measurement will have to speak in a language that <BR>

<P>     those listening can understand.  Too often analysts who <BR>

<P>     conduct sophisticated analysis complain that top managers and <BR>

<P>     elected officials pay no attention to their work.  This is <BR>

<P>     much like English-speaking tourists complaining, on visiting <BR>

<P>     the Great Wall of China, that no one understands their <BR> 

<P>     requests for directions.  If performance measurement is to be <BR>

<P>     a successful language for political communication, it will <BR>

<P>     have to be a language that those listening, especially busy <BR>

<P>     elected officials and top political appointees, will <BR>

<P>     understand and find useful.  Indeed, those crafting the <BR>

<P>     measures will have to work carefully to craft the measures to <BR>

<P>     serve their customers.  And customer-sensitive lower-level <BR>

<P>     managers will have to anticipate what kind of information <BR>

<P>     their superiors will need, and in what form they can most <BR>

<P>     easily present the data.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Performance measurement, moreover, must speak in a language <BR>

<P>     that those listening will want to hear.  There is a special <BR>

<P>     problem in speaking performance information to Congress.  <BR>

<P>     Congress naturally tends to think of solving problems by <BR>

<P>     passing laws; indeed, that is its Constitutional charge.  <BR>

<P>     That makes Congress peculiarly input-oriented.  Its <BR>

<P>     oversight, moreover, tends to be haphazard and episodic.  It <BR>

<P>     has few incentives for regular and systematic review.44   <BR>

<P>     Performance measurement, on the other hand, seeks a careful <BR>

<P>     and systematic survey of results.  Performance measurers just <BR>

<P>     find a way to interest members of Congress in GPRA and the <BR>

<P>     results it produces.  It will have little staying power <BR>

<P>     otherwise.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Put simply, performance measurement is about political <BR>

<P>communication.  It has value only to the degree to which it <BR>

<P>improves communication.  A careful look at performance <BR>

<P>measurement, therefore, naturally includes a searching analysis of <BR>
what we know about measuring results.  But it must also include a <BR>

<P>thoughtful examination of how the process of measuring results <BR>

<P>will enter the political discourse, and how it will shape the <BR>

<P>behavior of the players in the political process.  <BR>

<P>5. Missing Pieces<BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Despite the encyclopedic coverage of the NPR's report and the <BR>

<P>sweeping actions that followed, several important issues either <BR>

<P>are missing or have received scant attention.  Without attacking <BR>

<P>and solving these missing pieces of the picture, the NPR risks <BR>

<P>undercutting its promise.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Civil Service <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Reforming the civil service flows as a theme throughout the <BR>

<P>NPR report, and changing the rules of the civil service has been a <BR>

<P>major focus for much of the NPR's work since.  However, as <BR>

<P>discussed in section 2, creating a government that works better <BR>

<P>and costs less will depend ultimately on the movement's ability to <BR>

<P>build the capacity to do the job.  Government's problem is a <BR>

<P>people problem as well as a process problem.  Real reform hinges <BR>

<P>on government's ability to find, attract, promote, train, guide, <BR>

<P>and motivate the workers needed to do its work.  Major pieces are <BR>

<P>missing from the NPR's personnel reform effort, and without them <BR>

<P>the movement will not have the capacity to accomplish its goals.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Investment <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR has great promise for cutting the costs of <BR>

<P>government.  To produce some of these cost savings, however, the <BR>

<P>federal government will have to make short-term investments if the <BR>

<P>long-term results are to materialize, as the NPR's report <BR>

<P>recognized.1   In its first year, however, the incessant drive for <BR>

<P>deficit reduction has pushed the investment initiative off the <BR>

<P>stage.  The different pieces of the NPR are, in many ways, an <BR>

<P>inseparable package.  The reengineering of the federal government <BR>

<P>anticipates that advanced technology will make it possible to <BR>

<P>reduce the number of workers.  The number of workers, though, is <BR>

<P>being reduced far in advance of even the promise of new <BR>

<P>investment.  The risk is that the NPR will deliver a government <BR>

<P>that, in the long run, costs more and works worse.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Steering <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If the government's job is to steer, as Osborne and Gaebler <BR>

<P>suggest, whose hand will be on the tiller?  Reforms abroad, in <BR>

<P>state and local governments, and even the reinvention experience <BR>

<P>at the federal level to date all reinforce the same point:  Not <BR>

<P>only is strong political leadership necessary; there also has to <BR>

<P>be central administrative capacity to connect the person at the <BR>

<P>helm with the rowing mechanisms.  To prevent the creation of a new <BR>

<P>government agency, NPR officials deliberately decided not to make <BR>

<P>the NPR an agency.  Instead, the NPR has been staffed by detailees <BR>

<P>from other agencies rotating in and (often) out.  Consequently few <BR>

<P>hands have been on board since the beginning.  Meanwhile, OPM and <BR>

<P>OMB are undergoing major changes in mission and organization, and <BR>

<P>the General Services Administration is transforming its <BR>

<P>procurement functions and processes.  All of the federal <BR>

<P>government's central management agencies are thus simultaneously <BR>

<P>undergoing major changes.  The signals to managers throughout <BR>

<P>government therefore are unavoidably fuzzy and, sometimes, <BR>

<P>inconsistent.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The question for the NPR is not the instability.  <BR>
Considerable confusion is inevitable in any reform of this size, <BR>

<P>and the experience of other nations suggests that it will take at <BR>

<P>least two or three more years for stable patterns even to begin to <BR>

<P>emerge.  Rather, the question is who will ultimately be <BR>

<P>responsible for maintaining the reform movement.  The NPR has <BR>

<P>implicitly answered the question.  There will be no central <BR>

<P>steering mechanism.  The NPR report talked about the need for <BR>

<P>central management agencies to divest themselves of many of their <BR>

<P>powers, to decentralize those powers to the agencies, and thereby <BR>

<P>to empower workers.  While this is a sensible beginning tactic, it <BR>

<P>is no basis on which to build long-term success.  Practical <BR>

<P>politics suggests that, when problems or embarrassments arise from <BR>

<P>the behavior of empowered managers, as inevitably they will, <BR>

<P>predictable demands will surface that they never be allowed to <BR>

<P>occur again.  In the absence of stronger forces to the contrary, <BR>

<P>someone at some central office will be charged, by the president <BR>

<P>and/or Congress, with doing just that.  Practical management also <BR>

<P>suggests that it is unlikely that the accumulated decisions of <BR>

<P>millions of empowered workers will be consistent with each other, <BR>

<P>the law, or the public interest.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     If government is to steer, someone will have to keep the <BR>

<P>compass.  This does not mean the creation or reinforcement of <BR>

<P>large, overbearing central bureaucracies.  It does not mean <BR>

<P>turning OMB into a lion or GSA into a micro-level investigator.  <BR>

<P>But it does require careful thought about which functions <BR>
(particularly information collection, long-range assessment, <BR>

<P>problem solving, coordination, and the articulation of driving <BR>

<P>themes) inevitably need to be central ones.  We can safely predict <BR>

<P>that these, and perhaps others, will occur.  The question is where <BR>

<P>and by whom.  The NPR can avoid the question and risk having <BR>

<P>others answer it in ways that might contradict the movement's <BR>

<P>principles. Or the NPR can aggressively seek to answer it and fix <BR>

<P>central responsibility clearly.  The issue is not whether the <BR>

<P>answer will emerge; it is how, whether implicitly or explicitly, <BR>

<P>in support of or opposed to the movement that the NPR has labored <BR>

<P>to launch.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The logic of my argument for the OMB 2000 reorganization plan <BR>

<P>and GPRA is that the budget office is the natural, perhaps <BR>

<P>inevitable, place for these questions to be answered.  Indeed, the <BR>

<P>NPR's recommendations, OMB's reorganization, and GPRA's long-term <BR>

<P>strategic planning and performance measurement requirements all <BR>

<P>are mutually supporting.  The reinvented OMB is the logical place <BR>

<P>for the central steering role to occur, and it is time now to <BR>

<P>begin planning the transition from the NPR's short-term, jump-<BR>

<P>starting role to OMB's long-term nurturing and maintenance role.<BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Congress <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     When Clinton administration officials released the NPR report <BR>

<P>in September 1993, they received at least grudging support from <BR>

<P>Capitol Hill.  Most members of Congress recognized the appeal of a <BR>

<P>government that works better and costs less.  In the details, <BR>

<P>however, Congress reverted to form.2   Its members supported the <BR>

<P>rhetoric in general but micromanaged the details.  On one hand, <BR>

<P>Congress enthusiastically endorsed the downsizing initiative and <BR>

<P>even upped the ante from a cut of 252,000 government workers to <BR>

<P>272,900.  Members eagerly calculated how to spend the savings on <BR>

<P>the crime bill.  When it came to individual decisions to produce <BR>

<P>the savings, however, Congress quickly retreated.  They not only <BR>

<P>voted to exempt favored departments from downsizing.  They also <BR>

<P>torpedoed the Department of Labor's plan to combine 154 federal <BR>

<P>job training programs, housed in fourteen different federal <BR>

<P>agencies, into a coordinated effort.3 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     These actions teach an important lesson.  Although NPR <BR>

<P>officials long contended that they could launch most of their <BR>

<P>reforms without Congress, the reality is that the NPR cannot <BR>

<P>sustain any of its reforms without congressional support, or at <BR>

<P>least the absence of opposition.4   NPR officials began their <BR>

<P>reforms without a strategy for winning that support (or defusing <BR>

<P>that opposition) beyond the brave hope that the overwhelming logic <BR>

<P>of the reform would bring members of Congress to their camp.  They <BR>

<P>have been struggling ever since, from the buyout bill through <BR>

<P>procurement reform, to recover.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Congress, by practice and the Constitution, attacks problems <BR>

<P>by passing laws.  The NPR seeks to solve problems by improving <BR>

<P>performance.  Congress as an institution works on the input side.  <BR>

<P>The NPR focuses on the output side.  Congress has little incentive <BR>

<P>to worry about results and, in fact, has long indulged itself in a <BR>

<P>separation-of-powers fantasy that absolves it from any complicity <BR>

<P>in the executive branch's performance problems.  Members of <BR>

<P>Congress, furthermore, have everything to gain from publicly <BR>

<P>embracing the broad principles of reinvention and then protecting <BR>

<P>their constituents and favorite programs behind the scenes in <BR>

<P>committee rooms and little-noticed riders to complex bills.  If <BR>

<P>problems later develop, they will have been the result of a <BR>

<P>misdirected executive branch.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR, however, has several advantages to tackle these <BR>

<P>problems.  Many of the recommendations in the report, and much of <BR>

<P>its broad philosophical flavoring of performance and customer <BR>

<P>service, are of remote interest to most members of Congress.  <BR>

<P>Congressional disinterest gives the reinventers a great deal of <BR>

<P>initial maneuvering room to prove the success of their effort.  <BR>

<P>Moreover, many of the recommendations depend on how individual <BR>

<P>bureaucrats deal daily with issues on their desks and the <BR>
discretion they have to solve problems.  That is particularly true <BR>

<P>of customer service and program coordination issues.  They can <BR>

<P>make substantial progress by changing the way they do business, <BR>

<P>without changing the business they are in.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR's long-term success nevertheless depends on creating <BR>

<P>at least some incentives for members of Congress in the <BR>

<P>reinvention process.  The biggest incentive would be clear <BR>

<P>evidence that government does indeed work better and cost less, <BR>

<P>although that would scarcely prevent members of Congress from <BR>

<P>tinkering with details to benefit their constituents.  Even that, <BR>

<P>however, has lost some of its appeal, for local television <BR>

<P>reporters and newspaper columnists across the country have begun <BR>

<P>to point out the hypocrisy of embracing broad reforms while <BR>

<P>undermining them with pork-barrel votes, even if the pork is <BR>

<P>flowing back home.  Many members of Congress are struggling with <BR>

<P>some way to make government, and therefore their own jobs, more <BR>

<P>palatable to voters.  They are seeking ways to wring extra <BR>

<P>performance out of government so there will at least be a small <BR>

<P>amount of money to spend on new programs.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Furthermore, some members of Congress from committees that <BR>

<P>have long been relatively dormant, like the House Government <BR>

<P>Operations Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs <BR>

<P>Committee, have discovered that the NPR has given them new, high-<BR>

<P>profile issues like procurement reform and performance <BR>

<P>measurement.  In an era when fiscal constraints prevent most <BR>
committees from taking major initiatives, these high-profile <BR>

<P>issues have given some members new standing.  Because they cut <BR>

<P>across so many government programs and agencies   that is, because <BR>

<P>they cut across the jurisdictions of so many other congressional <BR>

<P>committees   these issues have also created the potential for new <BR>

<P>power centers in Congress.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Much of this rationale is tentative or hypothetical.  The <BR>

<P>important point, however, is that the NPR creates subtle <BR>

<P>opportunities for building congressional support for its <BR>

<P>initiatives.  It would be folly to think that members of Congress <BR>

<P>will put pork-barrel incentives aside.  It would also be folly to <BR>

<P>ignore the fact that most members of Congress are having far less <BR>

<P>fun than they used to, and many members are hungrily looking for <BR>

<P>some way to improve the way government works.  The NPR is rich <BR>

<P>with potential, but congressional support will not naturally flow <BR>

<P>to it any more than water will naturally flow uphill.  Still, with <BR>

<P>careful strategy and the construction of new mechanisms, water can <BR>

<P>indeed be made to flow uphill   and the NPR can build <BR>

<P>congressional support for its initiatives.  Given the slow start, <BR>

<P>however, the task is now all the greater.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>High-Risk Programs <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>     The NPR paid scant attention to the government's &quot;high-risk <BR>

<P>programs,&quot; identified by both OMB and the General Accounting <BR>

<P>Office (GAO), which have the potential for costing the federal <BR>

<P>government billions of dollars.5   The Department of Energy (DOE), <BR>

<P>for example, has more than $19 billion in contracts under <BR>

<P>management by major firms and academic organizations.  The NPR <BR>

<P>recommended that DOE improve its contract management, but the <BR>

<P>steps required do not fit neatly into the NPR approach.  GAO found <BR>

<P>that<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Historically, Energy's contractors have operated largely <BR>

<P>     without oversight of financial risk, and this has placed the <BR>

<P>     government's multibillion-dollar annual investment in <BR>

<P>     contractors' services at risk.  Energy lacks the necessary <BR>

<P>     staff expertise and information systems to monitor <BR>

<P>     contractors, and its contracts provide few incentives for <BR>

<P>     cost-effective contractor operations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The core of the problem, GAO found, lay in DOE's own <BR>

<P>administrative capacity and in the nature of the contracts it <BR>

<P>negotiated.6   Neither issue received major attention in the NPR.  <BR>

<P>Most of the NPR's procurement focus lay in untying the red tape <BR>

<P>binding the procurement process.  DOE's fundamental problems <BR>

<P>stemmed from precisely the opposite problem: the government's <BR>

<P>over-reliance on private markets.7   The same is true of many <BR>

<P>other high-risk programs identified by OMB and GAO, from Medicare <BR>

<P>to Superfund.  The lesson is that by squeezing money out of the <BR>

<P>federal budget by under-investing in management, poorly managed <BR>

<P>federal programs have cost taxpayers dearly.8   Problems have <BR>

<P>plagued the Environmental Protection Agency Superfund program.  <BR>

<P>DOE has made only halting progress in cleaning up its nuclear <BR>

<P>weapons facilities despite spending vast sums of money.  <BR>

<P>Management problems in both cases have cost billions of dollars.9   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In fact, it is a safe bet that savings from solving these and <BR>

<P>other management problems would swamp the savings promised through <BR>

<P>the NPR.  Money saved by avoiding future management problems, <BR>

<P>however, will not show up on the budget as savings.  It cannot be <BR>

<P>scored by CBO.  Nor can members of Congress take credit for saving <BR>

<P>it or turn around and spend the savings elsewhere.  The money <BR>

<P>saved is real, but expenses foregone do not travel politically as <BR>

<P>well as bureaucrats shown the door.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The high-risk problems stem from causes rooted deeply in the <BR>

<P>government's personnel, financial management, and contract <BR>

<P>management systems, and they cannot readily be fixed through <BR>

<P>culture change, empowerment, customer service, or the NPR's other <BR>

<P>themes.  Moreover, the short-term tactical decisions the NPR made <BR>

<P>to press the movement ahead, particularly downsizing the federal <BR>

<P>work force, risks making the high-risk problems even worse.  By <BR>

<P>cutting to a target instead of to a plan, the downsizing could <BR>

<P>easily eliminate both the people and the skills needed to attack <BR>

<P>the problem.  And the long-run costs could dwarf the short-term <BR>

<P>budget savings.  The NPR needs to examine its strategy carefully <BR>

<P>to ensure it includes a focused attack on the high-risk programs.<BR>

<P>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>Learning <BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     One of the most remarkable features of the NPR is just how <BR>

<P>much positive activity it generated the first year.  And no part <BR>

<P>of that activity has been more remarkable than the inventiveness <BR>

<P>thousands of government employees across the country have shown in <BR>

<P>the reinvention labs.  The NPR has worked hard to gather success <BR>

<P>stories from these labs.  A series of new electronic networks has <BR>

<P>encouraged managers to share results, but the NPR's learning <BR>

<P>strategy is embryonic.  There has been little systematic effort to <BR>

<P>learn what the labs, or the broader reinvention movement, have to <BR>

<P>teach.10 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs Contract <BR>

<P>Service Center reinvention lab in Milwaukee teaches several <BR>

<P>important lessons.  Its staff has been working since 1992 to <BR>

<P>improve procurement for eight VA hospitals in three states.  One <BR>

<P>of the department's respiratory therapists noted that the VA was <BR>

<P>paying for full refills of home oxygen tanks even if the tanks <BR>

<P>were still half full.  In a new contract the lab negotiated, the <BR>

<P>VA specified that it would pay only for the oxygen actually used, <BR>

<P>and the department saved $100,000 per year.  Since its start, <BR>

<P>Milwaukee officials estimate that through this and similar reforms <BR>

<P>they have saved $1 million.11 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR argued that procurement decisions would work best by <BR>

<P>decentralizing decisions as much as possible, and indeed the <BR>

<P>Milwaukee lab works in part by decentralizing contract legal <BR>

<P>review and approval authority from Washington to the field.  <BR>

<P>However, the Milwaukee lab also centralized contract authority <BR>

<P>from the hospitals to a regional facility.  That allowed larger <BR>

<P>buys and, therefore, better economies of scale.  It allowed <BR>

<P>improved record keeping so that the office could better monitor <BR>

<P>the performance of contractors, and it allowed the office to <BR>

<P>assemble skilled employees to manage the technical side of the <BR>

<P>purchases.  The lab followed only part of the reinvention <BR>

<P>prescription, learned some new lessons, and has important lessons <BR>

<P>to teach.  The NPR, however, has devised no way to reach out, <BR>

<P>collect the information, digest it, and figure out how to sharpen <BR>

<P>the principles of reinvention.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Even though the NPR covered an enormous range of the federal <BR>

<P>government's activities, it nevertheless left several large and <BR>

<P>important gaps.  Some of the gaps involved potential for <BR>

<P>significant dollar losses that could swamp the cost savings the <BR>

<P>NPR promised.  Some involved the potential for politically <BR>

<P>undermining the reinvention movement.  And some undercut the <BR>

<P>movement's ability to learn from its own successes.  Plugging the <BR>

<P>gaps is critical to the NPR's long-term success.<BR>

<P>Conclusion<BR>

<P>*************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In just its first year, the NPR has confounded its critics.  <BR>

<P>It has accomplished far more than cynics suggested might be <BR>

<P>possible.  It has also launched, for the most part, a broad reform <BR>

<P>movement in the right direction.  If the NPR has not always had <BR>

<P>clear answers, it has been at least asking the right questions.  <BR>

<P>Nevertheless, and this is the NPR's critical problem, the short-<BR>

<P>term accommodations it inevitably needed to make to get the <BR>

<P>movement going have weakened the NPR's chances for long-term <BR>

<P>success.  It is now not a self-sustaining revolution, and <BR>

<P>considerable work needs to be done to move the invasion from a <BR>

<P>beachhead to a breakout, and then from a breakout to conquest.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Reinventing government centers on the intersection of the <BR>

<P>&quot;high politics&quot; of presidential-congressional struggles and the <BR>

<P>&quot;low politics&quot; of routine administration.1   The connections <BR>

<P>between policymaking and execution, what we often call <BR>

<P>&quot;governance&quot;   are indisputably fraying.  The question is where <BR>

<P>the problem lies: with good people trapped in a bad system, as the <BR>

<P>reinventers claim, or with a good system hamstrung by a failure of <BR>

<P>political leadership, as the movement's critics assert?  The <BR>

<P>critics contend that, in the mad rush of the Clinton <BR>

<P>administration's &quot;high politics&quot; ambitions, the reinventers have <BR>

<P>misunderstood the foundations on which democratic administration <BR>

<P>rests.  They argue that the reinventers have no theory but a set <BR>

<P>of unspoken assumptions which, if exposed, would reveal the <BR>

<P>movement as a threat to democratic governance.  The reinventers <BR>

<P>counter that it is the &quot;low politics&quot; of administrative routine <BR>

<P>that has handicapped governance in the United States, and that <BR>

<P>this routine must be transformed if government is to work better.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The most valuable contribution of the reinventers is their <BR>

<P>frank recognition that the top-down bureaucratic authority <BR>

<P>approach guiding American bureaucracy since the Progressive era no <BR>

<P>longer effectively steers public management.  The traditional <BR>

<P>approach is not obsolete; it can never be so long as the United <BR>

<P>States is a government of laws.  But it must be adapted to a new <BR>

<P>reality of shared responsibility for common purposes.  Boundary <BR>

<P>spanning coupled with customer service offer fresh insights to <BR>

<P>attacking new and inescapable administrative realities.  <BR>

<P>Traditional bureaucratic theorists face the challenge of fitting <BR>

<P>old notions of neat hierarchical control to an increasingly messy <BR>

<P>administrative state where bureaucratic boundaries are the <BR>

<P>beginning, not the end, of the management process.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The reinventing government movement, however, too quickly <BR>

<P>brushes away the internal inconsistencies within its own theory.  <BR>

<P>Three threads of the reinventing fabric   downsizing, <BR>

<P>reengineering, and continuous improvement   compete to define it.  <BR>

<P>There is, moreover, little consensus on what &quot;customers&quot; really <BR>

<P>means or how to serve them.  The movement also too easily dances <BR>

<P>across critical but unsolved issues.  Reinventing government <BR>

<P>depends on resolving difficult political and technical problems in <BR>

<P>performance management.  And, even if these are resolved, customer <BR>

<P>service, competition, and performance measurement combined can <BR>

<P>never really substitute for top-down accountability.  That leaves <BR>

<P>the reinventers with the difficult puzzle of adapting the valuable <BR>

<P>pieces of their own movement with the driving forces of <BR>

<P>constitutional bureaucracy.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The problem of reinventing government really revolves around <BR>

<P>these issues:  Just what do we expect government to do?  How can <BR>

<P>the bureaucratic power required to do the job well be held <BR>

<P>accountable to elected officials and, in the end, to the people?  <BR>

<P>In sorting through these problems, historian Garry Wills writes, <BR>

<P>&quot;We have been eating into our intellectual as well as our <BR>

<P>financial capital.&quot;2   We need to stop eating our seed corn and <BR>

<P>begin anew to build the capacity to solve these problems.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Neither the traditional administration theorists nor the <BR>

<P>reinventers have full answers to the problems. New administrative <BR>

<P>realities have overtaken traditional theory, while tough and often <BR>

<P>undiagnosed problems plague the reinventing movement.  <BR>

<P>Furthermore, their debate surfaces, in a new way, the ageless <BR>

<P>question of how to balance energy in the executive with checks on <BR>

<P>potential abuses of executive power.  If Hamilton, Madison, and <BR>

<P>their followers could not resolve them, there is little chance <BR>

<P>that either side will find an answer that sticks.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Nevertheless, even if reinventing government raises more <BR>

<P>questions than it answers, they are the right questions.  <BR>

<P>Furthermore, they are not questions likely to go away, for the <BR>

<P>administrative issues are fundamental and the political stakes are <BR>

<P>high.  One of the best-kept secrets of the NPR, in fact, was that <BR>

<P>many of its quickest successes emerged from initiatives begun in <BR>

<P>the Bush administration.  In fact, Republican efforts to redefine <BR>

<P>that party's soul have notable similarities with both Reinventing <BR>

<P>Government and the NPR.3   The genie is out of the bottle.  The <BR>

<P>struggle now is for who will control it.  The basic issues are <BR>

<P>both ageless and well understood.  The struggle revolves around <BR>

<P>which values, especially executive power and legislative control, <BR>

<P>will shape the administrative process.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     History teaches us two important lessons about that struggle.  <BR>

<P>It is unlikely to be resolved to everyone's satisfaction at any <BR>

<P>moment or to anyone's satisfaction over time.  On the other hand, <BR>

<P>periodic shifts   from the Progressive movement through the New <BR>

<P>Deal, from the Great Society through the Reagan administration's <BR>

<P>downsizing   have produced huge changes in both policymaking and <BR>

<P>implementation.  The reinventing government movement marks one of <BR>

<P>those important historical shifts in how we work out these <BR>

<P>questions.  It is neither the fad that its critics condemn nor the <BR>

<P>fountainhead of reform that its proponents contend.  It is, <BR>

<P>however, a fresh opportunity to rethink the system under which we <BR>

<P>govern ourselves: to update old ideas to fit new problems, to <BR>

<P>experiment with fresh policy solutions for enduring dilemmas, to <BR>

<P>rethink the government capacity required to solve problems, to <BR>

<P>inject new energy into the effort, and to reshape the social <BR>

<P>contract between civic responsibility and governmental power.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The NPR's strategy of launching a revolution without <BR>

<P>prescribing its form was a brilliant masterpiece.  It allowed a <BR>

<P>breakout from the dominant ideas: that the size of the federal <BR>

<P>government could not be reduced; and that federal bureaucrats were <BR>

<P>stuck in existing behavior and could not be moved.  The NPR <BR>

<P>produced enormous enthusiasm for change, especially because of its <BR>

<P>fuzziness.  By promising bureaucrats more power and citizens a <BR>

<P>smaller and more effective government, the NPR was able to gather <BR>

<P>many good ideas under the same broad tent.  Under the tent, <BR>

<P>however, the ideas of the revolution crowded uneasily with each <BR>

<P>other.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     In the short term, that was of little moment.  The NPR, in <BR>

<P>six very hectic months in the middle of 1993, produced an enormous <BR>

<P>contribution in jump-starting the bureaucracy.  In the long term, <BR>

<P>however, these problems threaten to be the NPR's undoing.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The single biggest problem with the NPR was that, while it <BR>

<P>had a strategy leading to the release of its report on September <BR>

<P>7, 1993, it had no strategy for September 8 and afterward.  The <BR>

<P>NPR staff played a cheerleader role, to coordinate a handful of <BR>

<P>crosscutting issues like procurement reform and customer service, <BR>

<P>and to leave the other management reforms to executives across the <BR>

<P>government.  What they did not do was to create an explicit <BR>

<P>strategy for linking the two revolutions, or for inducing cynical <BR>

<P>or busy executives to join in the small-politics battles.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     As a result, downsizing became the dominant theme and driving <BR>

<P>reality.  The tactics of reinvention had the strongest effect <BR>

<P>where they fit the preexisting strategies of managers, especially <BR>

<P>cabinet secretaries.  They had little effect where managers did <BR>

<P>not see their utility in reaching larger ends.  In those agencies, <BR>

<P>the NPR had little leverage and scant success in creating <BR>

<P>incentives to lure busy, reluctant or frightened executives into <BR>

<P>the revolution.  In fact, it is a misnomer to speak of the NPR.  <BR>

<P>&quot;The NPR&quot; was little more than the accumulation of individual <BR>

<P>actions by administrators throughout the federal government.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Any management reform, of course, has meaning only to the <BR>

<P>extent that managers throughout an agency adopt it.  With the NPR, <BR>

<P>however, the problem was that it developed no mechanism for <BR>

<P>converting the unwashed or the reluctant.  Many managers <BR>

<P>throughout government understandably replied that they had seen it <BR>

<P>all before.  Downsizing the federal bureaucracy only increased <BR>

<P>their cynicism.4   Many managers said that they saw little <BR>

<P>empowerment or reinvention, but they certainly felt the reality of <BR>

<P>a shrinking work force and the pressures of doing more work with <BR>

<P>less help.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Without now building a much stronger foundation, the NPR <BR>

<P>risks leaving behind a worse reality than the one from which it <BR>

<P>started.  Government could be smaller, but the number of layers <BR>

<P>and regulations could be little changed.  The quality of <BR>

<P>management could diminish even further.  Worse yet, having raised <BR>

<P>expectations to great levels, the pain that continued performance <BR>

<P>problems will surely produce could even further diminish public <BR>

<P>trust and confidence in government.  And, should that occur, even <BR>

<P>the victory of producing a smaller government will be Pyrrhic, for <BR>

<P>voters and government managers alike.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     This dismal picture need not occur.  In A Christmas Carol, <BR>

<P>Ebenezer Scrooge was given the gift of seeing the ghost of an <BR>

<P>unpleasant yule yet to come and the opportunity to prevent it from <BR>

<P>happening.  The NPR has the same opportunity.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Taking advantage of that opportunity has to begin with a <BR>

<P>revolution in thinking about federal management.  Every important <BR>

<P>federal management reform of the last generation has been <BR>

<P>derivative of innovations at either the state and local level, the <BR>

<P>private sector, or sometimes foreign governments.  Elected <BR>

<P>officials, seeking new leverage over the bureaucracy or fresh <BR>

<P>ideas with which to appeal to voters, have culled the &quot;greatest <BR>

<P>hits&quot; of other organizations.  In particular, they have tended to <BR>

<P>extract the most attractive little-politics ideas to promote big-<BR>

<P>politics aims.  They have adopted only broad themes without <BR>

<P>learning the music, so the songs never come out quite the way they <BR>

<P>were written.  They have taken music written for other ensembles <BR>

<P>and grafted it onto the federal government, which often has <BR>

<P>neither had the instruments to play it well nor the mission to <BR>

<P>perform that kind of music.  And by borrowing so heavily on music <BR>

<P>written elsewhere, they have undercut the federal government's own <BR>

<P>ability to fashion the tunes that fit its own orchestra best.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in the enthusiasm <BR>

<P>to downsize.  The federal government's downsizing movement derives <BR>

<P>heavily from private sector initiatives of the late 1980s and <BR>

<P>early 1990s.  It has the obvious additional appeal to voters who <BR>

<P>are convinced they receive little value from the federal <BR>

<P>government.  The private sector, however, is already beginning to <BR>

<P>learn painful lessons from its own downsizing experiences; the <BR>

<P>federal government is on the verge of stumbling into the <BR>

<P>movement's worse problems.  In analyzing private sector downsizing <BR>

<P>programs, management expert Peter Drucker argued forcefully, &quot;We <BR>

<P>are seeing way too many amputations before the diagnosis.&quot;5   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Research is now beginning to mount that the initial <BR>

<P>advantages of corporate downsizing have often produced higher <BR>

<P>long-run costs.6   Stressed workers burn out, leave, or remain <BR>

<P>with lower morale.  Large cuts in staff tend to &quot;penalize <BR>

<P>departments that are slim and reward those that are oversized,&quot; <BR>

<P>management analyst Eileen Applebaum concludes.  The biggest <BR>

<P>performance differences, in fact, appeared due more to the quality <BR>

<P>of management than strategic downsizing (or upsizing).7   Indeed, <BR>

<P>a study of 531 American corporations by the Wyatt Company revealed <BR>

<P>private sector downsizing rarely helped companies achieve the <BR>

<P>goals of higher profits and lower costs.  Moreover, employee <BR>

<P>morale and motivation among surviving employees suffered.  More <BR>

<P>successful efforts, on the other hand, began from a clear vision <BR>

<P>for the future coupled with a fundamental restructuring of the <BR>

<P>organization, from top managers to front-line employees.  In fact, <BR>

<P>the biggest private sector successes came when people came to see <BR>

<P>change as an ongoing process instead of a short-term event.8   <BR>

<P>These findings lead to five important lessons for the reinventing <BR>

<P>government movement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     1. Successful reinvention requires coupling the driving ideas <BR>

<P>of the movement to the federal government's mission.  Private <BR>

<P>management reforms teach an important but little understood <BR>

<P>lesson: reforms derived from some organizations and applied <BR>

<P>blindly to others typically create more mischief than success.  <BR>

<P>Any successful reform has to be tailored closely to the <BR>

<P>fundamental mission and management problems of the organization.  <BR>

<P>The NPR gathered together ideas about reform from any source it <BR>

<P>could find, and it used them to start the revolution.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Many of these ideas are disconnected from what the federal <BR>

<P>government does and how it does it, however, and they provide weak <BR>

<P>guidance to harried government managers.  For example, no one can <BR>

<P>quarrel with the customer service program's goal of making <BR>

<P>government services more responsive.  But as now framed, it is a <BR>

<P>weak guide for action.  Simply charging managers to develop <BR>

<P>customer service programs without thinking carefully about what <BR>

<P>that means in the federal system will surely mean painfully re-<BR>

<P>learning the most important lesson of private management reform: <BR>

<P>powerful ideas plucked out of context and grafted onto the wrong <BR>

<P>kind of stock will never take.9 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Making reinvention work requires creative thinking about how <BR>

<P>to do the federal government's work better.  Borrowing ideas from <BR>

<P>other organizations is a start but it is not enough.  The federal <BR>

<P>government cannot simply consume knowledge about management <BR>

<P>practice.  It must get far more strongly in the business of <BR>

<P>developing new knowledge.  Careful thinking about management must <BR>

<P>be encouraged throughout the bureaucracy.  More important, such <BR>

<P>thinking, powered by an in-depth understanding of what the federal <BR>

<P>bureaucracy is and what it does, must be the driving mission of <BR>

<P>high officials close to the president: in OMB, OPM, and the White <BR>

<P>House staff itself.  &quot;Too often we end up reengineering trains <BR>

<P>that don't connect,&quot; one observant state government official <BR>

<P>said.10 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     2. Successful reinvention requires linking the big-politics <BR>

<P>of downsizing with the small-politics of performance improvement.  <BR>

<P>The biggest temptation in reinventing government is to reach for <BR>

<P>quick success by embracing downsizing without doing the hard work <BR>

<P>of improving performance; or to seek performance improvement while <BR>

<P>resisting the powerful political movement driving a reduction in <BR>

<P>the size of government.  The single most important reality of <BR>

<P>American public management for the coming decade is the need to <BR>

<P>solve the inescapable paradox that the two movements present.  <BR>

<P>Big-politics downsizers will have to reckon with the fact that, <BR>

<P>without careful planning, they could dumbsize the federal <BR>

<P>government, worsen performance, and even further enrage voters.  <BR>

<P>Little-politics performance improvers will have to reckon with the <BR>

<P>fact that expectations will increase as resources shrink.  Unlike <BR>

<P>previous management reforms, the pressures that produced the <BR>

<P>reinventing movement show no sign of evaporating.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Making reinvention work requires a frank recognition that <BR>

<P>neither piece of reinvention can proceed without the other   and <BR>

<P>that, to date, the movement has been singularly unsuccessful in <BR>

<P>charting a course to do that.  The pieces sit uneasily next to <BR>

<P>each other within the NPR report, and in the agencies they have <BR>

<P>proceeded even more uneasily.  The continued work of reinventing <BR>

<P>government requires a frank recognition among all parties about <BR>

<P>the tensions that its principal elements create, that the tensions <BR>

<P>cannot be escaped, and that charting a course through them will <BR>

<P>challenge the very best of our public managers.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The missing link in the NPR's effort to bridge the gap is <BR>

<P>attention to the number, position, and role of political <BR>

<P>appointees.  It is inconceivable that government could be <BR>

<P>invented, that managers could be empowered, that programs could <BR>

<P>achieve results, if the political appointees who direct government <BR>

<P>agencies are not part of the plan.  It is also inconceivable that <BR>

<P>the number of layers could be reduced without dealing with what <BR>

<P>Paul Light has perceptively described as the &quot;thickening&quot; <BR>

<P>problem.11   Nowhere in government is the layering problem worse <BR>

<P>than at the top, in the rarefied atmosphere inhabited by political <BR>

<P>appointees.  Careful attention to their role has to be part of any <BR>

<P>real effort to reinvent government.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     3. Successful reinvention requires developing a language for <BR>

<P>talking about it.  Just as the reinventers have not yet reconciled <BR>

<P>the conflicting elements driving their reforms, they have not yet <BR>

<P>discovered an effective way of talking about their work.  Part of <BR>

<P>the problem came from short-term tactics to appeal to the public <BR>

<P>through the mass media.  The vice president broke ash trays and <BR>

<P>laughed about rules preventing buying floor wax off the shelf.  <BR>

<P>Indeed, these symbols represented deep-seated problems that had to <BR>

<P>be solved, and they did attract media attention to the typically <BR>

<P>dull problems of public management.  However, these symbols <BR>

<P>celebrated the revolution without encouraging government workers <BR>

<P>to join in.  Here, yet again, were public officials making fun of <BR>

<P>their best efforts to negotiate through an unforgiving system; in <BR>

<P>most cases, they did not make up such nonsensical rules for their <BR>

<P>own amusement but wrote them to fit the dictates of Congress and <BR>

<P>political appointees.  The effort to build public support often <BR>

<P>undercut the NPR's ability to recruit government workers to the <BR>

<P>movement.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Making reinvention work requires reinventing the media and <BR>

<P>citizenship.  As leaders, government officials have a <BR>

<P>responsibility to educate and shape public discourse instead of <BR>

<P>simply feeding its worst preconceptions.  Many of the most <BR>

<P>publicized symbols of the NPR, like the ash trays and piles of <BR>

<P>regulations, have outlived their usefulness.  NPR officials now <BR>

<P>need to develop a second generation of symbols to communicate what <BR>

<P>the work of reinvention requires and what it produces.  Counting <BR>

<P>the number of executive orders issued or the number of NPR <BR>

<P>recommendations on which work has started will simply not be <BR>

<P>enough.  Reinventing government depends on building a new <BR>

<P>partnership between elected officials and the government's <BR>

<P>managers, and between government and its citizens.  The new <BR>

<P>symbols will have to communicate the shared responsibility that <BR>

<P>these partnerships require.  The Clinton administration has made <BR>

<P>an important start, in initiatives like food stamp &quot;smart cards&quot; <BR>

<P>and effective disaster relief for California earthquake victims, <BR>

<P>but the broader message has not yet begun to sink through.  If the <BR>

<P>administration allows its new initiatives to be judged on the <BR>

<P>terms of past failures, the reinventing government movement will <BR>

<P>surely wither.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     4. Successful reinvention requires reinventing the job of <BR>

<P>federal managers, especially in government's middle.  The most <BR>

<P>important, if the most quiet, failure of the early months of the <BR>

<P>NPR's implementation of its report was the widespread alienation <BR>

<P>of middle managers from the movement.  The downsizing galloped far <BR>

<P>ahead of the strategy that was to drive it, and the spread of the <BR>

<P>NPR's empowerment initiatives proved wildly uneven.  Their <BR>

<P>reaction was scarcely surprising; they heard the talk about new <BR>

<P>partnerships but saw the overriding reality of personnel cuts <BR>

<P>amidst rising expectations.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     To a degree that many cabinet secretaries, let alone top <BR>

<P>White House and congressional officials, fail to realize, middle <BR>

<P>managers shape the work of government.  Top officials can make <BR>

<P>policy and set priorities, but those priorities take hold only if <BR>

<P>the managers responsible for meeting them produce results.  It is <BR>

<P>quite another thing to build partnerships with union officials and <BR>

<P>pass out permission slips to lower-level workers, but the <BR>

<P>partnerships and permission slips will work only if supervisors <BR>

<P>create an environment that promotes them.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The reinvention movement must far more effectively connect <BR>

<P>its stirring rhetoric with its strategic and tactical planning.  <BR>

<P>Managers on the front lines have come away from meetings with some <BR>

<P>NPR officials convinced that they simply did not understand what <BR>

<P>managers in the field had to do to make programs work.12   NPR <BR>

<P>officials could reshape their rhetorical flourishes and better <BR>

<P>connect with the mangers they are trying to motivate if they moved <BR>

<P>their headquarters out of Washington, or at least established an <BR>

<P>important field office beyond the Beltway, where the real work of <BR>

<P>reinvention is happening.  &quot;The NPR is as isolated as any other <BR>

<P>government agency,&quot; one government official said.13 <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     More important, if the reinventers are serious, they must <BR>

<P>move from the bold rhetoric to the hard work of changing the <BR>

<P>systems.  Unless they do, federal managers will be left with new <BR>

<P>demands, a smaller work force, obsolete management systems, higher <BR>

<P>expectations, and lower morale.  Foremost is the need to reshape <BR>

<P>the personnel system: to produce new job categories that reflect <BR>

<P>what future managers will have to do and to create the incentives <BR>

<P>for attracting the best people to do them; to allow managers more <BR>

<P>flexibility in deploying and rewarding their staffs; to allow <BR>

<P>managers greater versatility in matching the personnel system to <BR>

<P>the needs of their agencies; and to allow supervisors greater <BR>

<P>authority to hire the best, fire the worst, and reward the most <BR>

<P>hard working employees.  Civil service reform was a constant <BR>

<P>subtext of the NPR report, but it since has slipped into a black <BR>

<P>hole of inaction.  Without fundamental reform of the civil <BR>

<P>service, the federal government will never be able to match its <BR>

<P>employees with the new jobs they must do or to attract the best <BR>

<P>employees to do those jobs.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     5. Successful reinvention requires creating the glue to bind <BR>

<P>the movement together.  The NPR has operated under the assumption <BR>

<P>that, once launched, the movement would become self-directed.  <BR>

<P>Federal managers, newly empowered, would exert their energy to <BR>

<P>manage more effectively.  The history of management reform, <BR>

<P>however, demonstrates that managers are rightly skeptical of big <BR>

<P>changes introduced in their interest.  Faced with a choice of <BR>

<P>taking large risks toward uncertain ends or riding out the storm <BR>

<P>in an admittedly leaky boat, many managers choose to take the <BR>

<P>conservative course.  On the other hand, some managers who take <BR>

<P>bold steps will surely walk in a direction different from the one <BR>

<P>that either their supervisors or members of Congress will support.  <BR>

<P>Reining in the overeager or misdirected, without eliminating <BR>

<P>incentives for bold action, is a huge challenge for the movement.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     OMB's reorganization, to support its more fundamental look at <BR>

<P>larger performance issues, is an important source of glue to hold <BR>

<P>the movement together and focus its attention more sharply.  To <BR>

<P>the degree to which OMB can combine budgetary and management <BR>

<P>perspectives, input measures with outcome results, short-term <BR>

<P>budget marks with long-term performance, it will fundamentally <BR>

<P>alter the discourse about what matters in the federal government.  <BR>

<P>The task is a large one, but to a degree that even NPR officials <BR>

<P>might not appreciate, the OMB effort is central to gluing together <BR>

<P>the two revolutions of reinvention. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Holding the revolution together ultimately will depend on how <BR>

<P>Congress reacts to it.  The single biggest omission in the NPR was <BR>

<P>a strategy for dealing with Congress.  The report seemed to <BR>

<P>suggest that its logic would be irresistible to members of <BR>

<P>Congress; that public support for its recommendations would make <BR>

<P>it impossible for members of Congress to disagree; or that the big <BR>

<P>picture supplied by the reinventing government movement would help <BR>

<P>Congress escape more parochial perspectives.  The first months of <BR>

<P>the NPR proved the folly of an implementation strategy that did <BR>

<P>not include Congress.  The struggles over the buyout bill, <BR>

<P>followed by House rejection of downsizing within VA hospitals and <BR>

<P>opposition to privatization of the air traffic control system, <BR>

<P>demonstrated that congressional support (or at least the absence <BR>

<P>of strong opposition) is critical to everything the NPR wants to <BR>

<P>accomplish.  For a movement founded on building partnerships, the <BR>

<P>absence of a strategy for building a partnership with Congress was <BR>

<P>surprising.  Success in the NPR will surely require quick <BR>

<P>attention to constructing that partnership.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Even more fundamentally, achieving the NPR's promise will <BR>

<P>require more clearly linking the question of what government ought <BR>

<P>to do and how government ought to do it.  The NPR, in the report's <BR>

<P>own words, &quot;focused primarily on how government should work, not <BR>

<P>on what it should do.&quot;14   The burden of a century of public <BR>

<P>management research, however, is that the distinction is <BR>

<P>artificial: the how powerfully shapes the what because means <BR>

<P>embody ends; and, from the beginning, the how has to be driven by <BR>

<P>the what.15   <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     To a greater degree than even political noncombatants stop to <BR>

<P>recognize, and certainly far more than government officials ever <BR>

<P>acknowledge, many public performance problems are often the <BR>

<P>product of what government sets out to do.  Government in fact <BR>

<P>does many things very well, from delivering social security checks <BR>

<P>to providing weather satellite maps.  Often, when things work <BR>

<P>badly, it is because it tries to do things that are very hard or <BR>

<P>impossible, like preventing drug abuse, training unemployed <BR>

<P>workers, cleaning up toxic waste, or providing welfare without <BR>

<P>creating dependence.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     Improving performance on one level requires focusing <BR>

<P>government most clearly on the things it does well and figuring <BR>

<P>out how to do them better.  However, we (and this includes the <BR>

<P>NPR, policymakers, and Americans in general) have not thought <BR>

<P>clearly about what those things are.  On another level, if we seek <BR>

<P>to do things that are hard to do well, we must be frank about the <BR>

<P>degree of difficulty and focus sharply on how to do the impossible <BR>

<P>better.  Many of the most basic questions to which the NPR has <BR>

<P>addressed itself revolve around such issues.  If we choose to <BR>

<P>attack these problems at a superficial level, by focusing on the <BR>

<P>number of bureaucrats that can be eliminated or the dollars that <BR>

<P>can be saved, we will both miss the real issues and even further <BR>

<P>undercut government's ability to perform well.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>     The National Performance Review accomplished, in just its <BR>

<P>first year, far more than anyone thought possible.  It energized <BR>

<P>employees, it attracted citizens, it drew media attention to <BR>

<P>government management, and it made the point that management <BR>

<P>matters.  In the blush of success, however, the NPR failed to <BR>

<P>build the foundation for success in the long haul.  It borrowed <BR>

<P>bits and pieces of management reform from both the public and <BR>

<P>private sectors and pasted them together in a patchwork that, <BR>

<P>while initially attractive, could not hold together.  In the <BR>

<P>process, the NPR missed the most important lesson that other <BR>

<P>successful reforms teach: in the long run, management, matched to <BR>

<P>mission, matters most.  The movement launched in September 1993, <BR>

<P>however promising, was not self- sustaining.  Making it stick <BR>

<P>requires hard work on tough questions   work that, for the most <BR>

<P>part, has not begun.<BR>

<P>
<P>1 &quot;National Performance Review&quot; has taken on three different <BR>

<P>meanings: the six-month survey of federal management, conducted by <BR>

<P>hundreds of federal managers during the middle of 1993; the report <BR>

<P>that survey produced, From Red Tape to Results: Creating a <BR>

<P>Government That Works Better and Costs Less (Report of the <BR>

<P>National Performance Review, September 7, 1993); and the effort <BR>

<P>that followed to put the report's recommendations into effect.  I <BR>

<P>will follow the convention and use &quot;NPR&quot; to refer to all of these <BR>

<P>pieces of the NPR.  The meaning will be clear from the context.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>2 Before the waivers, OMB required that all government forms, <BR>

<P>including surveys, be cleared prior to use.  The result frequently <BR>

<P>was a months-long delay before surveys could be used, which <BR>

<P>prevented government officials from gaining timely information <BR>

<P>about citizens' views.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>3 At the time this report was written, Senate and House conferees <BR>

<P>were meeting to reconcile different versions of the legislation.<BR>

<P>6 According to the NPR's electronic network, &quot;A Reinvention Lab is <BR>

<P>a place that cuts through `red tape,' exceeds customer <BR>

<P>expectations, and unleashes innovations for improvement from its <BR>

<P>employees.  Depending on the priorities of an agency, a lab may <BR>

<P>focus upon programs, processes, administrative structures, or a <BR>

<P>combination of all three.  A lab provides a focus for reinvention <BR>

<P>efforts, diminishes the fear of failure that accompanies risk, and <BR>

<P>provides opportunities to highlight the successes of reinvention <BR>

<P>and to recognize the people responsible for those successes.&quot;<BR>

<P>5 The work force reduction calculations were complex.  When he <BR>

<P>first took office, Bill Clinton promised to reduce federal <BR>

<P>civilian employment by 100,000 workers.  The NPR increased the <BR>

<P>number by 152,000, for a total of 252,000, and used the number of <BR>

<P>employees at the beginning of fiscal year 1993 as the baseline.  <BR>

<P>When Congress acted in March 1994 on the bill to make the <BR>

<P>reductions possible, it used the actual fiscal year 1993 <BR>

<P>employment level, which produced a baseline 20,900 higher than the <BR>

<P>NPR figure.  That resulted in a target for the downsizing of <BR>

<P>272,900 employees.<BR>

<P>About the Brookings Center for Public Management<BR>

<P>****************************************************************<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Brookings Institution's new Center for Public Management was <BR>

<P>founded in January 1994.  The advisory council to the Center is <BR>

<P>chaired by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve <BR>

<P>System, and former chairman of the National Commission on the <BR>

<P>Public Service.  The Center is led by John J. DiIulio, Jr., <BR>

<P>Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, <BR>

<P>and Nonresident Senior Fellow at Brookings.  The Center is part of <BR>

<P>the Brookings Governmental Studies program.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>The Center is dedicated to improving the public service and the <BR>

<P>processes by which democratically-enacted public policies are <BR>

<P>implemented.  The Center supports three main sets of activities:  <BR>

<P>(1) the design, execution, and timely publication of public <BR>

<P>management research on cutting-edge problems of federal, state, <BR>

<P>and local governance; (2) civic education and outreach efforts <BR>

<P>(symposia, reports, awards, op-eds) intended to keep policymakers, <BR>

<P>public administrators, journalists, and others informed about the <BR>

<P>crucial public management dimensions of public policy and <BR>

<P>governance; and (3) leadership and management training programs <BR>

<P>for selected government executives and managers. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>In July 1993, Brookings published Improving Government <BR>

<P>Performance:  An Owner's Manual, the first major independent <BR>

<P>analysis of the Clinton administration's &quot;reinventing government&quot; <BR>

<P>initiative, the National Performance Review.  Last January <BR>

<P>Brookings released Deregulating the Public Service:  Can <BR>

<P>Government Be Improved?, a critical study of the key assumptions <BR>

<P>behind many federal, state, and local bureaucracy reform <BR>

<P>initiatives.  Several other volumes are forthcoming this year from <BR>

<P>the new Brookings center, including Making Health Reform Work:  A <BR>

<P>View From the States and Inside the Reinvention Machine:  <BR>

<P>Appraising Governmental Reform.  Other Center projects include an <BR>

<P>analysis of the administrative consequences of divided party <BR>

<P>government, a study of public sector performance measurement and <BR>

<P>budgeting, and an effort to assist the federal government in <BR>

<P>administering the community policing provisions of the pending <BR>

<P>crime bill.  The Center's core leadership and staff are: <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Leadership:  Paul Volcker, Former Chairman, Board of Governors, <BR>

<P>Federal Reserve System; Thomas E. Mann, Director, Governmental <BR>

<P>Studies, The Brookings Institution; John J. DiIulio, Jr., <BR>

<P>Professor of Politics and Public Affairs, Princeton University, <BR>

<P>Director, Brookings Center for Public Management; Donald F. Kettl, <BR>

<P>Professor, La Follette Institute of Public Affairs, University of <BR>

<P>Wisconsin - Madison, Visiting Fellow, Brookings Institution; <BR>

<P>Gerald J. Garvey, Professor of Politics, Princeton University; <BR>

<P>Christopher H. Foreman, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution; and <BR>

<P>Constance Horner, Former Director, Federal Office of Personnel <BR>

<P>Management, Guest Scholar, Brookings Institution.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Staff:  Carey Macdonald, Brookings Institution; and Cindy Terrels, <BR>

<P>Brookings Institution.<BR>

<H1>Vice President Gore's Hammer Award</H1>
<P>
<P><B>Background</B> (updated 10/16/96<BR>

<P>The Hammer Award is Vice President Al Gore's special recognition to teams of federal employees (not individuals) who have made significant contributions in support of the President's National Performance Review (NPR) principles. Those principles are:<BR>

<P>-	putting customers first<BR>

<P>-	cutting red tape<BR>

<P>-	empowering employees,  and<BR>

<P>-	getting back to basics.<BR>

<P>The Hammer Award is the Vice President's answer to yesterday's government and its &#036;400 hammer. Fittingly, the award consists of a &#036;6.00 hammer, a ribbon, and a note from Vice President Gore, all in an aluminum frame. The award recognizes new standards of excellence achieved by teams helping to reinvent government. About 600 Hammer Awards have been presented to teams comprised of federal employees, state and local employees, and citizens who are working to build a better government.<BR>

<P><B>How to Nominate Teams</B><BR>

<P>The Vice President is always looking to celebrate the accomplishments of teams demonstrating extraordinary effort towards implementing the goals of the NPR. Accordingly, there is no limited, annual window of opportunity for nominations imposed by the NPR. NPR encourages nominations throughout the year. The nomination form is below.<BR>

<P>You may nominate your federal team for a Hammer Award.  Here's how:<BR>

<P>-	Send your nomination to your department or agency's  liaison to the NPR. Your department or agency will send the nomination to us.<BR>

<P>-	Send your nomination to the Federal Executive Board or Federal Executive Association in your geographic area. Follow their processes and schedules. These groups submit nominations to NPR and we send copies to the agency liaisons.<BR>

<P>The internal procedures used by the departments and the FEB/FEAs vary with the policies and practices developed by each. Some departments issue nationwide requests for nominations that are then reviewed by the agency liaison and others at the departmental level. FEB/FEA's have integrated nominations for Hammer Awards with their local annual award programs, including Public Service Recognition Week awards.<BR>

<P>-	Send your nomination directly to NPR. Although we encourage you to start with your agency or department, we will accept your nomination and forward it to the agency liaison. You may send your nomination by fax or Internet e-mail. See below.<BR>

<P>If you are with a State or local government, a private sector company, or another organization, you may also nominate federal teams and agencies with whom you are in partnership. <BR>

<P><B>Who Decides?</B><BR>
While each organization may structure the nomination and review process as it deems fit, the final approval of all Hammer Awards is made by the NPR staff, taking into account any comments and recommendations from the agency.<BR>

<P><B>Award Ceremonies</B><BR>
If your team is selected for a Hammer Award, your agency will  sponsor an award ceremony. Presentations are made by Vice President Gore or people who represent him. These representatives can be the head of your federal organization, an NPR staff member, or others. At these ceremonies, the team receives the Hammer Award plaque. Individual team members receive a certificate signed by the Vice President and a Hammer lapel pin.<BR>

<P><B>Tell Everybody</B><BR>
If your team wins, let the whole world know. Work with your newsletter editors (print and electronic) in advance so they can tell your coworkers. Work with your public affairs office to notify the media and outside organizations. Put your story on your agency's Web home page.<BR>

<P><B>For More Information</B><BR>

<P>If you have any questions, please call your agency liaison (see partial list below), FEB or FEA. You may also contact the NPR. Contact  Jerry Nikolaus at (202) 632-0391 or Denise Clyburn at (202) 632-0181. Their e-mail addresses are: <I>jerry.nikolaus@npr.gsa.gov</I> and <I>denise.clyburn@npr.gsa.gov</I>. NPR's fax number is (202) 632-0390.<BR>

<P>What has this group done that makes them truly outstanding?  We are looking for those federal employees who have done extraordinary things to help build a government that costs less and works better.  Please add any additional comments that you feel will support this nomination.  <BR>

<P>Please provide a short, one page, plain English narrative that would tell any taxpayer why your reinvention is a success.

<H2>Three Innovative Federal Programs Win &#036;100,000 Prize</H2>
	Three federal programs were among ten government programs that received a 1996 Innovations in American Government Award and &#036;100,000 from the Ford Foundation in a ceremony in Washington, DC on December 3. 
<P>
	In presenting the awards, Vice President Gore reached out to "every government manager--every government worker, everywhere."  He said, "Make it your job to reinvent government." (Full speech will be on NPR's Web site at http://www.npr.gov as soon as the transcript is available. Click on "News Room.") The federal winners are:
<UL>
	<LI><B>Consolidated Planning/Community Connections/Department of Housing and Urban Development</B>--facilitates citizen participation in community development planning and replaces cumbersome reporting requirements. More than 1,000 pages of paperwork were eliminated for participating communities. Contact Karen Hinton at (202) 708-2690.

<LI>	<B>No Sweat: Eradicating Sweatshops/Department of Labor</B>--helps prevent the exploitation of workers in the garment industry. It  enlists the voluntary cooperation of industry leaders, maximizes the Department's enforcement efforts, and raises public awareness. The program has collected &#036;8.4 million in back wages over the past three years. Call Suzanne Seiden at (202) 219-8305.

<LI>	<B>Consequence Assessment Tool  Set  (CATS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency</B>--uses computer modeling system adapted from cold war defense research. It predicts damage and speeds the delivery of emergency aid to areas devastated by disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes by giving managers more timely and relevant data. Contact Mr. Adrian Linz at (202) 646-3349 or e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:alinz@fema.gov">alinz@fema.gov.</A>
</UL>
	Selected from more than 1,550 applicants, the winning programs exemplify new models of government working effectively to provide innovative solutions to pressing social and economic problems. The solutions save money, streamline, services, help underserved populations, find novel uses for new technologies, or overcome bureaucratic gridlock. The program is sponsored by the Ford Foundation and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
<P>
	Four other federal programs were among the finalists that received &#036;20,000. The programs are Disability Services Team/Social Security Administration, Evaluating Oral Proposals in Major Government Procurements/Transportation, Federal Direct Student Loan Program/ Education, and U.S. Export Assistance Centers/Commerce.
<P>
	The deadline for 1997 applications  is January 8, 1997.  Call (617) 495-0558.

<H2>Blue Pages Reinvention Effort Gets Hammer Award</H2>
	More than 200 federal employees representing 25 agencies received the Vice President's Hammer Award on November 15 for their work in the first phase of a three-year project led by the General Services Administration to make government blue pages listings more customer friendly. Today, most listings read like an agency's organization chart--with names of offices, not services. Within the next few months, 18 million households in 10 cities will see improved blue pages when new phone books hit their doorsteps, according to Dave Barram, GSA's Acting Administrator. This project is a "true partnership within the government and with all the major telephone companies across the country," said NPR's Greg Woods, who represented the Vice President at the ceremony.
<P>
	<B>GSA is looking for additional federal volunteers to work with about 30 companies that publish 6,200 phone directories over the nation.</B> Contact Jack Finley at (202) 501-3932, e-mail:<A HREF="mailto:jack.finley@fed.gov"> jack.finley@fed.gov</A> or Bonnie Seybold at (202) 273-3440, e-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:Bonnie.Seybold@fed.gov">Bonnie.Seybold@fed.gov.</A>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <P>

<H3>Vice President Gore Reveals The Best Kept Secrets in Government</H3>
	Vice President Gore presented his annual report on the National Performance Review--<I>The Best Kept Secrets in Government-</I>-to the President on September 20 in Portland, Oregon.
<P>
	Many people have heard about government getting cheaper and smaller, the Vice President said in the book's introduction, but they haven't heard that government is getting better. "It's time for these secrets to get out."
<P>
	"This book the Vice President gives me today," the President said, "is a book that Americans ought to be interested in. It says we're bringing common sense to government."
<P>
	The book features real people--a front-line federal worker, a homemaker, a business executive, and a mayor. Their stories show that government culture is changing for the better, although there are still many things that need to be improved. The book highlights internal reforms (such as procurement), customer service, and partnerships with business and communities. The book includes appendices rich with facts and figures about savings, NPR recommendations, reinvention initiatives, and downsizing. 
<P>
	Oregon was selected as the site for the presentation because of that state's pioneering efforts to forge a new approach to federal-state-local partnerships.
<P>
<H3>Reinvention Highlights</H3>
	The book reports the smallest workforce in 30 years, with savings of &#036;118 billion from reinvention activities. Here's a sampling of what federal workers and their agencies are doing:
<UL>
<LI>	Agriculture dropped 3 million pages of government forms.
<LI>	Commerce eliminated requirements for prior approval on over &#036;32 billion worth of exports, and has completed the first comprehensive rewrite of Bureau of Export Administration regulations in 45 years.
<LI>	Defense will replace 27 payroll systems with one by 1997.
<LI>	Education eliminated 93 percent of its regulations. The Goals 2000 and School to Work Opportunities Act have no regulations at all.
<LI>	Energy reinvented internal management practices and initiated cost-cutting measures to save &#036;1.7 billion.
<LI>	Federal Emergency Management Agency cut in half the time it takes for assistance to reach disaster victims.
<LI>	General Services Administration reduced its workforce by 28 percent and cut its operating costs by 21 percent.
	
</UL>

	Sorry, we're running out of space. You'll find many more examples in the book. The Best Kept Secrets in Government is on 
NPR's reinvented home page at http://www.npr.gov. Look under "Latest Additions"  or the "Library." You may buy the book from the Government Printing Office (Stock # 040-000-00676-1). Random House has published a version (without the appendices) that will be in book stores soon. 
<P>
<H3>It's the Law:  Start Reengineering Your Agency's Travel Process</H3>
	President Clinton signed 1997 Defense Authorization legislation on September 23. It contains provisions for the biggest change in government travel rules in 40 years, and was passed with strong bipartisan support in the Congress.
<P>
	The new law finally fixes the underlying legislative problems so that all agencies can reinvent their travel systems, one of NPR's initial recommendations. Implementation will save taxpayers hundreds of  millions a year while improving government travel services. It does this by adopting the best travel practices in the private sector. The law:
<UL>
<LI>	Repeals the 1939 Telephone Act, which requires that all long-distance telephone calls be certified by supervisors as being in the interest of the government.
<LI>	Eliminates senseless red tape for employees who are required to transfer to another location.
</UL>
	
A House version of the bill required agencies to use a corporate credit card for travel expenses. Although that provision did not make the cut in conference, committee members thought the card was a good idea. The conference report urges agencies, when appropriate, to use their discretionary authority  to "maximize the use of the travel charge card."
<P>
	Over the years, the General Accounting Office has highlighted the excessive cost of the government's travel system. Last year it pointed out that, while the Defense Department spent about &#036;5 billion on its travel, it spent an additional 30 percent just to administer the system. Well-run travel systems in the private sector cost about six percent to administer.
<P>
	Government reinventors do not have to look to the private sector for a model. In 1995, the National Security Agency's travel management operation, a reinvention lab, was selected by Business Travel News, the newspaper of the travel industry, as one of the four best in the country. NSA is right up there with Hewlett-Packard, Bankers Trust, and Texas Instruments. NSA's new process, including software under development, can be used by other agencies. Call Chip Mahan at (301) 688-3023.
<P>
 	A task force of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, a government-wide reinvention activity,  developed the new legislation and implementing regulations. Call (202) 512-9201 for the name of a task force member who can discuss the travel provisions. Call (202) 512-6000 to get a copy of the JFMIP report, Improving Travel Management Governmentwide. 
<P>
	The report is also on the World Wide Web. See FinanceNet (http://www.financenet.gov). The direct URL is gopher://pula.financenet.gov:70/00/docs/central/jfmip/travel.rpt.gop.gop.  You may also use Gopher. To get a menu, use this address: gopher: //gopher.financenet.gov.

<H1>GSA Unleashes Leases: Agencies Can</H1>
<P>
<H1>Lease Property Starting in October</H1>
<P>     Effective October 14, the General Services Administration will offer federal agencies the option of leasing office space. At the same time, GSA is overhauling its own practices to offer faster, better and cheaper leasing services.<BR>
     The new program is &quot;Can't Beat GSA Leasing.&quot; <B>Agencies will have the option of leasing on their own, or using GSA's new competitive program.</B> GSA has been the government's sole agent for leasing private office space since its establishment in 1949. Acting Administrator Dave Barram and Robert Peck, Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, announced the new policy at a meeting of GSA's more than 700 leasing staff in Chicago on July 9-11. <BR>
     The agency's action in opening itself to competition follows through on a recommendation of the Vice President's National Performance Review in 1993. Peck said that GSA staff are energized at the prospect of competing. They believe that when agencies are given the choice, most will find,&quot;You can't beat GSA.&quot; The new program builds on lessons learned in a number of GSA Reinvention Labs.  These practices, Peck said, have already saved government more than $300 million. Later this year, GSA's leasing agents will also begin switching to real estate software proven in the corporate world.<BR>
     For more information, contact Johanna Roark at (202) 501-0977 or email: <I>johanna.roark@gsa.gov</I>.<BR>

<P>
<H2>President Issues Executive Order: Agencies Will Coordinate</H2>
<P>
<H2>Across Government on Information Technology</H2>
<P>     President Clinton on July 16 signed Executive Order 13011 on Federal Information Technology. The order expands on the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 that goes into effect on August 8.<BR>
     Big changes are afoot when it comes to buying and using IT. <B>The Act permits federal agencies to buy their own computers and computer systems, replacing the centralized responsibility of the General Services Administration.</B> <B>The President's order calls on agencies to shift their focus from the technology itself to what technology can help agencies accomplish</B>. Agencies should buy technology that will help them meet their strategic missions and perform better.<BR>
     The new law creates a new, visible position in each agency, the chief information officer, instead of a previous information resources official. These CIOs have a big job. The government spends $25 billion annually on information technology. The President's order establishes a CIO Council as a forum for agency CIOs to share ideas, learn from each other and make recommendations for all of government.<BR>
     The President directs managers to buy IT in smaller chunks when it's practical. These  can be built and tested more quickly than the mammoth systems of yesterday that took forever to buy and were out of date before they ever got installed. The order also sets up a Government Information Technology Services Board that will include some outside experts. This board will see that NPR's IT recommendations continue to happen. <BR>
     The executive order is on NPR's home page at <I>http://www.npr.gov</I>. Go to &quot;Library.&quot; For more information, after Aug. 14 contact Jasmeet Seehra at <I>seehra_j@a1.eop.gov</I> or (202) 395-3123.<BR>

<P>
<H2>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious</H2>
<P>
<H2>Diseases Tests Paperless Grant Making</H2>
<P>     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is testing a paperless, Internet-based, peer review process for certain research grants. It allows reviewers' confidential critiques and scores to be pasted onto a secure screen. Critiques are shielded until all are in the system. At that time, the shield is lowered and reviewers can see the scores and critiques for all applications. (When an organization uses the Internet to do internal processes, it's called an &quot;intranet.&quot; See <I>Reinvention Express</I>, July 12, 1996, Vol. 2, No. 18.)<BR>
     The RFP (request for proposals) is also going on the Internet, according to Dr. John McGowan, director of the Division of Extramural Activities. &quot;Proposals will be submitted and reviewed via the Internet, and the contract award will be made electronically. Nothing will be done on paper, except the contract signing, a legal requirement,&quot; he said.<BR>
     NIAID also communicates with the research community through <I>NIAID Council News</I> on its Internet home page (<I>http://www.niaid.nih.gov</I>).  It tells potential grantees how much money the Institute has, where it would like to spend it, and who makes the funding decisions. It used to be a paper newsletter. On the Internet it can be immediately updated.<BR>
     These online activities are a part of the agency's reinvention activities--all aimed at speeding up grant awards. For example, there used to be a 3-4 month delay between the arrival of grant applications and a meeting of its Advisory Council, which makes funding decisions. No more. &quot;We realized you don't need a council meeting to do a council review,&quot; McGowan said. Council members do their reviews electronically. By next year, Council sessions will be paperless, saving at least $100,000.<BR>
     For more information, contact Dr. McGowan at (301) 496-7291 or email:<BR>
 J<I>MCGOWAN@mercury.niaid.nih.gov</I>.<BR>

<P>Read Carefully: We're Talking InTRAnet<BR>

<P>     Already, corporations are reaping huge benefits from using &quot;intranets&quot; in their organizations. Government agencies can, too.<BR>

<P>     What's an intranet?  It's Internet technology used within an organization to connect employees. Employees use Internet software applications to get information and to do whatever the organization wants done internally. These online, often interactive, applications include business information to employees, employee suggestion programs, employee surveys, vacancy announcements, company policies, rules and operating procedures, internal forms, administrative processes (like submitting and processing travel vouchers online), collaborative research and development workspace, and forums. The possibilities are endless. Because these software applications are intended for internal use, the company can make its intranet inaccessible to the outside.<BR>

<P>     If a company policy changes, every employee connected to the Internet can know as soon as the policy goes online, whether company employees are in one building, one state, one country, or anywhere on the planet.  With an intranet application, nobody has to wait around for a memo, manual, or CD-ROM to be mass produced and distributed. (Just think, 10, 000 employees in 100 locations would have the policy change at the same time.)  And, if the organization wants to let the whole wide world know the new policy or procedure, it can do so cheaply and easily. That's what FedEx did when it moved its online intranet package tracking system to its World Wide Web address on the Internet. Now its customers use it, too.<BR>

<P>     Organizations are finding that intranets can reduce operational and production costs, cut paperwork, speed up processing time for administrative services, and improve internal communications. Intranets are so hot that some experts say there will soon be five times as many intranet sites as Internet sites.<BR>

<P><B>GSA Is an Intranet Pioneer in Government</B><BR>
     In late March, the General Services Administration's new Business Technology Council decided to give all employees access to the Internet by June--and they did. That opened the door for the InSite Project--GSA's version of intranet--and the applications are growing rapidly, according to Project Director Don Heffernan.<BR>

<P>     GSA had the enthusiastic endorsement of its Administrator, David Barram, so it could move out in a big way. GSA also had a substantial nationwide communications system in place, but your agency could rely on the already existing Internet. In fact, a more typical starting approach may be an intranet serving a local or regional office, Don said. Contact Don Heffernan at (202) 208-1534 or email: <I>donald.heffernan@gsa.gov</I>.<BR>

<P><B>NPR and GITS Will Sponsor Intranet Workshops</B><BR>
     The National Performance Review and Government Information Technology Services invite you to a series of free workshops on intranet technology. It's not just for technical people, although they are invited, too. If you are an agency executive, a program manager, or an end user, this workhop is for you because we know you'll want to use the Internet internally when you see what it can do for your organization.<BR>

<P>     The first intranet workshop--an overview by a private sector technology strategist--will be in the main auditorium of the Department of Labor in Washington, DC, from 1:30 - 3:45 p.m. on Thursday, July 25. This session is limited to the first 250 registrants.<BR>

<P>     Subsequent workshop topics in August include &quot;Reducing Paperwork,&quot; &quot;Empowering Employees with Better Information,&quot; &quot;Mission-critical Business Applications,&quot; and a general wrap-up. You'll learn intranet basics from representatives of VISA International, Home Box Office, FedEx, Eli Lilly, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and others.<BR>

<P><B>How to Register for the First Intranet Workshop</B><BR>
     To register for the first workshop on July 25, send your name, organization, phone, and fax number to Nathaniel McNamara at e-mail: <I>nathaniel.mcnamara@npr.gsa.gov</I> or FAX (202) 632-0390. For more information, call Nathaniel at (202) 632-0408.<BR>

<P>     You'll get registration information for the August workshops when you attend the July 25th workshop. The later workshops will be held from 1:30 - 3:45 p.m. on the first four Thursdays in August, but will be in different locations. You don't have to attend every workshop to benefit from the information. The last workshop will provide information on applying for seed money in September from the Information Technology Innovations Fund. Fund managers will give special consideration to proposals for intranet applications. <BR>

<P>
<H2>OPM's Performance Management Conference is Sept. 4-5</H2>
<P>     The Office of Personnel Management is sponsoring the second annual Performance Management Conference Sept. 4-5, in McLean, VA. Changes in performance management regulations have presented federal agencies with the opportunity to reinvent appraisal and awards programs suited to their organizational needs. New flexibilities mean more choices. Topics include Performance-Based Organizations, Measuring Performance, and Results-Based Performance Management. Conference cost is $450. For more information, call (202) 606-2720.<BR>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <BR>

<P><B>Denver Innovations Conference Is July 16-17</B><BR>

<H1>How to Spend $100,000</H1>
<P>     As a winner of the 1995 Innovations in American Government Award, the Bureau of Reclamation faced a problem we'd all like to tackle--how to spend the $100,000 grant that went with the award. The Bureau is using it to set up an Innovations Resource Center to share information on reinvention techniques and approaches with other agencies and to manage a Speaker's Bank. The Bureau will also set up a reinvention clearing house and host conferences.<BR>
    <B> This is short notice, but if you're interested and if you hurry, maybe you can get in on their two-day government innovations conference in Denver, July 16-17.</B> It's co-sponsored by the Denver Federal Executive Board. The keynote speaker will be William Parent, Executive Director of the Innovations in Government Award Program. <BR>

<P><B>For Conference Information</B><BR>
     Because the Bureau is covering a lot of the expenses from their award, the fee is just $40. It must be paid by check (made out to the DFEB). You may fax your name, organization, mailing address, and phone number to (303) 676-6464, and you must mail your check immediately. <B>Call JoAnne Zimmerman at (303) 676-7009 to get more information. </B><BR>
     The Bureau of Reclamation was one of six federal organizations to win the Innovations in Government Award last year. Sponsored by the Ford Foundation and Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, the Award recognizes government programs that represent new and highly effective approaches to meeting public needs. For Award information, call (617) 495-0558.<BR>

<P><B>Reclamation's Reinvention Innovations</B><BR>
     Reclamation won the Award for transforming itself from a dam-building agency into a leading water resource management agency. Here are some of the Bureau of Reclamation's award-winning achievements:<BR>
-	Delegated decision-making authority to the lowest practical level, reduced layers of management, and established a network of area offices.<BR>
-	Eliminated many requirements, including nearly 6,500 pages of internal regulations.<BR>
-	Reduced the workforce by more than 1,500 employees between 1993 and 1994 and maintained a spirit of enthusiasm and commitment.<BR>
-	Provided training and support to employees, including open planning meetings,  intensive outplacement assistance, and courses on managing change.<BR>
	If you can't make the conference, contact Karen Pedone to learn about the other services of the Innovations Resource Center (Email:<I> kpedone@usbr.gov</I>,  phone: 202-208-4972).<BR>

<P>
<H2>Speaking of Awards</H2>
<P>
<H2>     Applications for the 1997 President's Quality Award Program are now available.  The program has two components: the Presidential Quality Award--the counterpart of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the private sector--and the Quality Improvement Prototype Award. Apply to the Office of Personnel Management no later than October 11, 1996.  To get an application package, call Coleen Kenney at (703) 312-7331. The application package is also on NPR's home page (<I>http://www.npr.gov</I>). Go to &quot;News Room&quot; and look under &quot;Awards.&quot;</H2>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Cutting the Nation's Energy Bill</H2>
<P>     Pop quiz...How do you bring 1,000 people together, from Washington State to Washington, DC, for less than $15 per person?<BR>
     The Department of Energy did just that on June 11 when it used technology to electronically connect managers, customers, contractors, and stakeholders for its Third Annual Quality Summit, &quot;DOE: Cost-Conscious and Results-Driven.&quot;  Through satellite links, video and phone linkages, fax, phone, and e-mail systems, attendees heard from Secretary O'Leary and speakers from industry, labor, and customer groups. They also participated in workshops such as &quot;Delivering Results to Customers&quot; and &quot;Forces of Change and the Transformation Process.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Not All Talk</B><BR>
     And, the Department of Energy quality process is not all talk. Examples of cost savings identified thus far through DOE's quality processes include:<BR>
- 	$70 million in productivity savings realized by the Albuquerque Operations Office through improvements to its uranium mill tailings (a byproduct of uranium mining) disposal process. <BR>
-	$10 million saved by reducing management oversight reviews from 324 to 21.<BR>
-	$5.6 million saved by the Idaho Operations Office through activity-based costing to reduce costs and eliminate non-value-added work.<BR>
-	$1.3 million saved at the Central Training Academy in New Mexico through use of distant learning media.<BR>
     Reinvention is not new to DOE. Change has been on-going since the President appointed Hazel R. O'Leary to head the nation's nuclear weapons agency. The reinvented DOE also develops the world's most advanced environmental technologies to clean up contaminated weapons sites; conducts basic scientific research in biology, chemistry, and physics; and explores alternative sources of energy to replace our planet's dwindling oil reserves.<BR>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <BR>

<P>3-M Nominates EPA for Hammer Award<BR>

<H2>EPA's Voluntary 33/50 Program Achieves Major Environmental Goal Without One Word of Regulation</H2>
<P>	It's a first. On June 18, the Vice President's Hammer Award was presented to a government regulatory agency as a result of a nomination from a private sector company. <B>The story behind this event heralds a new, enlightened era in federal regulatory practice--one in which government and industry work together to achieve common goals.</B><BR>
	The Environmental Protection Agency received the award for its ground-breaking 33/50 Program. This partnership program challenged industry to voluntarily reduce environmental releases of 17 high-volume toxic chemicals by 33 percent in 1993 and 50 percent in 1995. More than 1,300 companies representing 5,000 facilities participated in the program.<BR>
	On June 26, Vice President Gore released the most recent (1994) data from EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (industrial chemicals that pose environmental and health concerns). It shows that the program reached its goals a year early. Free of government regulations, paperwork, penalties, punishments, and lawsuits, each company developed its own goals and plans and let EPA know of its commitment in a simple letter.<BR>

<P><B>It Was Two Hammers, Actually</B><BR>
	One of the participating companies, 3M, nominated the 33/50  team for the Hammer Award, commending  it for exchanging &quot;blue ribbons for red tape.&quot; NPR Project Director Bob Stone presented the award at 3M's headquarters in St. Paul. He also presented a companion award to 3-M, representing more than 1300 industry partners, for participating in the program.<BR>
	Industry applauded the effort from the beginning and the kudos continued. Richard Zanetti, editor of <I>Chemical Engineering Magazine</I>, wrote &quot;....33/50 has been one of the smartest things EPA has done....the government's role in 33/50 is small, as it should be. In fact, EPA manages the entire program with just a handful of staffers. I would guess  that taxpayer return on investment for 33/50 is light years ahead of that from traditionally run environmental programs....33/50 may be the harbinger of a changing regulatory rationale.&quot;<BR>
	In December, McGraw-Hill, publisher of the above magazine, organized a celebration and presented an &quot;Environmental Champions&quot; Award to 20 participating companies and the Department of Energy as top achievers in reducing  pollutants--some 750 million pounds in all. Based on his own analysis of the 1993 TRI, Zanetti found that these companies reached their goals well ahead of schedule. These companies also saved money, with an estimated 15 percent decrease in production-related waste, almost double that for non-participants.	<BR>
	The 33/50 program was EPA's first voluntary environmental program; more than 80 others are now underway, including Green Lights, Project XL, and Wastewi$e.<BR>

<P><B>For More Information</B><BR>
 For more information about 33/50, or a referral to other programs, call Chris Tirpak at (202) 260-7538 or e-mail:<I> Tirpak.Chris@epamail.epa.gov</I>.<BR>
	Regulatory reform is a major component of reinventing government. Many agencies are paying less attention to process and punishment and more attention to partnership and results. For more information, call Bruce Smith at NPR, (202) 632-1176, or e-mail: <I>Bruce.Smith@npr.gsa.gov.</I><BR>

<H2>EPA Reinvents Its Relationship with States, Too</H2>
<P>	On May 16, Colorado and Utah became the first states in the country to sign &quot;performance partnership grants&quot; with the Environmental Protection Agency. The agreements allow the states more flexibility to direct and shift federal funds for environmental projects to achieve better environmental results.<BR>
	&quot;These partnerships are based on a shared vision of environmental protection that is based on trust, respect, and a commitment to changing the way we do business,&quot; said EPA Administrator Carol Browner. Patti Shwayder, acting executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the grant agreement will allow the State to set priorities for its environmental efforts.<BR>
	The new one-step grants replace up to 13 separate agreements the state agencies used to negotiate with EPA and will allow them to bypass time-consuming appeals to EPA. Under the reinvented system, states need only file a single comprehensive report each year.  The shift from limited categorical grants (such as air, water, hazardous waste, toxic substances) to broad &quot;multimedia&quot; grants required Congressional approval. The President signed the legislation authorizing the change on April 26.<BR>
________________________<BR>

<H2>DoL Task Force Report Describes Labor-Management Cooperation at State and Local Levels</H2>
<P>	A recent Department of Labor report lists dozens of examples of states and localities in which union and management have broken out of traditional roles and taken some risks to work cooperatively to achieve workplace innovations and improve services to the public. <B><I>Working Together for Public Service</I></B><B> </B>also lays out specific practices and &quot;how to's&quot; that may be of interest to others.  The report gives the findings of a task force put together by the Secretary of Labor. The task force found that some of the most impressive successes came from relationships that previously had been extremely contentious.<BR>
	The report is on DoL's home page:<I> http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/consolid.pl?media+reports</I>.<B> To get a copy or more information, contact Edward Hilz at (202) 219-8595, ext. 165, or e-mail: </B><B><I>ehilz@dol.gov</I></B><B>. The fax number is (202) 219-4315.</B><BR>

<H2>GAO Verifies Agency Progress</H2>
<P>
<H2>in Reinventing Government </H2>
<P>	The General Accounting Office issued a report on June 12 assessing the status of the reinventing government action items that agencies have reported to the National Performance Review as completed. <BR>
	On September 7, 1995, Vice President Gore reported to the President in his book, <I>Common Sense Government</I>, that agencies had completed 380 of the National Performance Review's 1, 203 action items. These items implement NPR's  original 384 recommendations in 1993 to make the government &quot;work better and cost less.&quot; GAO verified that 294 action items, or 77 percent, were completed.  It also determined that 66 action items, or 17 percent, were not completed but that, for all but one of them, they were either partially implemented or some action had been taken to begin implementation. GAO was unable to determine if  20 of the action items, or 5 percent, had been implemented because there wasn't enough  information available.<BR>
	NPR Project Director Bob Stone told the GAO, &quot;It is a valuable report that shows the significant accomplishments of the many federal agencies reviewed.&quot; <B>To get a free copy of the report,  </B><B><I>Management Reform, Completion Status of Agency Actions Under the National Performance Review</I></B><B> (GAO/GGD-96-94),  call GAO at (202) 512-6000 or fax your request to (301) 258-4066. The TDD number is (301) 413-0006.</B><BR>

<P>
<H2>Chicago OPM &quot;Recycles&quot; Excess Property and Space After Downsizing--and It's a Win-Win for Everybody</H2>
<P>	If your organization has fewer employees, you'll find yourself with more space, furniture, and equipment than you need. What you usually do is transfer the property to a warehouse to be excessed, and turn the space back to GSA. It's the traditional approach, but it's also expensive and time consuming. It may not be the best solution as agencies face the task of governing in a balanced-budget world.<BR>
	After downsizing, the Chicago Office of Personnel Management came up with another solution for 5,000 square feet of fully-equipped contemporary office space that it didn't need anymore. Working with the help of the Chicago Federal Executive Board, OPM advertised for a new federal tenant. The Internal Revenue Service responded, and now an IRS staff that had been in private rental space has moved to OPM's space. Plus, the two agencies have signed an agreement to share resources, including a telephone system, reception services, and a conference room. Everybody wins, especially the taxpayer. <BR>

<H2>Joint Employment and Training Technology Conference </H2>
<P>
<H2>(JETT*CON)Will Interest Government Reinventors</H2>
<P>	A 3-day technology conference in Washington, DC, July 9-11, will demonstrate how technology can save you time and money, improve quality, and revolutionize the way public employment and training services are provided to America's workers and employers.<BR>

<H2>Latest <I>Reinvention Roundtable</I>: &quot;Ten Things You Can Do Now That You Couldn't Do--or Didn't Do--Before Reinvention&quot;</H2>
<P>	If you're on the Internet, go right now to NPR's home page <I>(http://www.npr.gov</I>, then go to &quot;News Room&quot;) to read the latest issue of NPR's newsletter, <I>Reinvention Roundtable</I> , Vol. 3, No. 1. You'll find out that the <B>U.S. Army is  the federal government's biggest user of the IMPAC credit card. </B>This card, in the hands of nonprocurement staff, is saving the Army millions of dollars in administrative costs for small (micro) purchases and people are getting the supplies and services they need quicker. Read <B>&quot;Working on the Change Gang&quot;</B> to find out how a small group of change agents is motivating hundreds of people at the Department of Energy to make pledges to the President and the American people that will save taxpayers millions--maybe billions--of dollars in the next few years.<BR>
	You'll also find <B>&quot;Ten Things You Can Do Now That You Couldn't Do--or Didn't Do--Before Reinvention.&quot; </B>For example, you can survey your customers without getting advance clearance from the Office of Management and Budget as long as your agency has an umbrella agreement with OMB. Depending on your agreement, you may have to send copies of your survey to OMB a week or so before you go to the public. Also,  you can get rid of time and attendance sign-in sheets, and you don't have to submit receipts  for most travel expenses under $75. Read the story to get details and find out the other seven items.<BR>
	<B>If you're on the hard copy distribution list, you'll also see that we goofed royally  in one story.</B> We mislocated Milwaukee when we highlighted Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Milwaukee, (it's in WISCONSIN, not Minnesota) and Iron Mountain, MI. These centers won Hammer Awards for their achievements in telepathology, a breakthrough technology that allows doctors to make a diagnosis via closed circuit television, not the Internet as we said in the <I>Roundtable</I>.  We've corrected our mistakes on our home page.<BR>

<P>	<B><I>Reinvention Roundtable</I></B><B> is a hard copy, two-color, 12-page newsletter, complete with photographs and illustrations. The primary audience is federal employees. To get on the hard copy distribution list,  send your name and mailing address to </B><B><I>Roundtable</I></B><B> at fax (202) 632-0390 or email: </B><B><I>pat.wood@npr.gsa.gov.  </I></B><BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Social Security's Online Customers:</B></H2>
<P>
<H2><B>What a Wonderful World!</B></H2>
<P>	No matter what your age, would you like to know how much you've paid into Social Security and how much you can expect in benefits when you retire or if you become disabled?  	The Social Security Administration has provided this service for years, but recently the agency put the request form online on their home page. In the past, people had to call an 800 number to get the request form mailed or go by a Social Security office to pick it up. <BR>
	Until security issues are resolved, SSA will continue to mail back the Personal Earnings and Benefits Estimate Statement (PEBES). Here's what their online customers are saying:<BR>
-	&quot;...What a wonderful world!...this will be even better when the results can be e-mailed back.&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;Form was easy to fill out. Very pleased with your efforts. Who really had time to stop at the local social security office to get this type of information? As much as it's a good idea, I've never made it a priority for this reason.&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;Overall, my experience with the IRS online, and now the SSA, has developed a feeling of accessibility. I am very pleased, and feel that I am in touch with the government of this great country, a feeling I've never had before (long lines, red tape, frustration)...This accessibility is the greatest improvement I've seen in my 44 years as a citizen. Don't stop.&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;Great!  East to fill out. Your time estimate was high. (Editor's note: 5 minutes) I have always wanted to get one of these but never knew where to pick up a form.&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;This is too easy. Is this a trick or something?&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;This is what government should be about on behalf of its constituents...&quot;<BR>
-	&quot;Terrific. I love America.&quot;<BR>
	If you want to request a PEBES online, SSA's web address is <I>http://www.ssa.gov</I>. To find out more about SSA's online initiatives, contact Bruce Carter at (410) 965-7232 or email: <I>Bruce W. Carter@ssa.gov</I> or John Sabo at (410) 965-1550 or email: <I>John.T.Sabo@ssa.gov</I>.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>The SEC Broadens Its Outreach to Investors</B></H2>
<P>	One out of three American families now holds an investment in mutual funds or the stock market, directly or through defined contribution retirement plans. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reinventing its operations to reach out and educate this huge influx of new investors into the securities market in recent years. <BR>
	This bottom-up approach is in addition to its enforcement role for stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment companies, and others. &quot;We are educating investors so as to reduce the need for government intervention on their behalf,&quot; said SEC spokesman John Heine.<B> </B><BR>
	The SEC received a record 3,700 responses from investors when it asked for better ways to convey the risks of mutual funds. Here are some of the SEC's new activities:<BR>
<B>-	Town Meetings.</B>  The SEC has held 13 town meetings across the country, reaching about 8,480 investors directly and an estimated 3.5 million through TV and videotape.<BR>
<B>-	Brochures.</B>  The Commission has distributed more than 400,000 &quot;Invest Wisely&quot; brochures since March 1994.<BR>
<B>-	Toll-Free Line.</B> The SEC has received more than 100,000 calls to the toll-free line it created in October 1994 to answer commonly-asked questions. The number is 1-800-SEC-0330.<BR>
<B>-	WWW Site.</B>  The SEC created a site on the World Wide Web in October 1995 that got more than 2 million hits in the first two months. The site (<I>http://www.sec.gov</I>) has speeches, congressional testimony, rule proposals, news releases, investor alerts, and more. The SEC also has placed its EDGAR database of corporate information on the Web, allowing investors to access and download the disclosure documents of public companies.<BR>
<B>-	Plain English Pubs.</B>  The Commission is encouraging mutual fund companies to use plain English in their prospectuses and to use  a new &quot;Fund Profile&quot; that summarizes salient information in a format that invites comparison with other funds.<BR>
	For more information about the SEC's  investor education program, call (202) 942-7040.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>GAO Reports Results of Reinvention Lab Survey</B></H2>
<P>	The General Accounting Office published a report in March based upon the findings of a survey faxed to 185 reinvention labs and visits to 12 labs. &quot;What we found was extremely encouraging,&quot; said Curtis Copeland, Assistant Director for GAO's Federal Management and Workforce issues. However, he said the full value will only be realized when the operational improvements the labs tested are spread all over the government.  Many of the labs are working in personnel management, procurement systems, and new technology to improve operations.<BR>
	The report, <B><I>Management Reform,  Status of Agency Reinvention Lab Efforts</I></B><B>,</B> noted two areas for improvement: lab intercommunication and data collection.  Most of the labs reported they did not have a substantial amount of communication with each other nor with the National Performance Review.  GAO said that some labs' lack of objective data collection made it hard to measure the true success of their efforts. While two-thirds of the respondents consistently collected data, and 80 percent reported that the &quot;labs had improved service, productivity, and employee morale,&quot; other labs collected only anecdotes or informal comments.<BR>
	NPR reinvention lab coordinator Jeffrey Goldstein said NPR is creating more opportunities for labs to communicate with each other, including a new Internet database that will be added to NPR's Web home page in the coming months.<BR>
	To get a free copy of the report (GAO/GGD-96-69), call GAO at (202) 512- 6000, or fax (301) 258-4066, or TDD (301) 413-0006.  For more information about the 238 reinvention labs in operation over the country, call Jeffrey Goldstein at (202) 632-0387.<BR>

<H2><B>U.S. Army Takes Top Federal Quality Awards </B></H2>
<P>	Two Army organizations have earned recognition as the two top quality organizations in the federal government. Both are in New Jersey.<BR>
	The <B>U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center </B>(ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, is this year's winner of the Presidential Award for Quality.  This award is the public sector equivalent of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award to private sector companies. ARDEC's accomplishments included reducing internal overhead costs by $70 million annually. The Army's <B>Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Logistics and Readiness Center</B> (LRC) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, is the winner of the Quality Improvement Prototype (QIP) Award.<BR>
	Both awards are part of the President's Quality Award Program. Finalists are also winners.  Achievement Awards went to the following: Defense Mapping Agency, Fairfax, VA; Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion and Repair, Jacksonville, FL; Defense Contract Management Command Long Island, Garden City, NY; 97th Air Mobility Wing, Altus AFB, OK; Naval Station Mayport, Mayport, FL; Naval Aviation Depot, Alameda, CA; and the only civilian winner, Veterans Benefits Administration, Muskogee, OK. A Special Quality Achievement Award went to the John F. Kennedy Space Center, FL, for its accomplishments and quality improvements over a sustained period of time.<BR>
	The 1996  program drew 29 applications from 22 military and seven civilian organizations. Seventy quality experts and practitioners, representing both private sector and government organizations, conducted the examination process. The awards were presented in Washington, DC, on June 5 at the Ninth Annual National Conference on Federal Quality.  <BR>
	For more information, contact Warren Asher at the Office of Personnel Management, (202) 606-1800.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>DC Area Career Transition Center Is Up and Running</B></H2>
<P>	In the first two weeks after the interagency Metro Area Reemployment Center in Washington, DC, opened on May 14, more than 300 people came in for help. Some were RIFed from their federal jobs, others were with federal organizations that are relocating, and some came just in case, according to Director Ann Grandy.<BR>
	Trained counselors and other staff from the Office of Personnel Management, Agriculture, Justice, Labor, Veterans Affairs,  State, and the General Services Administration guide clients through the ins and outs of online searches for public and private sector jobs and resume preparation software. <BR>
	&quot;We are excited that private sector companies that want to hire federal employees are calling in with their immediate vacancies,&quot; Ann said. &quot;Our customers love the professional assistance they get. They say this service is greatly needed.&quot;  The Center is located at 800 N. Capitol St., NW.	<BR>

<P><B>Workshops Are Available</B><BR>
	The Center offers workshops on career transition orientation, resume preparation, and Internet job search. Workshops on change management, self-esteem, skills assessment, and other subjects will be added later. For more information on the workshops and other services, call (202) 565-6672.<BR>

<P><B>What Went Before</B><BR>
	On September 12, 1995, President Clinton issued a memorandum directing the heads of departments and agencies to establish programs to provide career transition assistance to their displaced employees. The Center is a pilot program developed by a consortium led by the Office of Personnel Management and composed of  representatives of national federal employee unions and the Departments of Employment Services of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. The pilot is funded by the Department of Labor. Sites are also expected to open in Maryland and Virginia. The project grew out of the efforts of the Interagency Advisory Group of 100 federal agency personnel directors to help displaced federal employees.  <BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Free Career Transition Satellite Broadcast Is June 19</B></H2>
<P>	The Interagency Advisory Group will offer a free interactive satellite broadcast from 1 to 2:30 p.m. EDT on June 19. &quot;Are You Prepared for an Uncertain Future?&quot; will give federal workers  information on career transition including where to go for help, how to get a resume up to date, and assessing how portable your skills are.<BR>
	To submit questions in advance or get more details on the broadcast, send a fax to (202) 720-9148. Here are the satellite details:<BR>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <BR>

<P>
<H1>Innovative Employees Start Interagency Benchmarking Council and You Can Join </H1>
<P>	A group of pioneers from five federal agencies, concerned about problems and inefficiencies as more and more federal organizations benchmark against world-class companies, have chartered an Interagency Benchmarking and Best Practices Council.<BR>
	&quot;With so many federal agencies involved in improving processes, cutting costs, and improving customer service,&quot; said Dolores Livingston at Energy, &quot;it seemed  reasonable to begin to work together. We realized that by serial benchmarking, we were not making the most efficient use of staff and travel resources and we stood the chance of wearing out our welcome with world-class companies.&quot;  <B>The charter organizations in the new Council are Transportation, Veterans Affairs, IRS,  the Patent and Trademark Office, and Energy.</B> Richard Hopf, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance Management at the Department of Energy, has championed the effort.<BR>

<P><B>Combining Capabilities and Reducing Duplication</B><BR>
	The new group expects to leverage their combined benchmarking capabilities, reduce duplication of effort, and develop common definitions, ethics, and approaches. They are planning a free one-day fall conference in Washington, DC, with the date to be announced. They are designing an Internet home page that will contain a skills and capabilities directory, an annotated bibliography, a clearinghouse of completed and planned benchmarking projects, and bulletin boards.  The National Performance Review will partner with the new Council. BenchNet, NPR's online benchmarking resource, will be linked to the Council's home page.<BR>
	Working since last August, the group also formed partnerships with the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse of the American Productivity and Quality Center, the Strategic Planning Institute, Germany's <I>Informationszentrum Benchmarking,</I> and Canada's Innovation and Quality Exchange.<BR>

<P><B>Your Agency Can Participate</B><BR>
	Federal, state and local governmental organizations that are willing to actively participate in benchmarking projects are encouraged to join the Council. Contact James J. Cavanagh, Department of Energy, by email: <I>james.cavanagh@hq.doe.gov</I> or at (202) 586-8257.<BR>

<P>
<H2>New NPR Benchmarking Consortium Study:</H2>
<P>
<H2>Make It Easy for Your Customers to Complain</H2>
<P>	Companies that are the best-in-business want their customers to complain, and so should federal agencies.  And, resolving complaints on the first contact can save money and build customer confidence.<BR>
	This  advice for federal agencies appears in the latest NPR-sponsored Federal Benchmarking Consortium Study Report, <I>Serving the American Public: Best Practices in Resolving Customer Complaints</I>. President Clinton, in his 1993 Executive Order 12862,  &quot;Setting Customer Service Standards,&quot; directed federal agencies to give customers an easy way for citizens to complain and get problems fixed. The interagency benchmarking team, representing 13 federal organizations, studied 10 corporate and government organizations with the best record for resolving customer complaints. For information, call Dan Curtis at (202) 632-0490. To get a copy, call the NPR customer service desk, (202) 632-0150. <B>The report will also be on NPR's home page by May 1. </B>The Web address is <I>http://www.npr.gov</I>. Look under &quot;Reports.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<H2>Call for Papers on Productivity and Quality Research</H2>
<P>	Government reinventors, take a look. Here's a place you may be able to showcase your efforts. The International Society for Productivity and Quality Research has put out a call for papers for its Sixth International Conference in Houston, March 16-19, 1997. The main theme is the development of new knowledge, its transition to practice, and the results that come from this new practice. The major focus will be the proven or potential impact on an organization's productivity and quality.  Papers are sought worldwide from government, business, and academia. <B>A one-page abstract is due June 1, 1996.</B>  For details, contact Carl G. Thor at (703) 548-7306 or FAX (703) 548-7908. The Web address is<I> http://www.el.uh.edu.ICPQR-97</I>.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Federal Quality Consultants Live On</H2>
<P>	Consultants from the former Federal Quality Institute continue to offer consultation, facilitation, and education services to federal leaders. Now known as the Federal Quality Consulting Group, the consultants are co-located at the National Performance Review. Their services are extremely flexible and help organizations implement NPR recommendations, resulting executive orders, and the Government Performance and Results Act. For more information, contact Barbara Reeder at (202) 632-0307, FAX 632-0390, or email: <I>barbara.reeder@npr.gsa.gov</I>.<BR>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <BR>

<P>&quot;New Realities: Common Sense Government&quot; Is the Theme<BR>

<H1>Federal Quality Conference Set for June 3-6</H1>
<P>	More than 2,500 federal workers and 100 exhibitors are expected to attend the Ninth Annual Conference on Federal Quality from June 3- 6 at the Washington Hilton and Towers Hotel.<BR>
	Vice President Gore has been invited to preside over the President's Quality Award presentations. Keynote speakers include author Stephen R. Covey; Mary Ellen Withrow, Treasurer of the United States; Elaine Kamarck, Senior Advisor to the Vice President; and officials from Texas Instruments, Inc., Drucker Foundation, and Crocker Associates. Presentations will be made by officials of 1996 quality award winners. <BR>
	&quot;We invite you to join us ,&quot; said Jim King, director of the Office of Personnel Management. &quot;The responsibility of creating common sense government rests with each of us.&quot; OPM is sponsoring the event, along with six co-sponsors, including the National Performance Review.<BR>

<P><B>For More Information</B><BR>
	Registration is coordinated by conference contacts in each agency or department. If you do not know your contact, or if you need more information, call Conference Coordinator Kim Exeter at (703) 312-7333 or Clint Sidwell at (703) 312-7329.<B> As space permits, OPM is also offering a limited number of registrations for Awards Day only on Wednesday, June 5, for a reduced fee.</B><BR>

<P>
<H2>Vanguard Agencies Put Customer Service Standards Online</H2>
<P>	Vice President Gore asked the President's eleven Vanguard agencies--the agencies with the most public contact--to put important customer service information online, and all have done it. This includes their customer service standards, specific promises to the public, and a means to provide customer feedback. You may reach this information through each agency's home page. You may also access it through the White House home page (<I>http://www.whitehouse.gov</I>, then click on &quot;What's New) or the NPR home page (<I>http://www.npr.gov</I>, then click on &quot;Customer Service). Some agencies have gone beyond the Vice President's request by delivering services online. Here's one example:<BR>

<P><B>VA Customer Service Goes Online</B>--Since March 15, the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters Consumer Affairs Service has been responding immediately to customers' inquiries received at the VA Home Page via Internet (<I>http://www.va.gov/</I>). Under the icon &quot;Putting Customers First,&quot; VA staff answers questions, resolves complaints, or quickly forwards issues to appropriate offices in headquarters or the field for resolution. For information, call Clayton Cochran at (202) 273-5771 or e-mail: <I>cochran.clayton@forum.va.gov</I>.<BR>
	In addition to the VA, the Vanguard agencies are: OSHA, IRS, EPA, Forest Service, Park Service, Customs, Immigration and Naturalization, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,  State's Passport Services, and Social Security. <BR>

<P>
<H2>More Than 400,000 Federal Employees Can Update</H2>
<P>
<H2>Their Own Personnel and Pay Records </H2>
<P>	<B>Employee Express</B>, an interagency reinvention initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services, gives about 434,000 federal employees direct access to their own personnel and payroll records and the means to directly process such actions as address changes, direct deposit of paychecks, voluntary allotments and federal and state tax withholding. And it's easy--call the agency's 800 number from a touchtone phone or make a visit to a free-standing kiosk within the agency. Next year there will be a PC version.<BR>
	The interagency task force was formed in 1994, with agencies sharing costs, defining the technologies, and using self-directed teams. The Phase I pilot, which ran from May to November 1995, affected 144,000 employees in 20 organizations. Without losing a beat, the initiative entered Phase II, which will add Thrift Savings Plan and Health Benefit actions by the November 1996 open season. &quot;We now have 24 agencies on board,&quot; said Project Manager Lynne Doupont. &quot;And some of the original organizations are expanding to reach even more of their employees.&quot; Future phases will reach more agencies and employees and more discretionary actions, with the aim to go governmentwide.<BR>

<P><B>&quot;A Neat Way to Make Government Work Better and Cost Less&quot;</B><BR>
	Employee Express gets rid of paper forms and eliminates the need for offices to key millions of personnel and payroll actions every year. Vice President Gore called the project the &quot;Virtual Department of Reinvention&quot; and wrote &quot;using computer power to let people update their own personnel records is a neat way to make government work better and cost less.&quot; <BR>
	In addition to HHS, original participants are Defense, Commerce, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury, Transportation (Federal Aviation Administration), Justice, Education, and the Office of Personnel Management. A small agency consortium represents the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, Smithsonian, Endowment for the Arts, Farm Credit Commission, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Emergency Management Administration, National Labor Relations Board, Office of Government Ethics, and the Small Business Administration. Organizations joining the partnership in Phase II are Housing and Urban Development, Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the Social Security Administration. <B>For more information about Employee Express, contact Lynne Doupont at (202) 690-8236 or by e-mail at </B><B><I>LTD@OSPAHF.SSW.DHHS.GOV</I></B><B>.</B><BR>

<P>
<H1>Cutting Internal Red Tape for Federal Workers</H1>
<P><I>Federal employees are doing a remarkable job in improving service and cutting red tape for the public, but how much progress can agencies show in cutting the internal red tape that frustrates and hampers federal workers? Until now, only a little. However, we've had some recent breakthroughs that promise to reduce much of the hassle in time keeping, procurement, and other areas. Here are the stories.</I><BR>

<P>
<H2>Time and Attendance: Its Days Are Numbered</H2>
<P>Vice President Gore told more than 600 participants at the reinvention conference in Bethesda, MD, on March 25 that the General Accounting Office has released new policy guidelines on time and attendance. The guidelines permit agencies to get rid of sign-in sheets and other time and attendance paperwork.<BR>

<P>The Vice President said the requirement that federal workers sign in is a &quot;waste and indignity. No excuses anymore. It's time to change.&quot; <BR>

<P><B>What Went Before</B><BR>
The Vice President's initial recommendations to the President in September 1993 called for eliminating labor intensive time sheets and time cards and using technology to enter payroll data on an exception basis (that is, only reporting the hours you don't work).<BR>

<P>A 1995 NPR survey on time and attendance in 26 federal organizations showed considerable confusion in interpreting governmentwide policies, a profusion of approaches, and many requirements embedded in union contracts that will have to be renegotiated. The survey was conducted under the auspices of the Chief Financial Officers Council.<BR>

<P><B>Policy Giver Is Also the Model</B><BR>
GAO is practicing the Vice President's vision for handling time and attendance. GAO does not require its employees to sign in and out on a daily basis. GAO trusts its employees to complete their scheduled number of hours before leaving at the end of the day. If an employee deviates one hour or more, he/she gets the supervisor's verbal approval. The new guidelines will permit agencies to establish systems based on this model. <B>Why not celebrate this news on Professional Secretaries Day, April 24? </B> The guidelines are on the NPR homepage (<I>http://www.npr.gov</I>) Go to the News Room.  For a copy of the guidelines, call (202) 512-6000. For information, call Barry Grinnell at (202) 512-9530.<BR>

<P>
<H2>New Laws Will Reduce the Hassle in Government Buying</H2>
<P>Your agency no longer has to jump through bureaucratic hoops and wait for months before it buys a new computer. The Brooks Act, which forced agencies that were buying information technology to adhere to special rules and obtain approval from the General Services Administration, has been repealed.<BR>

<P>That is just one of the several procurement reforms enacted as part of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA) and Information Technology Management Reform Act, which the President signed into law on February 10. These new laws also mean you will be able to:<BR>

<P>-	Reduce the number of suppliers you have to negotiate with after you get initial proposals.<BR>
-	Simplify your agency's procedures for buying commercial items up to $5 million (up from $100,000 under previous law).<BR>
-	Evaluate your agency's IT investment programs against criteria modeled on the best practices of successful companies.<BR>

<P>The new laws also require agencies to first make the way they work as efficient as possible, then to automate that efficient process, and finally, to measure the improvement.<BR>

<P><B>Earlier Law Reformed Smaller Dollar Procurement</B><BR>
These laws continue the push for governmentwide procurement reform that began with the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA). That law reinvented smaller dollar purchases; the latest laws focus on bigger dollars. Now government can get good market prices and the latest technology--just like industry. Simplifying procurement was one of the NPR's major recommendations in 1993.  For more information, call the Office of Federal Procurement Policy at (202) 395-6803.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Keep Reading. There's More</H2>
<P>Congress has passed other laws recently that implement NPR recommendations :<BR>

<P>-	Effective January 1, 1997, President Clinton will have authority to veto line items in appropriations bills. <BR>
-	The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995, signed by the President on December 21, 1995, repeals Congressionally-mandated reporting by federal agencies.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Here's a Free Transforming Government Conference</H2>
<P>The Consortium for Cultural Change will sponsor a free all-day conference for government reinventors on May 28 at the NIH Natcher Center in Bethesda, MD. Topics include the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and strategic planning, reengineering business processes, and performance metrics. Attendance is limited to 250, so you must preregister. But there's no free lunch: You'll buy your lunch in the cafeteria and pay  $8.50 for the breaks and reception.

<H2>Federal-State Partnership Gets Impressive Results in Just One Year for Children and Families in Washington State </H2>
<P>A federal-state partnership in administering social welfare programs in the State of Washington has increased training, job entry, parental child support collections and other performance indicators in just one year. <BR>

<P>The partnership was created by <B>Region X Administration for Children and Families</B> in Seattle and <B>Washington State Economic Services Administration</B> in February 1995. The two agencies created a shared vision &quot;to work together as partners to improve the economic independence and productivity of families&quot; and established common goals. A team of eleven federal and thirteen state employees participated with the blessing of federal and state agency administrators. <BR>

<P><B>The Partnership Is Getting Results</B><BR>
Here are two accomplishments of the collaborative approach to social service delivery:<BR>
-	Participants in the Job opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Unemployed Parent Program  increased by 18.6 percent in 1995, and is now over 30,000. The number of job entries increased by 43 percent, from more than 7,500 to almost 11,000.<BR>
-	The State increased child support collections by 10 percent and the number of paternities established went up by 32 percent over the previous year.<BR>

<P>The team also set up a pilot project to provide special assistance to AFDC/JOBS clients with learning disabilities and other special needs and a pilot to expand community involvement in Head Start and Child Care. They also implemented an automated system to track child support enforcement and began a pilot project to implement an automated AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamp tracking system.<BR>

<P><B>Workers Like the New Approach</B><BR>
Managers and workers in both agencies are pleased with the new working arrangement. &quot;The partnership agreement has helped fuse relationships with the Washington State Economic Services Administration and our communication has changed to a more consultative role, &quot; said Leonard Scott, ACF Cluster Manager for Self-Sufficiency. <BR>

<P>&quot;Since we have established Internet communication, we receive immediate information on current bills. This has helped us immensely in responding to the Washington State Legislature,&quot; said John Atherton, Chief, Office of Assistance Programs for the State. Federal-State collaboration has also resulted in improving services to clients with learning disabilities, he said.<BR>

<P>
<H1>Out of the Blue (Pages)</H1>
<P>Have you ever used your agency's listing in the phone book's blue pages of government numbers? Most listings read like an organizational chart, with names of offices and divisions, not services that people are tying to find.<BR>

<P>The <B>General Services Administration</B> has the lead in a reinventing government initiative underway with federal agencies to make their blue pages more customer friendly. The inspiration came from the <B>Federal Executive Board in Denver</B>. An FEB team--with representatives from the General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Government Printing Office and the FEB Board--partnered with U.S. West to lead federal agencies in the Denver area to improve their listings. Denver's improved blue pages came out last November. Some organizations that have high involvement with the public--like Social Security, Agriculture, and Transportation--are also pioneers in improving federal phone listings.<BR>

<P>For the government-wide initiative, a special team is working to create a standardized, user-friendly format to be used by about 30 companies that publish the 6,200 telephone directories in the U.S. If you have ideas for improvements, can share good or bad experiences using federal blue pages, or can help in your area, please contact Sue Valaskovic or Candy Kane at NPR, (202) 632-0150 or <I>candy.kane@npr.gsa.gov</I>. To ask about Denver, call Lea Chapan at (303) 676-7009.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Oklahoma Federal Executive Board Gets a Web Site</H2>
<P>The Oklahoma Federal Executive Board has established a home page on the World Wide Web that is linked to the National Performance Review's home page. FEB Director LeAnn Jenkins plans to post the monthly newsletter, meeting announcements, information about the Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU), and reinventing government activities by Oklahoma agencies. &quot;We want to use the Web to offer federal agencies information and ideas about working together and we want to show the public what Oklahoma agencies are doing to save money, cut red tape, and improve customer service,&quot; LeAnn said. The URL for the FEB Web site is <I>http://www.mmac.jccbi.gov/feb-okc/</I>. Call LeAnn at (405) 231-4167.<BR>

<H2>HUD Reinvents Its Training</H2>
<P>It's no secret: training is often among the first things to go when money gets scarce in a federal organization. Nobody ever said this was smart, just easy. Isn't it time we took a fresh look at how we approach training, especially with smaller budgets in the years to come?<BR>

<P>The Department of Housing and Urban Development has done it. HUD has been slowly, but radically, reshaping its departmental training activities for almost 3 years under Secretary Henry Cisneros. Instead of being swept away in a downsizing fervor, training has become a separate and elevated organization, focused on the departmental mission and guaranteed a dedicated budget that will not be reduced every time HUD faces financial constraints.<BR>

<P>Most of the changes were proposed by a 35-member task force blessed by the Secretary. It was made up of representatives from union and management, headquarters and  field.  Here's what HUD has accomplished.<BR>

<P><B>CENTRAL FOCUS</B>--HUD moved its training function into a new Academy, with field staff staying in the field, but reporting directly to the Field Training Manager in headquarters. This assures that training is focused, prioritized around HUD's objectives, and technically consistent.<BR>

<P><B>TECHNOLOGY-BASED DELIVERY SYSTEM</B>--For some training, it's not cost effective to bring 30 or 40 employees to a central site for training. New satellite training reaches 400 to 500 people at one time in field office sites. HUD's Television Network has 56 sites, fully equipped with a keypad system that allows interaction between the participants and the instructors. In addition to reaching many more people, HUD's distance learning technology has saved several hundred thousand dollars over traditional classroom methods. It also has increased the variety of programs and the consistency of technical training like legislative and program changes.<BR>
	   <BR>
<B>OPEN TO PARTNERS</B>--HUD now opens its training to its business partners. For example, comprehensive training on the Single Family Assistance Program was provided to about 500 field staff and representatives of lending institutions in FY95.  Plus, a videotape was sent to the Mortgage Bankers Association for its members. This interdisciplinary approach also facilitates people from within and outside HUD to interact (both in person and via technology) and plan ways to improve our nation's communities.<BR>
 .<BR>
<B>CAREER TRAINING</B>--HUD is providing opportunities for its staff to further their own career goals. The Department has set up partnerships with academic institutions over the country to offer certificate programs in a variety of fields, including housing and community development, business finance, and real estate management. In most cases, employee compete for slots. Twenty-three educational partnerships were in operation in FY 1995, with 1,500 HUD staff participating. Several hundred employees will participate this year. In addition, HUD set up a mentoring program with 500 participants. <BR>

<P>&quot;With these reforms, training is moving into the mainstream of HUD operations to become an integral part of the management process,&quot; said Sandra Webb, Administrator of the HUD Academy. For more information, contact Sandra at (202) 708-3368.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Vice President: Governing in a Balanced Budget World</B></H2>
<P>	Washington, D.C.--Vice President Gore today outlined six steps that will transform how the federal government operates in a balanced budget world. He unveiled the next phase of reinventing government in an address to the National Press Club. Citing bipartisan consensus, the Vice President said the question is not whether to balance the budget, but how. &quot;The budget will be balanced,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody better get used to that fact.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Kudos for Federal Workers</B><BR>
	The Vice President praised federal workers for what they have done to reinvent government.  He went beyond his prepared text to call attention to their help, ideas, and leadership. He said that some of the most talented people he has ever met are in the civil service. &quot;But we haven't just shrunk the government. In partnership with federal employees, we've actually made it work better,&quot; he said. &quot;But we're not done. The balanced budget has raised the bar from where it was just three years ago.&quot;<BR>
	He said that government will take steps to achieve the following objectives :<BR>

<P><B>Performance Based Organizations</B>--Although some parts of government--like making public policy or enforcing regulations--cannot be measured by business standards, the Vice President said, &quot;Much of government can, and should, operate more like a top-notch business.&quot; He proposed creating several Performance Based Organizations, or PBOs, within existing departments--an innovation that would require Congressional action. PBOs would be run by chief executives who sign contracts and would be personally accountable for delivering results--or be fired. Red tape, hiring barriers, and budget restrictions would be relaxed for these organizations, which would also separate their policy function from service operations. Legislation is now moving through Congress to convert the Patent and Trademark Office in Commerce into a PBO. (He also announced a contest to find a catchy name for the PBOs. See below.)<BR>

<P><B>Visible Improvements in Customer Service</B>--The government's customer service initiative would be stepped up, led by eleven &quot;Vanguard&quot; agencies and building on the customer service standards now in place in more than 200 agencies.  (The standards are on the Internet at <I>www.whitehouse.gov</I>.)&quot;We've challenged all agencies by setting a goal that 'everyone in America will know' that government service is better,&quot; the Vice President said. The President's Vanguard agencies are those with the most public contact: OSHA, IRS, EPA, Forest Service, Park Service, Customs, Immigration and Naturalization, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, VA, State's Passport Services, and Social Security. <BR>
	He drew applause when he said federal workers were redesigning the telephone &quot;blue pages&quot; so that &quot;you'll be able to look under 'P' for passports, not 'S' for State Department.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Regulatory Partnerships-</B>-&quot;We've going to make partnerships with the private sector the rule, not the exception,&quot; the Vice President said. He noted the successes of such partnerships as OSHA's Maine 200 and EPA's XL, Green Lights, and 33/50 that focus on results rather than processes. These programs are working because many corporate leaders share the same goals as government and are interested in working cooperatively to achieve them, he said.<BR>

<P><B>New Partnerships with Communities</B>-- Every time a grant program comes up for reauthorization, the Vice President said the Administration will ask Congress to turn it into a performance partnership and, if necessary, consolidate it with other programs. &quot;We will shift their focus from process to performance. Together, federal, state, and local governments will set the goals; then, communities will decide how to meet them,&quot; he said. The Administration will also enter into agreements with States to create these new partnerships, like the &quot;Oregon Option&quot; in 1994 to promote healthier children and more stable families, and this year in Connecticut to improve and revitalize the State's poorest communities.<BR>

<P><B>Single Points of Contact</B>--Over the next year, Housing and Urban Development will appoint a single federal point of contact for every community with more than 150,000 people. The contact will be a focal point for dealing with community issues, regardless of what federal agencies are involved. &quot;We're going to give the nameless, faceless bureaucrat a name and a face,&quot; the Vice President said.<BR>

<P><B>Federal Workforce Transformation</B>--One size personnel system doesn't fit all in business, and it doesn't fit in government either, the Vice President said. He expects bipartisan support for legislation that will be submitted to vastly expand the demonstration authority in civil service law. The new law would allow many agencies to design personnel systems suited to their mission, including authority to recruit and hire for all positions.<BR>

<P><B>For Copies</B><BR>
	The Vice President's speech is on the Internet at<I> www.npr.gov</I>. (Go to &quot;newsroom.&quot; You'll also find a short fact sheet and a policy document, &quot;Reinvention's Next Steps,&quot; that contains background papers supporting the speech.) For hard copies, fax your name and mailing address to NPR Help Desk, (202) 632-0390.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Help Pick a Name for Performance Based Organizations</B></H4>
<P>	&quot;We realize that PBO isn't a very catchy name,&quot; the Vice President said of one of the government innovations that he announced in his policy address on March 4. He announced a contest on the Internet at <I>www.npr.gov</I> so you can help decide the name. <BR>

<P>
<H1>She's a Friend</H1>
<P>	Lisa Kudrow--you may know her as &quot;Phoebe&quot; on NBC's hit sitcom Friends--was in Washington, DC on February 23 to film public service announcements with Vice President Gore. Lisa plugs the Internal Revenue Service's newest customer-friendly TeleFile Service--filing a tax return by touch tone phone. Filing takes about 6 minutes and the phone system does the math. Any refund comes within 21 days. In the spots, &quot;Phoebe,&quot; a ditsy blond, demonstrates how easy it is to file by phone. The new TeleFile service can be used by 20 million taxpayers who use Form 1040EZ. The toll-free number is inside the tax package.<BR>

<P><B>IRS Has Other Services to Make Taxes Less Taxing</B><BR>
	Here are other IRS innovations to make filing your return easier or to speed up any refund:<BR>

<P><B>Use Your Home Computer.</B> Until this year, almost all electronic returns were filed through commercial tax services. This year you can file from your home computer if you have one of several tax preparation software applications like Kiplinger Tax Cut or Intuit's Turbo Tax for Windows. Once your return is accepted, you'll have to mail in a signature form and your W-2s. IRS staff don't have to enter data into a computer as they do with paper returns and refunds only take 3 weeks. For information, see IRS's home page at <I>http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover/html</I>.<BR>

<P><B>Get Forms Online</B>. Formless in Phoenix? Don't sweat it. Last year IRS put more than 500 forms and instruction booklets online. Try the home page above. Or access by modem (703) 321-8020, or Telnet, <I>iris.irs.ustreas.gov</I>, or FTP, <I>ftp.irs.ustreas.gov</I>. IRS received the Vice President's Hammer Award and an award from <I>Government Computer News</I> for this innovation. <I>PC Computing News </I>named IRS one of the top 101 Internet sites; FOSE said it was in top 10. CNN said the IRS home page is &quot;colorful, campy, easy to use, and even fun.&quot; IRS is even getting fan mail. One customer wrote--electronically of course--&quot;The information and forms that you provide online are a lifesaver! It's sooooooooo much easier than going through the mail.&quot;   Contact Pamela Cobbs at (202) 927-2234.<BR>

<P><B>Get 57 Frequently-Asked-For Forms by FAX.</B> It's easy. Your FAX machine has to call their FAX machine. Find out how by calling (703) 487-4160.<BR>

<P><B>Use Direct Deposit.</B> You can get your refund deposited directly into your bank account whether you file on paper or electronically. Use Form 8888 that came with your tax package. If it didn't, call (800) TAX-FORM.<BR>

<P>
<H1>They Didn't Know Us in Moscow.</H1>
<P>
<H1>Now They Do.</H1>
<P>	It wouldn't surprise us if people in Moscow, Russia, didn't know that federal workers are reinventing government. But what about people in Moscow, Idaho? They didn't either until retired federal worker Sam Butterfield spoke up.<BR>
	Sam, a former manager with the U.S. Agency for International Development in posts over the world, retired to his hometown of Moscow, Idaho, in 1981. He's very active in the Rotary Club, including making an occasional speech. When he announced the topic of a recent speech--status of the efforts to reinvent government--his audience of business and community leaders openly expressed their skepticism. <BR>

<P><B>REGO Successes Were News to Them</B><BR>
	As he began to tell stories from <I>Common Sense Government</I>, Vice President Gore's recent report to the President, Sam Butterfield noticed that the mood of his listeners began to change. &quot;The story of the government beginning to change itself is a great story, and a persuasive one,&quot; he said. &quot;It was quite clear that the REGO efforts and successes of federal workers were truly news to this audience. The message was both surprising and encouraging to them. The Maine OSHA story really got their attention.&quot; (In Maine 200, OSHA workers traded penalties and punishment for partnership with 200 companies to achieve much safer workplaces. Call Bill Freeman at (207) 941-8177. See <I>Reinvention Express,</I> May 19, 1995,  Vol. 1,  No. 9. )<BR>

<P><B>Participants Began to Share Their Positive Experiences with Government</B><BR>
	In the question and answer period, members of the audience began to share their own positive experiences with government. A recently retired minister volunteered that he had been very impressed with the way the Social Security Administration had treated him when he let them know that they had failed to include $40,000 to $50,000 of his lifetime earnings. One of the town's leading accountants jumped in to tell about a number of things the IRS was doing to help tax filers.  (See IRS story above.) &quot;The Q and A turned into a very rich dialog,&quot; Sam said, &quot;and a very supportive one.&quot; He closed by linking reinventing government to increasing the American people's trust in their government and in their capacity to collectively solve the nation's problems.<BR>

An Information Sheet for Federal Communicators, Managers, Workers, and Their Partners--Pass It On <BR>

<P>
<H1>Helping Employees and Agencies Survive and Thrive While the Federal Government Shrinks</H1>
<P>	What can you do to prepare yourself or your staff for a possible downsizing within your organization? What resources can you tap to help your agency's workforce develop job-hunting skills and strategies or coping skills for those left with the challenge of getting the job done well with fewer people and fewer dollars? How can you maintain productivity and improve customer service while you are letting people go? Help is on the way.<BR>

<P><B>Agencies Must Provide Career Transition Services</B><BR>
	Interim regs for the President's Sept. 12, 1995 directive on Career Transition go into effect on Feb. 29. The new program requires agencies to provide services such as resume preparation to their own employees affected by downsizing. They must also offer vacancies to their own surplus or displaced employees before hiring from outside the agency and must select displaced federal workers from other agencies before hiring candidates from outside government. Contact OPM's C.C. Christakos or Susan Shelton at (202) 606-0960.<BR>
	Federal Executive Boards play an important role in the new program. Here's what's happening in two FEBs:<BR>

<P><B>Portland (Oregon) Federal Executive Board</B> will have an all-day program with exhibits in May, focusing on self-assessment, interviewing, networking, resume writing, and self-employment. &quot;We're also going to market this seminar to our county and state partners,&quot; said FEB Executive Director Ron Johnson. &quot;We're also concerned with helping agencies cope with doing more with fewer resources and staff. We want to help employees focus on setting priorities,&quot; he said. The event is the first in a series of ongoing services of the FEB Career Transition Committee. Contact Ron Johnson at (503) 326-2060.<BR>

<P><B>New York</B> <B>FEB</B> set up a downsizing task force to look at technology, hold classes on resume writing, and inventory &quot;soft landing&quot; aids to avoid duplication among member agencies. It will sponsor a comprehensive program on March 8 in partnership with the States of New York and New Jersey and the Dept. of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. &quot;We're particularly interested in the services the States can provide, including coming on site to work with employees and adding federal job listings to their computerized listings,&quot; said FEB Director Susan Kossin. Contact her at (212) 264-1890.<BR>

<P>	Defense has recent experience in downsizing, partly because of the Base Realignment and Closure Act in 1990 after the end of the Cold War and partly because of reinventing government. Savings are substantial--$1.9 billion annually for the Navy alone.<B> </B>Some Defense organizations report remarkable achievements in keeping work going and dealing humanely with employees. The story that follows is one example.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Mare Island Naval Shipyard Shrinks Workforce, Minimizes a RIF, Keeps Work Going--While Preparing to Close</B></H2>
<P>	Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California--set for closure on April 1, 1996--was able to go from 6,200 employees in March 1993 to about 1,600 now. It got to this point without a reduction-in-force while also completing its shipwork--which it did last April. Now the shipyard is concentrating on closure. About 1,000 of those remaining will be RIFed, but more than half of these are training for new careers.<BR>
	The key was using quality leadership principles and involving everyone, including the unions. The shipyard continues to provide education and training, but with a changed focus. Now it provides training in environmental work through a partnership with the University of California and local colleges. Staff are cleaning up the shipyard prior to closure, work that is qualifying them for jobs in the environmental field.<BR>
	Mare Island has set up a career resource center with career transitional services to prepare its remaining employees to adjust to work outside the shipyard. More than 1,500 have found federal jobs through the Priority Placement Program. For information, call TQL coordinator Valinda Gillis, at (707) 646-5965.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Two Department of Navy Women Offer Fresh Insight and Tips on Surviving in a Downsizing World</B></H2>
<P>	Pamela J. Kidder and Bobbie Ryan, who work for the Total Quality Leadership Office in the office of the Under Secretary of the Navy, wrote a two-part article, &quot;How to Survive in a Downsizing World,&quot; that appeared in the Dec. 1995 and Jan.-Feb. 1996 issues of the <I>Journal for Quality and Participation</I>. <BR>
	Based on interviews with executives from the public and private sectors, the first article discusses what's happening to the workplace in the 90's,  new strategies for dealing with the changing work environment, and what skills and attitudes are needed to survive. The second has exercises on work values and long-term career planning. You can access the articles with a PC and modem. Dial the TQLO electronic bulletin board,  (703) 602-9094. <BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Federal Employees Help Pay for Resume Workshop</B></H2>
<P>	Faith Williamson, Director of the Career Management Center at Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, came up with an innovative way to pay resume expert Kathryn Troutman to teach federal employees how to convert their old Standard Form 171s into new federal-style resumes. If their agencies didn't have the funds, participants could pay their own way to the 3-hour workshop.<BR>
	Faith worked out the details in conjunction with the HHS Program Support Center Administrative Office. &quot;About 20 percent of the 70 participants paid by personal checks made out to HHS,&quot; she said.  The event was a huge success and Faith is planning another workshop on March 6. It's open to federal employees from other departments and personal payment options are available. Call Faith Williamson at (202) 205-9391.<BR>

<P>
<H1>Vice President Presents First Awards </H1>
<P>
<H1>to Labor-Management Partnerships</H1>
<P>	Four labor-management partnerships in federal organizations have won the first awards from the National Partnership Council. President Clinton created the Council in 1993 to encourage agencies and unions to work together to reinvent government.<BR>
	Vice President Gore presented the National Partnership Awards in a ceremony at the Office of Personnel Management in Washington, DC on Feb. 14. &quot;We have seen a new era of cooperation and cost-cutting,&quot; the Vice President said. Here are the winners:<BR>
<B>U.S. Mint/American Federation of Government Employees, Denver</B>--Before the partnership, strife between employees and managers was legendary and severe, to the point of impeding quality customer service and costing millions of tax dollars in labor disputes. On nothing more than a handshake, labor-management accord has resulted in $10 million savings by informal resolution of more than 200 equal opportunity conflicts or labor-management disputes. In addition, the Denver Mint will produce its own coin-pressing dies by mid 1996, saving $300,000. It pressed a record 10.3 billion circulating coins and eight million collectible coins in FY95. Contact Mike Rucker at (202) 874-9300.<BR>
<B>Red River Army Depot/National Association of Government Employees and Five Other Unions, Texarkana, TX</B>--Partnership rescued the Red River Depot from almost certain extinction. The facility repairs light-tracked combat vehicles, recertifies missiles, and stores ammunition. Partnership evolved into new ways of doing business, saving taxpayers $15 million in FY94. Its quality program encourages teamwork, employee involvement, and continuous process improvement. One employee suggestion saved $8 million. Partnership helped negotiate a 70 percent trimming of excess management positions and decreased employee labor complaints by 80 percent. The Depot also won a 1995 Federal Quality Improvement Prototype Award. Contact Pat Pierce at (903) 334-2110.<BR>
<B>U.S. Customs Service/National Treasury Employees Union</B>-Customs, working with its partnership team, has successfully streamlined the agency's organizational structure and reinvested resources into enforcement and front-line operations. The result is a jointly-developed reinvestment strategy to deploy additional employees to our nation's borders to beef-up drug interdiction, inspection, and collection of duties on goods entering the country. Throughout this restructuring, the Customs Service has had no reductions-in-force among the 12,000 employees covered by the partnership. Reassignments were voluntary and frequently involved new career opportunities. Contact Ed Banks at (202) 634-2221.<BR>
<B>Dept. of Labor/National Council of Field Labor Locals</B>, <B>AFGE</B>--After years of a traditional adversarial relationship, in 1991 labor and management at this Department achieved a national collective bargaining agreement to cooperate that predates President Clinton's Executive Order 12871 calling for partnership. On beginning a reinvention effort, labor and management agreed that all reinvention activities would be a partnership endeavor. For example, a labor-management team simplified the Federal Employees Compensation claims process. Front-line workers in the Coal Mine Workers Compensation Field Office in Greensburg, PA, are serving claimants better by setting up booths in shopping malls. Otherwise, applicants must file at local Social Security office where no Black Lung specialists are available to provide special help. The Department has won seven Hammer Awards for its partnership successes. Contact Jerry Lelchook at (202) 219-6521.<BR>

<P><B>Other Awards</B><BR>
	The <B>Department of Defense</B> Partnership Council and seven Defense employee organizations received a special citation. Honorable mention went to <B>Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio</B>; the <B>Army Letterkenny Depot, PA; Army Tobyhanna Depot, PA</B>; and <B>Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Palo Alto; CA, Des Moines, IO; and Portland, OR.</B> <BR>
	Office of Personnel Management Jim King is chair of the NPC. For more information about the Council, contact Phyllis Foley at (202) 606-2194.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Conference on Competitive Government Set for March 18</B></H2>
<P>	The Federal Management Institute and the Maxwell School for Advanced Public Management are sponsoring a one-day seminar on public-private competition on March 18 at the Washington National Airport Hilton. The program, &quot;Head to Head: Winning at Competitive Government,&quot; will provide a substantive review of the policy issues and competitive skills that public managers need in the race to work better and cost less.  Call (703) 683-8700 for details.<BR>

<P>
<H2><B>Reinvention Labs and Other Government Innovators Will Showcase Achievements at March 25-27 Conference</B> </H2>
<P>	Reinvention Labs and other innovators will showcase what they are doing to create a government that works better and costs less at a conference on March 25-27 at the Natcher Conference Center in Bethesda, MD. Speakers include Vice President Gore, members of the President's Management Council, union leaders, and reengineering guru Michael Hammer.<BR>
	The conference is aimed at labs, Hammer Award winners, GPRA pilots, other government innovators and anyone who would like to be a government innovator. Sponsors are NPR, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Administration, the Center for Advanced Public Management, the Council for Excellence in Government, and <I>Government Executive</I> Magazine.

<P>
<H1>OMB Deputy Blesses Business Concepts Proposed by the CFO Council</H1>
<P>	John A. Koskinen, the Office of Management and Budget's Deputy Director for Management, agrees with many of the proposals set forth by the Chief Financial Officers Council to encourage federal entrepreneurial organizations, including how to better accommodate staffing needs. The proposals apply not only to federal fee-for-service organizations that operate without appropriations, but also to any business-like, performance-based organization within the federal government.<BR>
	The OMB deputy responded on January 3 to a letter from George Munoz, CFO at Treasury and Executive Vice Chair of the Council. Munoz's letter transmitted a CFO paper, &quot;FTE Support for Entrepreneurial Organizations.&quot; <BR>
	&quot;The 12 standard operating principles for business-like government operations contained in the paper are sound guidance for such activities,&quot; Koskinen wrote. &quot;We endorse the goal that agencies seek operational structures that provide the most cost effective solutions to obtain administrative support services while maintaining accountability to agency senior decisionmakers. Business-like organizations should be accountable for results that focus on outputs and outcomes. Federal business-like enterprises are excellent candidates for 'performance-based organizations' and should have a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess each service which is offered.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Staffing Levels for Business-Like Activities</B><BR>
	The OMB deputy indicated that federal business-like organizations that can demonstrate the need for additional staff and have identified the funds to pay for staff, should be given the FTEs (full-time equivalents) needed to carry out their business-like operations. These organizations should first request the necessary FTEs within their own agency. If agency FTEs are not available, the organization should seek help from the CFO Council in finding FTEs from other agencies.<BR>
	If the interagency alternative does not work, Koskinen wrote that &quot;OMB will give favorable consideration to increases in agency FTE target levels to accommodate the needs of the business-like organization.&quot;<BR>
	To get a copy of the CFO paper and the OMB response or for more information, call Laura Chambon at Commerce, (202) 482-2324.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Formula for Success at &quot;The Center&quot;:  Revenues = Expenses</H2>
<P>	What is part of the Department of Treasury, deals with nothing but money management, but receives no appropriated funds? It's The Center for Applied Financial Management (The Center). Established in 1991, The Center provides highly skilled financial management experts to agencies of all three federal government branches on a reimbursable basis. The Center's product line includes individualized accounting systems support, consultation and advice, financial system products and services, financial management services, and financial education.<BR>
	The concept of a multi-dimensional staff of financial advisors providing service through an entrepreneurial mission has paid off in a big way.  As a franchising operation that sells its services, it is able to operate without appropriated funds.  This pioneering approach has garnered the Vice President's Hammer Award.  The Center was also a semi-finalist in the 1995 Innovations in American Government Awards competition sponsored by The Ford Foundation and Harvard University. <BR>
	To find out more about The Center, contact Laurie Hoard at (202) 874-7037.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Franchising Pilot Applications Are in Pipeline</H2>
<P>	Applications for the first federal franchising pilots are being processed and decisions are expected within the next few months, according to Clyde McShan, Deputy CFO at Commerce who is the chair of the CFO Council's Committee on Entrepreneurial Government. Six franchise fund pilots were authorized by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994.<BR>
	A federal franchising operation sells common administrative services like personnel, procurement, or accounting to other federal organizations. &quot;Franchising is a primary means of establishing entrepreneurial government,&quot; McShan said. &quot;The franchising agency must be self-sufficient, it cannot use appropriations, and it services must be reimbursable.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Out with Internal Monopolies, In with Competition</B><BR>
	&quot;We want to get away from internal monopolies where people are required to use their services,&quot; McShan said. &quot;We want competition. That way we get the biggest bang for the buck. A franchising organization is driven to provide quality customer service. An organization must have a good product at a good rate or it will go out of business.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>Pilot Evaluation Process Is Nearing Completion</B><BR>
	OMB has forwarded applications for the pilots from Commerce, EPA, Interior, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs to House and Senate appropriations and oversight committees for consultation. These applications were favorably evaluated by the Council's committee under a competitive process it developed. Health and Human Services is reworking a proposal and the Federal Aviation Administration sent a very recent proposal that is being evaluated by the Council's committee.<BR>
	For more information  call Laura Chambon at (202) 482-2324.<BR>

The College, one of 19 school systems or academic institutions that applied to participate in a new Baldrige Award Pilot Program in Education, was among three selected for a site visit by a team of six quality education experts last October. One purpose of the pilot is to determine the interest of educational organizations in participating in a national recognition program based on performance improvement.<BR>
	 By law, all acquisitions officials who have responsibility for acquiring weapons systems must attend the College. The College's commandant, Brig. Gen. Claude M. Bolton, Jr., USAF, and Mary-jo Hall, Special Assistant for Quality, are among the presenters this week at the Quest for Excellence VIII, the official conference of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.<BR>
	The Award promotes quality awareness and practices in U.S. businesses. It is administered by the American Society for Quality Control for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  For information about the award, call ASQC at (414) 272-8575. For information about the College, call Mary-jo Hall at (703) 805-3361.<BR>

<H2><B>NASA's TSEI is A-OK!</B></H2>
<P>	If you are a power user of technology like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, how do you ensure that there will be motivated scientists in the future? One approach is the Tri-State Education Initiative (TSEI) that is &quot;taking off&quot; under the auspices of NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Implemented in 1991 and winner of a Hammer Award in December, TSEI is a cooperative effort between NASA and state, local and other federal agencies working for national education reform. Thirty school districts in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee participate in programs designed to involve all age groups in the education system, with emphasis on the sciences. Currently, 102,000 students and 5,600 teachers in 232 schools benefit from TSEI programs.<BR>
	This national demonstration program is centered on the grounds of Tishomingo County High School in Iuka, Mississippi. There, the Tri-State Learning Center boasts one of the 27 sites in the nation using &quot;real time&quot; weather receiving systems for instruction. It is one of only seven sites in the nation selected by the U.S. Department of Education for Staff Development in Science and the only site with an Endangered Species Tracking Program. <BR>
	Dr. David Powe, manager of education programs at the Stennis Space Center had this to say when TSEI was recognized with a Hammer Award on December 1: &quot;We are very excited by this latest honor. This award is designed to recognize work and a team spirit among staff.&quot;  For more information, contact Dr. Powe at (601) 423-7452.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Veterans Agree:  A &quot;Local&quot; is the Best Medicine</B></H4>
<P>	The Tennessee Department of Health has teamed with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide veterans with primary and preventive medical care at the local level. Instead of a 6 or 7-hour round trip to Nashville for treatment, enrolled veterans receive routine medical care locally at the Medical Center for Stewart County, Tennessee. This unique pilot program focuses on the medical needs of dozens of veterans in rural areas of Tennessee and Kentucky that are underserved by medical practitioners.<BR>
	Veterans living in the area who are currently receiving care are invited to enroll by mail. So far, three out of four have accepted the local alternative. These veterans are then eligible for treatment at the Stewart County Medical Center. Technology helps. The local facility retrieves the patients' medical records via computer link with the VA Hospital in Nashville, providing practitioners on both ends of the line with the information they need to make informed decisions.  Instead of the veteran traveling for hours on the asphalt highway, their records travel nanoseconds on the information superhighway. Joy Hunter of the VA Medical Center said, &quot;The patient population here has a great need. We want our veterans to thrive, not just survive.&quot;<BR>
	For details contact Frank Calderala, (615) 340-2392.<BR>

<H4><B>Employees Roundtable Seeks Examples of Government Excellence</B></H4>
<P>	What is innovative, creative or cutting edge at your agency? Public Employees Roundtable wants to know. The Roundtable is seeking nominations for its 1996 Public Service Excellence Awards. These awards honor federal, state, city, county, international, and intergovernmental programs that have made outstanding contributions to public service. Winning organizations will be honored during Public Service Recognition Week, May 6-12. <B>Application deadline is February 15, 1996. </B>Contact (202) 927-5000 or <I>permail@aol.com</I>.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Energy: We've Got Our Customers at Heart</B></H4>
<P>	Red hearts aren't just a motif for Valentine's Day at the Department of Energy this month. Employees are showing their heartfelt appreciation for their customers during the entire month of February, according to Marge Gildenhorn, quality management specialist.<BR>
	The month's observance includes two seminars emphasizing that customer service is everyone's business, an awards ceremony with Secretary Hazel O'Leary on Feb. 15, and an all-day symposium on customer survey tools on Feb. 27. It's a two-way observance: All month, internal and external customers can give out on-the-spot thank-you certificates to those employees who give superior service. Contact Marge Gildenhorn at (202) 586-4699.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Hammer Awards Are Like the Energizer Bunny. They Keep on Going.</B></H4>
<P>	The Vice President's Hammer Awards are given at any time of the year. These awards recognize the outstanding work of federal teams (including those with state and local partners) that are putting customers first, cutting red tape, empowering employees, reforming regulations, and otherwise reinventing government. More than 250 teams have won the award, according to Award Coordinator Jerry Nikolaus. To get an application form and information, contact Jerry at (202) 632-0150 or <I>jerry.nikolaus@npr.gsa.gov</I>. Jerry can send the information by e-mail if you wish.<BR>

<P>
<H4>President Clinton Lauds Federal Worker in State of the Union Address</H4>
<P>	Most federal employees, like other Americans, watched the President's State of the Union Address on Jan. 23 on their television sets. Not Richard H. Dean.<BR>
	Richard, a Social Security claims representative from Oklahoma City, represented the federal workforce as the President's special guest in the House gallery. President Clinton cited the 49-year old Vietnam veteran as an example of one of the &quot;hard-working Americans who are now working harder and smarter than ever before to make sure that the quality of our services does not decline&quot; as the federal workforce shrinks. <BR>
	Richard, after digging himself free from the rubble after a bomb shattered the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995, helped rescue crews locate and carry out his colleagues. He saved the lives of at least three people.<BR>

<P>
<H4>We've Got Excuses--and They're Good Ones</H4>
<P>	The last <I>Reinvention Express</I> (Vol. 1, No. 19) was published on December 8, 1995, and here it is, almost the end of January in a new year, and we're just getting out Vol. 2, No. 1. Furthermore, for reasons about to be explained, many of you will not see this until much later unless you get delivery by e-mail or check out our Web site at <I>http://www.npr.gov</I>.<BR>
	First came the long furlough, then came the wicked blizzard of 1996--make that two blizzards during the same week of January.  When some of us finally returned to our desks at the National Performance Review, we found that our long-awaited new computer network server was being installed. <BR>
The editor's e-mail and FAX directories were a casualty of the upgrade.<BR>
	A team from the E-mail Program Management Office at the General Services Administration saved the day. Team members  set up a list server for the <I>Express </I>and entered as many of the e-mail addresses as we could salvage. We're also soliciting new e-mail customers, so please pass subscription information on to your colleagues.<BR>
	Here's how to subscribe. Send an e-mail message to: <I>Listproc@etc.fed.gov</I>. Put this message: <I>SUBSCRIBE EXPRESS-L@ETC.FED.GOV firstname lastname</I>. (Put a space after the e-mail address and after your first name.) EXAMPLE: <I>SUBSCRIBE EXPRESS-L@ETC.FED.GOV John Doe</I>.

<H4>OPM Calls for Papers for National Conference on Federal Quality</H4>
<P>	The Office of Personnel Management invites quality experts, government reinventors, and others to submit proposals to speak at the 9th Annual Conference on Federal Quality in Washington, DC, June 3-6, 1996.  The theme is &quot;New Realities: Common Sense Government.&quot;  <I>Common Sense Government</I> is the name of the Vice President's latest report to the President on reinventing government. The National Performance Review is one of several conference co-sponsors. <B>Hurry--OPM must receive proposals by Feb. 5, 1996. </B> For information and an application form, call Kim Exeter at (703) 312-7333.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Army Medical Materiel Center Europe Uses Web Site and Team Work to Serve Its Customers Quickly</H2>
<P>
<P><I>In this age of reduced funding, federal managers must consider every economy, every efficiency, in order to deliver high quality services at less cost. Necessity will be the mother of reinvention. Here's a success story about customer service, technology and good management that other federal programs can learn from.</I><BR>

<P><B>	</B>The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center Europe in Pirmasens, Germany uses an Internet Web site (<I>http://www.pirmasens.amedd.army.mil</I>) to list the supplies it sells and to receive orders. Its customers are Army, Navy, and Air Force organizations in Europe and Southwest Asia and embassies in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Some customers are as far away as Bejing and ships at sea. <BR>

<P><B>Rolling Warehouses--Trucking Along</B><BR>
	 Medical staff in hospitals and other sites in Bosnia, Hungary, and Croatia, for example, can track medical supply trucks by computer and even divert supplies--like life-saving antibiotics--off a truck enroute. That's because the Center uses various commercial trucking companies that are outfitted with laptop computers and global pointing receivers (to transmit their location on the highway). The Center updates tracking information and truck contents on its Home Page a couple of times a day, and it's working toward almost instantaneous updates.<BR>
		The Center's pharmacist puts medical notes on the electronic bulletin board so that military pharmacies can keep up with the news like the latest drugs or recalls.  Electronic commerce also means that these pharmacies can order directly from the Center--eliminating a middleman and reducing  pharmaceutical inventories by about $1 million. Orders often come in overnight and the prescription drugs and other supplies are dispatched the next morning. Some locations in Germany get these supplies within hours.<BR>

<P><B>Putting Customers First</B><BR>
	&quot;We don't believe any Defense organization can match us in putting information at the fingertips of our customers,&quot; said Col. Richard Ursone who commands the center. &quot;We meet with customer representatives to find out what they want. We are a one-stop shopping center and we purchased the software for online commerce for a nominal amount.&quot;  The Center also repairs medical equipment like X-ray units and cardiac monitors and manufactures 5,000 eyeglasses a month. The Center depends on team work, performance measures, benchmarks, and a highly-motivated staff to assure high productivity and excellent service. The Command's staff includes about 15 Army civilians, 30 military staff, and 225 German nationals. A co-located medical logistics batallion also works with the Center.<BR>

<P><B>For More Information</B><BR>
 For more information, contact Col. Ursone by e-mail at <I>ursoner@pirmasens-tammis1.army.mil</I> or from the U.S. by phone at<BR>
011-49-633186-7395 (or 6426). <BR>

<H2>Federal Downsizing: Better Workforce and Strategic Planning Could Have Made Buyouts More Effective </H2>

<img alt="pdf" src="/gifs/pdficon.gif"><A HREF="/library/gao/gg96062.pdf">GAO/GGD-96-62 Aug. 26 (75 pages). </A><P>


Although buyouts of up to $25,000 helped federal agencies shrink the federal workforce by almost 230,500 employees (10.5 percent) between January 1993
and March 1996, some agencies report that the downsizing has stretched them too thin, causing work backlogs, a loss of institutional memory, and skill
imbalances. Such consequences could have been avoided had agencies done adequate strategic and workforce planning, which would have increased the
likelihood that employees with needed skills and training were retained. In general, agency officials viewed the buyouts as an effective downsizing tool, allowing
them to reach their downsizing goals with minimal use of reductions-in-force. The buyouts also permitted agencies to downsize without disproportionately
affecting the representation of women and minorities. The largest share of the buyouts was paid to employees who took regular or early retirements. GAO's
analysis of separation trends suggests that some employees may have delayed their departures in order to receive buyouts.

<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>REG05: Streamline Agency Rulemaking Procedures</h2>
<p>
<b>Background</b><p>
In an effort to coordinate policies within each 
agency and within the executive branch, numerous 
layers of review and analyses have been added on top 
of the relatively simple notice-and-comment 
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA). Clearance is required by numerous offices 
within the agency (and again within the department if 
the agency is part of a department) and by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB). As has been 
previously noted, the entire process is repeated 
twice--first at the proposal stage, then again when 
the rule is finalized. After a several-month-long 
study by a contractor, one agency found that it took 
an 18-foot flow chart with 373 boxes to describe its 
then-current rulemaking process.[Endnote 1]
<p>
Another reason for the extensive internal review is 
the fear of litigation challenging the rule. Agencies 
compile extensive records to defend themselves if 
rules are challenged in court--even for issues no one 
has raised during the public comment period. An 
agency can spend considerable resources developing a 
rule only to have it nullified in court because the 
rule was based on an impermissible statutory 
interpretation. If a successful challenge is brought 
after the rule is issued, an entire program may be 
thrown into a state of disarray.[Endnote 2]
<p>
Some agencies have statutory provisions that help 
reduce the amount of litigation preparation needed 
during the rulemaking process. For example, some 
statutes prohibit litigants from challenging a rule 
on any basis other than ones raised during the public 
comment period and require challenges to be brought 
within 60 days of the day the rule is issued.[Endnote 3]
<p>
The straightforward APA notice-and-comment rulemaking 
process has now become so formalized that its 
name--informal rulemaking--seems a misnomer. Some 
agencies, however, have additional statutory 
requirements that make their rulemaking process even 
more cumbersome. For example, the Federal Trade 
Commission is required to conduct trial-type hearings 
that allow cross-examination of witnesses.[Endnote 4]
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
Although different agencies have different internal 
rulemaking processes, within an agency too often the 
same review process is used and the same number of 
clearances are required regardless of the 
significance or complexity of a rule.[Endnote 5] A process 
with numerous checks makes sense for significant rules 
(e.g., ones that announce a major policy, initiate a 
new regulatory program, have a significant effect on 
the economy, or are particularly controversial). 
However, a large number of the thousands of rules 
issued each year are not significant and do not 
warrant extensive review by numerous offices. 
Anecdotal evidence indicates that insignificant rules 
(which may be a clarification of an existing rule or 
a small change needed to undo an unintended 
consequence of an existing rule) often languish on 
reviewers' desks because the rules are not high 
priority and the reviewers are busy with other 
demands.[Endnote 6] Even relatively minor changes to an 
existing program can easily take nine months or more.
<p>
The failure to establish a process that 
differentiates between significant and insignificant 
rules is costly. The current lengthy process 
precludes quick, minor adjustments to existing 
programs, wastes the time of numerous reviewers, and 
frustrates staff responsible for getting the rules 
out and keeping programs functioning. Evidence that 
the rulemaking process has become too cumbersome is 
provided by the frequency with which agency staff 
turn to other methods of establishing agency policy. 
Instead of issuing rules, agencies issue policy 
statements, guidance documents, and memos to agency 
personnel that are often not required to go through 
public comment, extensive internal agency clearance 
or OMB review.[Endnote 7]
<p>
SOME EFFORTS AT STREAMLINING. The Clinton 
administration's regulatory review executive order is 
a major step in streamling the regulatory process. It 
will streamline the review process by requiring the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) 
to review only significant rules.
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has 
made efforts to streamline its process and avoid the 
"double" review process (i.e., all clearances 
required both at proposal and final rule stage) by 
issuing "direct final" rules for certain rules on 
which it believes the public will not comment. 
Although EPA issues many rules that are controversial 
and that benefit from public comment, a significant 
number of rules receive no comments. These rules 
include:
<p>
--minor modifications of existing rules (such as 
  directions about where to submit information or 
  technical changes to testing standards that have been 
  adopted by a professional association);
<p>
--federal approval of changes to a state plan 
  implementing federal law affecting only one or a 
  small group of companies (especially where the 
  federal agency has very little discretion); and
<p>
--"significant new use" rules limited to specific 
  chemicals.
<p>
In this direct final rulemaking approach, EPA 
publishes a notice in the Federal Register saying 
that a rule will become effective in 60 days unless, 
within 30 days, someone submits written notice of an 
intent to file an adverse or negative comment. If no 
such notice of intent is filed, the rule becomes 
final without going through a second round of intra- 
and inter-agency review. If even one person files 
such a notice, EPA withdraws the rule, republishes it 
as a proposed rule, and proceeds with normal notice-
and-comment rulemaking and the second round of 
review. (Republishing the rule as a proposal serves 
two functions. First, it gives an opportunity to 
comment to people who may have kept silent because 
they wanted the rule to go into effect immediately. 
Second, it self-imposes a penalty--additional steps 
and further delay--which serves to prevent the agency 
from overreaching in the use of this technique.)
<p>
This approach avoids the second round of clearances 
and review, which otherwise delays rules, wastes 
time, and should be superfluous (especially if all 
reviewers are warned the first time that the rule 
might go final without further review). Theoretically, 
the second review ought to be very quick, but clearing 
any document through numerous government offices takes
time. The paper shuffling also wastes the reviewers' 
time by requiring them to look at something twice when 
once would have sufficed.
<p>
EPA uses this process routinely in two areas--approval 
of changes to state implementation plans and 
"significant new use" rules for chemicals.
<p>
--In a pilot project testing this procedure for 
  EPA approval of changes to state implementation plans 
  under the Clean Air Act, 90 rules were processed in 
  an average of 181 days, which was considerably better 
  than the 419 days it took to process 81 comparable 
  rules prior to the use of the direct final process.[Endnote 8] 
  For the last 10 years, EPA has used the process 
  nationwide to approve changes to state plans.
<p>
--In 1989, as a result of an informal reg neg 
  process with industry and environmental groups, EPA 
  adopted the direct final rulemaking process for 
  chemical-specific significant new use rules (SNURs) 
  issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act.[Endnote 9] 
  SNURs for at least a hundred chemicals have been issued as 
  direct final rules.[Endnote 10]
<p>
EPA also uses direct final rules occasionally for 
other types of rules. The agency has rarely had to 
withdraw a rule because public comments were filed, 
and no one has ever challenged these rules for 
failure to comply with the APA.[Endnote 11]
<p>
Some agencies have streamlined the process by issuing 
broad, generic rules to resolve common issues or to 
establish standards applicable to multiple industries 
instead of conducting separate rulemakings for each 
issue or industry. For example, the Social Security 
Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
each have successfully issued rules concerning common 
problems arising in disability claims and 
applications for power plants, respectively. On the 
other hand, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration was not allowed by a court to use a 
generic, instead of a hazard-by-hazard, approach for 
permissible exposure levels for air contaminants.[Endnote 12]
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service has established 
categories of rulemaking notices that appear in final 
form in the Federal Register after reduced review. 
For example, when a quota of fish previously 
specified by regulation has been taken in a 
particular fishery, a notice closing that fishery is 
published in the final rule section of the Federal 
Register. Violators of these closure notices may be 
subject to a variety of civil enforcement 
proceedings. These notices are not reviewed by either 
the Department of Commerce or OIRA.[Endnote 13]
<p>
Agencies also conserve agency resources by adopting 
voluntary national consensus standards rather than 
developing criteria 
in-house.[Endnote 14]
<p>
<b>ACTIONS</b><p>
1. Streamline internal agency rulemaking procedures. (1)
<p>
The President should direct heads of regulatory 
agencies to review and streamline their internal 
rulemaking processes. The Regulatory Coordinating 
Group (RCG), in consultation with the Administrative 
Conference of the United States (ACUS), should assist 
the process by providing a forum for agencies to 
exchange information and coordinate hiring of 
contractors (if any are necessary) to avoid 
duplicative efforts. A variety of principles should 
be adopted to streamline the process and reduce the 
cost of issuing rules, including:
<p>
--Agencies should differentiate between 
  significant and insignificant rules and use a shorter 
  process for insignificant rules. The new regulatory 
  review executive order requires OIRA review only for 
  significant rules. Agencies also should strive to 
  group or tier rules and to adjust the process so that 
  the number of steps in the clearance process varies 
  with the significance or importance of the rule.
<p>
--Executive departments (such as the Department of   
  Health and Human Services) should review their 
  internal delegations to determine whether agencies 
  headed by Presidential appointees (such as the Food 
  and Drug Administration) can issue some insignificant 
  rules without departmental review. It might be 
  appropriate to develop a triage system similar to the 
  one in the new regulatory review executive order.
<p>
--Agencies should determine whether there are 
  continuing, unnecessary roadblocks in the process and 
  then determine how to remove them.
<p>
--Agencies should get early input from top 
  policymakers on the choice of regulatory approach to 
  be taken so that agency resources are not wasted 
  drafting regulations that are inconsistent with the 
  desired policies.
<p>
2. Use "direct final" rulemaking to reduce needless 
double review of noncontroversial rules. (1)
<p>
The head of each regulatory agency should use "direct 
final" rulemaking or a similar approach at least once 
in the next year (or explain why it cannot be 
done).[Endnote 16] The direct final process should only 
be used for rules that the agency believes are so 
noncontroversial that no one would file adverse or 
negative comments on the proposal. Under this 
process, the agency would publish a direct final rule 
in the Federal Register. The Federal Register notice 
should explain that the rule would become effective 
in 60 (or some other appropriate number) days if, 
within 30 (or some other appropriate number) days, 
the agency did not receive notice from any person of 
the intention to file adverse or negative comments.[Endnote 17] 
If the agency is notified that adverse comments would 
be filed, the agency would be required to withdraw 
the direct final rule, republish it as a proposed 
rule, and go through the usual notice-and-comment 
procedures.
<p>
3. Develop specifications for rulemaking petitions. (1)
<p>
The heads of regulatory agencies should issue 
regulations specifying what must be in petitions for 
rulemaking and describing the process for filing 
them.[Endnote 18] Such regulations should explain that 
detailed petitions, complete with a text of a proposed 
rule and underlying analyses, may help the agency respond 
to the petition more quickly. Sufficiently detailed 
petitions may form a basis for a notice of proposed 
rulemaking. After a public comment period, the agency 
could then either withdraw the proposal or modify it 
as necessary and adopt it as a final rule.[Endnote 19]
<p>
4. Evaluate and draft proposed legislative changes to 
speed the rulemaking process. (4)
<p>
Heads of regulatory agencies, in coordination with 
the Regulatory Coordinating Group (RCG) and ACUS 
should:
<p>
--identify existing statutes that unnecessarily 
  require cross-examination and other adjudicative 
  fact-finding procedures in rulemakings and should 
  recommend whether the administration should seek 
  legislative changes;
<p>
--identify which, if any, statutes should be 
  amended to limit the amount of time parties have to 
  challenge a rule, or to limit the issues on judicial 
  review to those that were raised during the public 
  comment period, and should recommend whether the 
  administration should seek legislative changes; and
<p>
--recommend whether the administration should seek 
  amendments to ensure that regulatory statutes provide 
  sufficient flexibility for agencies to issue "generic 
  rules" that would settle, in one proceeding, issues 
  that would otherwise recur in numerous separate 
  rulemakings or enforcement proceedings.
<p>
The Chair of the RCG, in coordination with ACUS, 
should study whether:
<p>
--The administration should seek an amendment to 
  the Federal Advisory Committee Act to exempt advisory 
  committees that meet only once from its 
  requirements.[Endnote 20]
<p>
--It would be feasible, useful and constitutional 
  for agencies to be able to seek judicial resolution 
  (similar to a declaratory judgment) by a court of 
  difficult statutory interpretations that are 
  important to resolve before an agency finalizes a 
  rule and expends significant resources.[Endnote 21] If the 
  administration seeks legislation, the procedure to be 
  established should ensure that affected interests are 
  represented and that issues are not presented 
  prematurely (i.e., before the agency has definitively 
  determined that there is an actual problem of 
  statutory interpretation).

Operators reports that a staff member from the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs noted that "the 
Coast Guard's rigorous internal review process 
applies equally to rules of sweeping consequence and 
minor technical guidelines." The American Waterways

7. To a certain extent, the use of such other methods 
allows agencies to differentiate between significant 
and insignificant rules and is a useful development. 
However, there are drawbacks to these methods-- although 
technically these policies cannot bind people outside
the agency, as a practical matter,  they may have 
that effect. Unlike rules (which are published in 
the Federal Register and codified in the Code of 
Federal Regulations), less formal statements 
of agency policy are not necessarily compiled in one 
place and may not be accessible to the public. There 
is a general sense that agencies are turning to 
policy statements and guidance too frequently. See

(1982), p. 46 (unpublished report to ACUS); Anthony,

15. These principles should apply to all agencies 
even though agency processes vary significantly from 
agency to agency, depending, in part, on the agency's 
mission and culture.
<p>
16. Agencies can use direct final rules without new 
legislation, although the process does pose some 
litigation risk. Arguably, direct final rules meet 
the requirements of the APA. However, an argument 
could be made to the contrary. Agencies should 
determine when it is appropriate to take that risk 
after consultation with their general counsels. One 
factor that may make it easier for EPA to use the 
process is the special provisions in the Clean Air 
Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act that require 
anyone challenging a rule to bring the judicial 
challenge within 60 days after the rule is published 
in the Federal Register. 42 U.S.C.   7607(b)(1) (1991 
Supp.); 15 U.S.C.   2618 (1988). Agencies that do not 
want to take the litigation risk associated with 
direct final rules should structure review procedures 
to accomplish nearly the same thing. Instead of a 
direct final rule automatically going into effect 
unless the agency withdraws it, the agency could 
publish in the Federal Register a notice of no 
adverse comment that makes the rule final. Internal 
and OMB review procedures should not require review 
of such a notice if everyone is notified that this 
process might be used.

because the agency has invited rulemaking petitions.

<h2>REG06: Encourage Alternative Dispute Resolution When Enforcing Regulations</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
Disputes constantly arise when agencies enforce 
regulations. Enforcing regulations and encouraging 
compliance with regulatory requirements in the least 
costly, least adversarial, and most effective way are 
crucial to ensuring that the policies underlying 
regulations are implemented.
<p>
Enforcement of regulations often requires substantial 
litigation. Adjudication--the resolution of disputes 
before agency administrative law judges or in federal 
court--is often lengthy, expensive, and highly 
contentious.[Endnote 1] Ultimate outcomes are frequently 
unsatisfactory and may undercut future efforts to 
ensure effective compliance by creating an atmosphere 
of antagonism and distrust. In the long run, 
encouraging compliance is likely to be more effective 
than litigating over enforcement.
<p>
Current enforcement dispute resolution systems tend 
to emphasize litigation, and there are times when 
this emphasis is proper. Regulated entities must 
understand that they must comply with regulations or 
face sanctions. Successful litigation by the 
government may serve as a deterrent to future 
wrongdoing. Ensuring regulatory compliance is, after 
all, a federal law enforcement role.
<p>
However, the fact is that a high percentage of 
enforcement disputes are ultimately resolved not 
through litigation but through settlement 
negotiations.[Endnote 2] There are a variety of reasons for 
this, including inadequate resources to pursue all 
cases through the full litigation process, and 
insufficient or questionable evidence in particular 
cases. Moreover, in some situations, the remedies 
available through the adjudicatory process (be it at 
the administrative level or in court) may not provide 
the optimal practical solutions. Negotiated 
settlements often occur, however, only after 
substantial adversarial maneuvering, or at the 
proverbial "courthouse steps."
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
Various alternatives to litigation and administrative 
adjudication can be useful in resolving a significant 
number of enforcement disputes earlier, with fewer 
resources, and with better results than might 
otherwise occur. Alternative means of dispute 
resolution (ADR) can be an alternative to litigation, 
and it can also serve as an improved way to handle 
negotiated resolutions. Because ADR processes are 
designed to develop consensual solutions to disputes, 
they should reduce contentiousness and may result in 
relationships between the regulators and the 
regulated that are more cooperative and more 
conducive to future voluntary compliance.
<p>
These alternatives encompass a collection of 
techniques designed to help disputing parties resolve 
their conflicts in mutually acceptable ways.[Endnote 3] 
Although the scope of what constitutes ADR varies 
depending on who is using the term, it is generally 
considered to include dispute resolution systems 
where a neutral third party, or "neutral," helps 
parties resolve their dispute.
<p>
ADR has become increasingly popular as a way to help 
resolve the wide variety of disputes involving 
individuals, businesses, and governments. Although 
some variations of ADR have been around for 
centuries, in recent time, court backlogs have served 
as an impetus for wider consideration of ADR 
techniques. Courts (both federal and state) provide 
ADR programs to litigants.[Endnote 4] For decades, labor and 
management have used ADR to resolve disputes. Private 
industry has begun to look to ADR as a way to prevent 
disputes from escalating and absorbing large amounts 
of resources.[Endnote 5] Community-based programs and family 
mediation programs have used ADR processes to address 
interpersonal disputes. An increasing number of 
states have incorporated the use of ADR into courts 
and agencies. As President Clinton said (while 
Governor of Arkansas), "[One] thing we need, in every 
state, is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism 
that would encourage people to look for a way, short 
of litigation, to resolve their disputes."6
<p>
ADR comes in a variety of forms. Some, like 
mediation, are fairly well-known. Others, such as 
minitrials, are less familiar. The more common types 
of ADR include:
<p>
--mediation,
<p>
--early neutral evaluation,
<p>
--factfinding,
<p>
--settlement judges,
<p>
--minitrials, and
<p>
--arbitration.[Endnote 7]
<p>
ADR is generally an appropriate dispute resolution 
mechanism when the dispute is one in which the 
parties might be willing to accept a negotiated 
settlement.[Endnote 8] Because ADR processes are inherently 
flexible, and can be designed to meet the needs of 
the disputing parties, they should be considered in a 
wide variety of cases.
<p>
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT. The Administrative
Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (ADR Act) governs agency use of ADR
in non-rulemaking disputes.[Endnote 9] It reflects Congress' 
interest in and recognition of the potential benefits 
of ADR, and it authorizes and encourages the innovative use of ADR
by providing a flexible framework that agencies can adapt to their 
own needs.
<p>
The Act requires relatively little, but authorizes much.
It requires each federal agency to develop a policy for
using ADR. It directs agencies to review their types of
disputes, how they are currently resolved, and whether ADR 
might be useful. The Act also requires that each agency appoint a
senior official as a "dispute resolution specialist" to 
serve as the coordinator and point person for agency 
ADR activities. These requirements are aimed at 
ensuring that agencies make educated and thoughtful 
decisions about ADR.
<p>
The Act amended the Administrative Procedure Act to 
provide express authority to use ADR where the 
disputants agree to use it. It provides new authority 
for federal agencies to enter into binding 
arbitration, with some limitations. It provides 
statutory protection for confidentiality of ADR 
processes, and contains provisions relating to the 
acquisition of dispute resolution "neutrals."
<p>
Unfortunately, however, agency compliance with the 
ADR Act has been inconsistent. Despite clear success 
stories (see below), some agencies have vacancies in 
the dispute resolution specialist positions mandated 
by the Act or have not appointed to the post an 
official with sufficient rank.[Endnote 10]
<p>
FEDERAL AGENCY USE OF ADR. Over the last decade, some 
federal agencies have begun to give serious attention 
to the use of ADR. ADR has been used by several 
agencies in enforcement cases and other regulatory 
proceedings. Agencies have also used ADR in resolving 
contract, personnel and Equal Employment Opportunity 
disputes. A wide range of agencies--from the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 
Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services to 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and 
the Resolution Trust Corporation--have used ADR. 
Others--like the U.S. Air Force and the Internal 
Revenue Service--are in the planning stages for 
significant ADR programs.[Endnote 11]
<p>
Some of the results of the use of ADR to date have 
been impressive. The Department of Labor last year 
ran a pilot program in one of its regional offices 
using mediation to resolve enforcement cases 
involving the workplace, including cases involving 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) and wage and hour regulations. The 
Department's evaluation of the program demonstrated 
that both agency and industry parties were quite 
satisfied with the use of ADR, and that in many 
cases, the mediated resolution was quicker and better 
than either face-to-face negotiation or litigation.[Endnote 12] 
The Department has recently decided to expand the 
program to all of its regions.[Endnote 13] The Farmers Home 
Administration found that it saved millions of 
dollars using mediation to avoid foreclosures in 
farmer-lender disputes.[Endnote 14] The FDIC saved over 
$400,000 in litigation costs from a small pilot 
mediation program involving creditor claims arising 
from failed banks.[Endnote 15] EPA has had significant 
successes using mediation to resolve Superfund 
hazardous waste cleanup proceedings.[Endnote 16]
<p>
To maintain momentum, a new Presidential directive on 
ADR is needed. The only existing executive order on 
ADR, Executive Order 12778, is not specific enough to 
provide useful guidance to the agencies.[Endnote 17] The 
directive should not only be linked to the ADR Act's 
provisions, but it also should address other 
approaches to encouraging agency use of ADR, 
including increased budgetary incentives, personnel 
appraisal incentives, and streamlined procurement of 
outside neutrals.
<p>
BUDGETARY INCENTIVES. Although the goals of ADR 
include the conservation of resources in the long 
run, it is important that the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) provide agencies with budgetary 
incentives to use ADR. This has at least two aspects: 
ensuring that the resources necessary to develop ADR 
systems are available, and ensuring that budget 
incentives over the long term do not undercut ADR 
use, but rather reward the consensual resolution of 
disputes and discourage the creation of large 
adjudicatory backlogs.
<p>
First, some resources are necessary to develop and 
implement an ADR program. While over the long run, 
ADR should provide savings to both the government and 
the private sector, seed money and personnel 
resources are often needed to get agency systems up 
and running. Thus, at least in the early 
implementation stages, some specific budget for ADR 
implementation may be necessary.
<p>
Second, the criteria for increasing agency budgets 
often provide skewed incentives. For example, 
providing additional resources to an agency with a 
large adjudicatory backlog might remove the incentive 
to reduce that backlog. Moreover, the savings from 
using ADR may not be felt by the same component of 
the agency to which the costs accrue.
<p>
<b>PERSONNEL INCENTIVES.</b><p>
The ADR Act requires that 
the dispute resolution specialist and other agency 
personnel be provided training in ADR.[Endnote 18] This is 
crucial. Although ADR concepts are not extremely 
complicated, those who would use ADR, as well as 
those deciding whether and when to use it, need to 
understand how to participate effectively in these 
processes, understand their benefits, and know when 
it is appropriate to use them.
<p>
Performance evaluation criteria also must provide the 
appropriate incentives to encourage agency personnel 
to use ADR and resolve disputes consensually. For 
example, some agencies give credit in individual 
performance appraisals for the number of cases 
opened, but not for the number of cases resolved or 
the efficiency and effectiveness of resolution. This 
should be altered so that both types of numbers are 
important.
<p>
<b>HIRING OF NEUTRALS.</b><p>
Current contracting processes for 
obtaining a neutral can be extremely cumbersome. 
Neutrals are potentially available from a variety of 
sources. ACUS, for example, has a roster of neutrals 
from which agencies can select.[Endnote 19]
<p>
However, getting a candidate from the roster does not 
obviate the need for a system to hire and arrange to 
pay (if necessary) for the neutral's services. 
Depending on the amount of money involved, a more or 
less complicated competitive bidding system may be 
required. This process is frequently incompatible 
with the short time frames that may be necessary to 
use ADR effectively.
<p>
It is important that agency personnel interested in 
using ADR have access to neutrals in a timely 
fashion. Depending on whether the neutral is someone 
from the same agency, a different agency, or outside 
the government, mechanisms (including ones for 
sharing of neutrals among agencies) should be 
established to ensure ready availability. Agencies 
also have been and should be encouraged to continue 
training their personnel in mediation and related ADR 
techniques, so that they can make use of neutrals 
from their own and other agencies to help resolve 
disputes more quickly and less expensively.
<p>
<b>ACTION</b><p>
1. Increase use of alternative means of dispute 
resolution. (2)
<p>
The President, through directive, should strongly 
encourage agencies to use ADR.[Endnote 20] Governor Clinton 
recognized the need for every state to use ADR 
processes to avoid needless litigation; President 
Clinton should take the opportunity to apply that 
dictum to every federal agency.[Endnote 21]
<p>
Presidential support of ADR is necessary to avoid 
budget incentives that undercut ADR use, to train 
agency staff in ADR, to structure performance 
appraisals to reward proper use of ADR, and to make 
it easier to hire neutrals in a timely fashion. Such 
support would let agency personnel know that they 
should take the dictates of the ADR Act of 1990 
seriously, without infringing on agencies' discretion 
to decide when to use ADR. Presidential leadership on 
this issue is a low-cost but highly effective way to 
engender long-term and widespread acceptance of the 
view that resolving disputes through ADR is not only 
appropriate, it is, in many cases, preferable.

<b>ENDNOTES</b><p>
1. Agencies have varying enforcement authorities. 
Many enforcement statutes permit agencies to bring 
enforcement proceedings before agency "administrative 
law judges" (with judicial review on the 
administrative record in federal court). Other 
agencies must seek enforcement (with the aid of the 
Department of Justice) in federal district court. In 
either case, litigation costs and delays can be a 
concern.

<p>
7. In mediation, a trained neutral third party helps 
disputants negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement. 
A mediator, by talking with each side, together and 
separately, can often help parties come to agreement 
by helping them develop options and explore 
acceptable settlements. The mediator does not have 
the power to decide a dispute; rather, the parties 
must agree to any resolution themselves. Mediation is 
often a component of other ADR processes.
In early neutral evaluation, a neutral factfinder, 
often one with substantive expertise, evaluates the 
relative merits of the parties' cases. After hearing 
an informal presentation of the highlights of 
parties' cases or positions, the neutral provides a 
nonbinding evaluation. This should give parties a 
more objective perspective on the strengths and 
weaknesses of their cases, thereby making further 
negotiations more likely to be productive.
<p>
In factfinding, neutrals determine disputed facts. 
This can be particularly useful where disagreements 
about the need for or meaning of data are impeding 
resolution of a dispute, or where the disputed facts 
are highly technical and would be better resolved by 
experts. Factfinding usually involves an informal 
presentation by each side of its case, whereupon the 
neutral provides an advisory opinion on the disputed 
facts, which can be used by the parties as a basis 
for further negotiation.
<p>
A settlement judge serves essentially as a mediator 
or neutral evaluator in cases pending before a 
tribunal. The settlement judge is usually a second 
judge from the same body as the presiding judge. In 
some cases, a settlement judge may give an informal 
advisory opinion. See Administrative Conference of 
the United States, Recommendation 88-5, "Agency Use 
of Settlement Judges," 1 C.F.R.   305.88-5; Joseph, 
Daniel and Michelle Gilbert, "Breaking the Settlement 
Ice: The Use of Settlement Judges in Administrative 
Proceedings," Administrative Law Journal, vol. 3, no. 
3 (1989), p. 571.
<p>
A minitrial is not really a trial, but a structured 
settlement process in which the disputants agree on a 
procedure for presenting their cases in a highly 
abbreviated form (usually no more than a few hours or 
a few days) to senior officials for each side who 
possess settlement authority. This process allows 
those officials to see first hand how their case, and 
that of the other parties, play out; this can serve 
as a basis for more fruitful negotiations. Often a 
neutral presides over the hearing, and may 
subsequently mediate the dispute or help parties 
evaluate their cases.
<p>
Arbitration is a relatively formal process, in which 
parties jointly select the decisionmaker(s), to whom 
they turn over the decisionmaking. The arbitrator(s), 
after hearing each side's case using procedures 
agreed on in advance by the parties, issues a 
decision. The standards for decision may also have 
been agreed on in advance by the parties. The 
arbitrator's decision may be nonbinding (in which 
case the process resembles neutral evaluation), or if 
the parties agree, it may be binding. See ACUS 
Recommendation 87-5, "Arbitration in Federal 
Programs," 1 C.F.R.   305.87-5 (1993); Administrative 
Conference of the United States, Agency Arbitration, 
Studies in Administrative Law and Procedure 88-1 
(1988) (discussing constitutional and statutory 
issues). Current law contains limitations on the use 
of binding arbitration by federal agencies. See 
section 4 of ADR Act, codified at 5 U.S.C.A.    571-
583 (1993 Supp.).
<p>
8. For example, litigation is necessary if a party 
needs to establish a judicial precedent. If there is 
a fundamental principle at stake that a party is 
absolutely unwilling to negotiate, ADR is likely to 
be unsuccessful. However, since most cases do settle 
eventually, it is important for parties to assess 
carefully whether an issue really is non-negotiable. 
If the costs of ADR would exceed the costs of 
resolution through other means, then other means 
should generally be used. Where a public record of 
the proceeding is needed, ADR may be inappropriate 
(although this concern may be accommodated by 
agreement of the parties). If a program requires 
complete uniformity of outcome, then individualized 
resolutions by the parties might not satisfy that 
need.

and should be employed. Moreover, EO 12778's 
provisions relating to ADR primarily address ADR use 
in court litigation. The Order's mention of 
administrative proceedings (section 3) is limited to 
a citation to an Administrative Conference of the 
United States (ACUS) Recommendation on case 
management that includes a short section encouraging 
ADR use. ACUS, Recommendation 86-7, "Case Management 
as a Tool for Improving Agency Adjudication," 1 
C.F.R. 305.86-7. This is especially weak given the 
opportunities presented by the Administrative Dispute 
Resolution Act, which is designed to facilitate ADR 
use at the agency level.

<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>REG07: Rank Risks and Engage in "Anticipatory" Regulatory Planning</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
Agency planning tends to be short-range rather than 
long-range. There is almost always a new crisis 
demanding immediate attention. The budget cycle is 
annual. Top agency policymakers often are at the 
agency for only two years. All of this gives agencies 
incentives to develop short-term rather than long-
term plans.
<p>
Nonetheless, long-term strategic planning is needed. 
Regulatory agencies have limited resources and 
limited demands they can make on the public. They 
share responsibility with Congress for ensuring that 
the nation gets the most for the money it spends on 
drug safety, the environment, and other matters. This 
requires agencies not only to set strategic goals, 
but also to determine whether those goals are being 
met.
<p>
This, in part, is the impetus behind the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993.[Endnote 1] The Act's 
implementation should do much to advance strategic, 
performance-based planning by the agencies. But 
regulatory agencies should take additional steps to 
plan their future regulatory agendas (especially 
those relating to regulation of environmental, 
health, and safety risks). The potential targets of 
regulations are so many, the implications so large, 
and regulatory resources so comparatively limited, 
that prioritization and long-range planning is 
imperative.
<p>
Regulatory agencies have begun to take some steps in 
this direction. Since 1985, executive agencies have 
been required to submit their planned significant 
regulatory actions to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB), which has published compilations 
annually as the Regulatory Program of the United 
States.[Endnote 2] Unfortunately, however, this process 
was not used as a significant planning document within the 
agencies or within the administration as a whole.[Endnote 3] 
Moreover, the Program was not published in a timely 
fashion; for example, the Program for 1992 was not 
distributed until February of 1993.[Endnote 4] The new 
regulatory review executive order will place greater 
emphasis on planning and will make the annual 
regulatory planning process more meaningful and 
timely.
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has begun a 
process that, although still in its early stages, can 
provide a model for the other 20 or so agencies that 
regulate environmental, health, or safety risks, 
including the Food and Drug Administration, the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.[Endnote 5] Its 1987 report, 
Unfinished Business, was based on an effort by 75 
senior career managers to compare and rank the 
relative risks posed by 31 environmental problems 
regulated by the agency.[Endnote 6] These rankings, while based 
on professional judgments, were limited by incomplete 
data and the infancy of risk comparison 
methodologies. But the effort was a landmark in that 
it crossed programmatic lines and also explicitly 
pointed out the disparity between the rankings and 
the resource allocation at EPA.[Endnote 7] Interestingly, the 
EPA experts' rankings were almost the reverse of 
prevailing public opinion about risk.[Endnote 8]
<p>
In 1990, EPA turned to its Science Advisory Board to 
evaluate Unfinished Business and the agency's 
response to it. The Board's special 39-member 
Relative Risk Reduction Strategies Committee produced 
a report, Reducing Risk, that contained a series of 
recommendations to the administrator on how to 
undertake risk prioritization so that EPA could 
"target its environmental protection efforts on the 
basis of opportunities for the greatest risk 
reduction."[Endnote 9]
<p>
The Carnegie Commission has applauded Unfinished 
Business and Reducing Risk as a "groundbreaking 
enterprise."[Endnote 10] It has specifically recommended that 
"other risk reduction agencies should attempt to incorporate 
into their own decisionmaking and institutional culture 
the global perspective on risk that these reports and 
their implementation embody."[Endnote 11]
<p>
As a by-product of its recent focus on risk prioritization,
EPA has devoted increasing attention to the identification
of future risk. In 1988, the EPA Science 
Advisory Board produced a report, Future Risk: 
Research Strategies for the 1990s, that catalogued 
risk reduction strategies for the future.[Endnote 12] Its 
first recommendation was that EPA should shift its 
regulatory strategy "from end-of-pipe controls to 
preventing the generation of pollution."[Endnote 13] 
Administrator Carol Browner recently announced her 
intention to make "pollution prevention the guiding 
principle for all our programs at the [EPA]."[Endnote 14]
<p>
EPA has also employed its Office of Policy Planning 
and Evaluation (OPPE) to plan for the future. OPPE's 
Office of Strategic Planning and Environmental Data 
has a Futures Staff for this purpose.[Endnote 15] The Office 
also has recently joined with the Science Advisory 
Board to sponsor a new Environmental Futures 
Committee at the behest of Administrator Browner.[Endnote 16]
<p>
Another agency now engaged in risk prioritization is 
the Research and Special Programs Administration in 
the Department of Transportation, which regulates the 
safety of gas, offshore, and hazardous liquid 
pipelines. About 20 to 25 pipeline-related risks will 
be ranked as high, medium, or low as part of this 
initiative.[Endnote 17]
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
As the Carnegie Commission report declared, "the 
fundamental problem in regulatory decision making at 
the agency level, as at the presidential and 
interagency levels, is how to set priorities. It is a 
great challenge for science-based regulatory agencies 
to compare and rank individual risks and families of 
risks within the universe they regulate."[Endnote 18]
<p>
The scope of agencies' regulatory mandates far 
exceeds their rulemaking resources. For example, 
OSHA, which must issue health and safety standards 
for thousands of chemicals, carcinogens, and other 
dangers in most of our nation's workplaces, only has 
sufficient resources to pursue 15 to 20 rulemaking 
efforts at any given time.[Endnote 19] Hence the dire 
need for prioritization. Prioritization by agencies will 
also help inform Congress about agency resource needs and 
may help Congress reorder its own thinking while also 
informing regulated parties about the agency's likely 
future agenda.
<p>
Risk prioritization can help agencies distinguish 
between regulatory targets that demand immediate 
attention and those that allow for mid- or long-range 
corrections. But in this fast-changing technological 
world, regulatory agencies must also begin to 
anticipate future problems before it is too late or 
before an expensive regulatory scheme must be 
imposed.
<p>
For example, EPA is finding solutions now to the 
potential problem posed by the lithium in batteries 
used to power electric motor vehicles.[Endnote 21] OSHA, 
for another example, might have better anticipated the 
workplace stresses and injuries caused by the 
computerized office (e.g., non-ergonomic chairs, 
video display terminal exposure, and carpal tunnel 
syndrome).
<p>
It is a truism to say that tomorrow's regulatory 
problems will likely differ markedly from today's. 
Changes in risk prioritizing must be anticipated from 
numerous sources. New knowledge about the hazards of 
existing technologies (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons or 
CFCs) and exposures (e.g., radon) is always being 
developed. Solutions to one problem may cause another 
(e.g., increased indoor pollution in offices with 
improperly designed energy efficient programs). 
Changes in behavior (e.g., increased use of lawn-care 
pesticides), introduction of new technologies (e.g., 
biotechnology), side effects of government 
intervention (e.g., floodplain management), or 
changes in societal concerns (e.g., greater concern 
about costs or fairness of solutions) all bear on 
future risk regulation. These sorts of changes must 
be anticipated to the greatest feasible extent.[Endnote 22]
<p>
In short, regulatory agencies cannot simply be 
reactive. They must develop ways of, and devote 
resources to, anticipating the need for new research 
or regulatory initiatives--and possibly for new or 
adjusted statutory mandates to forestall or remedy 
those problems.
<p>
<b>ACTIONS</b><p>
1. Rank the seriousness of environmental, health, or 
safety risks. (1)
<p>
Heads of regulatory agencies involved in the 
regulation of environmental, health, or safety risks 
should direct their agencies to rank the seriousness 
of those risks to permit better prioritization of 
their regulatory agendas. This is consistent with the 
new regulatory review executive order, which will 
require agencies to consider relative risks of 
different substances or activities within their 
jurisdictions. How that prioritization can best be 
accomplished should be left to individual agencies.
<p>
EPA's initial use of its program managers with a 
review by outside experts assembled by its Science 
Advisory Board has worked well. An alternate approach 
was espoused by a recent study by the Administrative 
Conference of the U.S. The study, done at OSHA's 
request, urged that agency to establish a formal 
prioritization committee staffed by politically 
sensitive technical experts who would serve staggered 
terms and be eligible for reappointment.[Endnote 23] 
Agencies should compare their own resource allocations 
with their internal risk rankings. Agencies should 
coordinate their development of risk prioritization 
processes and standards through the Regulatory 
Coordinating Group. Once risk lists are better 
developed and tested, they should be compared and 
possibly even coordinated across agency lines.
<p>
No one can pretend, however, that this will be an 
easy task. Analytical methodologies and basic data 
must be improved, and public perceptions of risk 
(which often differ markedly from that of scientists) 
must be factored into the equation.[Endnote 24] Comparing 
various types of health risks with disparate impacts 
on different populations (or human health concerns 
with degradation of ecosystems) requires value 
judgments that may be impossible to quantify. Thus, 
precision in rankings may be unattainable. But 
ranking of risks into high, medium and low categories 
is realistic. The payoffs from such prioritization 
should far exceed the cost of the undertaking. It 
would inform the legislative process (since agency 
priorities are largely statute-driven), the budget 
process, the interagency coordination process, and 
ultimately, the public's understanding of risk.[Endnote 25]
<p>
2. Develop long-range future plans and anticipatory 
approaches to regulatory problems. (1)
<p>
The heads of regulatory agencies should develop long-
range future plans and anticipatory approaches to 
regulatory problems within their jurisdiction. 
Because of the differences in organizational 
structures among agencies, it is not possible to 
dictate just how such anticipatory planning can best 
be built into agency decision-making. Agencies should 
consider creating a staff to address long-range 
planning. Agency officials who serve in such offices 
should also meet under the sponsorship of the 
Regulatory Coordinating Group to discuss approaches 
to the problem.

when members of the public were given short, balanced

the experts' views more closely. Carnegie Commission

<H2>Improving Regulatory Systems</H2>
<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>REG08: Improve Regulatory Science</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
The new regulatory review executive order recognizes 
the importance of basing regulatory decisions on 
strong scientific data. Many regulatory decisions 
made by federal agencies are founded on scientific 
judgments.[Endnote 1] For example, rules concerning 
limitations on airline pilot working hours depend on 
physiological and behavioral science concerning human 
sleeping needs.[Endnote 2] The "age-60" limitation for 
commercial pilots depends on scientific judgments 
about aging and health risks.[Endnote 3] A myriad of 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupation 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) rules and enforcement 
actions depend on the adequacy of scientific 
judgments made by the agency.
<p>
To assist in making scientific judgments, agencies 
rely on both in-house scientific expertise and 
outside scientists. Agencies employ scientists both 
in staff advisory positions and in laboratories and 
research centers.[Endnote 4] Agencies must nurture in-house 
scientific expertise and attract top-flight 
scientists as employees.[Endnote 5] Regulatory agencies have 
also recognized that it is necessary to use outside 
scientific expertise--through the use of specialized 
scientific advisory committees, referral to the 
National Academy of Sciences, or hiring of scientific 
research consultants.[Endnote 6] In addition, the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (in the 
Department of Commerce) provides scientific advice to 
other agencies through interagency coordination.[Endnote 7] All 
of these approaches have their place, and agencies 
need to have the flexibility to use them.
<p>
Generally speaking, however, agency regulatory 
decisions are made by an agency head who is normally 
not a scientist, relying on the advice of program 
officials, administrative law judges, and agency 
general counsels. When decisions are challenged in 
court, they are reviewed by judges, who rarely have 
scientific training. This process is understandably 
regarded as deficient among scientists who follow the 
regulatory process.[Endnote 8]
<p>
This is not a new problem. In the 1970s, proposals 
were advanced for a "science court" procedure to 
determine "the best available scientific judgment" 
for regulatory purposes.[Endnote 9] The premise was that 
scientific and technical determinations could be 
separated from the political and social decisions 
entrusted by Congress to the federal regulatory 
agencies. If so, proponents argued, a panel of 
eminent "scientist-judges" would be better equipped 
to render a decision on the scientific merits than 
non-scientist government officials. Subsequently, 
those officials would deal solely with the socio-
political choices, but in a scientifically informed 
manner.
<p>
Science court proposals have since withered on the 
vine, largely because it is doubtful that scientific 
and policy issues can be separated--in part because 
the process of defining the problem is often 
subjective and frequently laden with political 
considerations.[Endnote 10] This is particularly true in 
connection with risk assessment decisions, which 
often arise in emotionally charged contexts such as 
food safety or occupational or environmental exposure 
to carcinogens, poisons, or radiation. Another 
approach to the problem has, however, been developed: 
the science advisory board.
<p>
<b>EPA's SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD.</b><p>
The EPA has developed 
the most sophisticated, wide-ranging science board 
among the agencies. The Science Advisory Board (SAB) 
in its present form was established in 1978 by 
statute, although predecessor bodies date back to the 
early 1970s.[Endnote 11]
<p>
As a federal advisory committee, the SAB must comply 
with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and related 
regulations. Consequently, the Board has an approved 
charter and must hold public meetings.[Endnote 12] The SAB 
charter provides a succinct statement of the Board's 
purpose: "The objective of the Board is to provide 
advice to EPA's Administrator on the scientific and 
technical aspects of environmental problems and 
issues."[Endnote 13]
<p>
At present the SAB consists of an Executive Committee 
and 10 Committees made up of 80 members, plus 300 
"consultants" who serve on an "as needed" basis.[Endnote 14] 
The SAB operates within EPA as a staff office 
reporting directly to the administrator, directed by 
a career Senior Executive Service (SES) Executive 
Director and 16 other staff members. Its budget is 
approximately $1.7 million.[Endnote 15]
<p>
The Board's activities are quite varied. It takes on 
reviews of scientific issues relating to EPA's 
mandate at the request of Congress, the 
administrator, and program offices as well as on its 
own initiative. In recent years, the Executive 
Director has issued an annual agency-wide 
solicitation of issues.[Endnote 16] Most of the Board's 
work-product consists of reports--most often as a result of 
a requested peer review of an agency document which 
includes findings, recommendations, and answers to 
specific questions addressed to the Board. Perhaps 
the most influential and celebrated SAB report was 
Reducing Risk, produced in 1990 by a special Relative 
Risk Reduction Strategies Committee. Such reports 
typically carry a disclaimer which restates the 
Board's independence within the agency.[Endnote 17]
<p>
Beyond its important role in furthering EPA's risk 
prioritization activities, the recent Board reports 
cover a mix of highly technical (e.g., Review of the 
Drinking Water Criteria Document for Cryptosporidium) 
and not-so-technical (e.g., Review of the draft 
revised Homebuyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon) 
reviews. They also show an increasing interest in 
forward-looking, strategic issues (e.g., Review of 
the Office of Research and Development's 
Bioremediation Research Program Strategy).[Endnote 18] To 
channel this sort of constructive criticism, 
Administrator Carol Browner has requested that the 
Board help the agency anticipate future environmental 
problems. The Board has accepted this request and is 
organizing a new Committee, the Environmental Futures 
Committee, to undertake this effort.[Endnote 19]
<p>
<b>THE FDA SCIENCE BOARD.</b><p>
FDA houses several national 
research centers (e.g., the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation, the Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research, and the Center for Devices and Radiological 
Health). The agency has also historically relied on 
about 40 highly particularized advisory committees to 
assist these centers in looking at particularized 
products, such as over-the-counter drugs, blood 
products, or ophthalmic devices.[Endnote 20] As Commissioner 
David Kessler told the National Performance Review, 
"Virtually every licensing decision of any 
significance in the agency is put before a scientific 
advisory committee."21
<p>
Because of the importance of science advisory 
committees in the agency, the Commissioner in June 
1992 established the "Science Board to the Food and 
Drug Administration."[Endnote 22] The Board consists of 12 
distinguished members (eight from academia, three 
from corporations, and one from a foundation). Other 
temporary members or consultants may be called upon 
to serve when needed, and temporary subcommittees are 
authorized. The Board's Charter provides a broad 
mandate to provide advice on specific technical 
issues and emerging, evolutionary, research 
questions.[Endnote 23]
<p>
In his remarks at the Board's first meeting, 
Commissioner Kessler restated his hope that the Board 
will tackle important cross-cutting scientific 
issues:
<p>
FDA convenes a variety of advisory panels. But this 
one is different from most. For the work you do will 
go beyond one product or one crisis. You are being 
asked to influence the very foundation of this 
agency's work...for decades to come.[Endnote 24]
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
As the Carnegie Commission study Improving Regulatory 
Decision Making states in commending the activities 
of the EPA and FDA boards, "External science advisory 
boards serve a critically important function in 
providing regulatory agencies with expert advice on a 
wide range of issues."[Endnote 25] Yet, with a few other 
exceptions, most regulatory agencies have not 
organized science advisory boards.[Endnote 26]
<p>
Creation of such science advisory boards not only 
should produce regulatory decisions and agenda 
setting that are founded on better science, they 
should also induce greater acceptance of those 
decisions by Congress, the courts, the general public 
and among scientists themselves.
<p>
Regulatory agencies need help in making decisions 
that must be made in a context of significant 
scientific or technical uncertainty. Recent hard-to-
predict questions have arisen, for example, 
concerning the permeability of different grades of 
latex to the AIDS virus or the possible risks posed 
by the sodium azide used in airbags when cars are 
junked. Given the difficulty in attracting top 
scientists into full-time government staff positions, 
the best way to tap into their expertise to answer 
these kinds of questions is to leverage the low costs 
of travel and government per-diem rates into 
formation of a part-time science advisory board.
<p>
<b>ACTION</b><p>
Create science advisory boards. (1)
<p>
The President should require that heads of regulatory 
agencies that conduct rulemaking or other proceedings 
that depend heavily on scientific information and 
judgments create a science advisory board or explain 
why such a board is not needed.
<p>
Agencies which face scientific issues in research and 
development rather than regulatory contexts may have 
other options such as the Federal Coordinating 
Council for Science, Engineering and Technology 
(FCCSET) (proposed for reconstitution as the National 
Science and Technology Council by NPR).[Endnote 27] 
Furthermore, regulatory agencies all have differences 
that may lead to different approaches to considering 
or creating such a board. FDA's reliance on 
scientific advisory committees led to a small 
overarching board, while EPA has an 80-member board 
with 10 committees. But all agencies, especially 
those with regulatory mandates involving risk-related 
questions, should consider creating a board that 
meets their specific needs.[Endnote 28]
<p>
Agencies with less frequent or less pressing 
scientific issues may wish to use established boards 
in other agencies. A fee-for-service program should 
be developed to foster this approach. Moreover, 
agency science boards should be linked to one 
another, perhaps under the sponsorship of the 
Regulatory Coordinating Group or the President's 
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).[Endnote 29] 
Such a linkage will facilitate synergy among the 
boards and will help agencies identify cutting-edge 
and other issues that would benefit from review by a 
quasi-independent board of outside scientific 
experts.
<p>
Agencies that do create such boards need to pay 
attention to their staff support as well.[Endnote 30] 
They need not be expensive propositions. Although EPA's 
mega-board has an annual budget of $1.7 million, the 
charter for the FDA Board estimates the annual cost 
of travel, compensation, and staff support to be less 
than $100,000. Both of these amounts seem like 
bargains, given the tremendous cost implications of 
EPA and FDA scientific decisions.

The quality of the research, development,

can be substantially improved. To do so, agencies 
must recruit and retain first-rate scientists and 
engineers, provide them with 
state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, 
and give them the resources necessary to 
carry on research of the highest quality. 
Where internal capabilities are weak, bridges should 
be built to allow access to the best scientists and

technical and scientific evolutions in the fields of 
regulatory science; on formulating an appropriate 
research agenda; and on upgrading its scientific and 
research facilities to keep pace with these changes. 
It will also provide the means for critical review of

Science Board, Energy Research Advisory Board, NASA 
Advisory Council, and a bureau with the State 
Department). An NPR survey disclosed that the 
Minerals Management Service with the Department of 
Interior also has a science board.

and Technology Policy (OSTP). According to the 
Carnegie Commission's study, "FCCSET's influence has 
varied over the past decade." Carnegie Commission 
report, supra, note 6 at p. 40. NPR is recommending 
that the President issue an executive order and 
propose legislation to reconstitute FCCSET into the 
National Science and Technology Council, giving it a 
broader role in setting since and technology policy.

Foundation/Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
"NSF01: Strengthen Coordination of Science Policy."

National Academy of Sciences report, Risk Assessment 
in the Federal Government: Managing the Process (May 
1983), Recommendation 3, p. 156. See also the 
proposal by the American Industrial Health Council 
(AIHC) that the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) create a science advisory 
committee, AIHC Proposal for an Ad Hoc OSHA Science 
Advisory Committee (August 28, 1990).
<p>
29. The Carnegie Commission report suggested that 
OSTP play a leading role in policy decisions 
involving scientific and regulatory decisions.

<p>
30. With respect to staffing, Bruce Smith has argued:
At a minimum the necessary elements seem to include 
the following: a full-time secretariat consisting of 
several persons; additional staff support, preferably 
drawn from the rest of the agency, for each separate 
task group established; an adequate budget, including 
some funds for travel, consultants, and contract 
research; and a career pattern within the agency that 
makes a support role to the advisory board a 
desirable assignment (both for promising younger 
officials and for senior people). The advisory 
board's secretariat should comprise persons with 
enough stature to permit easy interaction with other 
senior executives in the agency (both appointive and 
career) and with the committee members.

<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>REG09: Improve Agency and Congressional Relationships</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
Much of what an agency can or cannot do to solve a 
problem is dependent on the legislation that Congress 
passes requiring or authorizing an agency to take 
action. Agencies often complain that statutory 
constraints imposed by Congress are major impediments 
to more efficient, effective, and sensible 
regulation.
<p>
Legislation that is overly restrictive, too detailed, 
or poorly conceived or drafted leads to a number of 
problems. It can force agencies to spend resources on 
minor or nonexistent problems while major problems 
remain unaddressed. It is normally the agency that is 
blamed for issuing "bad" regulations--the agency's 
defense that Congress gave the agency no choice may 
not be heard.[Endnote 1] "Bad" regulations gradually destroy 
the credibility of the agency and are likely to make 
even its good regulations less acceptable.
<p>
Problematic legislation comes in a variety of forms. 
First, legislation may require an agency to issue 
regulations that do not solve a problem and, 
therefore, do not benefit society at large. For 
example, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 
1982 required the Secretary of Transportation to 
issue regulations requiring "splash and spray 
suppression devices" (fancy mud flaps) on trucks to 
decrease the amount of spray from trucks that could 
hinder visibility for car drivers.[Endnote 2] The Department 
of Transportation's (DOT) testing determined that the 
fancy mud flaps decreased the amount of spray on car 
windshields to such a slight degree that it did not 
improve the car driver's visibility and, thus, had no 
safety benefits. DOT, however, had no alternative 
other than requiring fancy mud flaps or seeking a 
statutory change.[Endnote 3]
<p>
Second, overly restrictive legislation does not allow 
agencies to change regulations as circumstances 
change. For example, Congress may require a 
regulatory scheme based on a particular assumption of 
cause and effect. If further research shows that 
assumption to be false, the agency may not be allowed 
to change its approach accordingly and may impose 
unnecessary costs on the economy.
<p>
Third, legislation that requires command-and-control 
or overly detailed regulation may be preventing the 
agency from using or developing an innovative 
approach that would be more effective or efficient.
<p>
Fourth, legislation may impose unrealistic (if not 
outright impossible) deadlines, which either make the 
agency look bad when the deadlines are not met or may 
preclude the agency from doing the necessary 
background work for the rule.[Endnote 4] In 1990, the General 
Accounting Office studied three statutes that 
required the Department of Education to issue 83 
regulations in 240 days. The sheer volume and 
complexity of the legal and policy issues involved 
made it virtually impossible for the Department to 
issue the regulations within the statutory 
timeframe.[Endnote 5]
<p>
Fifth, legislation may have unintended consequences. 
For example, a statute might inadvertently preclude 
the most common device for meeting a statutory goal 
by setting requirements that the device cannot meet.
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
Legislation that is overly restrictive, too detailed, 
or poorly conceived or drafted results from a variety 
of circumstances, some of which are not unique to the 
regulatory process--distrust between the executive and 
legislative branches, lack of congressional technical 
expertise, congressional failure to understand the 
difficulties in implementing a regulatory program, 
and lack of common understanding of complex issues 
between the legislative and executive branches. This 
general problem as it relates to regulatory problems 
is briefly discussed here. A more comprehensive 
discussion of relations between the executive and 
legislative branches and recommendations for 
improving them is contained in the National 
Performance Review Accompanying Report Creating 
Quality Leadership and Management.[Endnote 6] 
<p>
Distrust between executive and legislative branches 
is one of the major reasons for legislation that is 
overly restrictive, too detailed or poorly conceived 
or drafted. Some tension in the relationship between 
Congress and the executive branch is inherent in our 
system (especially when two branches are controlled 
by different political parties). Agencies should 
perceive Congress as an entity that imposes 
constraints on the executive. That is a result of the 
checks and balances established in the Constitution.
<p>
Nonetheless, the tension between the executive branch 
and Congress has risen too high.[Endnote 7] A panel of the 
National Academy of Public Administration recently 
concluded that, "[t]he outright confrontation and 
increasingly competitive relationship between the two 
branches has a high cost: a political system more and 
more unresponsive to national problems and 
unaccountable to the American people for addressing 
those problems."[Endnote 8] It is time to find a better 
balance.
<p>
Congressional distrust of agencies affects 
legislation in a variety of ways. In the past decade, 
Congress was motivated to write overly prescriptive 
legislation because it feared that an administration 
that disagreed with congressional policies and goals 
would substitute administration policy for 
congressional policy when statutes were ambiguous or 
flexible.[Endnote 9] Congressional concerns about agencies' 
inability to issue regulations in a timely fashion, 
exacerbated by the perception that the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) was holding up agency 
rules, resulted in Congress imposing statutory 
deadlines with "hammers" (like that for the food 
labeling rule) that would impose rigid statutory 
obligations on private parties if the deadlines were 
not met.[Endnote 10]
<p>
Some problems in legislation also result from a lack 
of understanding about how agencies work, emerging 
issues, or the arcane details of existing programs. 
Very few Members or Hill staffers have worked in 
agencies or appreciate the complexities of 
implementing the statutes they write. Agencies have 
expertise that Congress lacks in specific fields and 
about the details of existing programs. Although many 
Members and Hill staffers become quite knowledgeable 
about programs they oversee, when new issues or 
scientific breakthroughs occur, Congress and the 
administration (as well as federal judges) often lack 
a common understanding of the problems and emerging 
issues (including an understanding of where the 
experts disagree).[Endnote 11]
<p>
When the administration supports legislation, agency 
staff provide technical expertise and drafting advice 
to Congress. This help can be very useful to Congress 
and, thus, to the agency. It sometimes comes too 
late, however, because of the time it takes to reach 
an administration-wide policy on legislation.[Endnote 12] 
In addition, in the past, some agencies refused to give 
assistance if the administration disagreed with the 
legislation. When such legislation passed, though, 
agencies had to implement it--whether or not they had 
been able to correct technical glitches.
<p>
Other agencies have taken steps to diminish drafting 
problems, even with legislation with which the 
administration disagrees. The Department of 
Agriculture provides a technical drafting service to 
Congress. Upon written request from a member of 
Congress or a congressional committee, staff 
attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel will 
draft proposed legislative language implementing the 
requested policy. After clearance within the General 
Counsel's office, the proposed language is sent back 
to Congress. The Department makes it very clear that, 
even though its staff has drafted the legislation, 
that does not mean that the administration supports 
the legislation. The service is provided to all 
requesters regardless of the administration's 
position.[Endnote 13] The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
the Minerals Management Service of the Department of 
Interior provide similar services.[Endnote 14]
<p>
In addition to enhancing an agency's relationship 
with Congress, providing technical drafting cuts down 
on the unintended consequences of legislation. When 
the policy goal is to change a program only 
partially, the agency's experts are more likely to 
know how to limit or minimize changes to other parts 
of the program. The agency's experts should also be 
more sensitive to implementation problems.
<p>
At first blush, it may seem strange to offer to draft 
legislation with which the agency may disagree, but 
USDA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Minerals 
Management Service do not believe that doing so has 
resulted in legislation passing that would not 
otherwise have done so.[Endnote 15] Although helping to 
draft legislation does provide some assistance to the 
legislation's proponents, it also helps the agency. 
If the agency experts do not draft or comment on 
statutory language, it is likely to be written by 
someone with less understanding of the program, of 
the ramifications of the legislation, and of 
implementation problems.
<p>
<b>ACTION</b><p>
Establish technical drafting services for 
congressional committees and subcommittees. (1)
<p>
Agency heads should require their agencies to provide 
technical drafting services to chairs and ranking 
members of congressional committees and subcommittees 
and to the House or Senate Office of Legislative 
Counsel as a method of avoiding unintended 
consequences of legislation. It is important that 
such service be provided regardless of the 
administration's substantive policy position. 
If responses have to wait for determination of 
administration policy, such a service would not be 
effective because it will not provide timely input 
into the legislative process. Because an agency may 
have to implement legislation with which it 
disagrees, it should strive to fix technical glitches 
that may cause implementation problems. Furthermore, 
if the agency provides the service to all comers, 
responses cannot be interpreted as an early 
indication of administration support (which could 
happen if agencies only provided assistance in 
response to select requests).
<p>
To ensure that it is the agency, rather than the 
individual staff members, assisting Congress, the service 
should have the following safeguards built in:
<p>
--An agency will designate an office or senior 
  agency official (perhaps the congressional liaison 
  office or the general counsel's office) as the 
  clearinghouse for all technical drafting services.
<p>
--Although legislative language normally would be 
  drafted or revised by the agency's technical experts, 
  it should then be cleared by an appropriate senior 
  agency official (or officials). Given the time-
  sensitive nature of the legislative process and the 
  fact that policy clearance is not needed, the number 
  of levels of clearance should be very limited.
<p>
--Requests for statutory language and responses 
  containing such language will be in writing.

--Upon providing the response, the agency shall 
  instruct the congressional committee to disclaim that 
  technical drafting services indicate administration 
  support.

1. For example, President Bush faced a very difficult 
political problem in the summer and fall of 1992. The 
National Corn Growers Association and the ethanol 
industry claimed that a rule proposed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would preclude 
ethanol mixed with gasoline from meeting a federally 
ordered program requiring cleaner-burning 
reformulated gasoline. They wanted EPA to allow a 
special waiver for gasoline mixed with ethanol. The 
fact that the Clean Air Act did not allow EPA to 
grant the requested waiver did not stop this 
political pressure, nor did it stop a Sense of the 
Senate resolution [Congressional Record, Senate

Bush Administration's proposed rule. Rosewicz,

<H2>Improving Regulatory Systems</H2>
<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>REG10: Provide Better Training and Incentives for Regulators</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
A regulatory system is only as good as the people 
implementing it. A well-trained and informed cadre of 
regulatory officials is crucial for an efficient, 
innovative regulatory system, that emphasizes choice 
of the appropriate regulatory approach. Inadequate 
training can result in errors, no matter how 
intelligent and well-meaning the officials may be. No 
current programs provide the training necessary to 
effect the needed major changes in the federal 
government's regulatory culture.[Endnote 1] Proper training 
and performance incentives are needed to ensure that the 
agency officials involved in regulatory activities 
are as effective as possible.
<p>
As is well known, presidential appointees have widely 
diverse backgrounds and familiarity with the federal 
government. Many (but not all) are well-versed in 
their agency's substantive program, but few 
appointees can be expected to know, at the time of 
their appointment, the details of the arcane statutes 
and rules that govern the agency's rulemaking 
procedures.[Endnote 2] Yet a lack of understanding of these 
rules can slow and possibly trip the most eager of 
new appointees. It is crucial that this blank slate 
be filled quickly since studies show that nearly half 
of all presidential appointees leave office within 
two years--hardly enough time for them to develop a 
meaningful understanding on their own.[Endnote 3]
<p>
There have been some attempts in the past to furnish 
training to presidential appointees. Based on a 1975 
recommendation, the Administrative Conference of the 
U.S. (ACUS) provided a three-day seminar for 
commissioners of the independent regulatory agencies 
in 1977.[Endnote 4] It covered a broad range of topics relating 
to regulation.[Endnote 5] No such systematic programs have been 
held since. ACUS has also more recently provided 
shorter, day-long or half-day programs on various 
aspects of administrative law and procedure relevant 
to regulatory commissioners. A continuing, 
comprehensive approach is needed, however.
<p>
Some limited training opportunities do exist for 
career staff. The Legal Education Institute (LEI) 
within the Department of Justice's Office of Legal 
Education presents courses for government lawyers. 
The Federal Executive Institute provides management 
training for the Senior Executive Service (SES), and 
some federal officials have attended courses at the 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. A 
few outside firms also provide training courses. 
These opportunities are limited, both in number and 
in scope, and fall short of ensuring that all 
relevant personnel are familiar with the pertinent 
laws and processes.
<p>
Career regulators and Hill staff often lack a broad 
perspective about the regulatory process because 
career paths are often confined to one agency. 
Rotational assignments among agencies in the 
executive branch and among the branches are not 
common. Although some programs accomplish some of 
these goals for entry level officials, such as the 
two-year Presidential Management Intern program, 
there are no established inter-agency or inter-branch 
career paths for regulatory professionals.[Endnote 6] Such 
officials do not have any real incentive to seek 
rotational assignments, since it is the person's 
"home-base" agency that continues to conduct 
performance appraisals and absence is not likely to 
"make the heart grow fonder." Members of the SES also 
theoretically have this opportunity but they are 
often in such high-level positions that there is 
little incentive for them to seek or be permitted to 
accept rotational assignments.
<p>
<b>NEED FOR CHANGE</b><p>
Despite the increasing complexity of the regulatory 
process, little or no relevant training is currently 
available for regulatory officials. High-level 
policymakers, particularly those who are Presidential 
appointees, are often provided no training or 
background in the laws and processes they must 
follow, and career staff have access only to limited, 
and often inadequate, training opportunities.
<p>
The lack of training for presidential appointees is 
all the more glaring given the availability of 
intensive orientation to members of Congress and the 
federal judges.[Endnote 7] Indeed, a survey by the National 
Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) reported that 
79 percent of presidential appointees received no 
orientation of any kind.[Endnote 8] As NAPA has concluded:
<p>
It is hard to imagine that anyone could regard this 
disinterest in the orientation of new presidential 
appointees as a sound way to run the federal 
government. We believe the historical absence of such 
programs is a matter of great concern, a problem that 
should be permanently corrected.[Endnote 9]
<p>
With respect to career regulatory staffs, the 
situation is only somewhat better. Training for non-
lawyer career staff is hit-and-miss. The Legal 
Education Institute (LEI) does an excellent job of 
training agency lawyers on a variety of issues, a 
number of which relate to agency rulemaking and 
regulation. These courses have typically been one-day 
courses held in Washington, D.C. About 95 percent of 
the roughly 4,000 LEI attendees in 1991 were from 
Washington, D.C.[Endnote 10] Rather than having its own 
paid teaching staff, the institute typically relies on 
professionals from throughout the government to 
volunteer to teach courses in their areas of 
expertise.
<p>
Unfortunately, recent Department of Justice 
appropriations legislation required the Institute to 
be moved to Columbia, South Carolina, as part of a 
move of the entire Office of Legal Education.[Endnote 11] 
As a result, it is expected that either attendance by 
agency staff lawyers will drop significantly or 
training costs will rise significantly to cover the 
increased travel costs to send personnel to South 
Carolina (as opposed to across town).[Endnote 12] Moreover, 
LEI's travel expenses for faculty would increase, 
since almost 95 percent of the faculty were from 
Washington, D.C., and it is unlikely that as much of 
the necessary administrative law and regulatory 
expertise would be locally available in South 
Carolina.
<p>
In addition to training, a broad outlook on 
regulatory issues and first-hand awareness of a 
variety of perspectives can be extremely useful in 
developing regulatory programs. Providing select mid-
level career staff an opportunity to spend time at 
different agencies, on Capitol Hill, at the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), and/or in the judicial 
branch would provide those people and their agencies 
with extremely useful expertise for effective 
implementation of regulatory programs. They would 
discover how other agencies approach similar 
problems, what Congress' perspectives are, how the 
judiciary looks at regulatory issues as they come 
before the courts, and how OMB approaches problems of 
regulation. In addition, the quality of communication 
and coordination among agencies, Congress, and OMB 
might be improved through increased and ongoing 
contact. Also, the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), as a centralized locus for 
regulatory review, could be a place to train agency 
staff. Agency staff could learn not only what 
Presidential review entails and the technical skills 
involved in regulatory analysis, but also how other 
agencies address various regulatory problems.
<p>
The need for this type of rotation has been 
increasingly recognized. Judge Stephen Breyer, in his 
new book on improving risk regulation, called for a 
"circulating career path" for "(eventual) high level 
executives," modeled on France's Conseil d'Etat.[Endnote 13] 
As Judge Breyer visualized it, an OMB "special group" 
could be created with a special civil service career 
path leading though agencies, congressional committee 
staffs, back to OMB, with possible presidential 
appointments for the most successful members. Such a 
concept would not only augment OMB (especially OIRA's 
capabilities), it would "seed" the government with 
experts in broader regulatory issues.
<p>
<b>ACTIONS</b><p>
1. Establish a basic training program for 
Presidential appointees to regulatory agencies. (2)
<p>
The President should direct political appointees to 
regulatory agencies to attend a comprehensive 
training program on the issues and processes involved 
in regulatory development. The President should 
direct ACUS, which has expertise in the 
administrative adjudication and rulemaking processes 
and access to experts across the federal government 
and academia, to establish such an ongoing training 
program for presidential appointees. Among the topics 
that should be included in the curriculum are:
<p>
--role and organizations of regulatory agencies,
<p>
--personnel management,
<p>
--alternative regulatory approaches,
<p>
--the budget process,
<p>
--program evaluation,
<p>
--policy formation and the rulemaking process,
<p>
--the Administrative Procedure Act and various 
  other applicable statutes and executive orders,
<p>
--the relationship between agency rulemaking and 
  settlement,
<p>
--the relationship between regulatory agencies, 
  the White House and OMB,
<p>
--cost-benefit analysis use (but not abuse),
<p>
--judicial review,
<p>
--relationships with the public, the press, and 
  the state and local governments,
<p>
--regulatory reform, and
<p>
--alternative dispute resolution.[Endnote 14]
<p>
Faculty could include representatives. from the White 
House, Congress, various federal agencies, the 
federal judiciary, OMB, academia, and industry. 
Training programs should ideally be held at a site 
outside of Washington and should last for at least 
three days. They should be organized on a periodic 
basis, most frequently in the first half of the 
administration as new appointees are nominated or 
confirmed.
<p>
2. Move training programs for agency regulatory 
lawyers back to Washington, D.C., and expand to cover 
other career staff. (3)
<p>
Legislation should be enacted to move the Legal 
Education Institute (LEI) back to Washington, D.C. 
LEI should be expanded to non-lawyer career staff. 
Moving LEI back would generate substantial cost 
savings, some of which could be used to expand the 
program.[Endnote 15] Moreover, the administration should 
consider whether to incorporate LEI into ACUS, since 
a large portion of LEI's courses relate to various 
aspects of administrative law and process, which are 
ACUS's areas of expertise. In fact, ACUS currently 
coordinates several LEI courses. LEI's existing 
courses, supplemented with more focused ones on, for 
example, alternative dispute resolution techniques, 
could provide some of the necessary training for 
federal career regulatory officials.
<p>
3. Establish an "honors" rotation program for select 
mid-level career staffers. (1)
<p>
As the Carnegie Commission recently recommended:
<p>
The federal government should use its existing 
personnel authority to create opportunities for 
selected individuals to rotate in the early years of 
their career through environmental and risk-related 
regulatory agencies, Congress, the Executive Office 
of the President, and, in some instances, 
administrative offices of the Judiciary.[Endnote 16]
<p>
The Chair of the Regulatory Coordinating Group, in 
coordination with the Office of Personnel Management, 
should be charged by the President with developing an 
"honors" rotation program for select mid-level agency 
and congressional career staff involved in regulatory 
programs. In the meantime, key agencies with cross-
government mandates like OIRA in OMB should develop, 
on their own, strategies for rotating and exchanging 
staff with regulatory agencies.
<p>
4. Reward innovative regulators. (1)
<p>
The heads of regulatory agencies should ensure that 
achievements by federal officials in performing 
regulatory functions are rewarded, through 
performance appraisals, bonus systems, and awards. 
Performance appraisals and bonus systems within 
agencies should recognize achievements in innovative, 
consensus-based, and effective regulation.

7. In this environment, regulatory appointees need 
and should be provided an orientation, as early as 
possible, in the basics of administrative law. Newly 
elected Congressmen are offered intensive orientation 
courses by the congressional leadership, by outside 
seminars at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of 
Government or by other non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs). Newly appointed federal judges have similar 
offerings available to them at the National Judicial 
College (located at the University of Nevada - Reno) 
and by the Federal Judicial Center. Even career civil 
servants have at least some opportunities for 
intensive training (at OPM's Federal Executive 
Institute and the USDA Graduate School, or the 
Harvard JFK School). Presidential appointees, 
ironically, are the only major regulatory actors who 
do not receive orientation and basic training.

and a budget of $9 million. While an argument can be

inadvertent. Because AGAI and LEI do not overlap and

<HR>
<H2>Improving Regulatory Systems</H2>
<p> Recommendations and Actions
<HR>
<P>
<h2>Description of the Executive Order on Regulatory Reform</h2>
On January 21, 1993, President Clinton abolished the 
Council on Competitiveness and soon thereafter asked 
the Vice President to prepare recommendations for a 
new process of regulatory review. The Vice President 
convened an informal working group to develop such 
recommendations. The President will soon issue a new 
executive order to implement the needed reforms 
recommended by the Vice President.
<p>
President Clinton's plan to reform the regulatory 
review process is firmly rooted in his commitment to 
make government more efficient and responsive, 
relieve businesses of unnecessary regulatory burdens, 
and end special access for special interests.
<p>
The executive order on regulatory planning and review 
will create a process that guarantees that government 
regulates only when necessary, and that when it does 
so, it regulates cost-effectively, openly, and 
fairly. It also will ensure that all agencies of the 
federal government participate in a reexamination, 
across agencies, of the overall regulatory scheme 
currently in place to eliminate any unnecessary 
regulatory burden.
<p>
<b>Putting People First</b><p>
The President's plan provides a regulatory process 
that works for the American people, not against 
them--one fundamentally dedicated to improving their 
health, safety, environment, and well-being while 
encouraging economic growth and job creation. It is 
aimed at producing regulations that are effective, 
consistent, and understandable.
<p>
<b>Regulating Only When Necessary</b><p>
The process created by the executive order sets forth 
principles that ensure that agencies regulate only 
when necessary. It makes clear that alternatives, 
such as market incentives, are preferable to command-
and-control regulations. A regulatory working group 
of representatives from agencies with major domestic 
regulatory responsibility will meet regularly to 
consider new, creative, and more effective 
alternatives and approaches to regulating.
<p>
When regulations are necessary, the order will ensure 
that they are designed and implemented in the most 
cost-effective manner, so as to maximize benefits to 
society and to place the smallest possible burden on 
those being regulated. This process imposes a 
sensible, balanced definition of costs and benefits 
to ensure a realistic assessment of impacts on the 
economy, the environment, and public health and 
safety.
<p>
<b>Sensible Planning</b><p>
The executive order creates an enhanced planning 
process that starts before rules are formally 
initiated. This process will provide early guidance 
about administration priorities, thus minimizing 
conflicts and inconsistent regulatory activities 
among agencies. Agencies will set priorities and 
assemble annual regulatory plans, thereby improving 
their own internal planning, and ensure that other 
agencies and the public are informed of their 
activities.
<p>
<b>Reviewing New Regulations</b><p>
This executive order recognizes the primacy of 
agencies in the regulatory process. It also makes 
clear that the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA), within the Office of Management and 
Budget, will be the day-to-day entity responsible for 
necessary centralized review.
<p>
The centralized review process will be improved by 
selectively reviewing regulations. Under the review 
process, OIRA will review significant regulations--not 
every regulation. Its review will be more useful and 
realistic because it will be focused on the overall 
regulatory picture and will consider a broad 
definition of costs and benefits. And its review will 
be timely--driven by clear and appropriate time limits 
on review that will prevent interminable delays.
There also will be a clear process for resolving the 
rare regulatory disputes that develop between 
agencies or between OMB and an agency. Such disputes 
will be reviewed by the President only at the request 
of an agency head or the Office of Management and 
Budget. The Vice President, aided by appropriate 
White House policy advisors, will advise the 
President in resolving these disputes.
<p>
<b>Reviewing Existing Regulations</b><p>
Too often, cumulative and unnecessary regulatory 
burdens hamper economic growth and job creation. In 
order to ease such adverse effects on U.S. citizens 
and the economy, a process will be established to 
conduct an ongoing review of existing regulations or 
groups of regulations. Those regulations that are 
cumulative, obsolete, duplicative, or inconsistent 
will be identified for reconsideration and revision 
or elimination.
<p>
This process is carefully structured to be meaningful 
and to get results. The agencies will be asked to 
prepare a specific program for ongoing review of 
existing significant regulations and legislation that 
requires regulations that should be reviewed. In 
addition, the Vice President, in consultation with 
the White House advisors, will conduct reviews of 
existing regulations with a cross-agency perspective, 
and may identify regulations to the agency for 
review.
<p>
<b>Enhanced Accountability</b><p>
The executive order also will enhance government 
accountability in a number of ways. It will clearly 
delineate the responsibilities of the various 
entities involved in the regulatory review process. 
The OIRA review process will be conducted in the 
"sunshine."
<p>
The order requires public disclosure of OIRA meetings 
with, or information received from, outside parties. 
It also ensures that the public knows of the status 
of all pending regulations and changes made to 
regulations during the OIRA review process.
<p>
The process created by the new order also will end 
the "back door" special interest access to the review 
process. The order makes clear that the President's 
and Vice President's roles in the review process is 
limited to (1) providing leadership, (2) assisting in 
planning, and (3) resolving disputes. They will not 
act on behalf of, or be the conduit for, special 
interests or any private parties.

<Title>Reengineering Through Information Technology</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<HR>
<H2>Reengineering Through Information Technology</H2>
<p>
 <b>Executive Summary</b>
      When it comes to information technology, horror stories abound in 
 both the public and private sectors.  In some cases, the federal 
 government is woefully behind the times, unable to use even the most 
 basic technology to conduct its business. At one point, for instance, 
 three Agriculture Department bureaus were supposed to share a computer 
 system toimprove the management of food and subsidy programs. Five years 
 later, they still could not resolve differences over testing, 
 installation, and maintenance. 
<p>
      In society at large, the widespread use of new technology has 
 caused problems that include threats to personal privacy and safety. In 
 Brooklyn not long ago, crooks used a hidden video camera to watch people 
 withdrawing money at ATM machines. By recording personal identification 
 numbers, the cameras helped the crooks later make unauthorized 
 withdrawals. 
<p>
      Nevertheless, information technology has brought the convenience of 
 revolutionary change to everyday life, from ATM machines at banks to 
 global transfers of funds, from 800 telephone services to personal home 
 computers, "e-mail", and the worldwide Internet computer 
 telecommunications system. Whatever its problems, the information 
 technology revolution is upon us. One author calls such technology the 
 most powerful tool for change in the modern era.[1]
<p>
      American businesses, particularly the smarter ones, are taking 
 notice.  As the cover text of a recent book proclaims, "Computers and 
 telecommunications are reshaping the basic structure of American 
 enterprise, and any competitive business must realize the new technology 
 either to improve its products and services or to create entirely new 
 ones.[2] The private sector is employing information technology to 
 reengineer the way it does business, using human and material resources 
 more efficiently and competing more effectively. 
<p>
 -Lagging Behind- 
      For various reasons--some regulatory, some legislative, some
 cultural--the federal government lacks appropriate access to the most 
 efficient, costeffective information technology products and services. 
 The government has lacked not only strong leadership in this area, but 
 also a coherent plan on how to most effectively tap information 
 technology 's potential. This report provides Washington with a road map 
 to the future. 
<p>
      The government must not apply information technology haphazardly or 
 sporadically. It also should not simply automate existing practices. 
 Instead, public officials should view information technology as the 
 essential infrastructure for government of the 21st Century, a 
 modernized "electronic government" to give citizens broader, more 
 timely access to information and services through efficient, customer-
 responsive processes. 
<p>
      For practically everyone, dealing with the government is 
 complicated. Americans complain that government is too slow or confusing 
 in delivering its services or that they have too many places to call or 
 go.  Government employees complain even more about trying to deal with 
 other parts of government. A big reason is the incredible volume of 
 information that government processes and files. 
<p>
      Information technology, with its ability to electronically store 
 and rapidly sort, transmit, and access information, is the key to 
 solving this problem. If MasterCard can resolve a credit card issue at 1 
 a.m. and Federal Express can find the location of a package anywhere in 
 the world, then, theoretically at least, government can do as well. But 
 while technology solutions exist, government is falling dangerously 
 behind the private sector in using technology to deliver services. 
<p>
 -Catching Up-
      President Clinton and Vice President Gore want to use information 
 technology to improve Americans' quality of life and reinvigorate the 
 economy. The administration has identified technology as the "engine of 
 economic growth." [3]  Among its top priorities is accelerating the 
 development of a National Information Infrastructure of high-speed 
 telecommunications networks, advanced computer systems, and software. 
<p>
      Today, information technology can create the government of the 
 future, the electronic government. Electronic government overcomes the 
 barriers of time and distance to perform the business of government and 
 give people public information and services when and where they want 
 them. It can swiftly transfer funds, answer questions, collect and 
 validate data, and keep information flowing smoothly within and outside 
 government. But making electronic government a reality requires two 
 things: (1) leadership to place information technology at the center of 
 the business of governing, and (2) commitment to the necessary support 
 mechanisms. 
<p>
      This report outlines a three-part agenda for spreading information 
 technology's benefits to the federal government: (1) Strengthen 
 Leadership in Information Technology, (2) Implement Electronic 
 Government, and (3) Establish Support Mechanisms for Electronic 
 Government. 
<p>
 -Strengthen Leadership in Information Technology-.
      The recently created Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) 
 can provide leadership in integrating information technology into 
 systems that support government's operation.[4] Chaired by the 
 Secretary of Commerce, this task force is responsible for articulating 
 and implementing the President's vision for advanced telecommunications 
 and computing technology. It is uniquely positioned to help develop the 
 governmental aspects of America's information infrastructure. The 
 President should expand the task force's work to include a Government 
 Information Technology Services (GITS) Working Group which, in turn, 
 would collaborate with state and local governments as well as the 
 private sector. 
<p>
      The GITS Working Group should work with the IITF to develop a 
 strategic vision and an implementation plan for using government 
 information resources across and within agencies, and develop steps to 
 improve how government provides information and services to the public. 
 The working group should also develop strategies to empower information 
 technology management in federal agencies and set priorities for sharing 
 information among agencies. In addition, GITS should be the focal point 
 for implementing the actions of this report. 
<p>
 -Implement Electronic Government- 
      Electronic government extends the idea first seen in electronic 
 banking. Just as ATMs, plastic access cards, and nationwide networks 
 have made banking more convenient, electronic government will make 
 communicating with government easier and faster. Obviously, as in 
 electronic banking, privacy and security issues must be addressed here 
 as well. 
<p>
      We propose seven initiatives to inaugurate the electronic 
 government. They provide dynamic opportunities to improve the efficiency 
 and easy use of government services. Their implementation will provide 
 substantial return on investment through increases in productivity. 
<p>
 -Integrated Electronic Benefit Transfer-
       Electronic benefit transfer will use information technology 
 present in the financial industry to deliver, nationwide, fast and 
 efficient government assistance--including Food Stamps, Social Security 
 benefits, and veterans' benefits. 
<p>
 -Integrated Electronic Access to Government Information and Services- 
      Access to government is a right of Americans. Existing technology 
 makes possible the integrated electronic access to government 
 information and services. The use of a single nationwide 800 telephone 
 number would simplify access to government agencies. Electronic
 government kiosks that use technology similar to that in ATMs can 
 provide "one-stop shopping" for both government information and 
 services. Personal computers may also be used to access electronic 
 bulletin board systems, databases, and agency directory services. 
<p>
 -National Law Enforcement/Public Safety Network-  
      A National Law Enforcement/Public Safety Wireless Network will 
 improve coordination and communication among federal, state, and local 
 law enforcement and public safety agencies, and will save money. It must 
 first focus on establishing standards for sharing information and 
 implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. 
<p>
 -Intergovernmental Tax Filing, Reporting, and Payments Processing- 
      The IRS already has on file all the tax information needed to 
 calculate the taxes due for about 60 million taxpayers because financial 
 institutions and employers are required to report this information. Yet 
 IRS and state tax agencies still require taxpayers to compute what IRS 
 already knows. If IRS computed taxes and sent a statement, and if 
 electronic filing were used for all others, IRS and state agencies could 
 forgo the mailing of 75 boxcars of forms to taxpayers--and certain 
 classes of taxpayers could ultimately not need to file. For others, they 
 will need to file only once. Enormous administrative savings would 
 accrue to government and the burden on taxpayers would be reduced. 
<p>
 -International Trade Data System- 
      To help ensure the nation's competitiveness inglobal markets, the 
 Treasury Department should create an all-inclusive database for 
 disseminating international trade data, for use by the government and 
 the trade community. 
<p>
 -National Environmental Data Index- 
      The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should create a 
 National Environmental Data Index to coordinate the development and use 
 of environmental data gathered by various government agencies. Its goal-
 -to give government, the private sector, academia, and citizens easy 
 access to environmental information. 
<p>
 -Governmentwide Electronic Mail- 
      In the private sector, e-mail and messaging systems are becoming as 
 common as the desktop computer. Governmentwide electronic mail is a 
 natural progression from paper-based government to an electronic govern-
 ment. E-mail allows rapid communication among employees across agency 
 boundaries. The administration should work with Congress to resolve 
 issues regarding what constitutes a government record created by e-mail, 
 and how to ensure appropriate security in 
 using e-mail. 
<p>
 -Establish Support Mechanisms for Electronic Government- 
      The administration isworking with the private sector to more 
 quickly develop a broad, privately operated national information 
 infrastructure (NII). The NII "will revolutionize the way we work, 
 learn, shop, and live, and will provide Americans the information they 
 need, when they need it, and where they need it--whether in the form of 
 text, images, sound, or video."[5]  This capability will "enhance the 
 productivity of work and lead to dramatic improvements in social 
 services, education, and entertainment."[6] Nevertheless, this bright 
 future can only become a reality if we adopt "forward-looking policies 
 that promote the development of new technologies and if we invest in the 
 information infrastructure for the 21st Century." 
<p>
      The public and private sectors both must help improve the nation's 
 information infrastructure. Federal officials have a special 
 responsibility since the government produces information resources, uses 
 them and makes policy for their use, acts as a catalyst for their 
 development, and delivers services through them.[7] The government 
 should extensively use the emerging national information infrastructure 
 that American industry is creating and refining. In a recent report, the 
 President of the National Academy of Public Administration writes, 
<p>
      Information is pivotal to the vitality and productivity of 
     government services and the nation's economic competitiveness.
     At issue is whether we can use information technology effectively
     to empower government, the private sector, and citizens alike. The
     complexity of today's world demands that the public and private
     sectors not only learn to master this tool, but also work 
     cooperatively to maximize the national benefits.[8] 
<p>
      The infrastructure will allow the government to consolidate and 
 modernize its data processing centers and standardize some of 
 government's basic administrative functions, such as payroll, personnel 
 record-keeping, management information systems, and financial and 
 general ledger accounting. The GITS Working Group should develop an 
 implementation plan for consolidating data processing installations and 
 reengineering common application systems. 
<p>
      The administration recognizes that initiatives to bring electronic 
 government to the public require strategic relationships between 
 government and the private sector. These relationships must include 
 necessary incentives for innovation. Agencies should be able to retain a 
 portion of savings produced through information technology for 
 reinvestment, and use multi-year funding for information technology 
 projects. The government should promote performance-based contracting 
 for information technology products, allowing the private sector to 
 increase its profits if it can find ways to make government run more 
 efficiently and cost-effectively.  It should create a governmentwide 
 venture capital fund to finance innovative information technology 
 projects within agencies. 
<p>
      Success in implementing electronic government also depends on 
 public confidence. Electronic government must protect the information it 
 processes and ensure individual privacy. It also must protect national 
 security interests, permit legitimate law enforcement activities, 
 enhance global competitiveness and productivity for American business 
 and industry, and ensure civil liberties. The government must define 
 uniform privacy protection practices and generally accepted principles 
 for information security. It also must adopt a digital signature 
 standard, and it must promulgate encryption standards for sensitive 
 information. 
<p>
      The government also must expedite and simplify how it acquires 
 information technology.The market for computer hardware and software 
 involves products for which the shelf life can be as short as a few 
 months. In this environment, the government needs aggressive, innovative 
 purchasing methods. The General Services Administration's (GSA's) 
 current schedules should be replaced with a real-time, on-line 
 electronic marketplace.  Dollar limits on agency delegations of 
 procurement authority and on credit card purchases for commercial 
 information technology items should be raised significantly. 
<p>
      Federal employees must get training and technical assistance in 
 information technology. The government should create a program to train 
 nontechnical senior executives and political appointees. Moreover, the 
 Office of Personnel Management and GSA should establish information 
 resources management (IRM) competencies for federal employees pursuing 
 appointments to IRM management positions. 
<p>
      Finally, because the new technology allows a physical restructuring 
 of the organization, making it less hierarchical, employees at all 
 levels should be able to interact electronically, sharing ideas and 
 helping one another with on-line resolution of information technology
 problems.[9] 
<p>
      The quicker the federal workforce embraces the possibilities of 
 information technology, the sooner the initiatives of electronic 
 government can become a reality benefiting the public. By reengineering 
 through information technology, the Clinton administration will provide 
 the leadership, vision, and commitment to bring government into the 
 Information Age.
